# Privacy-Review-Analysis
My final project for IGA 538, Technology, Privacy, and the Trans-National Nature of the Internet. 

## Overview of Project
Smart home assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home have become ubiquitous in households across the world. This rise is coupled with a significant adoption of IoT (internet of things)-enabled devices, from smart thermostats to smart home security cameras. However, there has been a significant shift in the reasonable expectation of privacy in the home with this large influx of sensor-enabled devices into traditionally “private” spaces.
