Very disappointed with the microphone. Hears the wake up “Alexa “ prompt maybe 3 out of 5 tries? I have tried changing the wake up word to Echo. Didn’t help. The microphone just doesn’t work as well.

This is the only such device that easily connects to Ring products.  Google's similar devices (Nest hub) don't play well with Ring.  

There are many more uses for these devices, but most are not so compelling that you really need them. But I do notice that more and more apps support the Alexa devices.",Works well with Ring products

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Feb 2020,JakeMiran,"I love my Amazon Echo Show 5 so much! I bought it during the Black Friday Deals last November and got it at a really great low price. Although, I would not really buy it at a regular price because I think it is very expensive. I would just actually buy the Echo Show 8 if I have to buy one at a regular price to get my money’s worth. As it advertises, I could ask Alexa almost everything, although she wouldn’t have the answer for some of my questions. But that is perfectly fine because hey, nobody’s perfect! I like it that I could ask Alexa how the weather and traffic are while I am getting ready to go out. Before having Alexa, I had to actually stop getting ready and research everything on my phone which taking more of my time. I also love playing music on my Echo Show 5. I’ve tried both Amazon music and Apple music and I’ve found out that it is cheaper to just subscribe to Apple music with their Student plan subscription that cost $4.99/month when you are a student. All in all, I really love my Echo Show 5 and Alexa was very helpful and full of fun and facts!",I like it a lot!!

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,mush,"The Echo Show is a great idea.  It combines all the great Alexa features with Video capabilities.  

The system is a little underwhelming when it comes to computing power and operating system.  It gets confused often and is slow to react but I find it great for the office to keep up on headlines, listen to music and even watching an occasional video.

It's very reasonably priced and I would recommend.",Terrific informational item for the office

It’s great for the Ring activity and when I want to listen to music, watch YouTube videos and even tv shows. The clock is great because I don’t have to squint to see the wall clock in the middle of the night. It dims and doesn’t illuminate the room or disturb my sleep, either.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Sep 2020,Chris94,"Ive had many Alexa devices before, but never really looked into this one before. It came free as a promotional buy, but I honestly would not mind buying it for full price, its a great little gadget. 
I keep it on my nightstand mostly as a clock, but having song lyrics pop up while playing is a nice touch.

I'm a little disappointed in the microphone array as it's nowhere near as good as that of the 3rd generation Dot or Studio.  It seems I need to be closer to the device for it to recognize my voice then with other Echo devices.",Great for use on nightstand
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,PC21,"We’ve had a bunch of Echo Dots to help control speakers and some smart home items. We don’t use this one to the full capability (video calls, etc), but the visuals to accompany things like weather check are nice. Integrates well with the existing system. 

It should be said that this item was free with the purchase of another bigger item, so I didn’t have much in the way of expectations for the device.",Alexa gets more juice

It fits perfectly on a nightstand or an end table.  I've heard some people complain, ""Oh no, the screen's too small to watch a television show on.""  That's why you have a television.

Turns out it's perfect for a nice at-a-glance type device. Between the weather, news headlines, and the streaming pictures it's a nice add-on in the living room.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2019,BiPolarBear,"I finally settled down with the Show 5.  I tried all of the other competitor equivalent sizes/product and I am choosing Amazon.
Reasons:
1. Googl sends a lot of traffic to their own servers.  I specifically opted out of updates and statistic sharing but it was sending a lot of data.  Im a professional computer security guy by trade and I did not like it at all.
2. The biggest complaint I have read about the Shows are that they send different AMZ statements like spam.  Well, everyone forget to tell you that it can be turned off.

Last note is Show 5 has a clock.  So, its a better bedroom, office, living room device versus the Show 8.  The 8 is just bigger but the clock doesnt stay on.",Winner!

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,08 Nov 2020,EDRN,Purchased this for one of the rooms and its perfect. Not too big or small and sound coming out of this little guy is pretty loud. Easy step by step instructions on how to install in case youve never set one up. A must for home automation.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Mar 2020,elimia,"When this product first came out, I couldn't understand why anyone would buy it until Christmas last year when I got this cheap as part of a bundle. I already own a Google Mini which I feel Google is way better than Alexa on search results, so I was skeptical about the Echo Show 5's practicality. It has a small color screen which the main purpose is to serve as a clock so I figured it would make a nice ""smart"" clock to replace my ""dumb"" alarm clock that resets the time to 12:00 whenever the electricity goes out, but the good thing about a ""smart"" clock is that it can tell accurate time even after electricity goes out and comes back on again. Another great function is the ability to instruct this ""smart"" clock to wake you up (i.e. set an alarm) which I mainly use Google Mini for. Another great function is the ability to ask about the weather and have the screen display some weather details. The Echo Show 5 has now replaced my Google Mini. I also bought an Amazon Smart Plug and have my lamp connected to it so I use the Echo Show 5 to help me turn on or off the lamp, hands-free. I couldn't understand why people needed something like this to turn on/off lights, but I now realize why (it's just faster and more convenient than walking up to the lamp to physically do it, and especially at times when you're in bed and don't want to get up).",Now I know why people like this

I bought it to use in my kitchen and to add to the two (2) echo dot that I currently use in my living room and bedroom respectively. In addition to using my echo show for skype calls and visual clock/temp display, I use it to control my smart devices (lights switches/dimmers, bulbs, sockets, music, thermostat, security cameras and security system). I also use my echo show for sleep sounds, which helps me to fall asleep without effort.

This size is hardly more useful than the dot. I would probably get the 8inch if I was going to buy one, but I'm not sure of its' usefulness. 
I got it in a bundle and it basically just replaces a dot. Even the 8 inch one in the kitchen is really only helpful for recipes, and even then it doesn't keep them onscreen long enough, so I end up having to do the search again.","Unless you need the screen, just get a dot"

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Sep 2020,sanch11,"At first we were skeptical about purchasing an Alexa. We changed our minds after staying at an Air BNB that had Alexa. We loved how we could play any song by simply asking. 

Having this at home makes tasks a little more fun and convenient. For example, when I need to set an alarm I just ask Alexa to do it! 

We were debating between the speaker and the show. The show is cool because you can ask Alexa for the News or a certain story and the video attached to that subject will also show up. 

We are thinking about purchasing some more of these products to have in the rooms of the house.",Nice addition to our home!
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Jan 2020,Nick,Great product! Use it in my bathroom to play music while Im in the shower.

I get the news and weather and talk to Alexa whenever I want to. 
  We even argue some times...lol.   You tie all together with the Alexa App.",Great to have and works GREAT...
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2017,ScottG007,We like the Echo very much.  We have it tied to our Ring doorbell so we can see who is at our door even from back in our bedroom.  We have it connected to our home zoning system with Wifi thermostats so we can adjust the temperature in different rooms in our home simply by talking!  We can turn on our robot vacuum cleaner with our voice.  It's kind of like being the Jetsons!,Echo show
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Sep 2020,Pete,"I initially purchased this to prevent my toddlers from running to the door every time our door bell rang.  The Echo Show 5 is synced with my Ring Video Doorbell and with a simple command we are able to tap in live to see who is at the door.  Since purchasing this product, Alexa has become my 6 year olds go to for knowledge (not sure if I should be offended) during this never ending pandemic.  Alexa is constantly being asked how to spell things or for simple facts about mammals and dinosaurs.  I am sure my son would agree that we are very happy with this purchase.  There are a ton of other features that I am sure that we have not even uncovered but for now, it does the job in our household. Oh and for the Disney lover, they make a Disney Pizza Planet Alien holder for this device.  I am sorry Best Buy but that holder is only sold through Amazon.",Must Own For Amazon Product Lovers

Great addition to my collection of Echo’s but sure wouldn’t have paid a retail price for this, or bought it at all honestly.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Nov 2018,Agua305,"I got this Echo free as a promotional offer when I bought my Ring cameras. I thought it would be a nice addition to the system given that you can link it to your cameras. Overall it performs well, but I don’t find myself using it as much as I thought. It doesn’t give me video feed from my cameras which i thought it would be possible. I mostly just play music sometimes or use it as a night stand clock. As a free item is good, but I wouldn’t pay the retail price.","Works well, but not for everyone"
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,Patti,"We are still in the process of learning all the ways our Echo can be used, but using it just for the music alone makes it well worth the cost.  I have it on my kitchen counter and search for music as well as the occasional recipe. The speaker quality is very good.  We are going to order another for our upstairs bedroom. I know there are alot more ways to use it that we haven't even explored yet!",Surprisingly great
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2017,Rose,I think it’s great especially when my toddler wants a phone or tablet and the tv is being used we can easily put YouTube to calm them down for a bit. It won’t turn in the tv I don’t know if it’s cause our tv is limited to things but our echo dot would do it. Over all o got this and a blink camera together and the price was great.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,Bobos,I enjoy having this to see when I get deliveries or to know what’s going on outside without whenever there’s motion or whenever I feel like viewing the camera. The app also lets you know what’s happening in your part of town. I had to do a lot of work to install it like grind away the stone because it wouldn’t look professional if I didn’t. I’m pretty happy with how it came out and the functionality it provides.,Great picture monitor

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Sep 2020,Chinnman,"Of all the Amazon Echo Devices, this is the second most practical of all of them (behind the Echo Dot 3rd Gen). It does and performs as advertised. Best of all, it was bundled as a free item (with purchase of a Echo Studio)I love the portability of this device over the Echo Show 8 and larger Echo Show. Hands down this Echo Show 5 is the one to get. Reason for giving this a 4 star over a 5: In my opinion the sound and video quality could be better. However, if that’s something the consumer doesn’t care about as much, then it could easily be a 5. Other than that, if it’s an Alexa-powered device you’re looking for, then the Echo Show 5 should be on your list.",Outstanding Value and Tool
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Sep 2020,Twinsfan,"This is the fourth Echo Show 5 I have purchased. With three kids in college, this makes a great alarm clock or a quick and easy way to stream some music at their desks. It's also convenient to look over and to be able to see the time quickly. They love it! We turn the camera off the camera for security purposes. I know you have alarms on your phones. Sometimes it's nice to have a little separation from them. Nice little addition to the dorm room or apartment.",Great College Accessory

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2017,Kisma,I got this product as a bonus with my doorbell and it was definitely worth it.  It works together with Ring so I can tell Alexa to show me the door and I can see who is at the door without looking on my phone as in the past.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Feb 2020,Junior,"This is my first Amazon Smart device and so far it's just simply ok. I do see a lot of posts about the annoying ""Try 'Alexa'...."" screens showing up all day and night, yeah I do notice it at times when looking over at it, (Oddly it seems to start popping up when I enter the room..so maybe it hears me??) Who knows but it doesn't bother me that much. But if there was an option to turn it off, I would. 

It has a nice bright clear display, sound is pretty good and can be customized -with an internal equalizer. Connection to bluetooth devices like FireTV, iPad, iPhone worked well...perhaps too well. Once I start playing video on my phone on the first level of my home, bluetooth audio would transfer to the Echo located in my office on the 2nd level. So, I had to disable that. :)  

There is a frustrating issue I have right now - I do have a problem when I say ""Alexa,"" there have been MANY times so far in the 3-4 weeks of owning this, it won't respond, even though I see the animated blue line moving across on the bottom of the screen (indicating Alexa is listening) - and I'm only 1 foot away from the device. I even tried changing the ""Alexa"" name to ""Computer,"" no change. I've stood directly over the device saying ""Alexa"" with no response. At night before I go to bed, I will say ""Alexa, turn off display"" (have to say this a few times) - display turns off since I need complete darkness in my room to sleep. Trying to ""wake up"" Alexa in the mornings with my voice can be a real challenge - seems like SHE is in a deep sleep. So right now I'll just tap the display...it's just faster.

Perhaps a full reboot, maybe even a complete factory restore might help? I'm not 100% sure right now.

When this Show does function, this and the FireTV stick works flawlessly as it should - (asking ""Alexa, play Jack Ryan"" for example) will turn on Fire TV, and simply start playing the episode. 

Also I picked up my first ""Smart Bulb"" with this, a special deal for a $5 Sengled - Smart Wi-Fi bulb. This seems to work very well with the Show, it even has a dimmer control.

Another big issue right now is the Echo Show and LG Smart TV's - this simply does not work. However this looks like it may be a big problem on the LG side and it's very low rated ""ThinQ"" app working with Alexa Smart Home Skills. As of Feb. 9, 2020 - the problem still exists. 

Right now, its ok, there is some frustration with this so far. Perhaps a firmware update is needed.",It's ok. Good for a first Smart Device-A few flaws
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2019,Sally,"I absolutely love this product!  I got it to replace our Echo Spot due to the size being smaller than the larger show and price being cheaper.  It is so much better than the spot.  For one, I can see it!!!  Sound quality is good, (additional) base is good quality, doesn't take up much room, picture quality is good and home screen options are fun.  Would definitely recommend this above the spot any day!!!",Great addition to our collection!

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Nov 2019,Matt,"This Echo Show 5 works very similarly to the Echo Dots that I already have and I have two Of these devices. I love that you can do things directly from the screen like create routines, alarms or change the brightness of the light or the volume right there. It does not react as sensitively as other Amazon devices. Sometimes I find myself almost yelling at it. It is great when I pair it with my ring devices and can’t see my front porch camera directly from this device. It also has abilities to voice call but I haven’t found it to be helpful as it takes several seconds to connect video. 

Overall I am happy with it. I feel with more updates it will be fantastic.",Great tool for home automation

The Echo 5 is a great addition to your Alexa home, although I wouldn't recommend if you are looking to surf the web or watch YouTube (it's just too small, the Fire 10 Tablet would be better) but it makes a great alarm clock or Alexa command station. In my opinion the Echo 8 is the best size of all the echos, not too big and not too small. And like I said, if you want something that is more than just an Alexa command station, like you want to surf the web, watch movies, and just in general do more things - invest in the Fire Tablet 10. It does everything the Echos do plus tons more - and you can stand it up with a case and put it in Display Mode if you want it to look like an echo.",Works great as an Alexa addition to the house!

Didn’t know they made these with a screen.

And it seams like there is no end to the info you can ask for.    Amazing if you ask me.
The music part is one of my favorite parts of it.
I could go on and on about how much we like her.     
Went out 3 days later and picked up the Echo Show 8...     it is well worth the difference in price,   The speaker’s on the 8 are very good.
Only thing I think kinda sucks Is it should come with the stand.    It need the stand if you ask me.    It will work with out it but it adds a lot.
I think it helps the sound.    But it’s $25.  
You will enjoy it I promise!

I own a lot of Google products and Echo doesn’t come close to the Google Home.  I was surprised that Echo is constantly placing ads on the screen and doesn’t allow for conversation like Google.   Example I can ask Google what the shopping hours for Home Depot and then follow up by simply saying “show me directions” without saying the words OK Google or the name Home Depot again.  You can talk to Google.  Echo you need to start fresh with every request for Echo.  So there is nothing really wrong with Echo, it’s simply is not as good as Google.

I ask It to keep a shopping list for me which I add to when I notice that something is not in my cabinet and the weather is usually displayed.

It’s so easy to set your alarm even if you’re already in bed. Plus I have it set for Alexa to tell me the weather, traffic, and morning news when I wake up. Also, I love that I was able to sync it with my Spotify account and just simply tell Alexa to play a song or playlist on Spotify. The one star deduction is that Alexa doesn’t always understand a phrase you’re saying and it can be really frustrating - especially when you’re just waking up or going to sleep, but I’m still getting the hang of it and the pros FAR outweigh the cons. The price was unbeatable to comparable competitors. I definitely recommend it for an alarm clock, an accent to a kitchen counter, or desk.",Love this as a glorified alarm clock!

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Jun 2020,Jas32,"This is my first “show” Echo device, although I have 4 other Echo dots in my home. It met most of my expectations based on the research I’ve read and watched, but my biggest disappointment is the sensitivity of its microphone. 

It is installed in the exact same place where previously an Echo Dot 3 was sitting, and the Show 5 cannot seem to pick up my voice from the same place the Dot 3 can. In some cases, a Dot in another room will pick up my command before this one does. I tried moving it around but the cabinet it is sitting on is rather small.  I may have to relocate it to a totally different place. 

The other thing I wished it had was a simple constant display of time, temperature and date, ALL in same size font readable from about 15-20 feet (3/4 to 1 inch size would be nice). 

I like the lyrics shown on some songs (although just from Amazon music), wished it did that too for Spotify.",A bit disappointed...

I love the fact that you can set it on an ""away"" feature so if it hears the smoke alarm or breaking glass it will contact you.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,2,13 Nov 2019,BigDaddyKool,"I -LOVE- the Echo platform. Compared to its closest rival (Google Home), Alexa seems ""friendlier"" (possibly because of the wake word) and the app is a lot simpler.

I ordered three of Echo 5's because they're the PERFECT size for a desk, night stand or something to sit beside the couch.  I also have an older Echo Show and the newest Echo Show.  I wanted all of my Echoes to have screens so no matter where I am in the house, I can (theoretically) stream a security camera to it if necessary.

The biggest problem with the platform is that the ESP is just plain awful.  ESP is the feature that has the closest Echo respond to your voice.  That's the theory, anyway.  Reality works differently.  I'll talk to the Echo in my living room and the one in the kitchen responds.  I'll talk to the Echo in the kitchen and the one twenty feet down the hall will respond.

 That's only mildly amusing if I'm just adding something to my grocery list.  It's extremely frustrating if I'm trying to turn off an alarm, set a timer or view a security camera.  It's not amusing when I'm asking the Echo two feet away to show me the porch camera and the Echo far away in another room streams it instead.

The cause of the issue isn't having too many Echoes.  I also have multiple Google Homes and they've never had this issue.  I don't have an open floor plan and there are a lot of walls  separating each Echo.  The Echo's ESP detection just isn't very good.

If it weren't for the Echo's complete lack of ability to recognize when I'm two feet away and respond accordingly, this would rate a solid five stars.  However, since the Echo twenty feet away and in another part of the house routinely responds to my commands, I have to give it two out of five stars.","Nice device, TERRIBLE ESP"

This makes a great addition to the bedroom nightstand. As an alarm clock, music player, and Ring doorbell viewer it is perfect. The screen is a bit small to use for video watching unless you are sitting right in front of it. Its viewing angle is also a bit awkward as it leans back too much. A stand can be purchased to fix this, but a built in kick stand in the back would have been nice.

Echo Show with a display did not enhance the intelligence of Alexa and the use of the display is fairly limited especially with Show 5's small screen size.

(Ouch!) but worth it. You can also Position the clock. The screen is brilliant in color. I haven’t tried the video feature yet. I also keep the camera on off position. I use it for an alarm in the morning and so far Alexa hasn’t let me down. The thing I love the most about this little device is that right before the alarm goes off the display on the clock slowly glows brightly to wake you up more calmly and easier and the alarm doesn’t just blast. It starts out low then gradually gets louder. You can watch YouTube on this little device.

Problem is when someone rings the doorbell you do get a notification on the show, however as far as I can tell there is no way to have the doorbell image show up automatically.  I understand that there are work arounds for this but I would think that amazon would have native support for this feature.  You would also think that it would be no big deal to tell the show to show the doorbell image but the microphones in this thing is so bad you need a wiffle ball bat to wake it up.  I have devices in other rooms that pick up my voice before the show does. Hoping for some upgrades but at this point I can't say I'm very impressed.",Should be better

Loaded switch ads and won't stay on the home screen for any length of time. Claims to have access to movies but doesn't have Netflix so as far as I'm concerned it has no movies. When you tell it to whisper it sarcastically gives you trivia instead of talking quietly, even lowering the volume doesn't help cause as soon as you tell it anything it brings the volume up on it's own. Waste of time getting this unless your ok with constant ads and any show you try to watch there is no way to tell Alexa to resume it from where you paused it if you have to leave it paused ever, your stuck scrolling through the whole list of shows to find the one you were in the middle of on the tubi app. Save your money for the next one, mabey by then it will work as advertised!",Not much better than an echo dot.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,BrianR5,"We have it sitting on our kitchen counter. I like how it scrolls random news stories and other info on the screen, good mix. Also, it puts in text underneath what to say to get it to report on the story. That’s very helpful. 

Integrates well will other Echo in the room. For whatever reason we like to watch shows on it...even though we have an iPad sitting close by. I think it’s because the sound is so much better. The speaker hole on the bottom and the angle reflect it up to you and is much fuller than an older iPad.",Neat little device

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2019,sl3889,"After using the newer Echo Show 5 for a month or two, purchased three more for the rest of my family scattered across the map. Easy to setup and easy to use, now my 5 year old granddaughter can start a video call with us when she wants to. My elderly father feels better connected to his children and grand kids. This device has been an all around winner.

One consideration on the Show 5: the front screen and camera have a slight backward tilt, so it matters where you place it in your home. Put on a shelf or table too high and the camera will see only the ceiling, too low and say hello to your knees. Kitchen counter height is about right if you will use it standing, table height if you will use it sitting. In our living room the end tables were a bit to high and on calls we were on camera only mid-throat and up! It actualy took us a few tries to find a placement that had both a good camera angle and comfortable standing / sitting for video calls.",Purchased Three More

I do wish it was faster when asking Alexa for websites as my Echo Dots seem to reply a lot faster.  I understand this integrates with it's own browser or WikiHow so that may be something that can improve in the future.
For controlling my devices (lights, Ring Doorbell 2, etc.), it works fine and the screen seems surprisingly good for a lower resolution.  It will not be my go-to for Prime movies but nice to know that feature.  I do like the fact there is a physical camera cover as it does make me feel a little more secure.  

All in all, a good product and priced correctly.  Sound is nothing to brag about as I think my Echo Dot sound better but good enough.",will do for the nightstand

It works better for a night stand or a small dorm room, but not as the main hub in your home. We might upgrade to the larger echo show for our purpose.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Nov 2019,Novez,"We bought two of these on sale. They are nice replacements for two echo dots. It's nice to have video to supplement whatever Alexa is telling you. This is a good quality product but best next to the bed or on a desk due to the small display. In a big room, it is hard to read what is on the screen. When it is streaming video, the quality is good. It has a camera which can be covered up via a slide switch on top. We hooked them up to external speakers and they both work well. This can be done via either an audio output jack or bluetooth. My wife noted that they are slightly slower than the dots they replaced in responding but with video, they have more to do. If you get this on sale, then you are getting a lot for the price. It's a nice upgrade from the dot.",Nice Way To Have Alexa

The fonts are bit small, which can be adjusted. Overall great features and I got it for free, as part of a bundle. The screen is bright and the images are clean. It's nice to have the screen and camera, instead of just the speaker. Especially, if you have products that are compatible with the Shows, and they use the video feature. The only thing would be the screen. It would be great for bedroom, since the screen is small and won't cast too much light, while you sleep.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Jan 2020,Nfvsa1,"The Pros: compact design, great sound, video drop ins. The Cons: microphone off line, video quality could be better, lacks back to previous screen. So I have been using this for a little over a week now it’s overall it’s pretty great. You can definitely stream sound good sousing music. It’s compact which I think makes it best for a kitchen counter where you don’t want to take up to much space. There are added features like having more functionality when it comes to skills and games because of the screen. I do like that you can play prime videos on it as well. However, when you don’t need the microphone to be on is great but there’s a big red line across the bottom of the screen. Now if your watching a movie and want to turn it off then that line is quite annoying. I think the button that turns red on the top is good enough. The built in camera does provide decent video calls but I have found the call quality to be very scratchy on both ends. Lastly I wish you could go back to a previous screen like if you pause a movie it goes back to the home screen after awhile and you have to find it all over again.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Feb 2020,KBoy,"This came in a Black Friday bundle with Ring Pro Video Doorbell and Ring Pro Chime. I wasn't real sure the need or purpose of the Alexa Echo 5. My kids got the Echo Dot's a few years ago for Xmas, but I  didn't know much about them. That said I did a little research and stepped outside my comfort zone.

Set up is very simple. I downloaded the free Amazon Alexa App and followed the instruction. I pretty much used it to monitor the front door Ring Video at first, but now a few lights, and change channels on my TV thru Dish Hopper. It's capable of a lot of other things, but I'm just getting started. I work in the tech industry, but find it hard to get too motivated with all the smart home hype.

Since I didn't have any expectations, I have enjoyed the product. I really use it to monitor the front door, but do enjoy asking Alexa to change channels, checking weather, scores, play music, and other basic commands. Video quality is fine for my needs at the moment as well as the speaker quality. Yes I would recommend this, but I don't have a lot of experience with these types of devices so someone who has more knowledge/experience with smart home technology might think otherwise.",Amazingly Surprised!

Alexa works great with this as expected.  In my application, the best part of this is the auto dimming function.  That works very well.  With a big screen for an alarm clock I was concerned it would be way too bright with the lights out.  That is not the case at all.  It does an excellent job of turning the display red (easier at night) and dimming it way down.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2019,PCGamer,"For starters, my main goal was to view our Wyze & Ring Cameras with a smartscreen on my desk. I tried the Google Home Hub first because I also use Google Photos, and that’s a cool feature for the digital photo frame. BUT, the Home Hub can’t stream our cameras and was a pain with the commands. Also, after trying basic requests like ‘How many days has it been since (insert date)’, surprisingly the Echo Show answered every question and the Home Hub consistently said it couldn’t answer that request.

We have a mix of Home Mini & Echo Dots. Although Google has a better search feature, Alexa does a much better job with simple speaking command. Also setting up our smart home (which is at least 40+ devices) is MUCH easier with Alexa VS the Google Home app.

Lastly, yes, the screen is small, but for a desk or nightstand it’s perfect. The speaker sounds great by itself, but I’ve connected the one on my desk via AUX to my Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 desktop speakers.","Great smart screen, prefer over Google"

Nothing against this 5 but as we are getting up in years our eyesight is not what it used to be. The 8 has a larger screen and some more functionality that could be useful.

Aside from the price, which is great at just 90 dollars, you get a screen which is a good size, you get access to view things like Youtube, Amazon Prime movies, and firefox browser to surf the web. Its small enough to not be a big space taker like the regular show but still big enough to let you see and read what you need to. Super easy to set up and use if you already have amazon alexa products at home. If you were considering getting into an echo with a screen but were waiting, then now is the time to get one.

- Speaker(s?) easily outdone in sound quality/volume by basically any phone/tablet/stand-alone bluetooth speaker I own, but it's enough for listening to news or a little music while cooking.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jan 2020,mandiv,"Here's the breakdown, from my perspective:
Size: The Show, about the same height as the Spot but significantly wider, providing more screen space for a larger display. The Show is about the same size as my cell phone turned horizontally.
Build/materials quality: Show is good, but does not feel as solid as the Spot. Considering price difference (about $40 as of this writing), that's fair.
Stability: Show wins this one. The Spot is cute, but because of its shape it sometimes tips when you push it with one hand into a different location on your nightstand. Show is very stable.
Screen quality: to my eyes (yes, with my glasses on), Spot is the clear winner. Sharper image.
Screen layout: Show works better. Content has a little more space so appears less crowded.
Speakers/sound: Show wins. Speakers go around the sides and back and provide a pretty good sound. (Of course loses to a ""real"" speaker, like my Bose SoundLink.)
Privacy: Show has a built-in camera cover slide. Wasn't on the Spot (I bought a privacy sticky to cover the camera.)

As for the complaints about the ""suggestions""...follow these steps....
1 - Swipe down from the top of the screen
2 - Tap Settings
3 - Scroll to Home & Clock and Tap there
4 - Tap Home Content
5 - Turn off Rotate Continuously, Discovery, Final Scores, Notifications, Photo Highlights, Stocks, Trending Topics, Upcoming Games, (the other enabled skills are useful and don't come across the screen).

Beside being much easier to turn off the alarm or snooze she really likes the auto dimming feather of the display.  Now when she rolls over she doesn't have an overly bright clock face shinning in her eyes.

However, if you have multiple people set up on it, such as your child, then both parents, commands to call someone get pretty complicated.  The issue is that not all of you have a contact saved under the exact same name, so when the child says, ""Alexa, call mom.""  It may actually then try to call the father's mom, which is actually the child's grandmother.  That part was pretty difficult for us to figure out.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Apr 2020,NewHomeNightmare,"I was looking for a device to replace an alarm clock as well as a monitor for our video doorbell that was small enough to place on my nightstand.  The Echo Show 5 has done just that
From watching a Youtube video to just having a clock.  I like how much real-estate the screen has. I have the digital clock with the date and weather all on one page. Overall I think it's an upgrade rather than using my phone, which has a much smaller screen.
If you want a new clock for your nightstand or something to play music or just to watch multiple sources of video, this may work for you.

I guess each person has there own opinion on this product. It's not as bad as some of the reviewers on here are saying. I see my pictures clearly as they rotate on my Show 5. All I did was turn up the brightness. Amazon updates their software all the time. What might not be working now, could be fixed later.",Works perfectly for my needs and a great value

Our only complaint is that we feel the listening capabilities of Alexa is far superior in the Dots vs. this Show. We find ourselves repeating “Alexa!” If we aren’t right next to the Show. Definitely worth a purchase if you’re looking for an Echo with a screen.",A nice addition to our Echo ecosystem

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Feb 2020,Swiblet,"The Amazon show is a very small screen, about the size of a large phone screen. That being said, it may behoove you to just get a large phone. It does have Alexa and the set up was just as easy as any echo device, but I feel that the screen is very underutilized because the options it gives you to use it are either very limited or very non-user-friendly. 

Speakers are surprisingly full sounding for its size and it pairs very well with the ring doorbell that I got it with.","It does what it does well, but very limited"

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jun 2020,NYCtechGuy,First off I've had an echo dot for a few years now and I'm pretty satisfied with it.  I saw a best buy deal of the day to purchase two  echo show 5's for $100 so I went for it.  The sound quality is by far better compared to an echo dot.  It does what you would expect it to do in terms of voice commands and responses.  The echo show 5 doesn't play hulu if you're looking for that feature.  The echo show 5 isn't going to be like using your smartphone in terms of functionality.  However for a home assistant I would recommend this product.,Great sound

We use it with a Ring camera to show vehicle traffic coming up the driveway and foot traffic at the front door.  It's a little slow to actually show the image, but it's tolerable.

I love the capability of changing the wake word for this unit alone so we can speak to it directly without waking other Echo Dots nearby.

I already have five other ARLO devices and they work great with my ARLO App on my cell phone. But for safety purposes I want the Echo Show for everyone else inside the house.   So the issues I had with the Echo Show are for starters the ARLO Video Doorbell resolution quality has to be adjusted to a lower level or the Echo Show viewer won't display at all, it does not respond immediately if the doorbell rings like my cell phone app, and when I installed a few other ARLO cameras the Echo Show it locked up all my ARLO devices.   I reinstalled all the ARLO cameras three times and I don't usually have technical problem but this is a waste of money.  So in closing I would not recommend this Echo Show as it's software is technically not upgraded well enough for the ARLO Video Doorbell.","""Not Made"" for the ARLO Video Doorbell"
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jan 2020,momma2boys,"I still need to get used to having this in my kitchen, I keep forgetting to use it.  
It's great to play music as I'm cleaning up or cooking. I love that I can do so many things hands free like add items to my grocery list, check the weather, play music, set times, etc. 
I have it connected to my ring doorbell and I can easily see who is at my door from my kitchen to decide if I need to open up or not (stupid solicitors!!). 
The only thing that I don't like is that it is not fully functional when searching the web or going to websites. For example,  I asked it to show me pork tenderloin instant pot recipes and it gave me about 10 recipes but not a single 1 was for the IP. There is no way to type in a search, refine a search, etc.  There is no way to send a recipe I find on my phone to my show.  
Overall this is nice to have in the house.",Nice addition to my kitchen

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Jan 2020,Ducati234,"I got this bundled with the Ring Doorbell Pro around Thanksgiving time. The show 5 is a very good speaker. The Alexa capabilities are very good and the speaker itself produces some decent sound. It’s not going to blow away a speaker system or sound bar, but it’s okay for the small size and compactness of itself. If you have one system or the other, I’d suggest staying with your system unless you want the change. Definitely a nice add on for when I got this, so I have enjoyed using mine so far!",Very Good Smart Speaker

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jan 2020,SuperCelebrity,"Best Buy had a great deal on this device, which is why I purchased it. It was only $10 when purchased with a Ring doorbell system. You can't beat that price. It does everything a Smart speaker does, but has a display. To be honest, we haven't really used the display that much, because it is smaller than the normal Echo Show. However, it is linked to the Ring doorbell system and we are now able to answer our doorbell from our bedroom. It's also nice to display the time and show pictures. We are very much enjoying our Echo Show 5. The only down side is its side...if you had to choose between this one and a larger screen, get one with a larger screen.",Nice Smart Speaker with Display

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Nov 2019,AddictedtoAlexa,"I bought the original Echo show (little round one) when they came out to replace my alarm clock. While we loved it, it was too small to see the time in the middle of the night and the sound quality was “walkie talkie-ish” for listening to music while we get ready for work. The Echo show 5 is so much better in every way, hands down. Easy to see from across the room and the sound is so much better than the round one. If I had one recommendation though it would be to buy the little stand if you will have it above eye level when you’re sleeping. The stand will let you tilt it down so you can see it better in bed.",Echo show replacement

My husband once was against having devices in the house but I'm a techy woman and enjoy my devices so I've made our house sorta smart. We had an Echo Dot in the kitchen (for ambiance music and other daily uses) but after ordering Blink and Ring, the Echo Show 5 really came in handy. It's convenient when our hands are full and one of our cameras go off, we could view the cameras with a simple command.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jan 2020,Neil,"The Show looks nice, good display.  I like the autodim feature at night.  I do wish that some more of the features were available from the touch screen rather than having to ask Alexa to do them (sometimes if my wife is asleep, I don't want to speak to Alexa to have alexa speak to me).  On that note, I do like that there is a physical switch that covers the camera, but there isn't really anyway to shut off the listening aspect, and given some of the recent reports of human transcription being done in Ireland (I don't recall if was Amazon or Apple), it is a bit disconcerting.  The nice thing is that a lot of new features should be able to be added by software updates from Amazon.","Good now, but expect to get better"

Don't get me wrong the Spot are nice, but when it comes to watching a movie or checking a Video Camera unit such as Ring, Nest or Arlo, it is such a tiny screen on the Spot.. The New Show 5.5"" is perfect because you can actually get a better image with it. Also the night mode feature is way better than on the past models of the Echo Devices.

Sound wise this is louder than the Dot and Spot and has a little more Punch to it.

Often my first Echo show 5 seems hard of hearing. with no other sound in the room, I have had to repeat the wake word 3 to 4 times. That same device often gives responses that are nonsensical. Neither of the other 2 have ever responded that way.  In addition if I make a call from any number in history, Echo show 5 tries to make the call using Skype. 
The limited wake words intimidate my 85 year old mother to the point that she asks my brother to operate the device.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Feb 2020,River,Like the rest of the new technology I purchased I was also skeptical of Alexa.

There are a few negatives though.If you’re in the main room and your giving Alexa a command or asking a question the other systems in another room may answer or play. Which is annoying. And when I first bought the product the drop in would just turn on by itself. I knew this was happening because I would hear that timing sound that turns on whenever someone is using the communication system or camera.On the upside this is a great product to use as an intercom.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,2,13 Feb 2020,PCLCT,"The display is a bit small. I’m not taking off stars for that but I would suggest looking at the bigger Echo Show before thinking of buying this size.

The very big issue for me is the voice recognition. You almost have to yell at this thing from a foot away in order for it to activate. I have an Amazon Echo and 4 Echo dots that work great and do not require yelling at them for them to work. This gets frustrating after a while. Also, the sound is not that great. My newer Echo dot has better sound than this thing. Also, if you decide to connect this to another speaker via Bluetooth, be prepared for some occasional choppy sound. Something I have never experienced with Bluetooth connectivity before.

While this is a nice device to use with the Ring doorbell, I would recommend waiting for the next round, in this size, before purchasing.","It’s ok, not the best"

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,1,13 Sep 2020,Austin,"5 Echo Dots and 4 Alexa enabled devices at home work great; but the 2 Echo Shows are the worst. Even on requesting to show something based on on-screen prompts provide useless results, example - it'll prompt on screen saying ""Ask Alex about ABC"", when asked, it'll say there isn't anything available about ABC. It didn't work with Apple music at all, even after multiple resets and customer service requests the device doesn't work well. Watching you-tube is a hassle, touch screen options doesn't work and screen doesn't fit. If it wasn't for the Ring devices, would have chosen a Google hub. These are so frustrating!",Worst Echo device
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Apr 2020,HughW,"We bought this as a part of a package with a Ring doorbell.  The setup with the Ring didn't work so we returned all of it, but the Echo Show worked ok.",Compact but functional except with the Ring

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Nov 2019,TIAKYY,As the lil guy to the echo show this model offers display perfect for the smaller space.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,2,13 Feb 2020,McBill,"Luckily came as a freebie with a Ring Doorbell on Black Friday as that is all it's worth: nothing.
Front door view at night is not clear at all and I get much better resolution on my phone.
I thought that I'd be able to Face Time with my family but it doesn't even support that!
I have to keep the mic muted as it picks up commands intended for other Echo's in my house even though it's in another room.

"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,2,13 Jan 2020,Cesar,"After getting the chance to play with this and the Google Home, the difference is clear cut. Google home is way better. I believe this one was $20 cheaper, but you get what you pay for. If you come to that option, just do yourself the flavor and spring for the extra $20 to get the Google Home",Ok but clearly inferior to Google Home
"Amazon - Echo Show 5"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,2,13 Nov 2019,Xxxx,"It's just an Alexa with a speaker, but that's why I bought it. The bad party is the speaker. It starts it sounding good, but after about twenty minutes it starts to sound wired like the speaker is blown.  I've tried with different types of music and it had never been cracked to full volume. Turn it off for a little while and it's fine again and sometimes starts that way, but more often than not the sounds changes.",Just an Alexa with a speaker.
