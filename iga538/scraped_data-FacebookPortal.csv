Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Aug 2020,Jonathan Butler,"We bought the portal mini, as it was the cheapest of the options. We wanted the portal for the wide angle lens and for the stories feature. Our primary use was to help the kids connect to their grandparents who live far away. This Device has been a social life saver during Covid 19. We live far away from our families so having an easy way for our kids to visit with their grand parents, aunts, uncles and cousins has been great for them. my 3 and 5 year old have learned how to use it and call all their favs. When you set up the portal (using a face book account) you can set the people you want to be callable on the device. This prevents your kids from calling your old college room mate or other random people that you are ""friends"" with on facebook. It really is easy for kids to use. The smart tracking camera is cool, not perfect. Callers without the portal  have no control over the focus feature of the portal camera. So they get random zooming in whenever the camera senses motion. I hope they continue the wide angle lens on the newer portals. I think this is the best feature as it really allows you to feel like you have a guest over for dinner as apposed to the narrow view of a phone camera. The wide angle lens is a necessity for kids and a stationary device. It has no battery at all so it must be plugged in. This is a pro and a con. For kids, it keeps them from dragging it all over the house and abandoning their relatives to stare at the ceiling  in a random room. But it also means if you want to take a conversation from the living room into a story time in a bed room, you have to hang up and call back after it bootes up again. The stories feature is cool, but if you have the portal and the person on the other end of the call does not, they don't see the words to the story. This is a selling point to buy one for the grand parents. But since it's not as portable as a cell phone, grand parents may prefer to use their phone. The ""stand"" that comes built in is not great. It sits at a slight up angle. Which is fine most of the time. This stand is also part oft he the power cord, so you can't take it off. You can set it flat on the edge of the device, but it could get bumped and fall forward. It is also a great digital picture frame! it automatically shows pictures from your facebook account ( the one you used to log onto the device). You can limit the pictures to different albums etc. The pictures show up as a screen saver after a few minutes of inactivity. It does work with Alexa with some nice features compared to the amazon echo we have in the house. It will add things your shopping list and show you the list at the same time. It will also tell and show the weather. I'm sure these features work the same or better on amazon screen devices.","""Portal"" between Families"

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2018,Van Bodhi,"The set up and usage has been full of issues.  Their customer service is good.  They call you within minutes.  Bu the machine rejected our home wifi when every other device was working.  We had to change the router password and reset it even though all of our phones and home computers where working.  YOU CAN NOT CALL THIS DEVICE FROM A COMPUTER.  Only from phones, tablets or other portals.  Very sad.  The device when it works is easy to use even for my 85 year old father who we bought it for.  Yet the difficulty of set up and the lack of compatibility with computers is dis heartening.",Nice but not nice
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2020,jc,"I got portal plus about 9 months ago.  It is great as a video chat device.  The main benefit I saw is that display is large and the speakers are loud and voice control is available.  This is used for the grandparents who are computer illiterate and somewhat hard of hearing.  The speakers are loud so they can really hear me .  It's volume is adjustable too for those not so deaf.  This loudness was definitely required.  When they video chat with me I can hear them fine too so the microphone is sensitive. This means whether they stand up close of talk from the kitchen (30 ft away).  The display is larger that  a tablet and we put it in landscape mode (can be portrait too) .  Our goal is it is a device that just sits there and needs no attention like a landline telephone.  It will take multiple calls at once ie video conference so the most we've had is 3 people call at once.  All 3 were displayed simultaneously.  The other thing that helps illiteracy is they can just answer by saying "" hey portal answer"".  We did not want them to touch the device or initiate call. 'superframe' is what they call the display of pictures when not in a call.  So we load it with tons of pictures and somehow it cycles and displays pictures.  Not just what I load up but what I also put in their facebook account.  I'm unclear as to when and what pictures get displayed.  Easy to answer if you have just a few photos but if you have hundreds+ then I don't know which ones get chosen over time.  So every week or so I add photos to their facebook account and hope newer ones show up. Lots of other capabilities but it accomplished our main objectives.  Some features that I hope will come in future: 1) remote administration - so I can program /adjust as needed 2) auto answer - so I can check up on them and they don't have to do anything to answer 3) superframe - better control of what and when pictures show up. Click HELPFUL if you find this of benefit .",loud and big picture

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Nov 2020,M. Phillips,"This is some really bad software.  On the good side, the Portal TV is a super handy way to video chat using your TV... once you finally get to the calling part.  Unfortunately, the set-up process and user interface almost makes it not even worth it.  Paired with the fact that Facebook locks you into their little messenger world... is not ideal. When I turned the device on for the first time, it needed a 40 minute software download.  (I have descent broadband).  Then it started to install, but I accidentally touched the back button on the remote, and it had to download the software update again, for another 40 minutes.  All-in-all, device set-up took me 2 hours.  Unacceptable. The user interface is clunky.  Keep finding little glitchy things throughout that are frustrating. Searching contacts is hard, unless they are in your 'favorites' (which of course big brother facebook picks for you).  The alexa integration doesn't add much, but it is nice to say ""Hey Portal, call John Doe"".  There are cool features like games and mic drop and facebook watch, but they dont work unless the other side also has the same device, which nobody does.  I have also found that not many people answer fb messenger calls, when you try and call.  You have to text them first and let them know.  For group calls, you cant schedule like a zoom and send a link.  You have to create a room (which is super clunky) and hope people see it (which they dont).  I read that it supports Zoom, but I dont see it in the available apps. The actual video call is pretty cool, since the camera pans and zooms auto-magically.  Its very intelligent with its movements, even with multiple people moving around.  But everybody I call is using their phone, and are in portrait mode (not landscape) and are moving around (cause... its a phone).  I had envisioned more of a video conferencing feel like in the office on a big screen.  But since it only works with messenger, which everyone has on their phone, its not a great experience. Dont recommend.  Just too clunky and the software is disappointing for such a prominent company.  The interface is like a prototype that a college coding class would make, with illegible fonts and oversimplified menus.  Sad really.  The exception would be if you plan to have frequent calls with someone else with a Portal, and you could suffer through the excruciating set-up and learning the clunky interface so you could just say ""Hey Portal, call Jane Doe"" when you want to use it.  Then it might be OK.",Disappointing.  Software is terrible.
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2019,curiousmetoo,"Have tried all things - turned the portal tv on and off, tried to change the portal tv name etc. fortunately help / FAQ section showed how to reset it - remove the power input from the back, press the side button, keep it pressed and then insert the power cable back while keeping the side button pressed. Eventually in about 10 seconds, it will start the reset process and then you can remove your hand from the side button. Wanted to create a simple anon account to use it and got stuck in facebook review process, asking for photograph, mobile number etc! Not sure if I will keep this. Too hard to setup, no drop-in feature yet. Good idea, but bad execution, bad testing.","Unable to setup - error ""Portal Name Not Saved"" and does not move past it"
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Jenakay,"I really wanted to love this, but the cons outweigh the pros. I bought this as a present for my mom to video chat with grandkids using Facebook messenger. -The device is very bulky, much thicker than I expected. -Too confusing to use ""Hey Portal"" and ""Hey Alexa"" on one device. Alexa cannot answer or make calls, only Portal can by saying ""Hey Portal."" I kept accidentally saying, ""Hey Alexa"", to make a call and it kept telling me that voice commands would not work on that device. -I tested a few calls, and depending on the other person's messenger app, sometimes it would call to the portal and sometimes it would only call to my phone. It also calls both at the same time. -You cannot use the portal voice command to call with WhatsApp, only Facebook messenger. -My device did not have a setting for using the device GPS to know when you are home, to route the calls to your phone instead when you are not at home. That was very confusing. I also did not see the option to switch the call from the portal to my phone during video chat. -The camera moving around and zooming in and out was pretty cool, but it also did think my Christmas tree was a person and it kept zooming in to keep both of us in the frame lol. Overall, it is too glitchy and not advanced enough for the price, in my opinion. Especially just for video chat since I can't see her using it for anything else.",Too expensive for basically just video calls.
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2019,Georgette,"So touch screen is great, sound is amazing. Had the whatsapp video call drop calls when using the filters during the call. Can call multiple ppl on one call. Just note that if you call via fb messenger or whatsapp you can only add people to the call via whatever app your using. ALEXA will not make calls. So if yiu say alexa call mom, it will tell you it is not supported and tell you to use your phone app. But if you say hey portal call mom, it will call mom and search via their name on fb messenger. The camera follows you but not as fast as it advertises on their commercial or video example. Video quality is legit.  Perfect for a toddler that runs around and for the grandparents to enjoy watching him play versus a phone moving around all the time. No more video calls with them looking up his nose or facing the wall. Lol. Really enjoying this product and use it mostly for music and video calls so far. There aren't that mant apps for it yet. However sure the kinks will be worked out when software upgrades are available. Got it on sale so for $129.99 is a decent price to me for what it does.  Glad it got it and love watching my son argue with alexa bc she cant understand his toddler language yet. (Priceless)",Fee things it needs improvement (software updates can fix)but love it so far!
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,SoyPreciosa,"My grandbabies moved out of state and I got 2 of these to keep the connection. We call each other all the time and its so easy to play games.  We even get Alexa in on the fun, my grandkids will tell Alexa to play a song and we all just dance all around the house and just like its suppose to the Portal follows us.  Sometimes we have to be sneaky when we're trying to play hide and seek so Portal doesn't follow us and give up or location before the other peeson is done counting. If you need to stay connected this is an amazing option.",Helps keep your connection strong with the grandchildren.
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Nov 2018,Nyc37,Sorry but some of the reviews here are super BS (like they can't see me etc - probably they never used a tech product before). I am a tech freak buy any new gadget out there and I believe I can be quite honest when it comes to a products usability and tech. This is solid! Very impressive honestly. From the way it's build to the video and sound quality..I bought the large version for myself and the smaller for my family that is 4000 miles away. And I will tell you this..I've never connected in a more fun way with my niece before. It's amazing! We were been dancing together. Not having to hold a phone makes a big difference. Having the camera follows us make a big difference. Sound quality is superior comparing to chatting through the phone/messenger. Video quality is impressive and actually while my mom is on the same WiFi we get tons of interruptions when on phone but when we talk over portal there isn't a site break. That makes a huge difference. You get the full potential if both yourself and your family/loved on has one.  They also have some apps and they say they will add more. Alexa integration is solid even though I wish we could also watch the video news and not just hear the audio version.  I find this to be among the best first generation products I ever tried,Not sure why the BS reviews. This is amazing!!
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,Ko / JimB,"It handles it's primary function of video calls OK enough. The way the camera tracts people within it's field's range is pretty cool. And it's nice that now I have a large screen to see our grandchildren, but at times it seems a bit grainy compared to the first generation smaller portal I used to have. Also, I miss the touch screen capabilities of the original portal for doing things like selecting a subject to stay focused on. The available applications seems to be very limited as well. I could swear the 1st gen had a lot more apps to choose from. I do watch Amazon Prime through it, which so far works flawlessly, but it would be nice to have a browser, maybe utube.. or come on, this is a facebook product so how about facebook on it? I do have to admit that story time is a lot of fun with the youngest in our family. :) Alexa is OK on this.. handles my home automation OK enough, and MUCH clearer audio than my 3rd gen Echo Dot, but is a bit cumbersome in some aspects. If I want to see my Ring Doorbell video I can't just say to show me the front door. First I have to say ""hey portal, show me the home page."" This changes the HDMI port to the correct one for portal, as well as turn on the TV if its off. Once I have the portal screen showing then I can say ""Alexa, show me the front door."" and by that time I've already walked to the front door to see who's there. If I just tell Alexa to show me the front door it'll say OK, but nothing happens until I activate portal first. Frustrating. The HDMI-CEC control is also interesting. Yes, it will turn on my TV while switching to the portal port.. however; I can't use it to switch back to my cable-box's HDMI, control volume or turn the TV off. Perhaps there are commands to do this, but I haven't found them yet.","Nice, but could be better."

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Nov 2018,HH,"I have purchased both this and the smaller device (portal+ and portal). This is an outstanding device.  It is crystal clear and has a beautiful wide screen review.  I have placed a smaller device in my office, with the larger device at home.  It is super easy to use and my 5-year-old now can call me from home while I am at work.  Do note that I am using this only for portal to portal calls.  I do not use this to call through any other device.  In that regard, it is flawless. The only reason I gave it one * off is that the portal + is fairly big and conspicuous.  Unlike the smaller device (which I also have), this is awkward to place and takes up a lot of space due to its unusual size.  The smaller portal device is perfect and I would strongly recommend that be your first purchase. I have used this with one device in my office, one device at home and one device at my parents.  This truly enables us to all communicate flawlessly and is fantastic in that regard. Please ignore people who are rating this device solely on the company's actions.  The goal should really be to rate the device and how functions and performs.  Having said that, I do notice unusual activity with reviews.  Interestingly enough even though I really like the smaller portal and would rated five stars, I have been unable to do so.  See image enclosed.  Bizarre.  I have been an Amazon customer for over a decade have never seen this before. ‚Äã",Highly recommended for Portal to Portal calls
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2020,J.W.,"First off, it deserves more stars if ALL you need is to call (whatsApp) another person. Kids or parents. If you are looking for a device for your home office - stay away. Pros: - looks great. Good quality screen (rotates) and a camera - connects to Bluetooth devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, etc.) - easy to use Cons: - no 3rd party voice or video calls supported. No jabber, no Alexa calls, no skype, no sip, no google. Nothing. - device recognized by a phone as a bluetooth speaker. You can't use it as a speakerphone with you cell. - you can't call a regular phone number (even with a fee). - it doesn't support Webex meetings. Helpdesk says that they're working on it, but no ETA. Webex (via website) does not recognize microphone / speaker, or camera. No MS Teams support, no google meet. -  do you want to use it as a photo frame? Only with your facebook photos. - very few applications. 10? Useful? 2-3 max. - no email client, no calendar. Yes, you can open outlook 365 or gmail in a web browser but this is not the case. - Alexa on this device is handicapped. Most of commonly used functions not supported. - Although it is an android device, you cannot install apps from the play store. Actually you can - but you can't access them after the installation. This is the first time I decided to return an electronic device. I am done with it 3 hours after unboxing. Ugh.","Portal Plus - Great Idea, Horrible Execution"
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Sep 2020,El-Maz,"So i use Facebook messenger and whats up app a lot(daily) so this is an amazing devise for me. It is so cool, it moves when you move (moderate speed, so don't run) and it zooms in and out (for example if you were in a room talking and someone else comes in it zooms out to catch that person and vise versa when that person leaves it zooms back in on you). Also if there is a sound in the background it concentrates on your voice so the person on the other line does not get distracted. Also on messenger you can tell stories (kids stories). Now for Alexa app, its good but not perfect let me explain more so it does pull up recipes and turns on and off the lights but it doesn't save the recipe like the other Alexa apps and it doesn't show you the feed to your cameras but other than that its great and very useful to not have you holding your phone all the time and can multi task while you're chatting... i love it. My advice to you if you dont use the messenger and whats up apps regularly it wouldn't be useful to you. Hope this review helps your decision.",Amazing and useful
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Aug 2020,Alison,"We have had this less than a year and it is AWFUL. I had initially just wanted a digital picture frame, but my husband convinced me to get the portal since we could use it as a frame and for calling, games, etc. We have 5 Alexas and have never had any trouble with them so I figured this would be similar. At first it was ok, we could make calls and it also worked as a picture frame. Soon after we got it though I would walk by and see that instead of the picture I chose it was a suggestion to fb call my mother-in-law. Over and over I had to exit out and put my picture back up. After that my picture would randomly be missing and it would be one of the fb stock photos of nature. My picture was still listed as the active picture so I‚Äôd have to delete everything and reupload. Again, the main reason I bought this was to act as a digital frame. A few weeks ago the portal started going black. I‚Äôd have to restart it, sometimes twice a day. Finally today it shut off and it seems to no longer work.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Mar 2020,Dustin Moore,"I bought this for my grandfather just as coronavirus started to become a real concern. I wanted him to be able to video chat with the family when we weren't able to visit him. Unfortunately, his retirement community went on lockdown before I could deliver it. So until I can get it to him, we are using it in our home. I have a 5year old and a 16 month old. Video chatting with them via phone is hard for the people on the other end of the screen. They are ALL OVER THE PLACE and hard to follow. The portal has a nice wide field of vision that keeps them in frame most of the time However the BEST feature is the automatic face detection and camera tracking. It follows the girls all over our living room, keeping them in frame so their grandparents can always see them. It isn't 100% perfect, but it is a huge improvement over not having ng this feature and just trying to follow them with the phone.  Surprised - I thought this was a pointless product, but now that I have one, it is the only way I want to video call Fwiw, the Alexa and FB assistant I tegratio s are nice, and the speakers are quite good quality (and powerful). We listen to Pandora, Amazon music, and lots more on here daily. I will probably buy one of these to replace it once I give this one to my grandfather.

This device is wonderful for keeping in touch and for my children to interact with family.  The video quality is amazing and the camera works great to track and follow users.  Very pleased with that aspect.  The many features  of the  Portal really drew us in but after having device since Christmas we've noticed a few issues.  Many of the applications do not work as advertised or are so slow to load.  Our internet connection has been checked and verified to be way faster then recommended speeds.  The super frame pictures do not work most of the time and typically shows the same pictures all the time or shows only stock photos.  Once again went through support and verified all settings were correct still have issues.  At times it shows pictures from albums of users that were not added.  The Portal freezes or stops working while using various features.  On more then one occasion we've got a black screen that required voice commands to resolve due to touch screen not responding.  We have also had to unplug device to get it to reset after freezing for 30 plus minutes.  I think this device has several bugs that require some fixes.  Reading other reviews and blogs it appears Facebook knows of many of the issues and released devices anyways to ensure sales during holidays.,Software issues

As we've made the purchases we push through and use, and enjoy them... but I'd be hesitant to really recommend someone buy one... Next Generation maybe? Positives: Bought these for myself, mom, and sister, and father in law... We use it almost every weekend and love how it connects the family. We have young kids and the grandparents get to see them run around, and now the kids recognize their voice etc. After you're done its ALMOST like you sat next to them on the couch and had a good chat... Now very good during COVID isolation as well... The AR is fun for kids and adults and the story time thing is cool. Negatives: They had such a strong chance for a GREAT product, but the negatives are almost to the point where I'd be iffy about actually recommending this to someone. Making and Connecting on calls - Linking up multiple people is for some unknown reason, always a pain... You can sign in through Facebook Messenger AND/OR WhatsApp... BUT if you want too add people to calls they need to be signed into the same thing (Messenger or Whatsapp), and you can only ADD someone to call, you can't combine a received call... I bought the ones that hookup to your TV, so I'll admit this is partially due to that, but you effectively need to call ahead, make sure everyone has their TV's to the right input, and is signed into the right service.  As my sister said this morning, you come near to starting a family fight while trying to get the call going asking why someone isnt signed into the right service (see below). Also while combining calls (specifically for having 3 people on a call, it just shows the middle of the field of view of the camera and cuts off the sides... My mom inevitably can only see me in the center of the picture and misses my kids running around, and I in turn see my mom well centered, but only see my sisters cat which is situated between her and her husband... Set-up - It should be easy, but its not... Initial set up is KIND OF intuitive, but its not as simple as many other things... Its not impossible, and even after initial set up things don't always seem to stick... I (the tech knowledgeable 30 something) inevitably spend sometime face-timing or phoning the person on the other end to help them re-sign into something (even I've experienced being randomly signed out of profiles). Image Quality, Zoom, and following - We're all used to HD or 4K... and this is definitely not that quality... In a wide field of view the 12 mp camera does fine BUT when it ""Zooms"" in on you its only digital zoom so picture quality degrades quickly... The camera follows you nicely for big motions but sometimes seems to kind of have some ADD and randomly goes ""Squirrel!"" and zooms to another part of the room or just decides it doesn't like someone and won't include them in the picture... You can choose someone for the camera to focus on, but honestly having the OPTION just being able to manually control where the camera is looking would be super nice.. AR only tracks (3) faces which is kinda lack luster... even in a family of 4 someone is left out...","I WANT to love this thing, but they make it sooo hard..."
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jul 2019,Whats a pen name?,Waste of time to setup.  it never rings when people are calling which defeats the purpose of it's existence.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2020,Benjamin Slade,"(This review is for ""Portal TV"" since there are reviews for multiple types of Portals mixed together here) The main reason I got Portal TV was that it connects to grandma's huge flat screen TV.  We're talking heads which are 3-4 feet tall on her screen when we video chat with her.  And it's in her living room where she normally sits.  This permits her to see her family.  Priceless. But it's really hard to set this device up for her so she can easily use it. Grandma has terrible vision and is really really bad with gadgets, especially remote controls.  Asking grandma switch video inputs on her TV remote as opposed to her normally used satellite TV remote is beyond ridiculous.  The Portal TV remote is so small I don't think she can even see it.  Besides, the buttons on it a camouflaged by being the same color as the case.  Even I couldn't see the buttons.  Also, another small remote is guaranteed to be lost within a day or two.  So using the Portal TV remote is not an option. Her TV wasn't new enough to auto-switch to the Portal TV HDMI feed when answering a call (ie. when Portal answers a Facebook video call).  And even if it was, the TV wouldn't auto-switch back which would effectively disable her TV watching.  That's her main entertainment in life right now.  Cutting it off is beyond unacceptable. So instead I bought an HDMI auto-switch (HDMI Switch SGEYR 5x1 HDMI Switcher 5 in 1).  But the Portal TV device doesn't turn off it's HDMI output after it hangs up on a Facebook video call, so the HDMI switcher won't auto-switch back to her TV channels.  I ended up setting up a powerstrip on the table near where she sits.  The Portal TV device gets it's power from the powerstrip.  Before we want to do a Facebook Portal video call with her, we call her on the phone and tell her to turn on the powerstrip (it's big enough that she can see it).  We wait two minutes for the Portal TV device to powerup, then we call her on Facebook video (note, you have to use ""Messages"" in Facebook.com.  The Facebook Messenger app on Windows doesn't seem to have a video call option.  Yeah, that's not confusing).  She answers by saying ""Hey Portal, answer"" and then once connected, ""Hey Portal, camera on"". So I got it to work, but is was a huge hassle to setup.  The Portal TV device really needs an HDMI switch that can switch to Portal TV video to answer a Facebook video call, then auto-switch back to the TV when done. Call Quality: My mom has old DSL internet service that is pretty slow.  Her Portal TV device is connected via good strength WiFi (there is no ethernet port).  Portal TV does a very good job of handling the low bandwidth connection.  She sometimes looks a little grainy/pixelated, but the video and audio never drop out.  She says that her image of us looks very good. The microphones on the Portal TV device seem to do a good job of locking in on her voice. The Portal auto-zoom on person talking seems to work fairly well, but it occasionally decides to zoom in on Grandma's walker, rather than grandma.  But it's smart enough to keep grandma in the frame, so it's mostly humorous rather than a real problem. In summary, really cool device that does a good job handling low bandwidth connections and looks fantastic on the big screen.",Portal TV let's us talk to grandma!  But lack of HDMI auto-switching is a major drawback

Do you know Facebook has virtually no way to contact them for help! I can't even add my husband to the portal to use his contacts because I have to be logged into Facebook before I can add a user.

I love being able to face-time with my sister who also purchased an echo show. I hate it that I can't face-time with my son and daughter who both have Facebook portal.  My son called my iPhone from a Facebook portal TV system and the difference was incredible.  I need the echo show to talk with my sister, but I will definitively be getting a Facebook portal TV system. It is ridiculous that Facebook portal and Echo show don't have an app to let the two systems work with each other. It's would be like having a phone with one carrier and not being able to talk to somebody that uses a different carrier.  If you and your loved ones don't have echo show or a face-book portal TV system, I would choose the face-book portal TV system. If you have loved ones who have the echo show, you will want to go with that because they don't work with each other.",Can't facetime with facebook portal
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Sep 2020,Anniebananie,"My computer software developer son urged me to buy the Portal for my mom who's in an assisted living facility. It's been a lifesaver! I was concerned she wouldn't get the hang of it (she's 103!) but after some practice, she knows how to answer calls, and lights up when she sees our faces on the screen! Mom also loves to watch the slideshow of photos (from my sister's and my Facebook and Instagram pages) that scroll across the screen when she's not talking to us. I'm not nearly as anxious about the thought of another Covid spike in our state, and her assisted living having to shut down visitors again, because I know I'll still be able to ""see"" her and her apartment, and observe first-hand that all is well for her.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2020,Gadsby,"There is nothing much to say about Facebook Portal series since there is nothing to do, you set your facebook and whatsapp to use it and you can make whatsapp and facebook messenger audio or video call with some nice face effects beside these there is nothing special, no full alexa support, no phone application integration(there is a app but doesn't do anything), facebook portal voice has basic features likes setting alarm, telling weather, audio or video call and some basic calendar stuff. Since it has not cool features but they tried to cover with Browser option which is not working with neither Netflix nor PrimeVideo. So you can go YouTube or search on Google. It has Facebook Watch which is contains Facebook Videos(from pages you liked) and Facebook Originalsi I'll be honest and I haven't seen any Facebook Originals due lack of advertising, even facebook didn't let me know, you can watch videos from Facebook. Alexa is not Alexa, it's like half-Alexa, you can't set reminder or alarm from your Alexa app on your phone but you can set those things with Voice control both for Alexa and Portal. So whats point to have one of these things, if you like to use Whatsapp or Messenger call, you might want to have lite-Spotify(it plays, puase, skip songs with touchscreen and voice), you might want use as Photo frame since Portal 8"" and Portal 10"" has unique look. I guess Facebook's doesn't have much people working on this project and development is pretty slow, I believe their next devices which might cover lot of stuff unless they don't abandon this project. There are not much Apps beside few, I guess it because of Facebook Portal app development SDK is not open for public(it's registration based) but you can still use some of Alexa Skills. It's also missing major Facebook product like Instagram. NOTE: I didn't give bad score based on my faulty device(I have backlight issue on left top cornerr) I gave my honest review.","It's a entry level ""tablet"" with less feature but labeled as Smart Display"

With Portal, he is able to enjoy time with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren when he is not able to be with them physically.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Apr 2020,Darren,Pros: simple to set up and audio/video quality is amazing. Camera motion is really smooth and reliable and overall a great device that is optimized for video chat. Nails the call grandparents scenario for my kids. Cons: has to be plugged in. There's no battery. This is annoying. It's 2020 put a battery in it. You'd think this is obvious but it makes the device super lame that it has to be plugged in. UX can be clunky at times. We all naturally have a lot of Facebook friends but I don't want my son to accidentally dial a friend I haven't talked to in 10 years. The angle of the stand is a little off. When on a table it seems to point the camera towards ceiling more than we would prefer. So you end up being in the bottom half of the frame not the whole thing.,Almost perfect but a few misses. Still great device to call grandma

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jun 2020,irsh,"Review after two months of use: It's an excellent device and we've been using it a lot to video chat with family and friends. The best thing is the sounds. I can hear the other side loud and clear through my TV's speaker and they can hear me as well even when I'm far from the device. My TV has hdmi-cec capability and it was able to switch to the correct hdmi input using the tv remote's home button so that's good. I do wish I could manually zoom the camera. Maybe that'll come in a future update. One of my favorite features is the ability to leave a 30 second voice message to any of my contacts without dialing. I wish they would extend that to a minute or two though. We use this to send a short personal greeting to families and friends during holidays and we can even use effects while we're at it. Lastly, if you're choosing among the Portal lineups, know that Portal TV so far has always been last to get new Portal features. I'm a member of the Facebook group and we like comparing notes there. While other Portals has the ability to change their backgrounds into those cool Zoom-like virtual backgrounds, this feature is not available yet to Portal TV as of July 1, 2020. I would still choose Portal TV though coz I like seeing my contacts in the big screen. I hope Facebook keeps improving this as it is definitely a winner.",No manual zoom and no virtual backgrounds yet; otherwise excellent
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jul 2019,Logical Reviewer,"I bought 1 portal plus and 1 portal for the sole purpose of using the video calling function for my elderly Father. Unlike Amazon Echo Show, it has simple to use touchscreen buttons which my Father can learn to use. However, the portal devices require a Facebook account in order to use the video calling function. So I signed up a Facebook account for my Father for this purpose, putting in his real name and photo. After setting everything up, including adding friends and family to his list of contacts to call, Facebook locked his account, citing suspicious activity. Facebook requested another photo to unlock his account but after submitting this photo his account remains locked. So sitting in his living room is this expensive brick. If any other company sells you a device which requires a membership to use and yet does not allow you to get that membership, it would be considered a scam.",Facebook don‚Äôt let you use the portal devices after purchase

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2019,JL,"The Portal TV product idea is great - truly ground braking for families. The problem is execution. We bought the Portal TV in order to be closer to the grand parents. Using cell phone based video calling is kind of awkward. You are holding the cell phone in your hand constantly thinking about where the camera is facing. Your'e running around a toddler trying to make sure that she is focused on the picture. The picture on the cell phone is so small that the toddler isnt interested in it for a long time. Portal TV seemed to solve all of these issues. The idea of just lounging on your sofa and seeing the other end in a huge 65 inch picture seemed great. The toddler will see grandma super well. The camera tracking would follow the child in case she is running around. What could be better? The Portal TV does deliver. On the video side. Its a major game changer. I would not go back to cell phone based video calling, unless I absolutely have to. The problem, rather surprisingly, is audio. Portal TV doesnt deliver a full duplex experience where both parties here each others all the time. For whatever reason, Portal TV missed syllables and even whole words. Its difficult to understand what the other end is saying. Disappointing, given that the video part is so good. Not much point doing video calling, if you cant understand what the other end is saying.",Poor audio quality

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,Kimberly Wilcox,"We got these for Christmas. You have to have a Messenger / Facebook  account to use it. You can easily video call another messenger account  or use WhatsApp. Picture is very clear and you can have multiple people on at one time. Great for seeing the kids and grandkids when they live in another state. You also have a browser on it so you can surf the internet with it and add bookmarks / apps as needed. It has story time on it and the grandkids loved it. As it tells the story they are actually in the story, this is done by using the camera. They had a blast with it. I had a blast watching them laugh and point at themselves in the story book. Great memories. As for privacy when you are finished with the video chatting, just slide the camera and microphone  switch to off. A plastic cover will hide the camera.  You can still use all the other functions. We play music with it which comes in clearer than the radio. I especially like the camera, it follows you around the room and will either zoom in so the others can see you or if you sit real close to it the camera will adjust itself to pull away from you. No more moving whatever device you  use back and forth so people can see you. We had three people on one call and we could see them with no problems. It does show your surroundings so make sure no one sneaks up behind you in their skivvies. The camera will pick up other people behind you. I really did not see anything about it that I did not like. We will get good use out of this.  I am glad we got this. It is an easy way to see the family and keep up with what is going on. When you visit the family there is no more comments like ""look how much you have grown"" or ""changed"" etc. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to see the kids across the country or just for everyday use. I hadn't seen my brother in over a year and now we talk with this and it like we are in the room with each other. (jw)",Fun to use.
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Mar 2020,Ms.C,"I was so excited about this I bought the prerelease. I was hoping the issue I had with the initial product would be corrected in the coming months but it seems nothing has changed. Pro: Good picture quality Easy setup Cons:. The pan/zoom feature is obnoxious. The AI randomly pans and zooms on occasion when I am not even moving. Either improve the technology or at the very least, give an option to disable it. Connectivity to Facebook messenger is sloppy. Yes, you can search for your contacts and do group video chats but you can't look up or favorite your current Facebook messenger groups to do a video chat. You have to add people to the video call one by one and sometimes finding them via the search function is a challenge. You also cannot save that new group with a unique name for future calls. This seems to be a basic function for a product partnered with Facebook and really needs to be fixed. Pls fix the software and roll out an update. This could be an amazing product with some simple fixes. EDIT: reduced my rating to one star. I would return this if I could. No updates! Still randomly pans and zooms. Difficult to connect to your Facebook groups and the connection drops frequently. I'm back to using my laptop and web cam. I'm so disappointed. Don't waist your money like I did.",Potential missed

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2020,tre,"So far, here are the pros and cons.... Cons.... 1.  Many of my messenger contacts were missing.  After troubleshooting, I discovered that Portal TV has a 50-contact maximum (at least for Messenger, not sure about WhatsApp as I have less than 50 contacts for WhatsApp, but more than 50 on Messenger).  So I was looking for certain people on Messenger and they were not listed, but you are able to manually search for them with the Search tool and then add them to your ""Favorites""  You can also ""Hide"" Contacts from your main Messenger or WhatsApp list, for people that you never video chat with.  It Facebook/Portal did not inform the public or myself, the consumer, about the 50-contact limit,  and this led to confusion of why many contacts were not showing up.  Hopefully they will read this and increase the limit, or at least inform the users of the limit. 2.  When using Messenger to call someone on iPhone, there was problem where it only viewed in Portrait mode and would not rotate to Landscape no matter what the iPhone user did.  Then calling that same person through WhatsApp, Landscape worked perfectly.  So seems like there is a Messenger orientation issue when other party is using iPhone. Pros... 1.  Has been working as expected and really makes a huge difference, it is much more relaxed to be able to use your TV to video chat, you can just hang out and it is just so much better than using a little phone, especially when there are more people involved, so you don't have to huddle around little phones all the time. -I would have given 5 stars, but deducted one because of the 50-contact maximum limit that was never communicated by Facebook/Portal TV. *****UPDATE APRIL 20, 2020 -I originally gave it 4 stars, and am reducing to 2 stars.  Every 3-4 weeks, it kicks you out of your account and you have to go to website on computer and enter code to re-authorize it.  For my 75-year old mother, this confuses her and she calls me and it is very frustrating.  Also, after spending 25 minutes creating a FAVORITES list of her WhatsApp contacts, Portal TV REMOVED them when it decided to kick her off her account for re-authorization, then the Favorites are gone and have to be re-created.",Portal TV...Has a 50-Contact Maximum Limit & U HAVE TO KEEP RE-SIGNING IN EVERY 3-4 WEEKS!

I wish there was a warranty or something that Facebook provided. Another thing that isn't an issue but more of a suggestion, is that the device had a little more functionality to it as far as more apps, like an Amazon app store or something along those lines. It's a very, very large device which threw us off at the beginning with how large it is. And unless you're making a call with someone, it just kinda sits there. There's not much else to do with it.

It is a fabulous device. I set it up from home and then got within range of the hospital WiFi before sending it up to her room. Once set up, it is very easy to use, either with verbal commands or with the touch screen. The CONS to this device - 1) it has to be plugged in at all times, and the cord is fairly short. (We sent it to the hospital with an extension cord.) Caretakers kept moving it to not trip on the cord, so it kept getting put out of her range to reach the touch screen. 2) The WhatsApp feature is very glitchy.

You can set people as favorites so you don‚Äôt have to scroll to your friends list when you want to call. Unfortunately, usage is really hampered by the need to switch input away from what you are watching to make or receive a call, a clunky process on most TV‚Äôs. Alternatively, you could use the device as your primary player but that is not a good option for all but a few people. Really sub par as a media player- has Facebook watch (bad, not a lot of variety) Amazon Prime (good) and Spotify (ok, I guess). There are other video apps but they are not even worth mentioning. To be worth using as a media player it needs to catch up others- Hulu, Netflix, and Disney + at a minimum.

You can watch Hulu, Disney +, and HBO max on the device along with YouTube videos.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2019,Daryan,"Being a technophile I think this is better quality than anything Amazon has put out. I purchased 2 portal plus's and while I wish I could call people also on Echo or Skype, the hardware is far better than Echo show (which I also own). I'm not a huge fan of Facebook but the tech is sound and of great quality ( once again comparing to echo show)  this is so far a better product than anything currently available and I hope that Google and Amazon take notice. The ability to transfer my call immediately to my phone is on awesome when I leave the room.  It's quick and instantaneous and I don't have to think about it. If you dislike Facebook, I can empathize but great tech is great tech and this piece of hardware is fantastic albeit in this day and age I also dont like being locked in to a single communication system but I don't necessarily think that's Facebook fault.

And it is better in some cases, but I had bought the AI camera specifically to avoid my problem of running behind the kid holding iPhone during FaceTime calls. But this doesn't solve the problem at all. It didn't recognize the face of my kid at all, so it wouldn't pan according to kid's movement. Also few nitpicks- Panning is slow (or too smooth), Edges are very sharp. Stand is fixed at one angle so no way to adjust if you want to show something on the floor while portal is placed on the tv unit.","Impressive, but not there yet."

To be really useful, Facebook Portal TV should replace my Android box. This mean 4K and HDR capabilities, Apps like HBO, Netflix, Hulu, etc. It also need to have option for wired ethernet connectivity. Either that, or make it an App that I can install on Nvidia Shield (or other devices) and a cam/mic to connect through USB 3.0. 2. The remote should include don't disturb, mute mic button in addition to the hardware button on the device itself. 3. Should be able restrict access to contacts and calls based on authenticating users with the camera. This should also work for multi account for different people in the household. 4.

It is more interactive than our Alexa and allows my five year to have quality time with her dad even when he's traveling. It has features that bring bedtime stories to life, the camera follows her around the room while she plays, dances around, and shows him her latest gymnastics stunt. For me I notice that she stays ""on the phone"" longer. The screen resolution is great and pictures appear vivid and bright. The touch screen is very responsive. Overall, as a family, we love it and would highly recommend!",Love the interactive camera!
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2018,D. Houston,"This review is for the Portal Plus from Facebook. Smart, Hands-Free Video Calling with Alexa Built-in.  This is basically a tablet screen hooked permanently to a stand containing a speaker, microphone and camera.  The picture, video and audio quality is excellent. Set-up was easy.  The price however is too high (should never retail for more than $249). My main complaint is the lack of apps.  Mine came with Facebook Watch, YouTube, Newsy, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio, Food Network.  No Netflix, Hulu Plus, Skype, Nord VPN, Vudu, Amazon Music or Amazon Ptime Movies to mention a few.  Skype is important because with Skype you cannot only video conference with other Skype members, but you can make non-video calls to any phone using your Skype credit.  Makes no difference whether the person has a Facebook or Messenger account at all.  Nord VPN is critical to protect your records and calls from Facebook and future data breaches at Facebook. The product description says ""Facebook doesn't listen to, view or keep the contents of your Portal video calls. Calls on Portal are encrypted, so conversations stay between you and those you're calling.""  Given Facebook's scandals and data breaches however these statements should not be trusted or believed.  And note the key word ""contents.""  You should assume Facebook will keep records of who you video conference with and when, and that while calls are claimed to be encrypted, they are likely not encrypted against Facebook.  An app for Nord VPN would cure that, as Nord VPN has military grade encryption and is not located in the USA, making it not subject to court orders from the USA, etc. I give 3 of 5 stars.  Picture, video and audio quality is excellent.  Set-up is easy. Lack of enough apps, especially Skype and Nord VPN, is a strong negative.  Comparing the Portal Plus from Facebook, the Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show (2nd Generation), the Amazon Echo Show appears to be the better product with better value for now.",Not worth the money and inferior to the Amazon Echo Show - 2nd
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2019,Pat Walsh,"First impressions after seeing the ads, I pretty much just thought ""possibly overpriced, stand alone video chat device"" and okay - it follows you around or something. I'm super technical.. I know how to use multiple video chat apps.. why do I need this? They really need to market it better, because it's great! and they dont show it very well in ads. True - it is a teenager, or social media freaks dream come true... but anyone can find this useful, it is fun! PROS: > you look kind of good. It isnt a snap chat filter by any means.. but you look decent! > PRIVACY! I work in tech and am super paranoid about privacy. Facebook made it a point to build in a lot of privacy which is super awesome... I would never have kept this in a bedroom or anywhere private, but they built in hardware for privacy. There's a tab that switches the MIC and Cam off and a red light indicator that both are blocked. You can block one or the other, allowing you to Talk on the mic, without using the cam as well. You can visibly see the switch over the cam.  I really appreciate Facebook's awareness of the privacy issue and that they built in the privacy as a major part of the portal. > Motion sensing functionality  really is cool. It kind of goes a long with the cam making you look better in a way. It's a very nice chat experience. I did not use it walking around or dancing or anything - I just have it on my computer desk, in portrait mode and I video chat with it,  but you can tell a huge difference in quality even when your just sitting in front of it. Whenever you move back or forth - it re calibrates the image and makes it look very nice. > It's a digital picture frame! So... i just spent the same amount of money on a device that was only a digital picture frame at the beginning of the year... The portal will display all of your pics from Facebook, Instagram, and your phone...  I was surprised and that is awesome. > Outside of video chats - you can use it with Games and playing music with your friends. Okay - the music thing is definitely a teenager thing.. but I'm in my 30's and totally love playing games with my friends. it's fun. During setup, it asks for your Pandora or spotify - so it shares music  from that. > Super easy setup - anyone can do it. It has a wizard that walks you through the menus and there are no glitches. I didnt count how many screens setup is - but it asks for your wifi, your Facebook login, and the rest is asking if you want to share photos and music and helping you set that up. Very easy. > You can make calls to people on their phones - they don't need to have a portal. > It's well made. It looks like a photo frame. Nice design. It's big enough and the materials it is made out of are nice and look like they will hold up with time. OVERALL - I have gone from thinking it was an unnecessary device, to wanting to buy another one for my dad who lives across the country so we can talk on it. It's a stand alone device that even he will be able to setup. He doesnt get online or use facebook a lot, so he would be able to answer this like a telephone. I also love that it shares photos and is a digital picture frame. I have bought into the Portal - it's really nice and it is useful. If your life revolved around social media - this would be AMAZING.. but even if it doesn't - it's definitely a notch up from anything else available for making video calls. 5 stars all the way - I cant find any flaws in design or functionality/performance.",Waaayyyyyy better than expected - Not just for video chats - works great!
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2019,üåü FilipinaBarbie üåü,"I have this set up on my kitchen island. It was easy to set up because of the step by step prompting. I‚Äôve called a few people already that don‚Äôt have the actual Portal but they have the messenger app on their phone. I‚Äôm an Apple person but some of my friends don‚Äôt so it‚Äôs great to use this for them. I‚Äôm retired military so I have friends worldwide that I can connect with. My favorite option on this is that I can prompt Alexa to play such and such music genre and it will say, ‚ÄúI found this station that you may like‚Äù and will start playing. The sound carries throughout the house so I can play music for get-together or while I‚Äôm cleaning the house. I‚Äôve also synced my photos from Facebook, phone, and Instagram accounts so while it‚Äôs on standby, it will show photos just like an electronic photo album. I already have one friend that is going to buy this for one of her family members for Christmas. I‚Äôm loving this Portal and it‚Äôs fun to have!",So convenient!
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2019,Craig G.,"I can't imagine how anyone can give this product a negative review... It's one of the most unique gadgets I've encountered in a long time that has so many functions, I could never cover them all here. My only guess is maybe it's a bit too complicated to set up for those who aren't at least a bit tech savvy. So, I'll stick to my favorites things about it, which will require a long enough review as it is! - General: The display is crystal clear and responsive to the lightest touch (pardon the photos I've included here, they really don't do it justice), and the automatic camera panning functions perfectly. The microphone also works extremely well, clearly picking up your voice even when some distance away from the device. For paranoid people, the camera or both the cam and the microphone can be enabled/disabled in an instant via a sliding button on the side of the frame. There are icons displayed at upper right to indicate their status when inactive. The speakers are surprisingly good sounding, and it even has a sub-woofer in the rear, so it handles a full-range of frequencies when playing music. There are volume up/down buttons, also located at the side of the frame, or you can just tell Alexa to set the volume for you (example: ‚ÄúAlexa, set volume at 7‚Äù). Speaking of Alexa, ‚Äúshe‚Äù operates just as well here as I've seen in any other product. In addition to Alexa, Portal has a set of voice commands all its own, specific to the device. I love the ability to ask general questions (which as you can see in one photo I get a little crazy with sometimes, just for the heck of it) and request news, weather, music and other services. You can set the default sources for news and music from a variety of apps, such as Fox News and Pandora. Multiple users can be added, and it's a snap to switch between them, so everyone in the house can use their own various accounts. There's an accompanying free Portal app available in the Google Play Store, which works quite well for controlling some of the device's features remotely. - Video calls Since Portal sits on a table like a picture frame, it's always immediately available to make video calls without having to hassle with getting on your computer or digging out your tablet or phone. You can make these via either the Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp apps. That's a great option, as a lot of people with Facebook accounts might not use WhatsApp, which is far less popular than Messenger. Your Facebook friends and WhatsApp contacts are automatically added to the device's contact list, a nice convenience for making calls. ‚ÄúPhoto Booth‚Äù is hilarious, and when making video calls to my Granddaughters they absolutely adore it. I've seen other similar apps, but this one is especially good at placing its masks and other effects in exactly in the correct places on the display in relation to your face. Some even have appropriate accompanying music and sounds. - ‚ÄúSuperframe‚Äù Next to video calling, this is the best feature of the Portal... The picture frame of the future, which also displays videos! It detects when no one is in the vicinity to view it, in which case it turns the display off automatically, then back on again when someone approaches it. You can select which of your Facebook photo albums are displayed, add Instagram, and transfer photos/videos from your phone's camera to the device. Portal will source pictures from all of these simultaneously. When a Facebook photo or video is displayed, tapping the bottom left corner of the screen will display the album name, date uploaded and location (if available), along with a blurb from its accompanying post. Of course, the amount of time each photo is shown is configurable (from 15 seconds up to 10 minutes). It also displays the current date, time and temperature at lower right. There are just a few nits, but certainly nothing major: - Most of the ‚ÄúPortal Apps‚Äù are not apps at all, but instead simply web browser links to various web sites using the device's built-in web browser. However, the ones which use the browser all seem to operate fine, and it's nice that it has one in the first place. - The rear ‚Äúkick stand‚Äù is a non-adjustable, rigid plastic tube which the power supply cord also feeds through. So, the screen angle is fixed, but that can be taken care of by relocating the Portal to a higher or lower location since it's not a device you'll constantly be carrying around with you like a phone or tablet. I would have liked the option of hanging it on the wall as well though. In closing, I'm a total tech-head, and as previously mentioned this device is indeed unique and very easy to use once properly set up, even for people with no computer skills at all. Considering the plethora of functions it provides, in my opinion the price is also extremely reasonable. Now that we've got one, the convenience it provides would be hard to live without!",A super-cool little device
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2020,H. Erickson,"I'm honestly surprised at how much use we get out of the Portal. It's been a constant in our kitchen now for weeks and we do use it quite a bit. Not only due to its Alexa feature, but it has also been a hit with the kids when daddy is on business trips. This is a great screen device to connect long distance with. Setting it up is easy and simple, and you log in with your Facebook account. When not in use, it functions like a digital photo frame using your Facebook pictures. There are many settings with which you can customize it with but we've just left it pretty simple and it features our Facebook photos nicely. The video call quality is really very good and I've been impressed with how the camera follows and adjusts to where you are in the room. It is ideal for the kitchen especially as I can call and video chat while I cook, moving around my smaller galley kitchen, the camera follows me nicely. And now this next thing is rather vain of me, but I have to say that generally this angle--looking angled up from under your chin--isn't a flattering angle for so many people. For example, when I take a selfie, I hold my camera up and angled down from above me, so my chin looks smaller and the photo is more flattering. Somehow, this device manages to make me look good even from this low angle looking UP at me. That was a surprise! Usually I cringe when I open my phone camera and it's looking UP at me. But the Portal seems to create a flattering image even from that angle. So I enjoy using it! I also think the bedtime story feature is really sweet. When my husband is gone on business trips, he can ""read"" my kids a story that is interactive and fun from afar. I didn't think I'd like this product so much, honestly. I have to say, I'm surprisingly impressed and happy with it! My kids have figured out how to watch YouTube and browse the internet on it as well, though, so just know...it's another screen and device that does more than you might think!","Surprisingly impressed and great flattering camera for video chatting! (Yes, I'm vain.)"
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Dec 2019,amazon's fan,"Although it looks much like an iPad, Portal definitely provides a better quality video calls.  With iPad, sound is minimal, which is not the case with Portal.  Portal has a really nice built-in speaker on its back with bass that offers a much more pleasant sound quality for both video calls and even music listening, which is connected to Spotify, Pandora, and Amazon.  Alexa is readily available when she's called upon.  The camera also follows the video caller (slowly) within the space of less than 180 degrees.  During the video chat, all the functions included on the Messenger, such as filter, are all applicable on Portal.  Best of all, everyone looks great on the screen (clever design).  When Portal is not in use, pictures on Facebook will be automatically on display (by setting).  Images are very clear; sounds are also very clear.  The initial setup was very easy--I turned it on and followed the prompts--and only took me less than 15 minutes, including updating the software, before I made my first call.  The packaging looks a lot like any Apple products--simple, modern, and secure.  Overall, I am extremely happy with Portal.  I no longer struggle with hearing what comes out of the speaker.",Excellent for video-calling

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,J. Lewis,"I'll start by this review by saying that this Facebook Portal would probably be better as an office device than a living-room one given the current investigations of that company for violations of privacy. Personally, I'm not comfortable at the moment of this writing with sharing images of my personal space through that platform unless and until these privacy issues are resolved to my satisfaction. That said, this Portal is quite easy to set up. Connectivity over WiFi supports 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. This version of the Portal includes many features people would like; still, it has some quirks. It operates via two voice assistants, Portal and Alexa. I'm using Alexa for most things but can't get it to start video calls. I thus use ""Hey Portal"" for that. Video calling is smooth most times despite occasional problems but the motion tracking is phenomenal. If there is more than one person with you on a call, the camera pans onto whoever is speaking at the moment and does a cut-away at set angles  as if a professional camera guy were directing it The audio is great in calls but when using it with music it sounds a little tinny with way too much bass. The Bluetooth connection to several of my Bluetooth speakers occasionally sputters and there are no hardwired ports for headphones. I really don`t use WhatsApp but Instagram photos and Facebook photos are easy to access and you can even watch YouTube videos on it, though not videos from Amazon. There are some fun AR games for the kids and a storytelling feature with filters. I`m not overly impressed with this technology, to be honest. I have a friend who's rigged up a couple old tablets to do very similar things long before the first Portal, or any of its competitors for that matter, was doing it The need for something more, and the surrounding controversy with Facebook's policies, may make potential buyer reconsider whether this device is really worth the potential trouble and risks associated with it.",Do I Really Want Facebook Looking into My Living Room?
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,jande,Overall works well. I did run into a few hiccups with initial set up and had to contact Facebook portal chat team. With there instructions I had to do a factory reset and then was able to set it up with ease. Phone calls are made easily and I like how you can preset your favorites. Image quality is ok. I was hoping for a little better. The outside is made of a kind of cheap plastic which I don‚Äôt love. I do like that the camera follows you as you talk. Most of our video calling is done between my kids and their grandma so having a camera that follows them is nice. I also like that it is linked to my Facebook account so it shows pictures of mylife and kids. It‚Äôs like having a digital photo frame on the counter when I‚Äôm not using it. The sound quality on it is very nice. And it connected with Alexa easily.,A few set up hiccups but overall works really well
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2019,Eric L.,"This is a smart speaker with a touch screen that has video calling capability provided by Facebook. Using the Portal, you can video call anyone who has another Portal, or anyone who has Facebook Messenger installed on their personal device. I tested it with people who have Messenger since I'm the only Portal owner I know, and it works well with clear sound and picture. (I have fast broadband, but my experience with Facetime is that even a slower connection works fine, and that should be the case here). There is also WhatsApp connectivity available, but not being a WhatsApp user myself, I wasn't able to investigate that. The difference between this and something like Facetime for video calling is the Portal stays in one place on a shelf or table and the software uses face recognition to keep you in the frame as you wander around the room. And it works pretty well, within limits. Since the lens isn't physically moving, the software zooms and pans to within the limits of the angle of view of the wide angle fixed lens. The Portal can be used in landscape or portrait orientation, and there is a sensor that makes the change automatically as you rotate the screen. There's also a feature called ‚ÄúSpotlight‚Äù which allows you to put the focus on one person when talking to several people at once, just by tapping and pinching. And you can do group calls of up to eight people at once. As a mechanism for video calling it works smoothly and well. Since it's powered by the wall adapter and has no battery, it's not something you carry around from room to room, but if you like to make your video calls from one room, it's great. The portal itself is a simple white frame, somewhat hefty, feeling very solid and well made. The stand is placed at a fixed angle and is not adjustable. The screen looks dark when viewed at angles, so probably it's a TN screen. Not the best looking screen by modern standards, but it is crisp and bright and it's easy to read. There is a setting to automatically adjust the brightness with the ambient light, or you can set the brightness manually. The Superframe feature is welcome... it allows you to display a photo slideshow from your phone and/or Facebook and Instagram, and there's granularity of choice about which photos to display. Once the Portal is awake and idle, it can be set to display photos for a user-set period of time up to an hour. After the user-set period, the Portal goes to sleep, but it's still listening for voice commands (‚ÄúHey Portal, call mom...‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the Living Room lights‚Äù). The Alexa functionality works well. It can hear you and respond as well as any Amazon Echo. I'm still learning what Alexa functions can display information on the screen. Sometimes, it both speaks and displays answers on the screen; for example when I ask for a recipe or ask about the weather, it will display the weather or the recipe. It also appears to be able to display the output from an Arlo or Ring camera; however, it couldn't find my Arlo camera. This is probably Arlo's fault since the Arlo camera software rarely functions correctly. There are also a number of apps that come preinstalled which you can enable or disable, like Spotify, Photo Booth, Pandora, a browser, Youtube, CNN, and several others. One app I thought was particularly cute is ‚ÄúStory Time‚Äù which has you reading along with children's stories and uses the camera to put your face in the story, with some animated augmentation. If you are away from your kids and interacting with them using the Portal, this would be a charming and memorable way to say good night to them. The sound is surprisingly good.  There's a 4‚Äù woofer on the back of the frame, with the treble and midtones emanating from the front. It's not audiophile, but it's definitely better than tolerable and better than one would expect from a device this size. I have mine in the kitchen to pump out some tunes while cooking and doing dishes. Since it comes from Facebook, you must have a Facebook account to use the device. And elephant in the room time, you can assume that your private information will be sold by Facebook to nefarious third parties who don't have your best interests in mind. In any event, among the large data aggregators, Facebook has a reputation for being the most aggressive and objectionable. If you're very concerned about your privacy, this probably isn't the device for you. But, there are some settings included to help assuage your privacy worries, allowing you to review and delete saved voice interactions and other saved data. If you are meticulous you might be able to minimize your exposure, but Facebook has given us every reason not to trust them when it comes to our personal information, so I operate under the assumption that I don't have any privacy when using this device, and adjust what I do accordingly. It does appear Facebook is attempting to address privacy concerns, but this is not our first rodeo, and a healthy skepticism is advisable. It should be noted that there is a slider switch which, when slid all the way, physically covers the camera with a shutter and cuts off the microphone. A tiny red LED turns on when both the camera and microphone are disabled, so you can tell from across the room. When slid halfway, the shutter covers the camera but leaves the microphone available for voice commands. So prudent use of this switch should assuage some privacy concerns... just shut off the camera and microphone if you're not using the device. Finally, the literature provided with the device states that the camera and sound AI runs locally on the Portal, not on Facebook servers, so there's that. So, aside from the privacy concerns that spring from using a Facebook branded listening device and camera in my home, the experience with the Portal has been pleasant and encouraging. The device feels high end and well-engineered. The TN screen with its narrow viewing angles isn't the best available but is acceptable, and everything else here is Apple-level fit and finish. Assuming you place or would like to place video calls frequently to contacts who have Messenger installed on their devices, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Portal. If you don't place video calls but want an Alexa enabled smart speaker with a screen, this is also a good choice, considering the price, build quality, and functionality. But, you have a choice of which ecosystem to use in your smart screens, and if you're not invested in video calling to Messenger users, there are a number of different choices out there to consider, like the Echo Show and the Nest Hub. If you do choose the Portal, you won't be disappointed with the build quality-- it's a nicely made item.","Not Perfect, but Quite Good"
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2020,Susie Q.,"My mother in-law is not especially techno-savvy, so we wanted an easy and convenient way that she could video chat with our kids. We have one for ourselves and got one for her and were able to help her set it up in person. The portal is ideal for anyone with kids who like to run around the room while video chatting. The screen expands to include all of the people in the room and then zooms in when necessary. You can even pick a particular person to follow on the screen. However, my kids favorite feature is the video filters. My five-year-old especially loves all of the different transformations that can take place (particularly turning into a fire-breathing dragon. It's a great way to bring families together, and when not in use for video calls, it functions as a digital frame, cycling through your FB photos (you can even designate a particular FB photo album to use). It has a lot of additional functions also built in (like Alexa). I've used it to watch YouTube videos and to stream music. It's pretty versatile. For those afraid of an eavesdropping big brother, it includes a lens cover and a microphone mute button, although if you're really concerned you could always unplug it when you're not using it (the other party will just have to call you first to let you know you need to plug it in for a web chat). You can connect it to multiple FB accounts if there are more than one family members who want to use the device to speak with their contacts. Set-up is pretty simple and straightforward and didn't take very long at all.",A neat way to stay in touch.
Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Nov 2019,Mary V,"Portal Mini from Facebook. Smart Video Calling with Alexa Built-in ‚Äì 8‚Äù Screen (Black) This is an odd little machine. You must already have wifi and a Facebook account to make use of the Portal.  You log into this Portal with your credentials for both of those. The ‚Äúextra‚Äù is that Alexa, Amazon‚Äôs virtual assistant is integrated into this portal, so you can call her name and give her commands. You can also do video calling to any of your Facebook Friends. For example, you can say, ‚ÄúAlexa, call Jon‚Äù.  Alexa will initiate a video call with Jon. I did not like using the heavy screen with the ogling camera and eavesdropping microphone. To enable any interaction with Facebook, another password had to be provided. Even though I reset to factory settings after using the Portal, I have a gnawing feeling that I have somehow signed over to Mark Z. the rights to my off springs‚Äô DNA to the 8th generation. There‚Äôs no internal power source; it must be plugged in at all times to work. The Portal felt like a not-fully-developed prototype, one that hasn‚Äôt been fully thought-out either. Who would want this? Who would use it? The only possible people I could imagine would be either a granny who is afraid of using the computer but loves to get on Facebook. And truth be told, there aren‚Äôt really that many of those out there. Or the second scenario would be someone trying to exert extreme control over their children‚Äôs internet use.

Facebook Portal - Smart Video Calling 10‚Äù Touch Screen Display with Alexa - Black,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2019,Stepinwolf,"The touch screen worked well and it responded to my requests much like the Echo Show (1st generation) that I have.  I have a picture of them side by side for comparison.  The display is larger and I believe the sound is better.  The photos have been edited to remove personal references.  To use the Portal well, you really need to be close so you can access the touch screen and on angle.  The viewing angle is not a wide as I would like.  I am still learning how to use this and have not figured out how to control my smart home devices with it, but I am sure it is there somewhere.  I don‚Äôt use facebook messenger, spotify nor WhatsApp, so I couldn‚Äôt evaluate them.  It does can do a slide show of the images I have put on facebook, which is nice.  The ability to get CNN and iHart Radio on it is also nice.  I like the ability to cover the camera lens and disable the microphone with the slide on the top edge.","Good display, very good sound"

My phone has video calling/chatting/Face timing and so does my tablet. My computer has a webcam so I can/have used Skype and other video apps/sites before. But when I got this Portal and was setting it up I realized that I could call anyone through Facebook if they have one too or not. So anyone that has a Facebook with a connected phone number you can call them! It's fun and easy to use if you use the video chat feature or just treat it like a phone. The video quality is really great and the camera follows you/them as you move which is nice in case you're doing something like cleaning, cooking, or getting ready for example. It's a good size screen being 10 inches and the sound quality is great too. I like using Youtube through it as well. It has a really nice touch screen that responds just as well if not better than my phone and tablet. Oh and it has Alexa as a voice assistant built right in! So I can say ""Call Mike Jones or pull up Youtube"" and it'll do as instruction. Basically, the Facebook Portal has multiple uses and is really high quality! I can definitely say that I'm surprised yet glad to be able to honestly recommend it! I think it would make a fantastic and fun gift idea as well with the Holidays coming up.
