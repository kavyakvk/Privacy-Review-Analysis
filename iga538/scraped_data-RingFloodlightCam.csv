"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jul 2018,Rick,I purchased two of these from Amazon a year ago and they haven't failed me yet. Now I am linked to everyone in my neighborhood through the app and last night I received a notice that my neighbor's house had an attempted theft of his outdoor smoker/grill. I immediately contacted Ring through their app and told them to activate the recording service. That same man came to our back porch within minutes of leaving my neighbors house and tried to steal my brand new outdoor pizza oven. My Ring light came on and scared him away. My camera footage was able to assist the police in tracking down and arresting the man.,Everyone Should Have at Least One of These Floodlight Cameras
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2018,The Norm,"UPDATE 16FEB2018: After two weeks, I must downgrade my review... it's become obvious that the Ring Floodlight Cam only detects motion during the day.  At night, I can walk through the center of my defined motion zone, but the cam won't record until I'm within 10 feet of it. The defined zone is my driveway which is about 40 feet long and we have 3 cars. As long as the ne'er-do-wells only break into the car parked closest to the Ring cam, they will be recorded. A quick Google search for ""ring cam won't detect motion at night"" will yield many stories of the Ring product line failing to work in darkness. Apparently, the problem has been documented since September 2017 and Ring has failed to fix it. I must say that I'm beyond disappointed. At least I discovered this in enough time to send the cam back to Amazon for a refund. INITIAL REVIEW: We've begun having an ongoing problem with car break-ins in our neighborhood. I wanted to get a security cam to monitor our driveway. I looked into standard cctv and more advanced poe/hd cams with a dedicated computer and HDD, but hesitated due to the complicated nature of the installs. Not that I can't do that, but I really wanted a simpler option. Enter the Ring Floodlight Cam. I purchased one to install in place of the motion floodlight over our driveway. I am pleased. Pros: - Easy/straightforward install. If you can wire a light fixture, you can physically install this cam. - Getting the cam online was simple (you have to use the Ring App). - Setting zones was easy as well (using the app). - I receive motion notifications within 5 to 10 seconds of motion being detected. - The cloud app works well from my phone and is one of the more reasonably priced plans out there. - The two way voice communication allows me to startle my wife when she comes home from work. Cons: - The camera mount has very little range of motion... approximately 30* left, right, up or down. It worked in my install but it may not for you. - I see no way this cam could be mounted under an eave... vertical wall only. - A bubble level on the cam would be VERY helpful for setting the cam level with the ground (necessary for the motion sensor to work properly). - My house has several access points all using the same SSID. The cam occasionally connects to a weaker signal of one of the other APs. (Will likely fix this by setting up an SSID just for the cam.) When it connects to that weaker signal the performance of the cam is significantly degraded. Install tip: It was 20*F outside when I installed the cam. I didn't want to be running up and down a ladder if I had problems connecting to the network. I wired the cam up with a plug (from an old, grounded extension cord) and ran the wifi setup routine at my kitchen table. I verified everything was working (including the app, motion detection, etc.) before I installed it outside. My sole wish is that the wide angle lens were ""slightly"" less wide. But I knew that before purchase and it didn't stop me. If this cam continues to work as well as it has so far, I will likely get another for our front yard/door.",CANNOT DETECT MOTION AT NIGHT!!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Oct 2017,Luke,"I really wanted to like this product, but it comes with some flaws.  Several actually.  I feel like this product could benefit from several improvements, and perhaps not so much as the unit itself, but the ring app for Mac and the smart phone. My #1 issue during the installation was that the bolts that were provided were too short.  I had to reuse the old ones.  #2. I wish it could come with WIFI and ethernet ports.  We have a larger property so the signal on one end of the house can be unstable.  #3. Ok, software needs major work.  The light scheduler does not work.  Our lights were on a schedule to turn on at 7pm and turn off at 11pm, they do come on, but the ring app will never turn them off.  Also if there is movement the lights come on, but they don't turn off after the designated time of 15 minutes. My other problem; and this is a big deal for me is that I can view only one camera at a time.  I can understand this on a cell phone, but on a desktop computer I want to see video from all cameras installed.  The application will tell you to close one feed before you can open a feed from another camera.  The reason why I'd like to be able to see video from all my ring cameras is because I want to have the ability to track my kids around the house.  Some might be on a swing set while others could be riding a bike in front of the garage.",Software needs work.

Moyer,Was a huge fan of ring products up until last night when the LED light on my floodlight camera stopped working.  Product is 1yr and 2 months old.  Just out of warranty.  🤨 after working with Ring tech support for @2 hrs have been told there is nothing they can do and I will need to repurchase. Hard pill to swallow.  $250 product has no way to replace light and just stopped working just after 1 yr old.,Light just stopped working!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2017,Al,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I got this with my eyes wide open, knew a had a few flaws but also knew that the basic concept was very neat and if they could get it all to work as stated this would by far be a must have, not only for security, having fun with friends, well the list goes on and on. After a lot of trial and error it is working great now. OK, Let me first tell you what I have, I have the Ring Floodlight Video camera, TP-Link AC1900 Long Range Wireless Wi-Fi Router (Archer C9) TP-Link AC1750 Wi-Fi Range Extender w/ Gigabit Ethernet Port (RE450) , TP-Link 2.4GHz 8dBi Indoor Omni-directional Antenna, 802.11n/b/g, RP-SMA Female connector (TL-ANT2408CL) , Sounds like a lot but it's not. The router settings are simple. There is free software programs out there (Google it) that analyze your Wifi signal quality, RSSI, signal strength and more so when you have everything setup you aim your antennas at the range extender and look at free program to see if it's better or worse, keep doing this until you have best signal, remember  Ring Floodlight Video Camera goes from 0-100, the lower the number the better: RSSI (dBm) Signal -30 100% -40 100% -50 100% -60 90% -64 80% -68 70% -73 60% -77 50% -82 40% -86 30% -91 20% -95 10% A lot of people think the higher the number the better, Wrong. I had Ring outside mounted on front of carport, about 45 to 50 feet from router, the new C9 TP LINK from Amazon, Well er, ah, what was I doing wrong, kept Googling and reading and decided I had come this far can't stop now so ordered TP Link Range extender, boy  did this  make a difference. 2 ways to set up extender, simple way WPS button, push it on router and then push big button on extender or what I did I used WPS but named extender to, it will tell you how in instructions. Even though this was a major improvement I wanted more, after more reading I decided I needed the TP-Link 2.4GHz 8dBi Indoor Omni-directional Antennas so I got 3 of them, but only use two, 1 on each end of router and one that came with router in middle. While reading up on antennas is where I read about aiming them at your device or extender. Man I was cooking with grease now. I thought it could not get any better than this. OK, man was I wrong, completely. Today I moved Ring Floodlight closer to router by moving Ring on this side of carport, 9 feet up mounted on front of house near window, window is 9 feet up to. Mounted Ring, came inside, mounted range extender on window sill inside house, about 2 feet from Ring outside separated by glass window, came to router, just aimed the 2 8dBi antennas at range extender, other antenna straight up, turn on iPhone, Live View and almost fell out of chair, there are no words to explain the difference in video quality. If you do it right, this is a must have. I had not even used free programs yet to test aiming of antennas so I looked at signal strength on Ring App -25. This is the stuff if done right. Good luck. Also if you have ethernet connection and want to use wifi at same time (Not be kicked off wifi upon every reboot, google use how to use Ethernet and wifi at same time, youtube video tells you how to add two things to registry to make this happen, works great, Again Good Ruck.",Move Ring closer to router and Get Range Extender- Motion even detects objects as small as a cat
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2018,Eric,"After owning a Ring doorbell for about a year, and being happy with it, I decided to buy the Ring Floodlight in August 2017.  I got the unit, installed as a replacement for my current motion detecting floodlight, and gave it a try.  It was flaky.  Sometimes the camera would capture me walking up my driveway and other times not.  Sometimes you would see the car start backing out of the driveway, look like it was stopped, and then it would just disappear. I call Ring support, then spent hours with them testing out my WIFI link,  power cycling the device, which is a pain, as I had to keep going out to my circuit breaker box, allowing them to log in an see the same thing I was seeing.  After a few hours, they decided that it was a WIFI issue and they would give me a Ring Chime Pro to extend my WIFI.  I agreed to this, but as my tests using my phone as a WIFI tester showed I could get better then 5Mb/sec up and 20Mb/sec down right next to the Ring Floodlight, I was skeptical. The following week, the Ring Chime Pro showed up.  I plugged it in, set it up, and things were no better, so I was back on the phone with support for the rest of the day.  Moved the Ring Chime Pro to multiple locations, power cycled the Floodlight,  did more WIFI tests, and they finally decided to send me a new Ring Floodlight unit. I got the new unit in, installed it, but it was not any better.  I hoped that maybe the automated Ring software updates would help over time, but nothing.  Half the time the Floodlight is on all day long, and I have to use the app to turn it off. I drive up at night, and the Floodlight may turn on for a few seconds, or it may stick on for the night, or something in between.  The camera may alert me, or it may not.  When it does alert me, I normally see images that freeze, so you see someone walking up my driveway, the image freezes, and then seconds later, they just disappear. My internet provider supplies me with 125 Mb/sec down and 12 Mb/sec up which is way more then the Ring Floodlight needs.  Using WIFI I have no problems doing video Skype or Google hangout calls,  so I know the issue is not my WIFI or Internet.  The Ring Floodlight just does not work.  They can’t even get a simple motion detection Floodlight to work correctly, and the floodlight feature does not even use the Internet. Stay way.",The floodlight does not even work right
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2017,ca,"Absolutely do not buy this product. Great in concept but until they update the software to hold the wifi settings in the event of an intermittent power supply or intermittent wifi signal, the product is worthless. Every couple of days the product goes offline, the lights kick on/stay on and you have no control of the device unless you climb a ladder and manually reset the entire device. Ring has not been helpful at all in addressing this issue. The Ring Doorbell Pro does not have this issue so it is shocking they released the floodlight cam with this glaring flaw in design. Update: Ring has responded to complaints regarding the software issues and the product is working significantly better. No wifi connectivity issues and a few other glitches have been fixed. Only complaint is that customer service talked to me like I was clueless when they in fact had no idea about their own problems - once escalated a person with some sense help direct the issues to engineering for reprogramming.",Great in concept but until they update the software to ...
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Sep 2017,Rocky,"I'm using this floodlight cam to monitor a vacant family home located 1-1/2 hours away from our home location. Installation was very easy. I had my own tools, but the product came with everything needed (and these weren't the ""cheap"" IKEA-like assembly ones either) so I used those supplied with the cam/light. They even provided an ""s-hook"" to hold the light up close to the electrical junction box during installation so you didn't have to try juggling the fixture while making the electrical connections, or argue with your wife who is holding the fixture ""too low, stop moving around, don't answer that call, etc., how thoughtful was that?!?!  It ""paired"" very quickly with the wi-if network, and I'm very impressed with the picture quality and response time. I installed 4 Panasonic web-cams 15-years ago at our home that had pan/rotate/zoom capabilities so I was a bit concerned that this product was a fixed position camera.  The wide angle (I'm old and don't remember the product specs but I think it's 140-degrees) 1080p picture quality with digital pan and zoom quickly alleviated that concern. The clarity, length, and width of field-of-view is amazing!  I've already ordered a 2nd floodlight cam as well as a Doorbell Pro for the ""remote"" vacant home. I also plan on ordering units for our own home.  In speaking with the very friendly, and knowledgeable Ring support group, I was pleased to find out I can add as many Ring units, at as many residence locations as I desire and still be able to take advantage of their ""unlimited"" $100/year 60-day video Cloud storage plan that also provides a discount (10% I think) for additional Ring products purchased on their web-site, and if I remember correctly, also some type of extended product warranty.  If you visit the Ring website, (and I'm sure those products will also be available thru Sellers on Amazon as well) they have several new products shown that will be available ""Fall 2017"" that look very impressive, including their new Doorbell Elite version that will feature POE (I think this stands for Power over Ethernet) which means you can connect this Doorbell using a CAT 6-type cable to a compatible switch/router and have a very secure and stable ""wired"" (not ""wireless"" ) connection without having to have a seperate pair of wires to power the functions of this ""Elite"" Doorbell. I am not an employee, or am in no way affiliated with Ring, I payed the same price we all payed for this product that I purchased here on Amazon, but as an engineer who doesn't like having arguments with my project helper (i.e. my wife), and who recognizes a high quality product that is designed to make installing and using the unit easy for most anyone, I felt the need to compile this review.","Save Your Marriage, Buy This One!"

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jan 2019,JimRP,"I am extremely disappointed in all of the Ring products.  If you don't subscribe to their cloud service, the devices are basically worthless other than as an expensive doorbell or floodlight.  Without their cloud service, live viewing is all you can do.  To view a live motion event, you need to have the phone in your hand and be ready to tap the notification of motion.  Failure to be quick enough to tap the notification results in the event being sent to the cloud.  If you don't pay for their cloud service you cannot access the video after it has been sent to the cloud.  Of course, they give you free cloud service during your return period so you don't realize how poor the device is until it's too late to return it.  Even with their cloud service, It took 20 seconds for the camera to detect motion and report to the phone or Windows 10 app.  It took another 30 seconds for the app to show the motion event and an additional 40 seconds before you could open the video.  Our neighborhood had high-speed fiber optics installed in the last five years and our Internet is 100 Mbps up and down so speed is not an issue at our end.  In our test, the camera was only 18 feet from the wireless router.  I had planned on adding the Ring doorbell and five of the Ring floodlight camera/motion detectors around my house and shop.  You must pay the $30 cloud service fee for each camera if you want any access to the videos after the fact (that's $180 a year including the doorbell).  It's not the amount of money but the principle that you cannot save videos locally and that you have to pay the fee for even a marginally acceptable security device.  I am returning all of my security light/camera products.  Unfortunately, I am stuck with the doorbell as it's too late to return it.",Marginal to worthless security device.

Easy to install....anyone can do it if you can read.  If you do need support they are extremely helpful...a rarity! I also have the Ring doorbell pro....also highly recommended go for the pro for sure...much better video.

I purchased 4 of these floodlight cams to replace the stick up cams on my property. The viewing angle and the video quality is superb, the install and setup was easy and together with my trusty Netgear orbi's which blanket my property with wifi, the video stream is of great quality. Voice quality over the speaker is loud and clear, the spotlights are plenty bright to do their job at night. The siren is loud enough, but I'll admit for all I've read, I imagined it being louder. Night image quality is very good and the notifications arrive fast at my smart phone and Ring chime devices. I highly recommend this product provided you give it what it needs.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2018,raprap,"Using this product for a couple of months now. Generally I like it and it works well but there are two issues for me, one is annoying and the other is REALLY annoying. First, if you have the light in your backyard area that you use at night the bloody light is going on an off all the time you and guest enjoy the outdoors. Only solution is to turn the darn this off. Luckily, I have mine on a switch. Ring says they are working on a fix. The second REALLY ANNOYING part is that the floodlights default to always on when power is applied. Why is this an issue? Where I live we routinely have power interruptions for various reasons and due to storms in the summer. When this happens at 2AM the light turns ON, when power is restored and it never times out. If the light is somewhere near your bedroom guess what? Again, you must remove power (what's the purpose of that? defeats having it for security) to get some sleep or go to the app and turn the light off. Really, at 2AM and maybe multiple times in one night? This needs a timeout or better, an app setting for setup mode that turns it on and then disables it after that. I vote to the disable option in the app. This could easily be five stars.","Generally good, one annoying and one REALLY ANNOYING issue"

Robinson,"The device was easy to install. The setup didn’t work exactly as the instructions said, but I got it up and running without too much difficulty. I ended up having to buy a WiFi extender to get the best video quality, but that isn’t the fault of the device. It worked fine for about 2 weeks and then it went offline. There is power to the device but it will no longer connect to my network and I can’t get it to go into setup mode so I ca. Try to reconnect it. I tried Ring’s troubleshooting instructions with no luck. I called their support line and the associate ultimately tried to tell me the device probably just wasn’t wired probably, and that I may need to contact an electrician. I pushed back on that and they agreed to send me a replacement.  I’ll see how that goes and update this accordingly. Update: I received the replacement and it is up and running. No problems so far. I will give it a couple of weeks to see if it lasts longer than the original one did.  If it does, I will adjust my rating. 2nd update: the replacement is has been working for about a month now with no problems. There is some slight freezing and artifacts g while viewing the image, even though I have 150mbs WiFi with an extender near the camera. I wasn’t expecting TV quality, though.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Sep 2019,Sean Morris,"I bought a ring floodlight camera May 17, 2018.  A few weeks ago I noticed the camera pointing downwards. I thought possibly we were victims of vandalism, but when I examined the camera and sensor mount, pieces flaked off in my hand. My wife said she thought that she heard a noise when she closed one of the garage doors one day. I contacted Ring as I thought it was an unacceptable amount of time for this to fail. I was told my unit was out of warranty and they would offer me $100 off a replacement, as they had no repair parts for this.  Again unacceptable. I was going to try and glue it back together. Luckily I had an old light with a similar plastic mount/base.  I replaced it and I am up and running.  These things really should last more than a year. Use better plastic than can handle some UV exposure or go to a metal mount for the camera/sensor.",Worthless camera mount broke in just over a year
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2017,A. dinz,"The floodlight cam has many settings to help narrow down your preferences in what the camera picks up.  The problem with that is that those settings are not as accurate as they look, more on that later. Installation and setup is very thought out and simple! Packaging is great. Sharing access to your Ring products is great!  When you share access, that person sets up their own account and cannot mess with the settings of your camera/s. —updated— After a few months of ownership here is what I know-- Motion settings: there is about a 30-40 foot limit to set off the camera (day or night), stray headlights or lights reflecting off any shiny object will trip the camera/light at night (so no parking near the floodlight if cars will drive by). The ""area"" settings are cool but fairly inaccurate. The camera view looks nice on your devices but trying to see anything specific (faces, license plates, etc)past about 10 feet, especially if it's moving, isn't happening. The sound doesn't start until about 3-5 seconds into the video. The video's are skippy/laggy with our home network excellent and our ISP connection very good(1Gb service).  Customer Service wasn't helpful VIA email, they really wanted to talk on the phone which isn't the best way for the hearing impaired to communicate(me). Summary: Ring Floodlight is ok for general safety and alerting you when someone or something is within range but they're not sufficient for identifying anything specific. Getting the settings right for both daytime & nighttime isn't easy. The premise for the Ring products is a good one bit the hardware/technology needs major updating to deal with todays technology.  After a few months I'm still needing to change settings almost daily (the day/night differences mainly). Also there’s no notification of software/performance changes when they happen which is NOT good.  Some changes in the last few months completely changed how the light functions and I had no idea. Suggested enhancements: add a brightness setting (a setting that lowers or raises the brightness of the camera).  Times when the sun is shining directly, or nearly direct, into the camera makes it very difficult to see past about 10 feet. Fine tune the camera's light sensitivity at night to help stop the detection of indirect lights (far off headlights reflecting off a windshield or shiny car paint sets off the lights).  This is a security issue because at night passing cars can tell it's there when they set off the floodlights. Notify customers of camera updates!!!!",Good for general security-“updated review”

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2019,Nooly,"I love my Ring Doorbell Cam, and decided to add to the collection with a Floodlight Cam for my garage.  I had a motion style floodlight in place already, so replacement with the Ring version should have been fairly simple.  I pulled the unit out of the box, mounted it to garage, and then wired it accordingly.  After going through the setup process 5 or 6 times, and with a full wi-fi signal, the unit would not connect to my network.  A quick call to Ring's customer service resolved the issue after instructions to reboot my Asus router.  After the reboot, the unit connected. Once the setup was completed I entered my motion zones and began to play around with the settings a bit.  I noticed right away that when I manually turned on the floodlights, the lights would not come on.  The unit make a faint clicking sound like they were being switched on internally, but they would not illuminate.  After some communication with Ring, it was determined that the unit was defective. A replacement was ordered, and arrived from Amazon a few days later.  After swapping the units I now had the ability to manually turn the lights on and off.  What I noticed right away, however, is that the lights were not near as bright as the floodlight that I removed.  Another observation is that since the lenses are not frosted like my old unit, the perception of glare is quite high when looking towards the lights.  Although not a deal breaker, I was a bit disappointed.  Both of these issues could easily be fixed by Ring as the product is updated. After adjusting the settings on my second unit, I noticed that the lights were not activating with motion directly in front of the Floodlight Cam (camera and floodlight settings are separate).  With the unit facing my 90 foot long driveway, I could pull straight in, and the lights would not be triggered until my vehicle was passing through the garage door.  The lights would be triggered by my neighbor driving up and down his driveway, which is approximately 15 feet from the edge of my driveway.  They would also be triggered when we'd let our dogs out into the fenced in yard from the opposite side.  I tried adjusting the light motion zones left and right, and increasing and reducing the maximum distance setting.  The unit would still be triggered by the neighbor's driveway, and and still wouldn't activate from the front. After several communications once again with Ring, and a few resets, the problem was not able to be resolved.  Ring then decided to ship me a new unit directly from their facility in California.  After installation and setup, this unit is better than the last, but still doesn't function as it should.  I am able to shut off the right side zone so my neighbor doesn't set off the floodlights every time he drives by, but the unit is still not consistent when picking up motion directly in front of the unit (sensor is level as instructed).  Sometimes the floodlights will trigger from straight on and sometimes they won't.  When they do, it's usually when I'm about 5-10 feet away from the unit.  Once in a while the lights will be triggered when I'm about 25 feet away from the unit.  It's not at all consistent, and much worse than what I took down as far as the floodlights are concerned. Although for the most part I'm a fan of my Ring Doorbell Cam, I'm not as impressed with the Floodlight Cam.  A certain percentage of products are going to be defective, and that's understandable.  Unfortunately, I believe the floodlight sensors on the units that I received are nowhere near as precise as they need to be to make the units function properly.  I'd also like to see increased lumen output on the lights, and frosted lenses to cut down on the glare.  With these improvements I'd be much more inclined to recommend the product. One last thing to keep in mind concerning both of my Ring devices.  When a motion event triggers an alert on my mobile device, I can click the link immediately to obtain a live view of the camera in question.  Unfortunately, I cannot view the initial part of the recording that triggered the actual alert.  With a several second delay from the time you're alerted, it's very easy to miss the event that triggered the actual alert.  For example, I've had stray dogs pass through my front yard.  I'll open the alert as soon as I receive it only to find nothing on the view of the camera.  The Ring system is set up so that you can't immediately watch the beginning of the video that triggered the alert until that segment of video is done recording.  These videos are typically a minute or two in length, so for that period of time you may not see what actually caused the alert unless the person or animal is still present.  The one to two minutes may not sound like a lot of time, but if a dangerous wild animal passes by, or an intruder runs by quickly, you may not know it for a short period of time.  This has been a very annoying issue for both of my Ring cameras.  I'd like to see this changed so that I can immediately view the beginning of the video that has triggered the alert while the remainder of the video is still recording.  It does no good to have an alert if I can't see what may have triggered the alert without a lengthy delay.",Definitely Needs Improvement
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Feb 2019,susan@tucson,"At first glance, the Ring Spotlight Cam seemed perfect for my situation. In hindsight that notion was wrong. Really wrong. Initially I hired an electrician to install the device and then unfortunately after all that, it did not work. Then after one and a half hours on the line with tech support while climbing up on the ladder multiple times to reset the device, it was determined that the item was defective. I had to return it to Amazon which required repacking the item, printing out the label and taking it to the UPS store. Amazon shipped me another one. So another trip up the ladder to install the second device that had fewer problems but still was not operative. Then it was determined that the Cam was too far from my Internet router. Nowhere in the Amazon description nor in any of the Ring materials did they disclose this issue—that the router needs to be less than 30 feet from the device-- which seems in retrospect a problem that plagues many of their users. Since by definition, the router will be inside and the Cam is designed to be outside, it seems unethical not to mention this fact and probably illegal not to disclose this before a customers commits to the item and hires an electrician to make it happen. The costs start adding up. In addition to the initial $250 for the Can and the cost of the electrician, a Wi-Fi booster was required which also has to be installed and set up by the user. Long story short, many other conversations with Ring tech support ensued. The quality of Ring Tech support ranges from good to mediocre to just plain snarky. The written materials definitely lack the necessary details to make this a DIY project. Finally after all this, it’s working. But really all this is much to do about not nearly enough. Just don’t buy one. Stick with your plain vanilla outside lighting and do yourself a favor. You’ll live longer. If you want to know who is at your door, look out the window.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jul 2019,Harvey H. Meeker,"When I purchased the Floodlight Cam I had read through the various complaints about the product noted in the highly upvoted bad reviews, but I figured I would chance it anyway since the product is exactly what I wanted and there don't seem to be a lot of other alternatives. I had an existing fixture near that area and so there was already wiring available to use, but I did end up putting the Ring camera farther up so that it would have a better view and because the recommendation was to get it as high up as possible. I ended up installing a new exterior junction box for the camera and I used a metal one. According to the Ring documentation the camera is meant to sit in a 4"" round junction box. The camera is installed about 9 feet up on the front of my garage. There is nothing above or below it. I've seen other reviewers had trouble getting the camera to connect to their wifi and stay connected, but I had no issues. I use the Netgear Orbi mesh network with a base station and one satellite. The satellite lives on the second floor of my house and coverage area is quite large. I have about a 200 foot long driveway and I can get signal to my phone while standing at the end of it. By comparison the garage, while not connected to the house, is only about 15 feet away from the house. The camera connected up fine and has not lost connection. I've seen the complaints about the night vision motion detection for the camera being poor. I'll have to come back to that as I am set back from the road and so while I have nothing coming up at night it's quite possible in the week or so I've had it up that nothing has gone by at night either. Edit 1/15/2020: I've had the camera up for a few months now and I've gotten numerous nighttime motion detections from it. It seems to detect motion in the defined area very well and at odd angles. Most of my detections are woodland creatures as I'm set back in the woods, these are small creatures for the most part so it seems to be working fine overall.",I decided to go with this despite some of the prominent bad reviews.

Mostly 4 or 5 Stars. Mounting Hardware 5 Stars on the little box that contains the mounting hardware, such as:  screws, wire nuts, tool, and hook. Mounting Bracket 1 Star because it only works on 4” round electrical receptacles. It looked so well made and engineered until I realize it would not work with a 2”x4” electrical box whether it was horizontal or vertical.  Only one screw hole lined up.  Mine was horizontal surrounded by brick.  Thus, I spent an extra three hours on mounting it. Instructions 4 to 5 Stars Product Construction 5 Stars Packaging 5 Stars because nearly all can be recycled and it’s well designed. Overall Installation Process  5 Stars provided you have the correct electrical outlet Connecting To  WiFi 4 Stars because it does not support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi Connectivity. RING App on Smartphone 4 Stars.  Mainly because I think added users/family/friends should have less capabilities when granting them access to it. Siren Feature 2 to 3 Stars.

Of all the time the RING engineers spent on designing a mounting ring for the product, then it should haves worked on any 2”x4” electrical boxes.  This should should have been a “no brainer moment”. I do love it and I wish they come up with a few accessories that could be used with it. 1). Accessory to allow home owners to trigger a remote siren to help drive away intruders or alert neighbors. 2)  Limit or restrict access/changes to others who have been given access to it. 3)  Redesign the mounting bracket or make an adapter so it can be mounted to a 2”x4” or 4”x4” electrical box. 4)  Dual WiFi Band support for 2.4GHz or 5GHz.",VERY NICE PRODUCT BUT VERIFY THE DIMENSION OF YOUR ELECTRICAL BOX

The only fix is to completely power off the unit and have it reboot... which only fixes it for a short time.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Apr 2019,Mark,"We started with one Ring product, the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and we used the Amazon's ""Ring Video Doorbell Pro Installation"" services, too. Everything worked without any issues, we signed up for the $30 annual fee (a discount from the $3/month offering due to the prepayment.) We liked being able to see when our packages are delivered and where they are placed. This cam provided that, however, sometimes packages are left in front of our garage door, so . . . we went ahead and ordered the Ring Floodlight cam and mounted it over the center of our three-car garage which gives us a wide-angle view of our driveway. With these two Ring cams, we then had the front and the garage side of the house under monitoring. We went ahead and prepaid another $30 for the extended monitoring, etc.  We have several Alexa devices that permit seeing the action at the Front Door or Garage by uttering a command to Alexa. We have a screened in back porch and a deck, and you may have figured this out: There are times when we receive a delivery when it is raining, so the delivery person from FedEx or UPS will actually take our packages an put them on the floor of the screened in porch. Solution to the possible blind spot? By now you know we bought a second floodlight cam and mounted it in the middle of the back of the house which gives us a view (and a recording) of the back yard, the deck, and even the screened-in porch. We also added another $30 prepaid for one-year of recordings, etc. These floodlight cams are hardwired. No batteries. They have motion detectors which sense movement (sensitivity can be adjusted) and turn on 2000 lumen lights that bathe the area being monitored in brilliant white light. Now we're thinking, let's go to Ring to see if they have floodlights that have the same look, same brightness but without cams. The answer (on Amazon) was: They're being released at the end of April 2019. We bought two of them, here's how to look them up: ""Ring Smart Lighting - Floodlight."" Last but not least, we bought the Ring Smart Lighting - Bridge. The requirements/purpose/function of the bridge are these: The Ring Smart Lighting - Bridge - Installs indoors and receives power through the included Micro-USB power supply and cable. - Connects Ring Smart Lighting with Ring doorbells and cameras to create a fully connected home security system. - Allows Ring Smart Lights to work with Alexa to turn on lights and adjust settings with your voice. From Ring: ""The Ring Bridge lets Ring Smart Lights, doorbells and cameras talk to each other and work better together. If one Ring Bridge-enabled device detects motion, it can turn on your Ring Smart Lights, activate your Ring cameras and more, giving your Ring of Security endless combinations."" Once these are released, late April early May 2019, we'll replace our 25-year-old incandescent floodlights with Ring lights Giving us 75% of our house (where the doors are) camera coverage and 100% of our house with floodlight coverage. Given that these are super bright, not incandescent (meaning, hopefully, very long life and low energy consumption) lights we're very pleased to make the ""upgrades"" as an investment in our house. Also, there is a neat feature which allows you to ""geofence"" and read (and see) and make comments from other Ring owners who are inside of your ""fence."" Finally, once we get to the point of having more than three Ring devices we can sign up for the Ring unlimited service for $100 per year which means an increase of only $10 since we won't need the three $30 each individual ""subscriptions"" since the $100 fee covers as many devices as you have. Brilliant lights, HD cameras, two-way conversation possibilities provide a virtual 'ring' around our house  (plus there is a very loud siren that comes with the Ring Floodlight cams.) Although we did not get these things for this specific purpose, we were even able to watch our neighbor's son mow our lawn while we were out which gave us an indication how much longer we had before he was finished so we could get home in time to pay him. That was kind of a novel one-off, but it was cool to be able to look out and around our house just in case. I have no idea if Ring's products are durable, they do appear (and feel) well made which suggests they are durable, though; and they are attractive, almost having a Swedish-design (ours are in white). Five stars and this is an easy-to-give recommendation.

Not only did I spend $250.00 on the device I also paid an electrician to install it. I will never buy another Ring product again. What a poor product that you can't replace the bulbs and it becomes an expensive piece of garbage that doesn't even last that long.,Works great for 18 months then when it burns out just throw it away
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2018,Walter,"This was the easiest floodlight I have ever installed.  The hardware that came with it  made it super fast and easy to put up.  Once I turned the power back on and opened the ring app, it found the floodlight and connected it immediately to the same network as my stickup camera.  Could not be simpler and I could not be more pleased.  The reason that I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that you can not turn the light on with Alexa.  Alexa will announce motion and will show the camera's view on Alexa enabled screens, but you can not tell Alexa to turn the light on and off.  Connection to the device from my fire tv is almost immediate.  My stick up cam would often not connect or would take forever.  However the lack of light control  is a bit of a pain because I do not always have my phone on me when I am home.  You can control the light in the ring app, but Amazon really needs to do a deeper integration given that Ring is an Amazon company.  To me the ability to turn the lights on and off easily is a big deal.",Excellent device
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Apr 2020,CL,"Very poor as a security system. The design has a long lag time between detecting motion and sending an alert (2-3s) and then an even longer lag time once you click on an event to see a live view. In total, the lag can easily be 5-10s which is enough time for an intruder to break in before you could even see them on the camera and turn on the siren. The night vision is good but only in the center of the field of view as it is limited by what appears to be a single emitter (infrared light for night vision is like a single light bulb in the center instead of two lights pointing in two directions to light up more area). It leaves questions if the motion detection even works on the outer region of the field of view since it uses pixel comparisons for detecting motion. Since only the center is visible at night, motion may only be detecting in the center unless the light turns on to illuminate more area. Be sure that the light setting is more sensitive than the motion otherwise it will not see motion at night except in the center of the image due to the limited view in night vision mode. The motion detection system also has flaws. It is very apparent that it is dependent on the height of installation. I have two of these and one is mounted higher in the front of the house than the one on the back of the house. It takes a much larger object to trigger motion the higher it is mounted. They should have designed it better to include some simple range finding to truly determine the size of an object that is moving for their people only mode of detection. The picture quality is good and the app has nice features but being someone who designs electronic equipment, I find their overall hardware and software design to be very poorly done for a security application.",Poor performance as a security system

Pretty bad with audio. Actually it is awful for audio. Also, if you need to use the alarm on it.... You will be dead before you can figure out how to turn it on.

Every time someone loses something. But if you try to share real crime on it, it offends someone and will get blocked.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jun 2020,Jeff L.,"I have had mine for a little over a year now. Mine is installed at my back patio and has been working very well, but with some gripes. Firstly, I wish the Alexa skill allowed you to turn the floodlights on. You can turn them on with the Ring app, but it's inconvenient when you don't have your phone nearby, and even then you'd have to unlock the phone, load up the app, and click through a few steps to turn it on. Secondly, the people only mode doesn't work. Motion detection has been working very well, even at night. The problem is it might be too good, or rather the software can't distinguish what is a person and what is not. It still goes off on cats, raccoons, skunks, tiny little spiders, and the edge of a canvas flapping in the wind. I had to turn off alerts at night or I'd never get any sleep. But that kind of defeats the purpose when I want to be alerted if a person is there in the middle of the night. It still records, but I'm not allowed with it off. There's just too many false positives because the firmware still needs a lot of work. I have videos in my history every 5 to 10 minutes on some nights of literally nothing but a thin barely visible strand of spider webbing blowing across the camera. People only mode indeed. My ring doorbell pro also suffers from the same problem with car headlights, cats and deer setting off the alerts despite it being set to people only mode. That said, Ring support has been very good and helpful, providing me with a replacement when one of the floodlight lamps broke without any hassle. Actual motion detection is superb with picking up motion in the defined zones. The problem is just with it not being able to filter them properly to only alert me with what's relevant. Picture quality for daytime is great and for night vision, it's decent. I can make out plenty of detail of anything on my patio or things going by just beyond it. It's not blurry or anything. I do plan on getting another floodlight cam for my driveway, but I kind of want the ""people only"" detection to be improved first.",Good but with some flaws.

I have a Stick-Up Cam with solar panel, a Video Doorbell Pro, and two of these Ring Floodlight Cameras, so I'm familiar with the products and their various quirks. PROS: - Highly-sensitive motion detection - Acceptably-bright floodlight capability (about 70% as bright as a typical 150W incandescent I regularly used in my outdoor motion floods) - Easy setup - Set the sensitivity to ""People Only"" and our dog can come and go without setting off the alarm. Well done, Ring! - Programmable motion zones allow you to block out moving objects like wind chimes. - Motion alert scheduling means you can turn off alerts during the day. CONS: - $99/year for cloud recording feels a bit steep - No way to turn off motion activation on lights (i.e., if you turn off the lights in the app, any motion will turn them back on) - Activating the camera with a Live View sometimes takes a LONG time (even with strong wifi) - Motion alert scheduling doesn't seem to allow for multiple ""motion-on"" and ""motion-off"" periods during the same day.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Aug 2019,Judd Clarence,"I was at first really impressed. Easy setup, clear picture, great app to check in and see what is going on with live view, etc.  Then after a couple months, the quality of everything started deteriorating. The color of my picture is now varying shades of pink. There is no part that is full color. It started going pink in one corner and gradually migrated across the whole picture. Audio quality was the first to go within a few weeks. Now I cant even have a one sentence exchange with the person at my door. They can't make out what I'm saying and vice versa.  The picture gets worse every week. When I call customer service I get the runaround - like the problems are all my fault, not defective construction on components. If they have such poor quality or high defective rates then they should offer full replacements at no cost.  Also - don't bother getting the chime. they don't work and are fraught with problems!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2018,Tantor Unk Mangani,"The hardware setup went very smoothly. The camera and lights and mounting hardware seem well designed and sturdy. The app is just so-so and hooking the camera up to WiFi was a little challenging. The first time I went through the installation process, the app recognized the camera location and appeared to be working, but when I got to the part where it asked for which color the blinking light was, that's where it started to fall apart. I couldn't tell which color it was or if it was lit at all and there was a significant delay between what the camera was saying and what the app was showing me, so when I hit the reset button as instructed by the voice, the app had already moved on to the next screen, (or something to that effect).  I restarted the setup part of the app three more times and it wouldn't recognize the location and nothing else was working. It no longer recognized my WiFi and basically stopped working altogether. It told me installation was unsuccessful. I finally ended up turning off my phone and restarting it.  When I re-opened the app, the camera was recognized and it actually worked. I like most of it, but when it tells me that my 30 day free trial of Ring Pro (or whatever it's called, I can't remember the name) is going to expire, I select 'More info' to find out what that is all about and it just asks me for a credit card number. It doesn't tell me what I'm purchasing nor how much it will cost. Also, when I get motion alerts, I open the app and I am able to activate the camera only about 75% of the time. It has to go through a long series of initializing procedures before it tells me that the camera couldn't establish a connection. I have no problem with other WiFi devices located throughout the house. And 50% of the motion alert events are not recorded. I'll get an alert but when I open the app to see what the motion was, it won't have a recording and many times won't even show that an alert was logged even though I had received an alert on my phone. It's a good start but i think some improvements need to be made before i would purchase another Ring product.","Camera is nice, app not so great."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2018,Joe S.,"I'm updating after a few weeks of working with Ring on trying to figure out why I've had so many problems.  I was originally planning on returning the camera, but what I can only label as their ""one star Amazon-review panic police"" reached out to me and helped me through extensive troubleshooting on the device.  While it still doesn't work as advertised, its better than it was with some settings changes.  The biggest issues seem to be with the Live View feature and making sure you set up your motion zones properly.  Ring also sent me a new floodlight cam just to rule out a bad unit... unfortunately that didn't fix the issue and required me to climb up on a ladder in the freezing cold for essentially no reason. The key takeaways I've discovered: - As best as I can figure, the device just has a lousy networking stack, and doesn't respond well to anything but a near perfect wifi signal (which in almost any neighborhood or outside of a house is going to be a challenge.) - I installed an access point literally on the wall directly behind the device, less than four feet away, and the Ring still thinks the signal is only barely adequate.  My Logitech Circle 2 cameras, however, are happy as clams with the exact same access point. - The crystal clear videos they show of people in your driveway on the commercials are a made up farce.  You'll never see that kind of clarity out of this camera, even in broad daylight. - I've found that when alerts trigger and you try to bring up Live View, the App often simply hangs. You end up having to wait 30-40 seconds for it to finish recording whatever alert and then it sort of unfreezes. - Based on what the Ring folks told me, always use multiple motion zones.  If you stick with the default full-screen motion zone, you'll end up with loads of false positives and/or missed motion events, because it is apparently just too much for the camera to fully process. - The light trigger and the camera motion triggers are not related to one another.  The light triggers can be difficult to get right. - You may end up having to angle the camera down farther than ""parallel with the ground"" as the instructions state.  I was ending up with ridiculous mis-triggers on the lights from a street nearly 40 feet away every time a car went by even on the lowest settings.  Changing the angle improved this dramatically. - Ring's support (at least the support folks who respond to angry Amazon reviews) is really great... but I can't speak to their normal support channels.  However... I believe the product itself needs improvement.  I don't have these problems with any of my Logitech Circle 2 cameras (that run perfectly on the same wifi that the Rings seem to have so much trouble with.) - I'm going to be keeping the device, but I'm still far from thrilled with it.  But when it works, it works acceptably.  I had no idea that I have a cat, a fox and a pack of deer that seem very fond of my front yard at 2am... and its nice to know when your Amazon driver casually tosses a package on your front porch and can't be troubled to ring the bell or knock on the door. -- Original Review: I'm likely returning this.  The Ring Doorbell is terrific, but this thing is a piece of junk - its hard to believe its even from the same company. - It constantly disconnects and disables its motion alerts when it does. - Motion detection is lousy both in the camera and in the light motion sensor. - Constantly misfires on detections even when you define motion areas and set sensitivity to the lowest settings.  On the flip side, it misses BLATANT motion events, like a car pulling into a driveway or leaving. - Wifi is flaky as hell and since it is limited to 2.4ghz ONLY... you basically have to put an access point outside or right on an outside-facing wall of your house in order to get things to meet what the device thinks is minimum wifi signal strength. I've put way too much time and effort into troubleshooting this thing and will likely invest in a more traditional motion light and a standalone camera instead.  This thing is useless and buggy... it needs either POE or 5GHz and a total reworking of the system before I will even remotely recommend it.","Far from perfect, but when it works its useful"

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2019,T,"TL;DR bad video, motion detection, bad options and functions, but great lights. Not worth the money, especially with the monthly fee you'll have to pay, and no internal storage option. First off, motion detection is temperamental, works sometimes and doesn't work some other times, for instance, if you had a snow day and someone was walking on your ""zone"" that you setup, that person happened to be wearing white, the motion detector wouldn't detect anything. To further clarify, this is when you use ""detect people only"" option. You might think that switching to non-people would fix it but you're wrong, any sensitivity would trigger the motive detector even through reflections of cars or tree shadows on your zone and it will give you false alarms almost 24/7 which is useless and annoying at the very least. Dangerous at the worst because from the sheer number of alarms you'll stop checking activities which might leave you vulnerable to any home threats (porch pirate, intruders, etc), the motion also gets triggered by flags outside your house, so you have no option to keep your American flag at anywhere near your ""zone"" even if it covers a very important zone. Only option is to exclude that zone, which is again, very dangerous. When you get an alarm and click on it in your phone, it takes anywhere from 30 to 120 second to open the app live, sometimes minutes before is reveals the video, which by that time a porch pirate would've stolen your packages already.  Bicycles are ""too fast"" for the motion detector and the footage will always show you the last second or two of bicycle before it disappears from your view. That goes to show you the so-called developers of this app are not professional enough to know how to code the app to go back in time 10 or 15 second with time with faster objects after detecting the motion. Similarly, joggers and runners are too fast and trigger the same issues with the app. Imagine a porch pirate that comes running, gets your package and flees the scene before the app detects any of that.  If 100 people marked my review helpful, I'm willing to upload a video pretending to be the pirate and running away with my own package in real time to show you how the app handles it.  Please keep in mind I'm also using the chime pro signal repeater for WiFi and I have 2.4GHz and 5Ghz. However, the camera isn't a dual band and it only supports the slow 2.4GHz. In other words, signal and speed is optimized in my house but the camera and the app information relay are too slow in reality. The resolution is really bad and almost useless, can't detect faces, can't see more details, license plates, even when my car is within feet away from the ""HD 1080P"" camera. In other words, your guess is much better than the camera when it comes to identifying people or objects (cars) in your driveway. Without a monthly subscription the app is even more useless because you can't have an option of an internal storage. Lights are really good, very nice bright lights and that's about the only thing I like about the entire purchase, however,I could've easily bought lights without spending $$$s of dollars on this not so promising system. With the dysfunctional system, you might be led to choose the option they pitch for which is a home monitoring, in which a team of theirs monitor your house 24/7 but I personally don't trust them with anything, they can't develop a normal app with basic AI, they can't earn any money from me as a result. Sirens are good and loud, easy to control through the app but you'll almost never have to use them, hopefully. Without WiFi, there's no option for Ethernet connection, which is very dangerous and makes you vulnerable for exploitation. This must be an option in any wireless camera.",READ BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!!

RING pretty much is the perfect solution for all of these issues. The cameras/doorbell are pretty affordable, they plug right into existing power lines and connect to your wifi network. The installation does require some work. The flood light cams basically plug into your outside light boxes. The doorbell cam may require more work depending on how old your house is. I had to move the doorbell cam up about a foot and had to install a new 16v transformer. You do not have to use your existing doorbell, you can use the one that comes with the doorbell cam. I like my doorbell and wanted to keep it so that was a little more work. The flood cams took about 30min to install. The doorbell took half a day but that was because of my choice to use my existing wired doorbell.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Sep 2020,Just Jonny,"I love ring products, and their security system. I have virtually no complaints about that... But to require a modern junction box when there is literally no reason they can't include an adapter to an old square metal junction box is a joke. If this thing needed a neutral wire I'd understand, because I've run into that trying to install smart light fixtures, and I get the issue there, they need constant power otherwise no dice. This situation is just laziness, not to mention we are dealing with a 300 dollar floodlight. In the end I was able to reverse the screws on the old junction adapter from our previous 20 dollar costco driveway light, tighten the screws with pliers, and it fit perfectly. Had I thought there was a legitimate reason for this needing a modern junction box I might have not gone through with it, but I looked it over, there was none. The old school junction boxes are solid thick metal, and are probably more durable than these modern thin metal ones. Plus, our house is solid brick, meaning it would have required knocking out part of the outdoor brick. I guess my complaint is why can every other run of the mill 20 dollar outdoor light come with proper adaption kits, but ring thinks they are above it? Maybe they don't trust people to install it in a safe place, I can get that, but this is a location protected from the rain by the roof.  One more major gripe, zero orange wire cover things, I don't know if I've bought anything, ever, that was electrical that didn't come with those. If you're going to sell a 300 dollar floodlight ring, you need to get it together. Lastly, after being hooked up, it worked flawlessly.

The two spot lights are very bright and are more than sufficient to illuminate my driveway and back yard. They adjust easily and can be positioned pretty much however you need them. One note, the set up is not designed to be mounted under and eve or in the “upside down” orientation. A slight modification can be done which will allow this to happen, but is not recommended by ring. The camera itself give a nice clear picture and has lots of options, sensitivity, and motion zones to play with. The spot light function also has some settings, but I’ve found at times they’ve been too sensitive. Sometimes my lights kick on from the tarp covering my grill catching some wind. Nothing major, but just a note. Also, you can sync your ring devices so that when one triggers (light and or video), other nearby devices will do the same. The feature seems to work most of the time, but I’ve found it to be delayed or sometimes not work at all. Not a deal breaker but something they can work on. Overall, 5 stars. I have a lot of experience with cameras, including many of the most popular, and ring is a solid offering with some unique features.",Bright lights and crisp clear camera
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2017,mrclean5,"I've been doing my homework on the wireless security cameras available for several months. My home is located on a corner lot with the driveway located to the side of the house, so we have no idea when someone pulls in. My wife and I are members of a dog rescue, so we always have several dogs that get very excited when someone comes to the door. The Floodlight Cam has been a great addition, now we have an opportunity to wrangle up the dogs before the doorbell rings and raises the excitement level. The Floodlight Cam was the obvious choice for me for several reasons. I already had a motion sensing floodlight facing the driveway so it would be an easy swap out, which it was. The hardest part was removing what seemed like a full tube of silicone sealant that the previous homeowner felt necessary to apply around the base of the old unit. After that it was pretty straightforward, everything needed for the installation is in the box. My next piece of criteria was the video quality, the ring video quality is exceptional in both daylight and unlighted conditions. Another concern that I had was the operating temperatures, since winter temps here can dip below zero. This camera is temperature rated -22 through 120 F, the nearest competitor is rated down to -5. Lastly cloud storage Ring offers 60 days of video storage for $30/Yr, Nest offers 30 days storage for $100/Yr. For me, the choice was obvious and I couldn't be happier with my decision.",The whole package
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jun 2018,Adam Howell,"This really needs the ability to save video to a local network source.  What happens if a storm knocks out my internet?  As best I can tell, no video will be saved without an internet connection.  I would like to be able to archive video to my own server, but have not found a way to do that yet. Physical installation was about as difficult as any other exterior light.  Run a length of Romex from any nearby outlet (not a switched outlet or light) to where you will mount the Ring.  I used the garage door opener outlet, since it was closest.  Open the garage door before you start, for light, and then turn off the breaker to that outlet.  From inside the garage, on a ladder, I opened the outlet box, pulled out the outlet without disconnecting it, and plugged the stripped ends of Romex wire into the unused wire ports.  Push the other end of the length of Romex through that outlet box, into the attic.  I then reinstalled the outlet and cover plate. Move the ladder to wherever you want the Ring to be located.  Drill a 3/4"" hole for the Romex to enter the electrical box.  I used a 4"" round weatherproof box.  For bonus points, try to match color of the electrical box to your exterior paint, or to the color of your Ring floodlight.  Make sure it has a 1/2"" outlet hole in the back (many have 5 outlets: 4 on the sides and one in the back).  Install plugs in any electrical box ports you do not use (coat the threads with silicone or Teflon tape).  Screw a short length of 1/2"" electrical conduit to the back outlet of the electrical box.  Push the conduit through the 3/4"" hole you drilled, and mount the electrical box.  Attach the provided adapter plate to that exterior box. I then climbed up into the attic, stapled the Romex to trusses, and pushed the Romex out through the box.  Back outside, I climbed the ladder again, and connected the Romex to the Ring with the provided wire nuts.  Lastly, I mounted the Ring to the adapter plate! The WiFi setup was not easy, but not particularly difficult.  There is a small LED in the white motion sensor that blinks to let you know the current status.  Since that LED is trying to shine through white plastic, it was very difficult to discern its color during the daytime (when most people will be installing this).  You use the Ring app to connect to the floodlight, then select your WiFi network, and provide credentials.  After that, it SHOULD connect. I have an electrical engineering degree and a computer science degree, but still spent about 20 minutes on this step.  I am still not sure what missed step or change caused it to eventually connect.  In my opinion, the app should tell me the status of the floodlight.  Even after the handoff from the app to WiFi, the application should do some snooping to see if the Ring is trying to connect on the WiFi channel.  It's not that difficult to snoop 802.11, especially if you are already on the network. If you mount this up high, make sure you have someone to hold the ladder for you.  Pro-tip: get a helper that knows CPR and can dial 911!","Great, but lacks the ability to save video locally"

I recently purchased this device to add to my Ring doorbell for additional security around my home, especially with the camera and floodlight combo, and really wanted it to keep an eye on my truck in the driveway.  What I got was more than that I could have asked for, and something that I did not even think about using it for. The other day my grandson was over and playing in the backyard with my wife.  This is a completely fenced in yard with a high privacy fence.  My wife came inside to get a drink and then go right back out, but in those couple of minutes, my 3 year old grandson figured out how to open the side gate, and then ran around to the front of my house, unknown to either my wife or myself.  About that time I received an alert from my Ring floodlight, so I immediately opened the Ring app on my phone and viewed a video of my grandson running around to the front of our house.  We both immediately ran out front and brought him back in, (at which time he got quite the lecture from us), but thank goodness this device was installed and alerted us!  I was thinking of security in the form of protecting property when I purchased this device, but obviously from this experience, the uses for this type of device go well beyond that.  It is super simple to install, (like all Ring products so far), you just need to have the WiFi signal strength to reach where you install it, and it just works!  I highly recommend this product, no home should be without it!",Simple Security - No home should be without this!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2018,Penelope,"UPDATE: After a visit from the cable internet provider -- now that the upload and download speeds are sufficiently fast enough, the app connection to the live camera view is much more reliable. There is still a 2-3 second delay but that's preferable to not being able to connect at all half the time. Before purchasing, make sure your WiFi signal (either from your main router or with a range extender) will be strong enough and test your download/upload speeds from the location where you will be placing the camera will be sufficiently fast. Ring recommends just faster than 1Mbps up/down but the faster the better to eliminate connection lags. Also, I really like that it lets you define motion zone alerts -- I was getting a lot of false alerts due to a car cover cloth in view of the camera that would move around when windy even though it was on People only mode. But by being able to define motion zones, I was able to just outline the areas around and excluding the cloth. PREVIOUS REVIEW: I just installed my camera 2 days ago and found that I had to purchase an additional WiFi extender (for ~$50) to have a strong enough signal to use with this outdoor device. The floodlight is located only about 30 feet from the router (which is upstairs). The other issue I am having is that when it sends me a motion alert, I am frequently encountering problems connecting to the device from the app, so I can't actually view the motion alert incident until the app is finally able to make a connection which has ranged from 30 seconds later to several minutes later. So I have concerns right now that in the event of a critical motion alert, the app connection would fail, which could be problematic. Even though I normally have pretty fast internet, I was seeing extremely low upload speeds on the extender, I called my internet provider to see what they could do, and I'm not sure if they did anything, but upload speeds are currently much higher and my app connection to device connection is much better and smoother. This is the first security camera I've ever used so I don't really have anything else to compare it to, other than what I've read online. This camera only records when there is motion vs. other cameras like Nest which continuously records -- but so far, in my less than 24 hours of testing, the motion detector has performed reliably. I won't know if non-continuous recording will be an issue until it is an issue. As for the quality of the recordings -- I'm a little disappointed with the night time recording. From other footage that I've seen, I was expecting it to be better. But it's actually quite pixelated and during my test I had on a tee-shirt with contrasting lettering on it, and you wouldn't have been able to tell there was lettering on the shirt at all based on the footage. The color accuracy isn't too bad. I was also told by neighbor that if the camera gets ripped out or vandalized, that Ring would actually replace it for free. I haven't verified that yet, but if that's accurate, that would be great as my junction box is located at a height that is easy for someone to vandalize and was a concern that I had before purchasing. All in all, between the additional equipment I had to purchase and having to deal with my internet provider, and the less-than-desired clarity on the night time recordings -- installing + getting the product to run smoothly has not been a piece of cake so far. I'm happier with having this device then nothing at all, but am wondering if I picked the best equipment given what's available in the DIY security market. I'll give this device another week or two before deciding if I should keep it. I think it's going to mostly come down to whether I start to experience connection problems again and how easy it is to resolve that. Knowing what I know now, I would suggest doing the following before purchasing: - Test the internet connection speed in the location where you'll be installing the camera so you know if you'll need to amplify your connection speed. And then test again to make sure the extender connection speed will be adequate. - Decide how much clarity you need in your recordings. Do you need to be able to make out lettering on a person's shirt, particularly at night? - Are you OK with only recording when there is motion sensed? Or do you need continuous recording?  There does not appear to be an on-demand recording functionality either, which would be a really nice feature.",Had to purchase a WiFi extender

Since the Ring community is very helpful, we reported it to them and the local police. The motion sensor is spot on and alerts even the slightest movement. We have been alerted from a fox in the driveway and it even catches wild bunnies clearly! Then the floodlight would turn on and scare predators away. It also has a large field of view.

But if a ring style motion light is something that will work for you (meaning you get a decent wifi signal where you want to stick this thing up and you don't mind ring image quality) this is certainly something to consider. I'd say that the image quality is actually a step up from the ring pro, but you aren't going to be grabbing cell-phone quality images of faces walking by. The cell phone notices, and walkie talkie style communication are a bit of a gimmick if you ask me (staying true to the ring brand I suppose).

However, my primary reason was so I could watch my children get on the school bus.  I looked at several options on Amazon and took a chance on this one.  I had an electrician install the light above my garage entrance. He was able to do so with minimal trouble (had to run an electrical line). Once installed, it took several attempts to get the Ring to connect with WiFi. There is an app that must first be downloaded. The app walked me through each attempt.  Once connected, there were no issues. This light looks respectable. The picture quality is excellent for my needs. The sound through the camera is clear. The app allows me to set the lights to motion and to control the length of time they stay on. I can also turn the lights on and off with the app. The app will record and save motion for a specific period of time. You can chose to pay an annual small fee or a larger fee to save videos and have outside monitoring or pay no fee at all.  I will mention that the motion sensors are very good.

If your guys working on improving the app can’t figure that out, they should be employed in a different field. I need something that works for nighttime. This doesn't give clear nighttime pictures. I've tried with lights “on” and lights “off”. Lights “off” gives better picture but defeats the purpose eh? Daytime is good. But the app is too frustrating.

Look on your social media neighborhood crime watch pages - I’ll bet there are plenty of ring pics and videos. We use them to warn others of suspicious activity etc.... do your own research.

I have to say their support people are the best I ever worked with however the sound never worked to my satisfaction.  They even sent out a replacement unit and I was not happy with that one either so I sent it back.  I am keeping the original unit however as the motion detection and video work fine for me and for a flooodlight cam, sound is secondary.  If this had been a doorbell, I would have returned it. I have no issues with motion detection at night as some have said.  If anything, it's too good. I have had it trigger on a rabbit or a cat walking through at night and it was NOT set at maximum sensitivity.  It will often trigger on cars passing at night which I believe is because of the headlights.  It does not trigger on cars during the day.  The car headlights will sometimes reflect on a neighbor's window and I think that is what triggers it.  This is a real PITA.  I am not sure how to correct this.  The motion zones are not totally exact and there is some error in them.  I did not expect them to be perfect however. I also think the microphone is way too sensitive, passing cars sound like freight trains and it picks up stuff I can't even hear with my ears.  I mentioned to ring that some way to adjust the gain on the mic might be nice. Others have mentioned this and I knew this going in but this is a minus in my book.  Without a cloud subscription from Ring, you cannot save any videos making the cam somewhat useless.  A micro SD card slot to record on would greatly improve the value of this device IMHO.  My next camera will have to have a local recording option, even if it's just a 24 hour loop.  With Ring if you lose your Internet, this cam is totally useless.  At least if it had local recording you could still get something. (End of update) Original review starts here: The setup was very easy, simply replace old floodlight with this one. At 1st I thought it was perfect, all seemed OK but I was only checking the video in the daytime.  It is not all that good at night but still adequate enough, it did detect a rabbit running across the yard at night.  After spending a few days playing with it I noticed the video was not as good as it should be.  My RSSI (WiFi signal strength) was -60 and while that that should be enough I decided to move my router to a better place.  Now the RSSI is -35 and the video is better however the audio still cuts in and out.  My cable speed is 110/10 and the wifi speed at the camera is 75 down and about 9 up. I will give it a few more days as I play with settings but my guess is I will be returning it.  I had high hopes for this device but seems this is not to be.",Poor sound...
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2020,D. Bratman,"This is my 3rd outdoor Ring device. I have the Ring doorbell pro and another floodlight cam like this one over the garage. I installed the doorbell device and this one. I happened to have an electrician here for some work a month ago and I had him remove the existing outdoor light over the garage and replace it with the Ring spotlight. Seventy-five dollars well spent. I installed the Ring doorbell pro myself as there was an existing doorbell there. It’s not difficult if you have the space but KEEP THE LITTLE TOOLS in a place where you can find them again. You may need them. The Ring doorbell was a great introduction in how to set up and use Ring systems in general and set the motion zones. Too far out and you get lots of alerts. Also, as with all Ring systems, all units alert and show you who’s there (or not there) on your cell phone. So if you want to use it all night you have to keep your cell phone on. Now, installation. There’s a neat video on YouTube about installing a Ring floodlight cam like this one in what seems like 5 minutes. This must be in a perfect world. It took me quite a bit longer and I wondered if I should have brought the electrician back, even though I’m perfectly capable to installing a light fixture. NOTE: Turn the power off at the breaker box to be safe. This spotlight replaced an existing light on my deck (If there weren’t already wires there I DEFINITELY would have needed an electrician). Removing the light was easy and the box was there already but a bit rusted. Also, it was slightly turned so I could not get the Ring mounting bracket on straight. Off to Home Depot for another box. Okay done. Now, the instructions show just a few wires coming out of the Ring but there are actually a ton. Not to worry, you only need the 2 of them with bear wiring at the end—the black and white—and the ground wire. Make sure you wrap that copper ground wire around the green screw so it’s grounded and you don’t start a fire. My kit did not come with a green screw so I bought one at HD. In their video, they casually mention it without showing this step but it’s important. When I tried to put the fixture up the screws they gave me did not fit through the holes in the electrical box I had, so I have to find some that did. With that done, I connected the wires and had to jam them into the electrical box, then screw the whole fixture on. Not easy as there are a lot of wires not shown in the instructions. You really have to push it on tight. Connecting the unit to your phone app is easy, as long as you scan the bar code on the spotlight. It’s in the back somewhere. Now, the last Ring Spotlight I bought came with a plug in chime/wireless internet range extender called the Ring Chime Pro. This unit that I bought from Amazon did not include it. That’s okay, I already had one, but they are $50 if you don’t and need or want one. Lastly, since this was connected to an existing light, there was the concern that shutting off the switch would disengage the floodlight cam, which it would. I bought a switch guard, which covers the switch so no one accidentally turns it off, though it CAN be turned off if you like because there is an opening on the side. It just prevents accidentally or shutting off the light switch, which is my customary habit when I come inside at night. To install it you just remove the light switch plate, put this over the switch, and use the same screws to install the guard and plate at the same time. I would give this system 4 stars because having to keep your phone on all the time is a pain and there are plenty of “false alarms,” meaning an insect can set it off. But I’m giving this one a 3 simple because it’s not all fun and games installing it, though they’d like you to think it is. If you’re not handy/patient, just hire someone. The system itself is worth having.","Great to have, can be a pain to install."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Sep 2017,Pirate2240,"My husband and I have the Ring Doorbell Pro and love the idea that we can see who is coming before they ever get close enough to our home, but based on the layout and a recent break in at our neighbors we wanted to increase what we could see and catch on camera without ever needing to be home. We opted for the Ring Floodlight Cam because I love the sense of lighting up the area to anyone who gets close enough, but also capturing anything they do on camera. I love that we can even talk to anyone without them being away we are at home or not. Without knowing it when I ordered two of them, I didn't realize they came with alarms that we can activate anywhere. The ease of setting these up and installing them made adding them to our driveaway and backyard a place we can now view from anywhere. I love seeing that we can also protect a portion of our neighbors yard as well with the degree of visibility depending on where you set this up. I can even see when our daughter gets home to ensure my family is back home! The only downside for us is that occasionally the camera function doesn't give us a live view at times, but seeing as it is recorded, we can always go back and view it a few minutes later. I would easily give this a 4.5 out of 5 stars and love that I can take this with me wherever we move.",The best investment to our security needs for our home and NO contracts!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2020,Bruce S. Gruenbaum,"This product had me on the fence because of the reviews. I replaced the two lights on each side of my double garage with two of these, expecting I was going to return them. I won't be returning them. They work. Well. But they're not perfect. Installation was a piece of cake. I had both lights installed and running within 45 minutes of my Amazon delivery. The only issue was WiFi connectivity. The reviews I read had cautioned me that may be an issue, so I moved a mesh point to the garage and both cameras were working in a few minutes. Our home is on a cul-de-sac as part of an HOA, and I wanted a camera that could alert me if someone came onto my property, but record any activity on the street directly in front of the property without alerting me. The idea of ""motion zones"" sounded like it would do the job. Yes and no. I have the two spotlights configured as a set with my Ring Video Doorbell Pro. The three cameras work well together and I have managed to configure them so that one camera alerts while the other camera triggers recordings that don't require alerting. One camera is set to alert if anyone comes onto the property. The other is set to trigger recordings. The idea of being able to group two cameras into a ""light zone"" overcame a limitation of the cameras that do not allow you to set different zones to trigger different behavior. Now that I have them set up the way that I want, I only get notified when I really want to know. That's pretty neat. I have all three connected to my WiFi network that uses an Amplifi mesh network. All three cameras maintain a 70%+ network connection, but that required that I purchase a meshpoint and put it in my garage. 2.4GHz for these cameras is a real loss, especially as they are outside my garage that has a Chamberlain door opener with a 2.4GHz WiFi connection that messes with their connectivity. I knew going into this that I was going to end up signing up for the Ring Protect Plus Plan. Yeah, it's $100 per year, but that beats the snot out of the $50 per month I have been paying ADT for alarm monitoring, AND I get to keep as much video as I want. I just wish that the web site UI was more useful. Searching for videos is pathetic. Ring needs to spend some time talking to users to find out what kind of functionality they would like to see on the web site, and PLEASE provide the ability to stream the live feed from the cameras. Lastly, I LOVE the way you can configure motion zones on these cameras. having a polygon that I can shape the way I like is much better than the stupid zone mechanism that Ring has put in the stick up cams. I just wish that I could create zones for a camera and designate what I want triggered as a result of motion in the zone. Let me create a zone that triggers recording. A separate one that triggers alerts. A third that turns the lights on. That, combined with the improvements to the website would make this product perfect. All round, now that I have had the cameras running for a few days, I have got what I was looking for from them. It took some judicious thought to get them configured effectively, but I am satisfied with the outcome. I am ordering a third one for my back patio to light up the backyard.",Solid product. Works well. Needs additional software functionality.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2017,Russ,"Even with current flaws (I had trouble getting strong enough wifi signal), I’m impressed with the concept of the “Ring Floodlight Cam”. Motion light, and camera (day / night) seem to be very high quality. Record, speaker, and alarm are a bonus. The ring app is easy to navigate and simple. I researched what’s available and found two similar products. Neither were flood lights and I had doubts about quality. Since I already had experience with the Ring product installation, I decided to give it a try on my house. I even considered the doorbell instead, but I really wanted the motion flood light feature, and I felt like I had the perfect location for it since it’s mounted high enough no one could possibly reach it without a ladder. To my amazement this one works very well. Anyway, it’s only been in operation a week. If you want I’ll let you know performance status in a couple of weeks, but so far it’s doing everything I want it to do. I can live view my driveway, I get alerts during the day when someone walks up to my house, flood light comes on at night when someone walks in zones I created. I can only offer positive reviews of the Ring Floodlight Cam. I give customer support a 10. Next I want a ring light to replace the exterior light outside my back door.",Great product support.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Apr 2019,Pam K,So I’ve had two spotlight cams mounted on my garage for over a year.  I run the orbi mesh routers with one of the satellites in the garage interior.  Since the initial connection I have had zero connectivity issues. I live in farm country but am fortunate enough to have an isp that can provide 10 MBPS which has proven more than adequate for the ring along with 27 other devices in my Alexa smart home.  We lose power frequently out here but when the generator kicks in the cameras reboot immediately and with no issues. The only frustration comes with the motion detector activating by cars passing when it is snowing heavily - a light reflective issue.  Oh yeah and the spider that decided to check it out one night.  There does appear to be a lag on the phone at times but the recording starts on time. This is a phone issue since we have horrible service out here.  I’m not sure we even have 3g out here. 4g is a distant dream. I’ll be adding two more onto the other side of the horse barn once I hook up a bridge. I will update this after that installation to provide info on that set up. All things told I am extremely pleased with the performance of these cameras,Cameras work great - phone has the lag
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2020,RealReviewsBYTruGeek,"It's hard to write review for this product.  I almost gave it 1 star as I bought 2 refurbished, both of them developed ""over sensitive"" motion detection issues that basically caused the floodlight to remain on the entire night, and attract tons of bugs. If you have such problem with yours,  don't bother messing with the Motion sensitivity settings or worse yet, waste your time talking to support, just pack it up and return it and buy the latest release new version. The new version worked as promised for 2 weeks now, and the motion sensor comes on when there is people or animals, but will not be set off by phantoms, so 5-stars for the new version. Picture is clear and no dropped connections, and the lights are bright. I'm not confident with giving it a 5-star yet, as one of the two refurbished unit was defective from day one, but the other one worked for 28 days before the same motion sensor issue emerged.  So fingers crossed and I will update if the new unit also goes bad. The new unit looks the same, but the set-up flashing white light pattern is different.  One way to tell if your unit has the new software/firmware is the new one will triggers the ""join the Ring Setup"" wifi network prompt during setup, whereas the old version or the refurbished unit simply asks you to select your home wifi and enter password. In any case, the new one is worth the $60 difference compared to the refurb, just for the time and aggravation saved. As aside note, the same logic is not true for other Ring products, the refurbished Ring Doorbell Pro (with orange reset button instead of the black button for the new ones)  and the refurbished stick-up outdoor plug-in camera worked well.  I will review them separately.",Buy New as it is different from previous and refurbished version
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Aug 2019,Roger the Lion Hearted,"I've had this about two months, and it's triggered flawlessly: whenever someone walks down the side of our house I get notified, and the video stream - day or night - is clear.  It was easy to adjust so that it's triggered by people but not by bushes waving in the wind. However pets and possums (!) still trigger it. It doesn't happen often and I find it amusing to watch kitties wander around, so I have not tried to adjust further. The lights trigger on when taking the trash out at night - very useful. The installation process was straightforward. We also have a Ring doorbell so it was an easy decision to spring for the $100/year ""Plus"" plan that provides 60 days of cloud video storage. A few minor quibbles: when I get a motion notification on my phone I'll go to the app and can see the live view, but that may not show what triggered the motion, as the person or creature may have moved out of camera range. And the recording is not available for approximately a minute. Even then, sometimes I have to back out of the ""Side camera"" page in the app, then go back into it in order to see the recording in the timeline. Interestingly, sometimes the video is available in ""gear/Event History"" even though it has not yet shown up on the main timeline page (the one with the live view at top). As a result, depending on how fast someone or something is moving, and how quickly you get into the Ring app, it may take a minute or so to see what triggered the motion detection. Even then you may have to go back and forth a few times because otherwise the Ring app does not seem to want to update the timeline with newly recorded videos. So worst case is it make take one minute - plus some fumbling around in the app - to see what triggered the motion. The recording - but not live view - are available on the ring web site. Sometimes in the past I've been able to access a recording from my phone but playback didn't work reliably on the web site, but I haven't had this problem in a while Despite these minor shortcomings I would definitely recommend, and would buy again.",Almost flawless!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,J.Roe,"We have a Ring alarm system but had no camera. I picked this flood light cam up when it was on sale pre-Christmas. I am not an electrician or much or a handy man. I can watch YouTube videos and if the job does not require more than your standard box of tools or a work crew I can generally figure it out. So I’m not dumb = check. Am I super handy and take on all times of home projects with reckless abandon = absolutely not. That said - it comes with all the tools you need. Heck, it even comes with about 25 additional screws of various lengths and threadings to match up to your pre-existing floodlight. I didn’t need any of them, but Ring’s got your back on that even if you literally don’t need them on your back. Seriously Ring, back off!! In the end it was about $7.36 they probably could’ve saved but let’s not fault them for trying to have you Boy Scout level prepared. Did I mention they give you instructions on how to swap the Ring floodlight cam with your existing flood lights? I did. If you read above you already know this. Who’s the dummy now??? So that is what it instructs - swapping out. If you’re inclined (and please be so inclined) to switch off your circuit breaker before attempting to do this yourself you’ll be fine. If you do not, unboxing the floodlight cam might be the last tho g you do before electrocuting yourself to death. You’ve been warned. Don’t worry, Ring will warn you too. They seriously won’t leave you alone about it. Back off already, Ring!! So you cut off the breaker, unmount the old, do some bracket finagling, twist some wires together, screw in the new Ring floodlight cam and then go and turn the power to your house back on. Don’t wait too long, milk spoils. After all that you need to download and install the Ring app on your phone (not included in the box, get your own phone) and follow the device set-up instructions - of course you will need a WiFi signal (I don’t actually care if it is yours of your neighbors, but you will need one or you just installed an overpriced flood light when you had a perfectly good one already mounted above your garage - I don’t know if yours was above the garage, I’m playing the odds here, buddy. Now you’re on my back? You should work for Ring.). Set-up is fairly easy, but can take some time to dial in what you want for alerts, sounds, notifications, motion settings, light on/off timing, who has access, etc.) There’s also tutorials on YouTube if you get stuck. Oh, crap. I forget to mention one thing. You’ll need a ladder. There was not one included in the box.",Excellent - we can’t stop watching nothing happening outside

My house is in a decent neighborhood but it pays to be safe.  So, I installed two ring flood lights out front, a ring doorbell, and two ring floodlights in the backyard.  One of the lights out front failed two months later. I got a black screen and multiple attempts to reset it via killing the power failed.  Ring was super helpful - I called their 24 hour hotline and they had a replacement unit at my door within a day (SUPERB customer service).  The customer service rep was beyond nice and helpful. A few days later, the screen went black on one of my backyard units.  I was able to restart this one.  So, they work, but you have to be prepared to restart or replace when you get that black screen of death.  This is fine when you are home, but what if you're away on vacation? Even worse, what if one fails while there is a legitimate security issue? Also, there is a bit of lag on the units so don't expect the commercials (where you see the homeowner talking to visitors in the front yard) to be realistic. These concerns notwithstanding, the motion detection works great (doesn't false but does a great job of picking up legitimate movement), the picture is crystal clear, and the lights bright and effective.

I have several different cameras around the house and this was one of the easiest to set up! I replaced my existing outdoor spotlight with this and it only took about 20-minutes.  The mounting holes seemed to be slightly off from my previous outdoor light, but this may be due to the box that is installed on my house?  That said, it was still easy to install even though everything didn't line up perfectly. Pairing the camera with my Ring system was also a breeze.  It only took a few minutes to set everything up and I had access to the camera along with all of my other ring devices. I absolutely love the motion sensor which can automatically turn the lights on.  It's just one less light I need to turn on whenever I let the dogs outside. The only downside to this is the light itself.  I feel like it's not as bright as my previous light.  It's also much warmer (e.g. yellower) light than what I had before.  Therefore, I don't think it does as good of a job as lighting up my backyard, but it's pretty good.  I did have a very bright LED light before, so maybe my expectations were a little too high.

I held off on writing a review for ages hoping it would grow on me and I'd learn that it's quirks were a good thing. That didn't happen. The tiniest motion sets off the light (even on low sensitivity) but setting off the light doesn't set off the recording - so we wake in the morning knowing the light has gone off in the night because it woke us up, but there's no video evidence of why it went off. We've learned to ignore it when it goes off because it's usually a bug or a squirrel. I've been frustrated by this since day one, and last night, when there were thieves in our driveway, they set the light off, but there is no recording. The good news is we also have several Nest cameras, and they all caught the incident perfectly. This ""record when Ring thinks it's important"" is just horrible. Our Nest cams record constantly, they save alert moments when the camera thinks it saw something of interest, but I can scroll back and look at days worth of video (I pay for 10 days of history) if I want.

Stell,"UPDATE 3/12/18: I wanted to update this after getting better customer support. They did send me a Ring chime pro, the one with an extender, to see if that solved the flaky/low signal issue to the floodlight cam with my mesh system. Sadly it did not, the signal was much stronger with the mesh system than the chime pro. The floodlight was getting around RSSI 63 to 56 (some times lower) on the mesh system and with the chime pro it was lower all the time, so I switched it back to my mesh system. I still say these devices need better reception because of adding a Ring spotlight mount cam at our front door. It's about 10 feet from the router and is around RSSI 28 to 35, actually this spotlight cam gets better reception than the chime pro does in the house. lol! So it's a matter of the device cannot be too far away from the router or a satellite/extender like other Wifi devices can be and get a strong signal. I hope they do upgrade those capabilities because there are other places on our farm I want to place these cameras but knowing that just because my phone or other device gets great Wifi at that distance does not mean the Ring device will get the same reception. But overall I do like these cameras, are they perfect? No, but for the price point they are great and having the wired ones get you the ability to have the event recorded before it starts for reference. I might not catch the whole thing live, like the commercial shows, but I have the event recorded. Also I want that color night vision like on the commercials. ;-) It would be nice if it weren't for the fact it's reception is complete garbage. I have an Orbi satellite 10 ft from the floodlight and it gets ""ok"" to ""good"" signal, while my phone gets full signal at the floodlight and my phone is capable of using my Wifi an acre away inside my parents brick home. Customer service about this issue is pathetic, only suggesting that I force it to connect to the router that's 3 times farther away. I have had it on the router and it barely functions and would never hook up to an extender, which is why I went with an Orbi system. It's better with the satellite on the Orbi system but it should be much better if the reception on the camera itself was worth a crap. So with all the connection issues the motion alert is very slow, as in someone could break in our trucks before we ever got the alert and be gone, then the video quality may or may not be helpful. Oddly for an immobile object the reception changes more on this than my phone does when I walk all over the property.

Should be able to set the amount of time the light stays on once triggered.  This is a basic setting for most motion spot lights that cost fractions of this one. -Cannot set a time for the light to go off...can only set a time for the light to go on on the app...hence you have to go into the app to turn the light off at night (even though the app says ""set a time for the light to go on or off"" -The speaker does not have a volume adjustment, and difficult to hear unless you are standing very close to the light.",Great Product yet there is Room for Improvement

Meyer,"Stupid 1: You cannot disable the motion lights. Stupid 2: Motion lights turn on when it rains. Stupid 3: Motion lights don’t provide notifications or show in history. (They trigger separately from the camera) Stupid 4: These only work with vertical mounting without modifications. Stupid 5: You can create light groups, but that only lets you turn them on together - not turn them off or apply a common schedule. Stupid 6: Aiming the camera down affects the light motion sensor range. Stupid 7: The night vision is constantly confused whether it should be on/off resulting in with pitch black images momentarily or weird purple color. Stupid 8: They don’t even really integrate well with the Echo Shows they were bundled with. Which is also a mega flaw with Echo Show apps - a separate issue. Stupid 9: They don’t integrate directly with Samsung SmartThings like competitors do.  It’s a limited  pass thru Alexa. Stupid 10: Prepare to get on your ladder anytime you need to change things.

I would consider getting a different smart camera with traditional motion lights or smart lights and save a ton of money. If it wasn’t so much effort reversing the install I would send them back.

Tristan,"I purchased 4 of these cameras to secure my home in various locations throughout my yard.  After about a year and a half one of the cameras produced images that are discolored as seen in the picture.  Now another camera turns on and off and makes white noises.  The WiFi range is really horrible with these cameras.  Also, recording only happens when there is motion and there is no way to view times when motion isn’t detected when there was motion.  Also there is a huge lag time from when the recording commences and when you view.  So if you detect motion and get a notification on your phone, you have to wait several minutes before you can watch the video.  I just wasted $1,000 bucks and didn’t even get 2 years out of these cameras.  I beg you not to buy these cameras, they are horrible, the streaming service is also horrible.  70% of the time I can’t watch the video on my phone at my office (with a good WiFi connection) I just get a spinning circle.  I get a notification on my phone and can’t see the video, drives me nuts.  I don’t ever write negative reviews but at least this is an honest one.  When shopping for cameras I’m going to be shopping for warranties now.

We LOVE it!  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews on this product.  It was easy installation (in fairness due to the height of the floodlights we had an electrician install) and it worked immediately.  We were able to connect it to our wifi and we've been most impressed by the picture quality and the fact that it has never lost connection (even better than our doorbell).  We did upgrade our plan to include this camera but it is very reasonable for peace of mind knowing it's always recording and saving videos.  I love being able to see when my kids get home from school and the motion detector works great turning the lights on in the evening.

I never had such a good camera & such powerful floodlights before. Now, let's talk about the hidden costs. If you don't have a 4 GIG Data Plan, you will probably need one, so get one, or get a nasty surprise in your monthly phone bill. Worse, you might need to pay for some clown to come out and install a junction box for you. A jerk from Aard... came out, did an inspection, and proposed a $695 install fee.  That's six hundred and ninety five dollars. So, whatever you spent for the camera, triple that amount when you figure the cost of the camera, data line, and installation. If you're like me & you want to do it yourself, know that Ring has incompetents like ""Brent"" working for them who don't even know what gauge wire you should buy to connect your Ring Device to the Junction Box that you install. All that a guy like 'Brent"" knows to say is, ""We recommend that you get an electrician to install the device."" This may sound arrogant, but I'm not paying some clown who rode the short, yellow bus to school $695 to install a camera, ground rod, and a junction box. I did the job myself and the results were good. Basically, you can take an extension cord, cut the ends off it & connect the wires to the camera/flood lights on one end and connect the other end to a junction box: that's over-simplified, but it helps you to get the idea. Oh, if you detect a note of anger & frustration in my writer's tone, you're right: I contacted the RING/AMAZON Installer, and he acted like I needed an electrician and him to install the device. My take is that Brent, the Amazon Installer, & most electricians all rode the short, yellow bus & all took ""life studies"" as their primary path in high school.",Get Stung for a $695 INSTALLATION FEE & $40/month Data Line Upgrade

Even though I have it set to the least sensitive setting it still picks up everything to include when the light turns on from across the street and when cars drive by.

As a result, whatever caused the notification is long over.  The ads showing people talking to potential burglars are therefore very misleading.  You can see what happened by viewing the recording, but attempting to respond in a tiny manner is virtually impossible.  Complaints to Ring result in them telling you it is your network's fault,  it Ring's. I also found while traveling recently that the time stamp on the videos is NOT necessarily the local time of the occurrence.  The time shown is the time of the recording at time zone of the viewing of the video.  So if you are in New York and see something that happened at your California house at 11AM, it actually happened at 8AM in California.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2019,mustardchips,"*Second Update* I really wish Ring would update the app to allow a light motion schedule. You do have the ability to decide whether or not have the lights triggered by motion and you have the ability to have light motion zones. Further you have the ability to have the lights come on automatically on a schedule. What I’d REALLY like to have is the ability to schedule a timeframe for the lights to detect motion, for example from 11p-6am or even have motion light snooze like you can do with motion alerts. Would be a great update particularly in the winter when it gets dark early and the lights are aggressively bright. *UPDATED* I got an email from “Antonio” from Ring after reading my review. He asked if we could have a call to discuss review and see if he could assist. We scheduled a call and discussed my concerns. Though, the Live View is kinda of what it is (more security camera than monitoring camera) he could assist with lights coming on inexplicably. He sent me an email with a code so he could view my camera. He pushed through a firmware update resolving the lights coming on unwontedly issue. Further, he made some recommendations for how to best optimize the motion detection areas based on my needs/wants. After resolving floodlight camera I asked about door bell issue I had. Again he sent a new code so he could view my settings and camera. He noticed, despite using the wedge that points camera downward, it wasn’t pointing downward enough. He said he’ll mail two additional wedges at no charge. He mentioned, too, to send him an email if after installing additional wedges doesn’t resolve issue, we can look at other remedies. I was really blown away by his knowledge and more than anything his ability to resolve my concerns. Although the Live View doesn’t really offer all that I wanted I still am updating rating from 3 stars to 5 stars on the service level.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2017,Jack,"**Update - 2019/08/19: I've had the Ring Floodlight Cameras for some time now.  In fact, I currently have six of these installed around my house and I'm contemplating adding three more.  I also have two of the Ring Doorbells and the Ring Chime.  I'm very happy with the Ring system and would recommend it to anyone. However, I reiterate that it is imperative that you have a strong Wi-Fi system with excellent signal where the lights are mounted.  You can have a great signal inside your home that is just terrible where the floodlight is mounted.  In fact, I initially had issues with a couple of the Ring Floodlight Cameras that I installed for this very reason; one wouldn't connect at all until I upgraded my network. I had two wireless access points in the house, which completely covered the interior of my home, but once I ventured outside, the signal became considerably weaker.  I ended up updating my Wi-Fi network with three Ubiquity UniFi AP-AC-Pro access points in my attic, pointing downward to get the coverage I needed at the eaves of my roof outside.  This move improved my network throughout my home as well as providing the coverage I needed for the cameras outside. I have a strong signal to all my Ring devices and I don't experience any connection issues with any of them.  They all perform well as a result. **Original Review: I've had a Ring Doorbell for some time and I like it a lot.  I had been using Arlo cameras for perimeter monitoring of our house, but the Floodlight Cam is a much better choice. I already had floodlights all around the house, so installing the Floodlight Cams was an easy task.  I like the idea that I will no longer have to change batteries in my outside cameras and the Floodlight Cams have proven to be much more reliable in the short time I've had them. The adjustments on the lights are good enough that you can point them almost any direction you want.  The camera adjustment is not quite as good, but combining the option to mount the base at almost any horizontal degree, you have a lot of control over the camera alignment.  For the most part, I had no problems lining mine up as I wanted them.  I do have a couple floodlights that were not close to the outside wall (on porches) and if I could have adjusted those two to point at a lower vertical angle, I would get a better view directly below the lights, but it's good enough as is.  The wide viewing angle of the camera means getting the camera position close to where you want it is probably good enough. The motion detection zones are very well designed and work exactly as expected.  I'm no longer recording false alarms throughout the day, cars driving down the road and bugs for example, but the recordings I do get have been 100% accurate to date, at least on known activities. The only suggestion I have is to provide an option for the lights to turn on and off based on the sun setting and rising.  Before I installed the Floodlight Cams, I controlled my floodlights using my home automation system and it turned lights on when the sun set and turned them off at sunrise each day, based on date and time calculations for our time zone.  I could even program that system so that the lights came on 30 minutes before sunset and turned off 30 minutes after sunrise if I wanted to.  I think sun-based scheduling would make a great addition to the light settings.  With the Ring Floodlights, I’m now using a time-based schedule, which will need to be manually adjusted several times throughout the year. Having a good Wi-Fi signal where the cameras are mounted is key to a successful installation.  Keep that in mind when planning to buy these or any Wi-Fi based cameras.  You may have to tweak your Wi-Fi network to get solid connectivity to the cameras.  I have three Wi-Fi access points in my home to make this work well. The cameras and the software are well designed.  I do question the decision to use proprietary lights instead of standard bulbs, but the expected long life of LED lights should make this a non-issue for now.",I'm really liking the Ring Floodlight Cams!

My Apple Watch even gets a ping when motion is detected and I have the option to pause the motion sensor if I choose.  Setup was very easy and intuitive.  The only ""difficult"" part is that our old light was ""ceiling mounted"" and not on the wall under the eave.  As a result, the camera was a little limited in how far we could rotate it.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2017,Nick Sayer,"Given the distance and number of walls between our router (an Apple Airport Extreme 802.11ac) and where we mounted the floodlight cam, I expected the connection quality to be unacceptable, but the final result is surprisingly good. The unit reports a ""good"" signal strength and the picture is almost always flawless, with the occasional fraction of a second of dropped frames. If I had anything I'd want to change, I'd wish that the range of the motion sensor for the lights was more adjustable. For our installation, the range is too large even at the lowest sensitivity setting (the spot where we have it is rather small, but it's important that there be floodlights there because it is otherwise too dark to be safe). For the camera, the ability to draw motion zones on the image allows us to perfectly outline the part of the image that's our back yard, so we can capture images of anyone who comes in that way. And that's really the goal - in principle, no one should be able to come into our yard without video of them being saved for the police if it turns out they were up to no good. If you happen to be able to fire up the app at the time there's a motion event (or just whenever you want), you can have a two-way conversation with whoever is out there, and you can trigger an ear-piercing siren that should wake up the neighbors 2 or 3 houses down.","So far, it's working perfectly for us."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2020,bagoggans,"Super easy to install.  Removed the old flood light and had this installed in minutes.  Easy to setup and reset as the button is on the top and easy to do should you need to (and I did thanks to a poor wifi signal where it is located - had to buy and setup a wifi extender).  Saves money too - the light automatically comes on when I need it too, and goes off quickly once the area is clear. Captured two people on video trying to open my car doors at 3am, captured a FedEx driver dropping off a damaged/empty box.  The videos are stored in the Ring Cloud, and that service is cheap and easy to use (I highly recommend paying for the whole year in advance - best value).  Also VERY NICE is that I can talk to folks (and they can talk back) through the Ring interface on my phone, and I really like that capability!  Especially when I told the two pinheads (I will call them Beavis and Butthead) to smile for camera!  Ha! I highly recommend this product!

Don’t waste your money. I first got the doorbell which works but the WiFi despite having a good connection is slow to answer. The floodlight camera?! This thing won’t sense the strongest signal I have even if it’s entered in. It has to run on a medium signal strength and has remained “not connected to the internet” 80% of the time! When it works it was a good product and very sensitive to motion. BUT... 80% DOWN TIME, does not work for me. I should have just bought a FAKE camera, it would have done the same thing and been up for looks. BTW, I’ve talked to tech support for hours and reset it more times than I can count.",DONT BUY THIS

Took me about 10-15 to physically mount it and about twenty minutes to set up the rest. If you already have a ring device, adding the cloud storage to your account is a hoot. My issues are as follows. 1) I wish you could point it further to the sides. That’s just my application . 2) I would have expected slightly better night vision. But the lights work well.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jul 2019,Selvin C,"After a month, I ended up returning my camera. I was looking to use this device as a porch light for my back yard and take advantage of it's strong light as well as camera. With it being a porch light, I had it on a dusk to dawn type light schedule instead of a motion sensing light. That feature didn't really work too well and considering that I paid over $200 for the device and it was missing a few features that lower priced cams have, I couldn't see myself keeping it. Pros: -GREAT picture/video quality. -Two way talk w/ siren alarm -Sync with Neighbors app. -Bright floodlight (when it DOES come on) Cons: -Light schedule does not function when the app is installed across multiple devices (only had it on two devices). -For $250, I feel like you are paying more for the brand as apposed to the device and features itself. -If you wish to keep the recorded videos, you HAVE to pay a subscription. -Camera does not record 24/7. It only records motion (IF it senses motion) or when you set it to record while in the app. (for $250 I'd expect more, at least SD slot for internal storage but RING shoves their subscription down your throat). -Limited mobility of lights and camera. Though they are bright, you're limited to the degree you can move the lights around to. -Live feed takes too long to buffer (appx 30-45 secs, sometimes longer). A lot can happen in the time that I spend trying to get the app to open then to finally show the live feed. The app developers need to find a way for the feed to open in a ""lower resolution"" to at least have the app and feed render up quicker. Then once in the live feed, have the option to quick change to high res video. -The app uses TOOO much bandwidth. I have 1080 and 720 cams from a different manufacturer and they use FAR less bandwidth. Which allows their app and live feed to open quicker as well. Sucks they do not have a floodlight cam. All in all, I'd really give it 1.5 stars because of the picture quality and the integration of the neighbors app. Everything else about the device and the Ring app is crappy considering the price. Had the device been roughly $100 less or had features/functionality that match it's top dollar, I'd come to terms with keeping it and give it 5 stars w/o a doubt.",Overpriced Security Cam w/ Subscription fees
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Oct 2019,Dg lahm,"Motion detection is very sensitive, this particular camera senses motion 200 + ft away, depending on the size of the object (like tractor trailer on a nearby road). It does a very good job. I have also caught deer, raccoons and groundhogs crossing my yard at different times of the night. The night vision is very good as well but it would have been a little better if the beam of light was fanned out in a wider angle. Installation and set up were relatively easy. This camera was a wired camera so I had to run electricity from the basement, which was the hardest part of this installation process. If you have electricity at your installation location already, it is a breeze to set up. It would also be nice if ring offered a choice of either wide angle lens or a standard lens when you order the cameras. Overall I am pleased with all of the cameras that I have installed (4)",Very good camera system so far (6 weeks)
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2018,brightnight,"The setup and installation on this thing is a snap. It works well with the app and integrates well with the doorbell I already have. The picture quality is clear and so far reliable. That's where the good ends. The lights really aren't that bright at least compared to my older security light. The lights have a very limited ability to be pointed in specific directions so you have to mount it directly above where you want the light to hit. So if you're looking for a bright light, this is not the one for you because you can't just change out the bulbs to a higher wattage light. Also, I've already noticed that snow will trigger both the cam to record and the lights to come on. Tonight we just had flurries…barely hard enough to even feel and it was triggering them both ALL night long. On and off. And yes, there is a sensitivity level you can adjust but mine is adjusted back so far that it is no longer really effective in terms of security for someone coming on my property at the current setting. The problem is that even though my camera is under the eaves of my house, the wind blows the flurries in front of the sensor and it triggers the whole response so it's not about sensitivity of distance since it's occurring right in front of the unit. And that's a bummer…my electric bill will definitely be higher since this thing is popping on every 5 minutes and I'm not sure what the solution is. Either have the sensitivity to effectively protect your property or turn it down so low to avoid being triggered by snow that it simply doesn't do what you need it to do. And that's after playing with the zones and sensitivity AND being in a location where it's covered. Ultimately it's still probably my best bet of available cam/light options…the clarity and ease of access give it value, the unreliability of the sensor (unless my unit is bad) makes it a pain at times. Can't imagine how I will deal with it when we start to get actual snow instead of just flurries. UPDATING THIS REVIEW: Turns out I did get some good support from RING after this review. The support team offered to replace the unit I currently have but after power was cut to it it for 24 hours, it seemed to improve and at least wasn't coming on every 2 minutes like it was the night it was snowing when I wrote this review. My honest opinion is that there are a few kinks to work out on this device before it's a reliable part of a home security system. Reliability is key when you want protection for your home, I don't think anyone would suggest otherwise. If there are certain weather conditions, temperatures or situations when you cannot connect, when there are false notifications, times when you can't access the live view, it doesn't do too much in the way of confidence that it will work as needed if the time comes of legitimate security issues on/around your home. Ring support has been good after an initial chat that incensed me and I'm hoping that when we start to get snow again (we haven't had any since that one night) they will stay true to their word and offer to replace it. Update #2: Ring either doesn’t care that these are flawed or are terrified they’ll have to replace thousands of these units. It works ok during the day (inconsistent, difficult to connect to at times) but at night the motion detection is non-existent and the lights will not even come on until someone is directly under the unit. My driveway is about 200 ft so anyone could come onto my property at night without triggering the lights OR the camera unless they walk right up to the unit itself and create motion. I feel sorry for anyone who has counted on these to provide security for their home and ended up being broken into. It’s a false sense of security but the truth is that if someone broke into my house while I was away they would get away with it unless they come to within 6 feet of the unit where my cam would be triggered. And even then the quality of the footage (that typically records for about 5 seconds of important footage and a minute or after the fact footage) wouldn’t allow for any real identification. If you can afford this as a novelty so you can turn on your cam and watch birds from your phone, go for it. It’s not even close to a legitimate/valuable piece of security equipment. Most of all do NOT count on this to protect your home. I have read story after story about how these don’t trigger when they need to or start to record too late and cases where they weren’t even triggered at all (which is what mine would do based on how it responds to my activity at night).",Update: 6 months on and this is all but useless

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2020,Mike Foye,I live in a single story brick-front house (2100 sq ft).  I installed the Floodlight Cam on the front over the garage door facing the street.  It was having trouble connecting with any consistency so I got on line to look for answers.  I have an AT&T Broadband DSL Router (5268AC) that is less than a year old.  We don’t have access to cable. The Router is located on the other side of the house from the garage (3 drywalls walls plus the brick veneer of the garage – total 50 ft).  Following comments from other on-line users I bought a RockSpace 750Mbps extender (Amazon $45) and moved it half way to the garage to no better result and then out to the garage 8 ft from the floodlight with still no better result.  I sent the RockSpace back and bought a larger extender (Netgear Mesh AC1900 ($135 Best Buy))).  Again moved it half way with no appreciable change and then to the same location that is 8 ft from the flood light with almost no improvement.  System takes way too long to connect.  The Ring app device test shows that I have a poor wifi connection with the extender 8 ft away.  I have tested the wifi network.  I have consistently 12.70 Mbps download speed and 2.31 upload speed at the router.  Standing on a ladder right next to the floodlight I have 11.89 download and 2.21 upload.  The literature syas I need 2.0 Mbps!! I wish I had read the reviews before I spent $250 for this thing.  I had originally planned to get a Ring Video Doorbell but I am not going to waste my money.  This is a really great concept but it doesn’t work as claimed and I am not at all satisfied.  Particularly after running new 110 wiring and drilling holes in walls and brick to install it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,Very Disappointed
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2017,Mary Wisniewski,"Overall, I really like this product.  However, it took a lot to get it working. pros: Really nice camera quality, including color. Nice wide angle view, very wide viewing angle while still maintaining great image quality. Great service support, which I needed a lot of. The motion detection on the device is phenomenal.  I have 4 other security cameras that have motion detection which I gave up on.  I live in the country and varmints triggered the camera a lot I have motion detectors on my lights that are on a lot in windy days. I have a driveway detector that also triggers a lot from birds and such but then sometimes doesn't work when it should. This camera motion detection is spot on.  Very few false hits and very reliable on real people and vehicles coming to the property. Like my other cameras you can set the monitoring zones for the camera, but this one took about 5 minutes and I never looked back. No pun intended.  Also the camera has a motion detector for the lights.  I'm not sure if they integrate the motion detector for the lights with the camera motion detector, but it is super easy to setup and works excellent. IPhone interface is crisp, intuitive, and reliable. Quality seems very good, including packaging.  Not sure if it's made in USA, but it sure feels like it. Cons: You can easily turn off the motion detection when the wife is out in the garden, but there should be a timer, that turns it back on.  I turned mine off and it wasn't until a day later I remembered to turn it back on. This camera needs a very reliable high speed WIFI signal.  They are using 2.4GHZ band to get better range but then also looking for at least 2Mbps Upload and Download.  That's really tricky at 2.4 GHZ.  Your iPhone and most new laptops use 5GHZ because of the increased bandwidth.  Here they are trying to do a balancing act trying to get range with a narrow bandwidth channel. NOTE: If your ISP doesn't give you at least 2Mbps upload don't buy this unit. I have the second tier Internet service (ISP) which is 20 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload.  The upload speed is right at the limit to make the camera work.  To get 5 Mbps upload speed it's another $20 per month on top of the $60 I'm paying now. I have a 2000 sq. foot house and my Router is in the loft and my camera is over the garage.  Typical installation if you ask me.  Well the Speed at the camera was less then 1 Mbps.  So the unit acted like it was defective.  Could turn the lights and siren on and off but no video or audio image. Working with Ring support, they ended up sending me a new unit, which acted exactly the same.  This time the support person was more savvy and determined the WIFI speed at the camera was way to low.  BTW: Support is with folks having an American dialect, which made it easy for me to understand.  She offered to send me a repeater/chime unit for free, but said the repeater first receives the signal then sends it.  This essentially cuts the speed in half!  Now I would have a nice reliable signal but only at 1Mbps! Too cut to the chase.  I ended up buying a good quality WIFI repeater for $100.  It was relatively easy for me to get an Ethernet cable to my garage so I ended up configuring the extender as an ""access point.""  That simply means you run a long Ethernet cable from your router to the access point and it acts like a new WIFI router, with it's own WIFI network, at that access point.  I got the 2 Mbps download speed I needed and we lived happily ever after...almost.  Audio is still very choppy, but I have little desire to talk to an intruder like they do in the Ring commercials, so it's a non-issue for me.  If I followed my true instincts as a retired EE, I would upgrade my Internet service to the 5Mbps service but the other instinct most EE's have is we're cheap.  So until the world of technical gadgets absolutely begs for me to have the ""Extreme Internet Package.""  I'll just let the intruder get a taste of the siren.","Overall, I really like this product.  However, it took a lot to get it working."

This should be in every home I started out with just the Ring doorbell, I was impressed with it so much so I got the flood light cameras and then I got another flood light camera and because I wanted to put some in the back where it was a little further than what my electricity goes to so instead of getting the hardwired cameras I got the solar panels with the battery the formal need to hardwire any cameras the solar panel will recharge the batteries and what’s great is that the cameras spotlight will light up even in a black out so my house would probably be the only one that’s lit up In the next black out, I do suggest getting the cameras that are compatible with the solar panels and battery just don’t make the mistake I did where I did not realize that the hardwire cameras were specially not made to work with the solar panels so I had to return the hard wire ones because I already had the solar panels and order the cameras that are compatible The one thing that I find very very useful is that you can look on your cameras to see the grounds of your residence or to turn on the lights or even sound an alarm to scare away any intruders & you can do this from the other side of the world if you wanted to, Let me talk about the things that I do like about the cameras functionI find that it works very well I find that it has a really crisp and clear picture I also find that The night vision function is very awesome what I like about the night vision on these cameras are not gray it’s actually in color usually othercameras turn gray when it switches over to a Night Vision but not these cameras they keep its vibrant And clear picture I did have other cameras before I got the ring nearest to say all the other cameras were taken down in the ring cameras were put up I like them that much.... My house is so well covered now with the security system and all the cameras and lights and flood lights and sirens that it won’t nearly make it impossible for anybody to get through without being noticed the only way is that if they cover them selves with Sheet and try to walk in the dark then trip over the sprinkler and then get eaten by my dog which actually sounds better than calling the police lol","This should be in every home,"
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Sep 2017,Scott K.,"Well constructed, install is easy and secure.  As a motion sensor flood light its great.  App does what it needs to and works fine on iOS and Android.  You will definitely want a solid WiFi connection for your installation spot.  Anything less than 10Mbps could be problematic.  I added an inexpensive wired access point nearby just for the device to ensure I was getting good throughput.  When you change wireless networks you must physically press a button on the device which can be a pain depending on its location. As a recording device, audio recordings are pretty good but speaker is to quiet for voice interactions through the application.  For video, its inconsistent with picking up motion for recording.  Sometimes it will start recording as soon as it comes into the configured motion area and other times it takes up to a minute or does not trigger at all.  I'd say its accurate about 75% of the time when testing.  It generally won't get all of the video frames for a given recording.  Sometimes the videos are all black (black screen, blank video) but audio will be recorded. I think they should have higher requirements for solid WiFi signal so users don't get frustrated with flaky behavior.  And when users do have solid WiFi it should work perfectly.  Certainly some home ISP funny business could be happening but after testing the WiFi signal multiple times via multiple test sites I'm confident I have good signal but the device does not always deliver a quality video (lag, dropped frames, black screen, etc.).  I'd like to see what their production environment looks like and what kind capacity they have vs. demand.  Do they have regional data centers? What kind of SLAs? I'd recommend cause its cool and its works well as a motion sensor light, but not as a reliable video security device since it won't always capture the action.  It will mostly get your street hockey game highlights and random delivery guy drop offs.",Good flood light and OK IoT Camera

On three different occasions I asked a very direct and simple question and Ring responded with everything but the answer to my question.  I think I could eventually get it to work properly if I could get someone on the other side to help.  Ring actually assigns a rep to your case for a 'personal touch' but it wasn't effective.

The resolution is acceptable, but not optimal.  If there were a true ""Snooze Flood Lights"" option I'd be more satisfied. The support I received in person was GREAT.  Prior to that in trying to solve this on my own, I found the online support to be very unhelpful - in fact very frustrating, which caused me to write my original review.  The online support needs an overhaul.  It actually had several endpoints in the self-support where it asks if your issue is resolved and there is ONLY A YES BUTTON!? Old review: The concept of this camera flood light is great.  The execution of it by ring is not so great.  If your flood lights are on a switch, then you risk them being turned off.  If you leave them on, and you are hanging out outside, be ready for the motion to turn the lights on!  Your only option if you don’t want that is to turn them off and that turns off the camera as well.  There is no option to have the cameras running and not have the flood lights come on.  When I installed these I hardwired them to avoid someone accidentally shutting them off.  Now I can hangout in the backyard without being lit up like the sun!

For the second one I understood it’s a common problem and when I asked shouldn’t your product go through quality check before selling to customers, the answer was we should. They will send me a replacement for the second one till they figure out what’s wrong with the first one!! That means I have to pay the electrician again to replace these two. When I showed how annoyed I was , they wanted to give me a free month subscription ( $10 worth) wow ... That’s not what I expected from a brand new camera system out of the box and how inefficient their customer service is, all products should be inspected before sold. This is absolutely ridiculous having to repay n electrician for what???!!!! WARNING DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!",WARNING DO NOT WASTE YOU’RE MONEY!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Sep 2017,just a consumer,"Easy to install and set up. One of the nicest feature of Ring products is that the software user interface is almost the same for all products. However, it is not clear in the documentation if the floodlights are motion activated - how odd. I have lowered my rating.  The product has been unreliable in turning on/off.  It turns on and off all night (no birds, bees, moths, mosquitos - no rain/wind/fog).  It shows good WiFi connection but is very slow to respond to motion - the video is hardly ""real time"".  When I called Ring, their convenient response is ""you have a bad Wi-Fi connection"" (that is not what the device is telling me in its status report).  Other WiFi devices work fine in that location. Worst is the need to reset/re-establish the Wi-Fi connection.  My floodlight is under an eave on a high roof.  I have to find/borrow and then climb up an 16' ladder to push the WiFi-set button on top of the sensor.  And, then, hope that the WiFi resets. What a pain. A clever idea, but a poor (and, expensive, implementation).",another nice Ring product - for a short time
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2020,Chingadero,"While the Ring system does function nominally it really needs significant improvement, especially the software. I purchased both the floodlight camera and the video doorbell with a Chime Pro. We have Cox Gigablast internet with a Panoramic gateway so speed is not the issue. All of my other devices, (Roku, smart TV's, etc) work just fine with this system. The floodcam is mounted under the eave of the house directly above the window to my office where the gateway sits just inside the same window. Literally no more than 6 feet away. The doorbell is mounted by the front door which is next to the office and not more than 12 feet from the gateway. Here are my complaints. After we upgraded to Gigablast we learned that the Chime Pro is not compatible with the Cox Panoramic gateway and will not connect. It sits in my desk drawer now. Neither camera is anywhere close to ""real time"". If someone rings the doorbell you must wait several minutes to actually see who is there. Same for the floodcam. It may alert but when I open the app nothing appears for at least 2 or 3 minutes. Replay of captured events is wonky. Some of them will play immediately and others will freeze and lag. If you scroll through the captured events too quickly you will experience problems. The app needs a setting to turn off the ""Delete video?"" confirmation pop-up. If there are numerous videos stored it becomes very time consuming to confirm each deletion. If configuring or re-configuring Ring devices you must physically press the reset button on the device. Not too much trouble on the doorbell but for my floodcam it's a pain to drag out a ladder and climb up to do this. The button on the floodcam is smooth and flush with the body of the device so you can't feel it and it's very hard to see. With the latest update the Neighbors app does not clear viewed alerts correctly. It miscounts the number of actual ""new"" alerts and then continues to show them as not viewed after you go through them. I have to open it twice to clear the notification. Additionally since the last update the Dashboard loads very slowly. Most of the time I see the spinning progress circle and it says ""This is taking longer than usual"" or something to that effect. Overall I would give the Ring system a rating of ""Fair"". It could be significantly better if they would deal with the issues it has.",Needs a lot of improvement

(I tried different Motion Sensitivity with no luck) 2- I have 40 mbps internet speed at home and the other camera is installed in front of my garage door and my router is in my office. There is a wall between them BUT the distance between the camera and the router is literally less than 25 feet and the connection is poor so the camera misses some footage and the video freezes for seconds and all kind of issues. 3- The voice quality between your phone and the camera is not like what they show in their advertisements at all. It is not awful but it is not that good either. 4- I noticed that I got several notifications from my cameras when it is windy outside.they think the rose or tree branches or ""their shadows on the ground!"" are human's motion so I get several notifications during the windy days or nights.",Bough several Ring's products in 2 weeks.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2019,VMaar,"My parents are elderly and live on their own. That worries me, so the solution that we have come up with is to have a few Ring cameras around their house. That way I can see who is coming around and make sure they are safe. This device is relatively easy to install if you're handy. I did it on my own with a bit of help from my dad who was handing me parts and tools as I stood on a ladder to replace the motion-detecting flood light in the back of their house. It stopped working years ago, but we didn't get around to taking it down and buying another. I am glad we didn't because the Ring floodlight camera did not exist back then, and my parents probably would have been too cheap to replace a working floodlight. I had a few problems connecting to wifi, which seems to be related to some changes in their app. Eventually, I figured it out, and it is working. (I had no problems connecting other Ring devices that I installed, so I am not sure what was going on in this case. The app used a different protocol this time, which didn't work, but eventually it went to the old protocol and then it worked.) I can see their backyard, whether anyone is back there, including them, on my phone. If you're worried about the safety of and elderly parents' home, or if you're worried about an elderly parent falling outside of the home, this is a decent solution.",Another great Ring device
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jun 2020,Las Vegas Engineer,"I do have 4 of these and I believe they are the best on the market, but there is room for improvement. My comments after 2 years of use: 1. The camera is very good, provides clear pictures and HD Streaming. Top notch. 2. The light is strong enough, but not as strong as you would get with a new generation heavy duty LED floodlight. The color temperature is between warm white and daylight bright. A bit to white for my taste, but maybe too yellow for others who have daylight bright lights around the house. Ring went the middle way which is ok. As a way of future improvement, they may want to offer 2 sets, one daylight white another set warm white. This way they could satisfy and reach more customers. 3. Motion detection is an issue. The detection is good in detecting motion if someone is walking across the camera, but not when someone is appearing from in front. If I walk very slowly, it would not detect me. On the other hand, it does detect often insects that are attracted by the light. Wind and shadows often triggers the motion alerts too, even if settings are put on the lowest level. Generally, motion detection works but there is room for improvement. 4. The App is really below average. As far as I understand, Blink has same ownership, and I wonder why the development teams do not talk to each other? Blink has a much more simple app to use, while Ring's App gets overly complicated. It is hard to adjust schedules and to switch motion off/on, while with the Blink App, you simply do this on the main screen with a click on an icon. Ring should just follow Blink and make their App much less complicated. I feel developers have not fully understood that user experience is most important and that not everyone is a full expert in using new technology. 5. Monthly Fees: While I do not mind paying monthly fees to keep recordings, again, Blink does not have that, and for some, this may be a big disadvantage. All in all this is most properly the best flood light security camera on the market but there is place for improvement. Due to the monthly fees, some may consider just purchasing a flood light with their needed color temperature and a Blink camera in addition, both working together this way would eliminate monthly fees.","Great Camera, Good Light, Average Motion Detection, Below Average App"

Our house is not far off the road and I am unable to differentiate between people and cars. If you want your videos saved to the cloud, buy the $30/year plan, that is pretty cheap.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2018,Ryan B,"Keep in mind as you read this I've only owned the camera for about a week. However I have owned other cameras, D-Link and Samsung SmartThings.  This camera is great compared to D-Link and a step up from SmartThings (which it is compatible with, but only minimally).  This is easy to install (as long as you already have the wiring set up).  The controls are less complicated than SmartThings but don't give you the same  range of technical control which I never really needed.  One thing that is worth talking about is the zones you set up to look for motion.  All my camera's have had you make boxes that would be set as if drawing it on the (y-axis) monitor, but with this camera you can set it up more to the ground (x-axis).  This is great because with the y-axis setup you are forced to get trees as the wind blows through in your zones, or roads with passing traffic; which always sets off the camera several times a day. Which eventually causes you to ignore your alerts rather than be on your phone 24/7.  The only 2 things I wish was better: one is the picture quality especially when zooming (but it isn't any worse that SmartThings).  And second, I would like to see something that draws your eye to what ever caused the motion in the first place.  I have only seen this on professional security cameras so far.  But at night when you have a small rodent at the far edge of your zones set off your camera you could spend all day trying to figure out what set it off and never see it. So it would be nice to see a box around it or cross hairs on it, or anything really. Overall I would say this is a 4-4.5 star product.  So what is the BUT for... It's for the simple fact that in order for you to have any security really for your home you have to pay for there ""protection plan"". You can't look at past videos nor will it even save new ones.  If I wanted to pay monthly for a security service I would go through a security service...not install a few things on my own.  Thats on me for not understanding what I was getting into.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Apr 2018,Michael,I want to like these products.... But.  I have three devices two ring pro doorbells and a flood light.  I was going to purchase more for my house and a couple for another property I have..  Here is the part that I would say is unacceptable.  On some devices the recordings only last 20 seconds max.  On mine they are hard wired so that go around 40-45 seconds.  THERE IS NO WAY TO SET LENGTH ON RECORDING TIMES SO IF SOMEONE APPROACHES YOUR DOOR THEY JUST HAVE TO TRIGGER THE MOTION WITH WALKING BY OR SOMETING AND THEN COME BACK IN 30 SECINDS AND THE RING PRODUCTS ARE NOT RECORDING!!!! IT TAKES THEN A FEW SECONDS TO RESET.  I ASKED RING SUPPORT IF I  can adjust my recordings to continue for one or two minutes after motion is detected and they said there is no way to do that.  Another example is someone walks up to your car and peeks in window for 20-30 seconds and then stands still.  The ring products don't see motion and stop recording.  There is a gap  for 15-20 seconds before the devices will pick back up and record.  I am just saying I payed the top level of recording tier and you don't have option to record more than 45-50 second snips after motion is detected.,Not as good as hype.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2018,Sobak,"Purchased this for my house, I had a light in the back garage area but it was off to the side and didn't work after I installed a new fence.  I decided to not only move the light but also add some security.  The Ring Floodlight performed better than expected, the image is clear and the alerts are exactly that, low false alarms unless you have it setup to alert in more area than you need.  I've seen wildlife that I didn't know we had roaming the street at night.  Quick to install, my installation was a little more difficult because I had to move the power cable.  If you're mounting it under an eve, it can be difficult to get the camera at the right angle.  Lucky for me my drive way sits at an angle away from the house so it was easy to mount on the eve.  I took one star off for that just because if I wasn't sitting at an angle, my camera would not point where I wanted it.  I've been running it for a year now without any issues, configuration was easy but keep in mind that the ease and functionality is only as good as your WiFi signal, I added another access point in my network to accommodate the distance from my AP to the garage.  Keep that in mind when setting this device up, it probably isn't the quality of the device but the quality of your WiFi signal.  I've never had the image drop or go black.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jul 2018,Daromo,"This Ring floodlight camera is motion and sound activated and is quite sensitive. You can adjust its sensitivity as you like. At its most sensitive, it will capture and alert you to every movement of every breeze through every leaf near the target range of coverage. You can also adjust it to a people-only alert. I have had the camera set up only a couple of months but it has worked fine.  A really useful feature is that if you are using your smartphone or mobile device to monitor alerts, you can chat with whoever enters the motion range remotely. This is useful when you get a UPS or FedEx package delivery but you're not home, and you can tell the delivery person where to stash your package or to take it back to hold if you need to.  There is also an alarm function that you can set off with your phone, which I gratefully haven't had to use yet, but I'm told that it's super loud. You can also connect this to other Ring devices. Downside is that if you want to store your videos for up to 60 days at a time after the free trial period expires, you have to sign up for a subscription on a monthly or annual basis. Otherwise, there is no storage capability built-in. So far so good.",Very sensitive to motion and sound with great clarity for monitoring on mobile devices

Actually even with the floodlights activated it can only record in grainy blurry black & white. When you call Ring's technical help they tell you it's a known problem that the developers are going to fix in a forth coming update which never comes. This is false advertising. They have even gone to the trouble of taking away the display of the firmware version in the app and replacing it with the words, ""Up to Date"". You have to call technical support to find out what firmware version your camera is on. There is also nowhere on their website where you can find what is the most current firmware version.

Butzin,"I already have two Ring Pro Doorbells and, based on my experience as security devices, I have been considering purchasing the Ring Floodlight Camera.  I finalized the sale after an experience with Ring which exceeded my expectations. We returned home from a trip to discover that our two Ring doorbells had failed.  One was under warranty.  I called to put in a warranty claim on one device, figuring the other was my problem (and after only 18 months of use came as a disappointment).  Low and behold, the support person checked my online history to determine that both devices had not survived an automatic upgrade.  Without hesitation, or pleading on my part, he happily replaced both doorbells, and I received replacements within a couple of days. Based on this experience, I decided to buy the Ring Floodlight, which was easy to install as a replacement for a ""dumb"" camera and floodlight.  The wide angle camera on all three of my ring devices provides a helpful view of my property during our frequent travels. As important as the hardware, is the Ring app.  Provided you have high speed internet on both ends, you can view video of your ring devices from anywhere in the world.  You can also easily set up motion zones and real time or historical surveillance videos.  You'll receive audible notification on your smartphone when motion is detected during the time you've set for surveillance. Historical surveillance videos requires a modest, annual fee. Both the Ring doorbells and floodlight offer two way audio. The floodlight has a siren that can be activated remotely. As an example, say that there is a suspicious person within range of the motion detection area and  the custom surveillance time that you set up on the Ring app for your device(s). You will receive an audible alarm on your phone and a message indicating that motion has been detected.  You can then select the Ring app and get a ""live view"" from your Ring devices.  At this point, you can communicate with the intruder, and, for the Floodlight camera, initiate a loud siren, which will begin in 30 seconds.  (You can also turn off the siren.) If you set it up, the Ring app will also notify you of burglaries in your neighborhood, and, optionally share your experience with burglars and intruders with your neighbors. My understanding is that there is also a 24/7 monitoring service available for $10 per month.  I do my own monitoring, which works find. I particularly like being able to communicate to service personnel when I am away.  I can monitor their working at our home, and answer any questions they might have. I also have a particular use for a ring doorbell that is installed at the entrance to our residential elevator.  A guest rings the bell. I can see him or her and communicate instructions for entering the elevator and ascending to our main living area.  I also have a Kevo lock, so I can visible identify the guess and then unlock the exterior elevator door through my iPhone.  It's pretty neat! The installation kit and instructions makes installation pretty easy, although I'll admit that I'm a handy kind of guy. For the Ring doorbells, my 8 and 16 volt transformers (which are pretty typical) didn't provide enough voltage, so I replaced them with 24 volt models.  (Ring maintains that the doorbells require a minimum of 16 volts, but I had better experience with 24 volts). Also, the floodlight requires a 110 box.  Many, if not most, customers will probably want to hire a qualified electrician to provide the rough in necessary to support Ring devices.",Ring products are great

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2018,Norcross,"I recently purchased two of the Ring Floodlight Cameras for the exterior of my home. The cameras arrived quickly and were packaged very well. As with the other Ring products I have purchased in the past, I was quite impressed with the product packaging, instructions, and included installation tools. INSTALLATION: Installation of the cameras was extremely easy. I started at a location where I had a previously installed exterior wall light. This existing light was removed and I began the process of installing the Ring Floodlight Camera. Ring included picture instructions that were very helpful and easy to follow. Ring really goes through and considers what the end-user is going to need to install the product. A small hook was included with the camera which allowed you to hang the light from the house while installing the wire nuts. This was something that was much appreciated while up on the ladder. All said and done, I was able to uninstall the existing light and install the Ring Floodlight Camera within 20 minutes. SETUP: Setup of the two cameras I purchased was also very simple. You start by scanning a barcode the Ring includes within the installation packet. From there you are guided through the Ring phone app on exactly how to pair the cameras with your router and app. The app pretty much does everything for you and you just have to click ‘Next’ or ‘Continue’ APP: The app on my iPhone works flawlessly and is very easy to navigate. The app allows you to access all of the settings and features that the cameras offer such as activating the siren, watching a live feed of the video, and seeing events that were triggered by the camera. The motion detection area is completely customizable and after adjusting the sensitivity I have not received any false alerts. The camera did alert to raindrops during heavy rainfall, but other than that has been great. PERFORMANCE: The video quality on these cameras is probably an 8/10. The picture is clear enough to distinguish features on passing vehicles and identify passerby’s. Nighttime video is great thanks to the powerful floodlights. Previous cameras that I’ve had performed very poorly at night and it almost looked like you were viewing nothing but darkness. The floodlights are LED and super bright. The light heads are adjustable leaving you the possibility to spread light near or far. OVERALL: As an endnote I am very impressed by the quality of video, the customizability and features accessible through the app, and the performance of the Floodlight as an actual light. The one gripe I have with Ring is that they advertise the ability to view 60 days of footage with their highest protection plan. To my dismay I discovered that this only includes footage of when there is motion triggered, or when you physically choose a live view. In other words you cannot view backlogged video from a certain time when the camera didn’t otherwise detect motion. Other than that I am very satisfied with this purchase.","Great Quality Video, Bright Floodlights"

Any movement from shadows to small birds will set the thing off. Because I have a tiny dog that goes in and out all day long I basically have to turn the notifications off since it will just alert me to motion all day long. I've had days with over 100 motion alerts when I don't turn the notifications off and with the notifications off the camera is pretty much useless.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Aug 2019,Jim Valerio,"The hardest part about installing this camera was choosing the location.  I decided to put it on an outbuilding under the eave, which required extending an electrical wire to a new surface mount box. And then I needed to add a directional WiFi repeater that shot from the house 500' to the outbuilding. Once that was done (4 hours), the rest was running in 10 minutes! The best thing so far about the camera is the phone/compute app. I like the automatic motion alerts, a schedule for disabling them, and that the motion detection region can be reduced from the full camera frame to a smaller area. Videos have caught many visitors (deer, birds, cats, rabbits) as well as the expected visitors.

Now the bugs are out. Even on its lowest sensitivity where it is only suppose to detect people a single strand of a spider web will set it off. It makes it impossible to sleep at night. UPDATE 5-31-19 I changed the rating from 1 to 4. After working with an excellent Level 2 technician, we seemed to have solved a great deal of the problem. The problem was that the White exterior attracted a swarm of bugs around the unit from the reflection of ambient light. A spider built a nest and that was it for my sleep. We changed the unit from the WHITE case to the BLACK case. AMAZON SHOULD START STOCKING IT. It was amazing with the change from a swarm of bugs to almost nothing when we changed to a BLACK case. We tried turning off all the lights on the unit and my house. This did not help. Changing the case from white to black was like day and night. The only problem left was the spider was still there. A new web had been built away from the unit. I sprayed the new web with spider killer and the spider seems gone. I am going to take a risk and have the floodlights come on for 1 minute as this seems to be the recording time after motion is detected. (see below) As additional information, I am in SC where it is hot and humid late Spring through early Fall. It is now late Spring. I will see how this holds up through Summer and Fall. UPDATE 6-1-19 2 suggestions to RING: 1) Turn the light on when the camera turns on when it detects motion. I would set it to turn off after a minute when it stops recording. I do not think there is any reason to have a separate motion sensing system for the lights. Is there an infra-red light that comes on at night? 2) Replace the bulbs with Bug lights.

This is a great product - when it works.  The following features work well: - camera, on demand via wifi - light turns on when user walks in front - from the app you can turn on the light - cool ""neighborhood"" features where you can see clips shared in your area However, the reason I bought this product was the timed lighting.  I wanted this to go on at dusk and off at about 11pm.  It worked for about 3 weeks, then abruptly stopped.  I called support twice, they didn't resolve the issue, just said an update should eventually happen.  I also emailed the CEO, he didn't care. In summary, if the product did what it said it would, it would be 5 stars.  But don't count on it, or the customer support.","Timed Lighting Feature Didn't Work, But Now Fixed"
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jun 2019,Jeremiah G.,"The camera provides good image of you have your router near by the camera.  Because the camera uses older 2.4 GHz WiFi tech it is very susceptible to interference and can't take advantage of new beam forming MU-MIMO technology like their RingPro doorbell can. Consequently, signal degradation happens quickly over distance and I found the only resolution was to move the router to near the wall of the Ring Floodlight. The RingPro doorbell, on the other hand, uses 5 GHz WiFi, which in principle should be more distance dependent, but because there's a lot less interference and because my routers can do beam forming, it works just fine further away. My recommendation is to NOT buy this product until ring updates it with a 5 GHz radio like their RingPro doorbell *if* you have a largish home that is clad in brick or metal siding. If you do, you may have to invest in a mesh WiFi network or extenders (which is what we ultimately did) The night vision is poor. The floodlights should have IR lights in them that are always on to record at night and then turn the white lights on during motion. Because night vision is poor, is doesn't detect motion well at night. The picture quality is moderate. From my floodlight I was able to get ~20 Mb up and down, so I would expect it to be better. Overall, this is an inferior product as compared to their RingPro doorbell, which has been outstanding. WiFi issues, moderate camera resolution, and poor night vision make this well below the value proposition for this product. It is safe to pass on this until an updated version is released or go with a competitor altogether.",Big House? Prepare to move your router
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Sep 2017,Jaz,In my new home I can't see my front driveway from any window. I needed a way to see my driveway for security reasons and piece of mind. At first I was hesitant to buy a Ring product because of complaints of wifi connections being poor with their products and cam feed response times being too long. After reading hundreds of reviews of Ring products I guessed it was people's Wifi setups causing the issue and not Ring products. I bought a new mesh router and made sure my wifi speeds were good at the location I was installing the Floodlight Cam. Purchased the Floodlight Cam and installed it myself following Rings excellent installation videos. Took 30 minutes. I couldn't be happier with the Ring Floodlight Cam and the Ring App. Excellent Cam feed picture Fast picture response time when receiving motion alerts No false motion alerts Floodlights work well Cloud storage of every alert Don't hesitate to buy this great security cam like I did.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Mar 2019,DJW,"As a standard flood light with motion detection, it works just fine. Install is simple if you're replacing an existing 110V system. LEDs are plenty bright enough and the adjustable on/off delay works as expected. The camera does record movement and the motion detection has adjustable sensitivity. Video storage is acceptable and  monthly fee is priced very reasonably. The transfer range however of the video from the device to the wifi is absurdly short, so you will absolutely need a booster, so make sure you order them together. At that your booster will still need to be very close to the light, mine is literally on the other side of the wall and then needs to be within range of your wireless router (the booster does not have a hard-wired option). The delay in the system is much too slow to make it useful as a ""door bell"", so if you're going to use it for security it works fine and will notify you immediately, but by the time it connects the video to your phone, it's not very useful for the 2-way audio feature, unless you just want to use it to call the kids in for dinner.",Depends on what you want it to do

I installed my Ring with no problems and it started working immediately.  I began to notice that it would freeze up at .08 secs into the playback.  The app's device health said my signal strength was good but obviously it wasn't great.  The phone company told me that it's hard for Wifi to pass through metal or steel doors.  Since my wifi had to pass through a steel door and a metal garage door I figured that was my problem.  So I purchased a wired Access Point and installed it on the wall that held my Ring on the outside.  I didn't figure I could get any better Wifi connection than that.  Still the same problem.  I ran the test that Ring has available to check your upload and download speeds.  My speeds were download 2.83 and upload of .80.  So next I called the phone company and increased my internet speed to 6 and figured out THAT was the problem.  Because my internet speed was only at 3, it couldn't upload or download the video fast enough to have continuous playback.  Now that I have all the bugs worked out, it is running flawlessly. Also, you will have to purchase the $30 a yr fee to see the recordings.  There is no way you will be able to see every movement the camera catches while it's happening live, because we all have to sleep sometime. It is worth the money, hands down.",Helpful tips for your Ring products.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2019,JMT Cairn,"I have another brand of camera too.  I do like them.  However, we had a strange guy sneaking around the side of our house which was out of camera range for the cameras which needed to be plugged in.  I could have spoken to him through the existing camera but it was too far for him to hear.  That was enough to get me to finally change out our old, hard-wired floodlight that didn't work anyway.  I got this Ring Floodlight Camera to fill that gap.  It was super easy to install... only took a few minutes actually.  I like the camera quality, the floodlight is bright and can be remotely turned on via the app.  I also like that if creepy guy comes back, I can talk to him through the camera (which is close enough to the side of the house for him to hear).

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2019,Nathan,"The motion detection has some issues for me. For one, I found that the night vision was attracting too many bugs near the camera and was giving me a lot of false alarms. That's not necessarily the fault of Ring as I'm sure I'm one of the few people with an issue like this since mine is located in a different part than directly next to the house. I got a bug zapper which has greatly reduced these false occurrences. But one issue that I do think Ring is responsible for is not always detecting movement when it should. I noticed a flyer stuck in my gate in the zone I set up for motion detecting and I see no recordings of this taking place at the time it should have happened. One minute it's not there and the next it's there. Someone walked up to my gate and placed this there and Ring didn't catch that. It's quite unbelievable and I'm a bit peeved realizing that had I really needed that footage. My settings are set to the default level, right in the middle, for motion detecting. It always picks up me as a person and my vehicle, but it couldn't pick this up which is worrisome. Another thing is that, I'd say about half the time, there is a delay between alert and a motion detection. Sometimes it is right on the ball, I've walked in front of it and it immediately sent me an alert and then other times I walk in front of it and when I'm out of view, it sends an alert which would be pointless if you had an intruder who got through and are looking at the live view. But, in Ring's defense, if you do go back one recording, you will see whatever triggered the alert there, just not on live during these rare times. The other issue is with the connectivity. Again, my floodlight is positioned a little ways away from our home but I saw that Ring recommends, even in the app it recommended it, getting the Ring Chime Pro which is supposed to extend the network solely for the floodlight. I read other negative reviews on the Chime Pro and agree after my own experience with it. It did not work and it did not make the connection any better for the floodlight. However, I did pick up a slightly more expensive Netgear extender that is doing the job fairly well. I still have some minor glitches here and there, mostly with live view, but they're few and far between and mostly just in a slight pixelation here and there. Recordings are nearly unnoticeable. I assume this is because the floodlight sends the video after recording it and there aren't much buffering issues there. I was jailbroken for a while and for some reason, there is some issue with jailbroken iPhone and iPad seeing Live view. Most times, it simply wouldn't even let me see the footage. So if you're jailbroken, do keep this in mind that you might experience issues. Since unjailbreaking, I am no longer having any issues. Not sure why, but it did happen. The sound was a major factor for me in buying this and being able to communicate with people who arrive to this gate. The speaker is not very loud, at least for our area, where there is a slightly busy road nearby. I had an Amazon delivery a few weeks ago and wanted to tell the driver where to place the packages. Either they were ignoring me or they couldn't hear me. I'm leaning more towards the latter because it didn't seem like they could hear me at all, not even a faint sound. I have had other people talk to me over this speaker. At first I heard a faint voice from a few yards away and when I got closer I could hear the camera much better. It was a bit difficult with the noisy traffic for me to hear them and them to hear me, but we eventually were able to conclude our conversation. If we were in a much quieter area, I'm sure it wouldn't be as bad as it is here. So take this into consideration for yourself. Overall, I'm sort of satisfied with this. It has its issues but I'm finding ways around each of them and becoming more and more satisfied. One thing to also note is that if you let your subscription lapse, you will lose any previous footage that you have not saved from the cloud. Anything stored in the cloud will be gone, even if you restore the subscription shortly after. So if you had a break-in and now want to get past cloud footage, you won't be able to get it by just renewing your subscription. The subscription must be active at the time of the break-in for it to be accessible in the cloud, if that makes sense.",Decent but with some faults

Then I start seeing intermittent problems with video recording for only 20 seconds or freezing after 20 seconds then say at 50 seconds restarts or after 20 seconds next 40 seconds goes black. I contacted ring support who blamed the WiFi signal being too weak - Strange as camera is only 20 feet from the router and ring doorbell camera which is same distance with a solid bock wall in between it and router has stronger signal and works just fine. Long story short after months of issues, 2 new routers I still have the same problems only they are getting worse to the point the floodlight camera is useless. Just came off the phone with Ring support again and told the same thing - WiFi to weak (total rubbish) I think the issue is I live in Florida and the camera is on a South facing wall and the heat has taken its toll on the equipment and the equipment is now faulty. Rings solution - sending a WiFi extender (not sure where I can put that in the 20 feet between router and camera). With all their messing around the device is now outside of their 12 month warranty. Lets hope they keep records of my contact with support (as I have) when I demand a new unit after their WiFi extender does not fix the issue ! EDIT After the wireless extender was installed the RSSI reading at the camera went from -60 range to -50 range and the lock ups and freezing has stopped for now so it does seem the device is very sensitive to the wifi strength it receives.

But can you mount this to your soffit or eave?  Yes, but you may not like the results.  The Ring Floodlight Camera is designed to be mounted on a vertical surface.  Some owners mount this on a horizontal surface, such as on the horizontal soffit under the eave.  However, this violates the installation instructions provided by Ring, which state: ""When mounted at 9 feet off the ground, with the motion detector parallel to the ground, the motion sensor is optimized to detect human-sized objects at up to 30 feet.""  The key here is the part ""with the motion detector parallel to the ground"".  The motion sensor is mounted with the camera on an adjustable ball joint, but the adjustment is limited to approximately plus or minus 15 degrees.  With the floodlight cam mounted on a vertical surface, plus or minus 15 degrees is adequate to achieve the desired performance.  With the floodlight cam mounted on a horizontal surface, plus or minus 15 degrees is about 30 degrees short of what you need to position the motion sensor parallel to the ground.  In other words, your camera will be pointed downward much farther than the manufacturer intended, and your motion sensor will not operate optimally, i.e., it will not detect moving objects until they are right next to your home.  Some owners are happy with this sub-optimal installation, hence the number of conflicting responses to the question. The second most disappointing thing about this camera is the app.  It takes far too long for your push notifications to arrive on your phone.  Most the time when I receive a push notification and I fire up my cameras whatever set them off is long gone.  Once the video is uploaded to the cloud you can go back and view the events you missed, but none of this is what I would call real time.  Sadly, this state of affairs seems par for the industry.  I just hope that Ring puts some serious investment into improving their streaming performance.  Customers expect the power to monitor their home in real time.

I almost didn't buy this because of reviews that said the spotlight doesn't work at night - or the camera didn't detect motion. Let me assure you if you're considering this device - everything works just as it should. Our son helped us install it and showed us how to use the Ring app on my iphone and create an account on my laptop. I like that you can use the app to define the area in which you want it to watch for motion. We have it watching to just before the end of our 40 foot driveway. We have it set halfway between the least and most sensitive settings and sometimes it detects motion if a car goes by with high beams on, so if I want I can either move the detection zone back a bit or change the sensitivity setting. It detects any motion - when we walk out to the end of the driveway to get the mail, when we back out of the garage or anyone drives into the driveway, when a cat is prowling in the middle of the night.  The light only comes on at night and you can set it for how long to stay on. You can snooze motion detection if you're going to be working near the camera. We can watch the video on our laptop or phone or select ""live view"" at any time to see what's happening right now. There is also a mic that picks up sound so we can talk to the person outside.

I was warned here to not buy this thing and I bought it anyway because it was a cyber Monday sale or something.  I decided to keep the thing, but it's supposed to have people only triggering mode and a lot of people, including me, report it picking up on small animals. Also, its afraid of its own reflection...anything shiny will cause it to alarm at night when the lights come on. I had to cover a stainless top table with black plastic to get it to stop going off all night when the lights come on...then the next question is, why are the lights always coming on when there is nothing to trigger them? Also, it seems rain, bugs, random stuff floating by it will also trigger an alert when the lights go on, again, for no apparent reason. I cant count on this device for peaceful security at night because it will wake me up with false alarms, so its completely useless for that because I have to turn do not disturb on my phone or leave the phone out of the bedroom if I want to be sure I wont be woken up for no good reason in the middle of the night. Only reason I kept the light/camera is it gives me the ability to look out that side of the house where otherwise there is only one window, far away from the living room you can look that way. When my driveway alarms go off, I can look through that camera to see whats going on without running all the way to that window. Also, I can look through the camera when I'm not home and during the daytime it picks up human activity and alerts me.

I can check in on him coming and going from his walks and even watch him watering his plants.  I'm SOLD.  We have a fancy, security/camera system.  It takes up a ton of room in my office with all the monitor/HD receiver, etc. but those hardwired cameras are not near as good as RING! Then you have to scroll through the recording to find an incident which is time consuming and a pain in the butt!  I've decided we're ditching the ""security system"" and switching to just RING!  Right now I can monitor the entire exterior of my home, no matter where I am, hit an alarm if I need to and even ""make a comment"" if need be. Next I'll be purchasing a few ""Stick-up Cams"" for the inside of the house for added security and to watch the dog of course! I can store videos and monitor security on ALL devices for a year at $100.00.  Well worth the money.  ALL my RING products are very well made, excellent camera/pic quality, video playback is great, monitoring via the app is spot on and so easy.  Actually, the entire setup for all RING products is so, so easy!!!  Stop searching and join the RING family. You won't be disappointed!!!!",Ditching the FANCY security system for RING!!!!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Aug 2017,Matthew A. Mizenko,"I got this to augment a bunch of indoor and outdoor Nest cams I have as well as replace a crappy old mercury light. Mostly, I could not be happier. The hardware is great - easy install (they even provide tools as well as a hanger to put the light on while you are up on a ladder doing the wiring) super clear wide-angle video, lights are nice and bright, motion detection is rock solid, etc. Also, $3/mo per camera or $10/mo for unlimited is a MUCH better price than Nest (and really, where Nest ought to be - Nest pretty much a rip-off at the current price). Where it could use some improvement is on the software. It would be really nice to have something of a timeline view, to be able to see into the past without it being associated to a specific detection event. Also, it seems to take a while for the video to spin up and also turn off. The ""red phone"" would appear to be a hang-up button, which I guess it does do, but also doubles as the ""close the video"" button which is not immediately obvious. A big ""X"" somewhere would be better. Overall though, really happy with this.","Solid HW, SW could be improved a bit."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Aug 2020,DJ10tre,"Easy to install if you already have a light outside of your front door (which is where my camera is located). I know nothing about electricity and just followed the video instructions. Great picture, I watch from my Samsung cell phone frequently. Easy to get started, and with my current wifi provider(Xfinity). I like the adjustable zones, you can zoom, set motion for people only and snooze alerts. Night mode is in color.. not sure if that is because of the second light in the carport or not (I have seen complaints from others that night vision is in black and white). I keep that second light on, the same hours as the camera. Features are very easy to use. Changing the time that the camera light turns on and off is very easy. I pay for the lowest subscription, can't remember why. Enjoy being able to go back and review all incidents that set off motion while I was not home. You can also turn the sound outside on, and choose to turn on the communicator to talk to the person at the door, or set off an annoying alarm sound. I would highly recommend, if you don't want to pay an alarm company or other provider to monitor cameras for you. I will definitely purchase additional Ring products. I was able to utilize the payment plan that Amazon offers, and that helped as well.",Excellent camera/light system for the price
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2019,Buffy,"I'll start by saying that I am not a technician or electrician. And for me, this was a breeze to install, setup and get working right out of the box. Everything you need for installation is included but I used my own tools anyway. The lights are bright and light our whole back yard. They can be adjusted up, down,  right and left so you can customize the beam direction to your liking. You can set the light on or off in the Ring app. The light will come on when motion is detected but only when it is dark outside. This saves energy costs dramatically. The lights cannot be controlled via Alexa and there is only one brightness level for those used to Hue lights. After installation the camera connected right away to the Ring app and Alexa. I could view the camera on my Echo Dot on my office desk and even on my TV with Fire Cube connected. The quality is great! I just said ""Echo, show me the back yard camera"" and it switched on my TV and opened the camera. This does require the RING skill to be enabled and connected, but that was easy and it's free! Alerts sing across my Alexa devices throughout the house whenever there is movement at my front door or back yard based on my preferred motion settings within the Ring app. This can all be customized within the app. The sensitivity, advanced motion zones and more. These alerts can be turned off and on as you prefer but cannot be controlled via Alexa routines. This is something I hope to see in future updates. These cameras have given us the peace of mind we needed after a stranger was noticed casing our house this holiday season. They do require good wifi and most issues you see here can be resolved by that alone. The one thing I would love to see is continuous viewing/monitoring without being timed out of the app after 10 minutes. Other than that, Ring has a great product and service that I would recommend to anyone looking for added security for their home. If you are on the fence about getting these cameras like I was, I can say they are worth their weight in gold and you should go for it!",A Camera and Light Worth Installing
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2017,TechW,"I am an experienced DIYer. Installation was easy. Configuration of the zone to monitor motion was also easy and precise. I did have to turn down the sensitivity to people only as in the late afternoon, shadows of the trees being blown by the wind would set it off. It is fine now. The lights work well for the area I needed covered. The video is very clear, both night and day. Night vision works well in black and white, but I was pleasantly surprised when it switched to color at night once the lights were on. It looked great! Frankly, it works and looks better than my Ring Pro Doorbell. And it is pretty good. It is worth getting the hard wired cameras rather than the battery operated ones if you can possibly do so. They have more / better features which you may not be aware of it you don't read up on each product carefully. I definitely recommend the Floodlight Cam.","Great video, easy installation"
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Feb 2020,AndAnotherThing,"Well, we've just completed round one of ""Ringing"" our house with the installation of two of the Floodlight Security Cams. Installation and setup were both painless and trouble free. The product itself as well as its integration with the Ring app are exemplary. I've had quality control problems with Ring — the company replaced a doorbell and two chimes — but the customer service is superb. I've never had to wait as much as five minutes to speak to a live representative and chat availability has been even better. Ring's products are sophisticated and cutting edge — there will be problems. They seem tacitly to acknowledge this and counter with terrific product support. One nit to pick: Integration with Alexa is not as seamless as it could be. Because Alexa treats this product as a ""camera"" and not as a ""light,"" you won't be able to use the Alexa app to turn the floodlights off and on. That's a minor cavil, but one I thought I should share. Otherwise, now that we're fully up and running with all sides of our house protected by Ring security products, we couldn't be more pleased.",I'm impressed!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Mar 2018,APJones,"Good/Great: This is a very high-quality flood light. The construction is very solid. On my iOS device, the app works flawlessly on WiFi or LTE. It’s beautifully packaged, and it includes everything you need to install, even the screwdriver. There are no instructions for eve mounting, but it’s all over YouTube, etc. Setup is a breeze. I love the customizable motion zones. All settings are very granular. They’ve thought of almost everything there. Settings are VERY refined. Notifications are immediate, and IFTTT integration works perfectly. I like the color temperature because it’s not the typical cold blue light of most LED lights. The Bad: Mounted under an eve, it does not look as elegant as the press photos of the wall-mounted light. It’s rather protruded-looking and very obvious. I would prefer a camera that was more streamlined, but that’s my preference. The speaker/microphone part is not very clear, but I’m sure that will change since Amazon purchased Ring. A friendly interaction with the voice feature now is like a crazy person screaming at a roof to onlookers. This is a place Amazon/Alexa excels with multiple microphones. I hope this advances soon. The Ugly: Ring does NOT currently integrate with Google Assistant. It was listed device by Google on 3/16/18, but Ring confirmed its no longer available.  Also, you can’t view Ring on 1st gen Fire Sticks. Conclusion: Overall, this an amazing device for an Alexa household. For Google, probably go with the Nest products. I love both, but overall I’m a google household, and I’ve never been disappointed. If Amazon had never purchased Ring and they worked with google, I think I would be a 5 star customer.  Nest cameras seem like the next solution.","Good, bad, and ugly."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2018,Rim,"UPGRADED REVIEW: They finally fixed the Light Schedule and it seems to be working as expected again.  I took off one star from my original review since it took them two months to fix this issue. DOWNGRADED REVIEW: I noticed in early June that the Floodlight Cam light was turned off even though the Light Schedule I set should have had it turned on.  I created a support ticket.  At first, from seeing video during the time it should still be on, I saw that the light was off and it would turn on because of motion sensing.  Later on, I would be returning home late at night and I could see the Floodlight Cam light was off when it should be on.  This is not good for security purposes, which is the primary reason I bought this.  I'm considering putting the Phillips Hue bulb I was using before, because at least it turned on and stayed on during the times I set it to.  I was also considering spending $500 on the Ring Home Security line of products but I've put that on hold because of how the Floodlight Cam issues is being handled (or not handled). I created a support ticket on June 18, 2019, and went through some basic troubleshooting but it is still not fixed.  I even gave them a chance to fix it before I changed this Amazon review but all they say is they're still investigating the issue.  So here I am, downgrading my review. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I wanted the Ring Doorbell but I don't have the electric wiring for a doorbell and didn't want to get the battery-operated one so I decided to replace my front door light with the Ring Floodlight and I am very happy with it.  It's bright enough to light up my walkway and driveway (fits two car lengths) which was a plus for me, though the light does get in your eyes as you get to the door.  A higher placement would be better but I did not want to change my wiring.  But the brightness really helps in the video quality.  A friend has the Ring doorbell and I assume a normal front door light and when it's dark out, his videos almost look black and white.  Meanwhile, with the bright floodlight, my videos are in color.  We've compared videos and he agrees my videos look so much better. The app is easy to use, the videos are pretty good quality, motion detection works well and I really like the neighborhood alerts (where other Ring users near you and authorities can post suspicious activity).  I had to tweak a bunch of things to get it to my preference but once I did, it's been very helpful and provides good peace of mind.  When I work from home, it's great to know when a package has been delivered so I can get it pretty soon so it doesn't sit there long to prevent thievery.  When on travel, I would get notifications when my mail arrived and when squirrels (tweakable) would run across my yard so it was nice to see my house hadn't burned down. :p One wish list item, which I need to tell Ring, is to be able to adjust the color of the light itself (like smart bulbs by Hue).  The reason is, the floodlight white light attracts moths during warmer months which trigger the motion detection alert.  A light that is more yellow doesn't attract moths as much.  Or its bulb should already come with a color that doesn't attract moths.",Mostly happy with it except it took them two months to fix an issue

However, I find better pricing of Ring products direct from Ring.com than through Amazon especially when they are having sales.  It's not perfect, but close enough for my purposes.  I have the $100 annual monitoring service which gives me cloud pictures of all my Ring cams (4) + alarm system monitoring.  This is $100 a year which is far less costly than any other doorbell or cam system out there.  We had SimpliSafe alarm system previously and it was costing $25 a month for monitoring service.  I cancelled that --- threw away the alarm equipment and not having the monthly fees associated with it actually paid for the new Ring Alarm within a little over a year.  You do the math and you will realize that the limitations of every doorbell cam monitoring service costs are.  Compare that to the $100 annual charge by Ring whether you have one device or 30 of them, it's only $100 total a year.  It's a no brainer to me.

I unfortunately did not and neither did any of my neighbors. I started to do some research and was really intrigued by the idea of a floodlight with a camera as it's mounted right above my garage/driveway. Black Friday this ear had a great deal, and with the theft, I thought it was a perfect time to purchase one and I'm beyond happy with it so far! Installation was a breeze (I think it took me longer to read the directions and watch the videos than it did to put in) and once it was up it looked great. I had an issue right off the bat however with wi-fi signal, as I've seen many others have, so I went out and purchased an extender as another access point between my router and the camera. As soon as that went in it was good to go and as my wife said, I'm watching my new favorite channel...a video image of my driveway!

My driveway is approximately 150 Feet long. The amazing camera shows a very clear picture of my garage door, my back patio, the side and rear entrance to my home, and the entire driveway all the way to the street.  I can also see parts of my neighbors homes adjacent to mine. The motion detection picks up everything from a person/car on my driveway to rabbits and squirrels on the driveway or back yard.  I receive an email notification which I can click to review a short video showing the motion. My only criticism is the lighting goes on and off frequently, unless I adjust the light setting zone to be VERY close and narrow to the device itself.  I suspect it's because I have it mounted under the eve instead of a vertical surface.  A bit of a design flaw, however overall this device is perfect for my use.

The motion detection is superb withe the video clip starting before the moving object enters the video.  The resolution and range of view are excellent.  The android App is so easy to use but the iPhone version is not easy to locate or search for video clips.  I've owned Arlo for a few years and they are crap.

Alderson,"We have had this floodlight for about 6 months, and have not had any trouble with it. The flaw has nothing to do with the operation or the mechanics of the camera or the floodlight. The flaw is the way that alerts are handled in the app on an iPhone. We purchased the Ring Floodlight because someone had tried to break into my truck. I just realized that the Ring, however, has given me a false sense of security, because there is no way I will receive an alert after I have gone to bed. I have my iPhone set to suppress alerts between 10pm and 7am so as not to be awakened every time an app (ESPN, Bleacher Report, Weather, News, Calendar, etc.) sends an alert. There apparently is no setting for the Ring app to override this suppression. So I am faced with the choice between receiving Ring alerts (the only way it is useful) or getting a good night's sleep (the only way I am useful). I might as well always sleep in the truck, or stand watch at the front window all night. Until the ios app is rewritten to allow it to override the alert suppression, the floodlight and its app are worthless.",Major Flaw With the System

This was very easy to do. Picture quality is excellent, both at night and day.

Physical installation wasn't hard at all. We did have an issue connecting to the wifi. Followed all of the steps as required but it wouldn't connect. Don't ask me how it got fixed but apparently turning the power off and then back on did the trick. Has an excellent picture and the manual zone settings are outstanding. I have the lights set to come on for motion and it has reset on it's own to stay on all of the time. That's happened several times and gets frustrating. Also, the camera lag time is a flaw. Have had several motion alerts and by the time the camera came on and started recording it was too late. You get 1 free month of video recording, after that you have to pay $3 a month for 1 camera or $10 a month for multiple cameras. It doesn't appear to give the option of saving videos on your own device that I have found yet. If I'm wrong about that please let me know. The monthly fees combined with the purchase price is high in my opinion.

The lights and sirens worked. Eventhough the signal wasn't strong It worked every time I went into my driveway and also showed seconds before.  Cool!  Then I found out it only senses motion up to 30 feet eventhough I set the zone further than 30 feet.  My fault.  Should have checked the distance before buying.  Anyway. 2 Things that I noticed. 1- Is the motion triggered on 2 or more occasions which I briefly looked at and when I went to look back to view again I couldn't find it.  I didn't delete.  2- I received a package at my door.  The motion didn't detect anything (forgot to mention I have the ring doorbell 2 which didn't detect motion either and the signal was good)  I then bought a wifi extender because the signal wasn't good as I mentioned for the front camera.

The light was scheduled to turn on at 6 p.m. daily, but it always came on at noon every day. Finally, I set the schedule to turn the lights on at (12a.m.) midnight because it always came on 6 hours early which means the floodlight clock is 6 hours ahead of real time.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2019,Jayden17,"The good: 1. Replaces existing hard-wired flood light - comes with tools and various mounting options and different screw sizes to fit almost any existing mounting box. I removed the old one and installed mine in 15 minutes. 2. The picture quality is excellent, you can even zoom in and see pretty far out into the road/neighbors yards 150-200' away. 3. The motion alerts zones/sensitivity feature is great. You can choose the exact area that you want to monitor for motion 4. You can link this with other ring devices in the app - for instance I have linked my front ring doorbell to this floodlight so that if my ring doorbell senses motion it will turn on the flood light. This greatly increases my motion coverage on the front of my house, where my floodlight can't see. 5. Light is very bright - lights up my driveway nicely even mounted 20' up above the garage, which is the main goal of the floodlight. The OK: 1. The alarm function is not super loud, not sure if it's due to the location I have it mounted. You can hear it, but it's not blazing loud. I think it will still scare off intruders if it comes to it. 2. The 2-way talk seems to be VERY quiet - I cannot have a conversation with someone though this - however that was not the intent for me, so I don't care about it. However for others who may intend to use this feature - note that the volume is very low from the floodlight speaker and people outside will not hear it unless they are very close. However from the app you can hear voices outside pretty clearly. This could be due to mounting location. The bad: 1. The motion alerts zones and light sensor options are separate. This could be a good feature if you wanted to receive motion alerts but not have the light go on. For me this doesn't make much sense. If any motion is sensed I want the light to go on, period - which is not the case here. The light sensor is separate and only has 3 zones, of which you can turn on or off and adjust the distance you want to sense for all 3 (but not individually). Both the motion alerts and light sensors settings are completely different. Why? I just don't get what use-case this was intended for. I would think there would only be one motion sensor and you maybe can maybe setup different zones. For example: One range would provide alerts, the other range would turn on the light - Or you can have a singular range that would provide alerts and turn on the light. Why have 2 different sensors within this unit. It seems like it was over-engineered. Can the motion alert sensor not turn on the light - that doesn't make sense since when I link this with my doorbell, the doorbell sensor can turn on the light. At least give me an option in the app to link the floodlight motion alert sensor to the floodlight light. 2. The motion alert sensor is a little finnicky. My driveway is 150' long and I'm not sure it will sense to the end of the driveway even though I have it selected when I create the zone. There seems to be times when I can walk in the driveway and not set it off, then other times it goes off right away. 3. The light sensor options are finnicky as well. I turned off the zone on the left so that my flag will not set off the light when it's windy. I then increased the range a little bit so I could pick up motion further out to turn the lights on and it then seems to pick up the flag moving again. I spent probably a couple of hours tweaking settings and walking around my driveway like an idiot to figure this thing out. It's a little clunky and I'm hoping future app updates / software updates will fix this. I did get it to a decent spot where it will not turn on every time the flag moves. Also rain and bugs seems to set it off. So there's that as well. 4. It will only work in hard-wired locations so look at the other lighting options if you don't have an existing floodlight you're looking to replace (or have an electrician run a wire / install a box for it). Overall: I really like this floodlight and I'm hoping some future software / app updates will adjust some of the settings issues I've been having with the sensors. I also like that I can link this to my doorbell and have the doorbell turn the light on if someone walks in part of the front yard where the floodlight can't see. Additionally I'll be adding the path lights and step lights to the front of my house and I'll bridge them to this floodlight for increased lighting and security. I will then do the same in the back. I have a ring doorbell in the back, I will be replacing the existing floodlight with another one of these and then add some additional path lighting back there. This is in addition to the security system I have and I really feel like this is an integrated part of the security system now. I want to add a door lock and a smart plug as well, so that if any of my motion sensors pick up motion at night I can have an interior light turn on. And the door lock could automatically set my alarm when locked. I give this 4 stars - will update to 5 stars when I can either figure out the motion/light sensors or after updates fix my issues.","Great replacement for existing floodlight, with some caveats"

I have three different smart camera brands in my house and if these had a feature where you could record 24/7 and go back at any time to see what happen, they would be my favorite. The install was so simple and the motion detection works amazing, as long as you make sure to set the settings correctly to your surroundings. I guarantee one of the reasons people are getting false alerts is cause of user error. They are nice and bright also.

I set up a second access point on the network specifically for Ring floodlight, doorbell, and chime.  Nothing else even touches that access point. Even with that, I get low readings on ring products unless I actually open the door.  The product is good when it works, but IMO needs work to make the internals work with all types of houses. What I ended up doing was taking this OFF chime pro .  Would you believe it works better when not connected to that thing?  Signals are still not that fantastic but at least more consistent! I can be in the garden, the front of my house by the street, and still get strong wifi signal on my laptop computer, tablet and even my phone. Putting it up was easy, I took the old light down (make sure you have the power off of course!) and put this one its place in about 30 minutes.  I do like this better than the old light but if I wanted just a flood I wouldn't have spent over 100 bucks for it.

She has a security cam system, but only sees things upon review, not during the act. I decided to get her one which she could use as a supplement to her existing system, a supplement that would allow her to interrupt a burgle from the safety of the inside of her home. I also wanted to get one for myself because we have a backyard that has cable and electrical trunk boxes in it and have technicians come and go whether we are home or not. I want to know who is in my backyard and why. This Ring Floodlight Cam works PERFECTLY!!! I love it and plan on getting a couple more for other areas of the property.

These are great. I like the convenience of simply replacing a regular floodlight to add a camera. The viewing angle is wider than I expected and picture quality is great. I am still playing with the sensitivity to not pick up night spiders (yes, it is that sensitive) and cats. The lights are very bright and work well. I have used them to finish mowing the lawn when daylight ran out. I did purchase a simple range extender to put in my garage to improve the quality of reception for the one I have on my driveway. I did not buy the Ring brand extender, so not sure how well that one works, but the one I got solved any issues. I do recommend this product. I would rate myself above average with electrical work, but these are simple to install if you have ever replaced a light fixture. The ONLY complaint I would have on these, is if you lose connection or need to change it, you may have to push a button on top of the unit. Which in my case, involves getting a ladder to reach it. Overall I am quite satisfied. I plan to buy another floodlight, at some point, to complete my perimeter.

Say you need to see what's going on around your house - so you go to open the app to see the live feed. Oh, sorry, Ring doesn't allow you to go to the live view quickly. They default to your past history events. It requires several clicks to get to your live view (you know, something you buy security cameras for.)

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jun 2019,Abby TD,"Anyone thinking of buying and installing this camera should be aware of some issues you might run into.  I am sure everyone's experience can be slightly different, but I wanted to share what I experienced in case this will help others. I purchased the wired version of the Ring Floodlight Camera. Before installing the Ring Floodlight camera, I checked our WIFI router WIFI signal to the outside of the house where the camera would be placed.  It meets the minimum of 1 MB/s - 2 MB/s.  No issues with WIFI signal reaching the camera. After a very painful installation, the camera is working well.  I have 0 complaints about the app or camera function.  I downloaded the ring app to my iPhone and paired up the ring floodlight in 2 minutes after wiring it up. I feel it has a very good motion sensor.  I am fine with that it only records when it detects movement.  For me, notifications are fast and the live view has very little lag when testing it out at home. Now the bad regarding the installation: In general, the hardware provided and instructions are great.  However, I ran into 2 issues when I installed the unit that could be a problem for others too.  This is why I am detailing those out. First, I feel the Ring factory had a weak crimp on the floodlight bare ground wire that connects it to the ground screw inside the floodlight housing.  After hanging up the floodlight with the supplied hook to avoid tension on the wires, I proceeded to wire everything up.  I was wiring up the floodlight bare ground wire to the Ring mounting plate grounding lug per the instructions, the ground wire pulled completely loose from the crimp without hardly any force at all.  Maybe this was just a one-off weaker crimp since crimping can have some variation from any factory.  I crimped a new extra terminal I happened to have on hand and screwed it back in place inside the floodlight housing.  Hopefully, this will not likely happen for others.  Be very careful and avoid applying any tension to the ground wire crimp. Second, the Ring supplied wire nuts that came with my Ring floodlight do not fit inside the housing flush and interfere with the installation.  When looking at the picture, you will notice the wire nut sits proud inside the housing and not flush.  The Ring floodlight comes with many wires inside the unit to connect two lights and camera to your house wiring, so not much room is available for wire nuts.  I am sure someone with better skills than me can invest the time and patience to position all 1 million wires around the small gap at the edge to arrive at the perfect position, but this is not realistic for my average skills.  I noticed this when trying to bolt it back up and it would not fit flush at all.  So, I had to dig through my personal supplies and find smaller wire nuts to fit.  I could have also crimped the wires together for the installation but crimping household wires actually screws things up in the long term.  I want to be able to easily hook back up our old light if something goes wrong.  When you crimp, then the only way to remove the crimp is to cut wires which then leaves them too short for hooking anything else up. It is always possible I am not as skilled as I should be, so I am not trying to slander the company at all.  I just want to share the facts of my experience for others since this is what Amazon is all about. At the end of the day, I would not hesitate to buy another Ring product.  For me, as long as something works well, I can work on getting better with the installation process. Hope this reviews helps others.","Great working security camera and floodlight, but installation may be painful"

Had some minor issues in the beginning like the video image not changing to color when the lights came on, resetting the camera fixed that.  Once in a while the app has issues connecting to the camera or cloud when trying to view previous or live video. I got this over the Nest because this has the combo light and mounted into an existing wall fixture, plus it has the siren.  Haven't had to use it yet fortunately. I docked a star because their mounts for this are designed for plastic junction boxes and won't fit metal boxes found in older homes that are smaller in diameter.  I had to leave the old mounting bracket from my floodlight attached to the box, then secure the Ring mount to the old bracket so they were layered, but then I could only use 2 screws total because of hole alignment issues but it's secure overall.  I did tell Ring customer service about it.  They try to include everything you'd need to install this in the box except they didn't account for old houses.

I knew it was the delivery person, because of the timing of the chimes. The software Ring uses is also quite Expert, and navigating through out is easy.  Thank you Ring!",Update - Impressive Customer Service!  Have become a Ring fanatic!!!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jun 2019,GLABSr,"In three words, I love it. The video quality is exceptional. There are a lot of options regarding motion control and lighting  usage. I use it to monitor my backyard  and so far so good. The only cons are the fact that the motion detection is a little too sensitive. I had to put it on the people only mode, but even in that option large moths have activated the camera. And I think the flood lights might work better with yellow/amber lighting instead of the bright white. Acts like a magnet for bugs! I have resorted to setting lights on only when motion detected.",App and camera works great!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Nov 2018,Nathan Brooks,"*** UPDATE *** I need to recant my review below which I initially gave one star. As it turns out, the wiring in my attic which appears to have been done by the DIYer, was indeed not the best.. surprise. Here's a laugh. I installed this light in the summer time. In Texas, we almost never turn our ceiling fans off. I finally started to connect some dots in my head. Maybe, just maybe, I started experiencing issues when the temperatures started to cool down, and we started flipping the switch to the ceiling fan? Yep... there it is. I'm still trying to figure out how the wire connecting my Ring Flood Lights is connected to my living room switch, seeing that the wire is coming from an entirely different direction. But it is. At any rate, I now stand by 3 stars instead of 1, only because I've had some issues communicating through it. People can hear me, but receiving their audio is not so hot. Meaning, the audip is so low and choppy, that I can't really hear them at all. Lights are at standard heigh, one story home above a garage. It seems one would need to be right up on it in order to communicate with it. A big reason I bought this was to be able to communicate with who steps on my property. However, I give Ring customer support 5 stars. They saw my review and reached out to me to schedule an apointment to get my issues fixed. I was able to fix it before our scheduled appointment. ======== These floodlight cameras were exactly what I needed in a neighborhood like mine. This thing was working great for 3 months. Now it no longer powers on. No camera, no lights, and no response when I push the reset button. Do NOT waste your money.",*** UPDATED *** Huge disappointment... NEVERMIND
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 May 2020,Edgar qg,We just got our two cams and boy are we excited. The instal is very simple I mean I can’t believe how simple it is ..really. You simply remove your old light after turning off your power screw in the new base where you just removed the old one and connect three wires white to white. Black to black and the ground wire that’s it your done. Put the camera on using the included tool and turn on the power. The app is upper easy to use and so is setting up the cam and they each co E with a 30 day trail of ring premium. They are super sensitive but that can be fixed in the app using zones and adjusting the sensitivity meter,Can’t put a price on peace of mind
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2017,Miriam Jones,"At this time, I can only give the Ring Floodlight two stars.  I will edit my review if the bugs ever get worked out.  So, the pros first.  It was easy installation since we already had an existing floodlight and just replaced it with the Ring floodlight.  Wi-Fi connectivity is good, though when I get a motion alert ,and I click on live view, sometimes it takes a few seconds to connect, meaning whatever or whomever triggered the alert is probably already out of view.  Then you have to go to recorded motion, but it takes a few minutes for that to appear.  Still, it does decent job alerting me I guess.  So what are the problems?  The main problem we are having is that we have it set to detect motion from 7 pm - 7 am.  However, it does the opposite, showing motion during the day instead of at night.  We switched it to opposite 7am-7pm to see if it would do the opposite.  It did not.  Then we switched it back to 7pm-7am, and it worked....for a while.  Then, all of sudden without us doing anything, it is back to showing motion between 7am-7pm when we don't really need it.  Basically, this problem renders the Ring floodlight camera almost useless.  It is during the night we would like detection, since that is when we have had things stolen from our yard.  This floodlight camera seems very finicky.  The lights seem to work randomly, also.  In addition, the range of motion detection is very limited as we can't move the detector sensor but so much.  What this means is that we basically need two of these, and the front of our house is not even that big.  Would I buy this again?  I am not sure at this point.  I am going to try working with it some more but really don't know what else to do.  The app for controlling it is easy to use and basic, so the problem seems to be with the Ring, not operator error.  Full disclosure, I haven't tried customer service yet but will soon.  Will update this review if something changes.",Disappointed in the Ring Floodlight

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Oct 2019,adamnash,"This camera is high quality - great video, easy to access from the phone, high quality construction. I'm giving it two stars instead of five, however. Let me explain why. 1) For setup, the camera requires you to engage in a local wi-fi network to connect to the camera. That's standard. Unfortunately, if you've installed multiple units, there is no easy way to reach the button to trigger the setup mode without accessing the top of the camera - a serious problem for most locations. 2) Once installed, let's say you are in your backyard, and the security light keeps coming on due to motion. No problem, right? Just snooze the camera for a few hours? Nope. That doesn't affect the motion lights. Oh, OK, just turn the lights off? Nope, that only works for a few seconds. Then the next trigger sets them back on. The only way to turn off the lights for a period of time is to reset the motion-detection zones in the app... and if you do that, you'd better remember to set them back, otherwise your precious security camera won't work properly. Insane. After several threads with support, they know about this issue, but have no plans to fix it. So, two stars. And that's from someone who spent $600 on three of them.","Great web-enabled security camera, but fatal flaw in setup & controls"
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Oct 2019,roqdoc,"This is an update of my review, moving the Ring Floodlight system from one star to four.  The problem was a software bug that the Ring tech staff fixed over the Internet, and now the Floodlight unit is working as it was supposed to.  I'm not going to remove my original explanation because if you have the same problem with your unit, you should contact Ring and  get them to do a software fix for you.  Here is my original review: When it was working, the Ring Floodlight did a pretty good job of showing the movement of people (and raccoons) outside.  Then it stopped working, with exactly the same symptoms as the first Ring Floodlight I installed.  For some reason, the lights (but not the camera) now come on at night for 25 seconds, then turn off for 5 seconds before they turn on again.  The process repeats itself over and over again until I turn it off manually.  There is no record of the camera turning on, just the lights.  But needless to say, you don't want your security lights coming on every 30 seconds.  I'll try to turn this one back in for a refund, but I'm not going to replace it again.  The Ring Spotlight that I also have installed, does not have this problem, so maybe I can replace the Floodlight version for a second Spotlight version.","Ring has updated my software, and now the Floodlight unit is working as intended, at least for now."

Even though Amazon owns BOTH Eero and Ring, we spent hours unable to connect this supposedly user-friendly device until we finally found a random comment somewhere that said setup fails if there is an apostrophe in your network name.  As farfetched as that sounded, we were desperate and tried.  Sure enough, we changed our network name and it worked right away.  Wasted hours trying to set up AND then had to reconnect every single stupid connected device in our house to the newly renamed network. ANNOYING!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2017,Hunggie,"I have had the Floodlight Cam installed for over a week now, and it's functioning as expected. The device installation was quite challenging, but the WiFi connection and system set-up were not. The video quality is good.  I am also very satisfied with the sensitivity setting to allow optimal range in the motion detection mode. Due to limited mounting options, my Floodlight Cam was installed a little higher than preferred. As such, the camera normally captures the top part of people's heads instead of their faces - unless the visitors/intruders look up towards the camera. Needless to say, the enhanced perimeter security is pretty ""cool"" and quite satisfying. So far so good!",Floodlight Cam installed and functioning well as expected
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 May 2020,Angry Plumber,These things are great.  Hung it from the old floodlight box above my back yard.  It just went right up where my old flood light was.  Took me longer to get out the ladder and put it away. They connect and set up so easily.  The only complaint I have is it’s miserable to adjust the lights because you have to wait until dark and with mine I need a 20’ ladder. The best improvement would be to add motors where you can adjust the lights and camera remotely from your phone.  I would gladly pay extra for those features. We needed a WiFi booster for the doorbell and it ended up being close enough to the flood light that it tied right in and works. Can see all the animals in our back yard at night. No people!  Which is exactly what I’d hoped.  Will put another in my driveway and possibly one on the deck where the blind spot is for this camera.,Easy to install and setup!  Works great!
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jul 2019,Don,"I've always wanted a camera in the front of my home, and backyard. After a demonstration from a guy at work of his ring floodlight cam I was sold on the idea. I bought 2, one for the front, one for the back. It's been over 3 weeks now and I'm very impressed. I like that you can increase or decrease the sensitivity of the motion detection, and control when and how you get alerts. After seeing how many cats I have roaming around the house at night, it was nice to have the ability to turn the sensitivity down, and alerts. Installation was easy being as I replaced existing lights. Took me 15minutes for each. Connecting to my wifi was simple and fast, as was installing the app, and ease of using it. My RSSI in cam health was around 56, which is exceptable but in my quest for perfections I bought the chime pro to extend my wifi. After spending time on the phone with the tech, it was obvious I was not going to do any better. I sent that back. Love these cameras!","Great quality, and ease of use."

I was quite impressed I purchased two of these and I had the intention of buying three more ...setup was easy enough I don't recall having any issues with it other than I noticed when I wanted to look at my house when I was away and I was in a good WIFI  location it wouldn't boot up this disturbed me greatly ......how is it a security camera that we paid this much for doesn't work as advertised??? I called ring support and was told that perhaps my wifi I wasn't strong enough... so I bought a brand new router to increase the wireless range that did not work either ironically 2 days after i had the router set up...one of the cameras broke I have no idea why it quit working but it did anyway I returned it through Amazon and got one back reinstalled it having the same problems ....I kept thinking what if a burglar was breaking in your home ..you wouldnt know it ....anyway, I spoke to my friend about this problem and he told me he was having the same issues .  he said that he was going to write a bad review on Amazon which he did... ring promptly reach out to him and offered to give him an antenna that would increase its range .. he suggested I write a bad review and ring will respond and gives me two antennas as well....I didn't want to do that.. I thought I should call the company and let them know the problem and let them fix it I called the 800 number spoke with a girl by the name of Tatiana she was very nice very polite I told her the issues I was having told her that I would like to get a couple of antennas she said we don't give those out anymore you have to buy them on the store I told her that that was unacceptable further I told her that I was planning on buying three more ring products assuming that the antennas fix the problem she spoke to her manager or someone and she told me that they wouldn't send me the antennas so here I am writing this review letting all of you know buyer beware this product is not as advertised it looks good ... the idea is good but that's where it ends... further the idea that I have to pay a yearly subscription for this product to work in the first place... it's just plain wrong... and since the product doesn't work in the first place I'm wasting my money.... so please consider all options before purchasing this product it just doesn't work as advertised",I had a good friend recommend this product to me when I first ...

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Mar 2018,Robert Cooper,"This device has a HUGE design flaw.  In order to reset the device in the event of a power failure, you have to push the button on top of the device to get it into setup mode (What's the point of that?).  That doesn't sound like a big deal but most people are going to have their floodlight mounted 10-15 feet in the air so that means breaking out the extension ladder to reset it.  I've had to reset it three times this winter because of power outages.  Oh, and if you want to change the network your camera is on, you have to climb back up on the ladder and hit that button again.  You can't just change it through the app.  Ridiculous.",One big bug
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2019,Tim,"Received my floodlight cam and was surprised on how well it was packaged both outside and inside. The device itself had a little bit of weight to it, which in this case was a good thing. It is both sturdy and durable for an outside environment. The included mounting bracket was a huge plus, made the install process as smooth as silk. Instructions were helpful and well laid out. Adjusting the lights to where I wanted them, setting all the features up inside the Ring application, was a breeze. The only reason for 4 stars is the Wi-Fi signal to this Ring device as well as other Ring devices that I have, is less than stellar. I have a top of the line router and range extenders but Ring devices don't seem to connect with the full potential of my network. Other than that, this is a great product and I'm sure if you have a need for this type of product, it will satisfy that need. After using the product for sometime now it would be nice if Ring added a feature to reduce the light intensity if need be and also add LED lights that could change color to prevent the bugs from gathering around the light in the summertime. Other than that, still will happy with my purchase.",Better than expected
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2018,pamkba,Not pleased. When the alert rings the camera does not load most times it just twirls until the event is over. I would  say dedicated 2GB high speed internet per ring is needed. The key word is dedicated.  It worked a little better away from home dependent upon Internet.  This needs to be put on product details the fact that high speed or at least this device needs a dedicated  2GB  to work properly.  Update 11-19-18 Customer Service and Support is really good with Ring.  Amaon refused to adjust  price has dropped.  Ring works with you until a solution is figured out to make your product work properly.  So for 2 stars.  Waiting on another product to buddy with the Ring Flood hopefully this solution will work.  Ill keep u posted. Unfortunatley none of the solutions worked because the device needs dedicated 2GB to work properly.  Although none of the solutions from Ring really worked I have to give their customer service 5 stars  But only 2 for the entire unconvinced of it all and being stuck with a device that can’t work fully. So I have a 249. device that is just good for motion.  And Ring has another much cheaper device non internet dependent coming out 3-6-19.  Would love this one instead Amazon refuses to exchange it  So  I  paid someone to install would have to pay someone to take down and reinstall another. This could get expensive.  Amazon doesnt care about this.  Talked to supervisor Katie at Amazon today very non chalent said no credit and also there was no one else for me to speak with. I spend and I have spent too much money at Amazon.  Customer service means a lot.  So fewer purchases from now on.,Like it except you need dedicated Internet

The camera is excelllent and I really enjoy being able to draw your motion zones. With the floodlight however, the camera isn’t half of what the Pro doorbell is. It says it’s 1080p but I have yet to see it. Also, I’m crazy about LEDs. I’ve learned that cheap ones stay dimly lit when not in use and my Ring floodlight LEDs are always dimly lit when not lit up. This is really disappointing to me as the product is not cheap. On a positive note, I like the security it provides and I like that the motion sensing isn’t too sensitive.

RINGS solution is to replace the entire unit with a crappy discount. IF you have to replace the entire unit for one light burning out, I consider that a horrible design. Other floodlights let you screw in a new bulb, here I have to replace the entire unit, poor engineering. Not green and or cost effective, it is a money making scam from the company.

This was as easy to install as replacing an existing electrical outlet. Packaging was easy to open and I did not have any problems installing the flood light camera. Overall time it took about 30 minutes and a ladder. I have other Ring products (Ring Pro Door Bell) and truly enjoy the convenience of having one app to monitor the two main entries into my house. I have not had any false motion alerts with this device and it works exactly as it is supposed too (even at night). I did have to purchase a Netgear  wifi extender from Walmart which cost about 30 bucks. My garage is pretty long and the router it connects too was more than 50 feet away from the flood light camera but I still had a -65 good connection. After I installed the wifi extender that connection went to -40 which is an excellent connection. I did not have any issues with setting up the motion and zones and that is what truly makes this product so great. So far the motion sensor has captured small rabbits and a bobcat passing by. This setting can be adjusted if you have more wildlife in your area but overall this is a great product and I would definitely purchase other Ring products. I am working on looking at areas around the back of the house to install stick up cams from Ring that would go into our home security network.,Great Product

South,"Update: I still like my Ring Flood light, however the video often ""ghosts"" a moving person. Installing a Ring Chime Pro wifi extender, helped the ghosting alot, but it regularly drops the wifi signal causing me to miss movements in my driveway. Over the past couple of weeks I've installed and uninstalled the Chime Pro a number of times. It's quite easy to install and it wouldn't be such a big issue if I didn't have to keep draging a tall ladder out out of my garage to reach the reset button on the Ring light fixture. Also, each time I install the Chime Pro device, it affects my heat/cool control system. I don't know if I have a defective device.... or if the Chime Pro still needs the bugs worked out of it. I will be returning the Chime Pro. An easy 5 stars for the fixture!! Nice quality product, packaged very well and arrived quickly. Easy installation. The camera provides a wide range of view, the motion detector reaches out about 30 feet and the lights are remarkably bright. It does exactly what I need it to do. The app could use some improvements to make it a little more user friendly, but after some experimentation, it was fairly easy to figure out without having to use the instruction manual. The instruction manual is extremely small and is quite basic and the light grey colored font was challenging to read. If I could make any recommendations, I would suggest the manufacture darken up the font and get a little more descriptive in the app set -up section of the manual.

I was asked by the company to review the product I paid A LOT of money for, which in my opinion is tasteless considering I am getting npthing in return for my time. Make a note of this boys. I usually get paid for this. With that said, here is my honest review of The Ring Floodlight. Quality: Before even opening the box I assumed that the floodlight was made of plastic. It's not, it's actually a very heavy high quality light that is made of metal. I was extremely happy with that because my last security camera was plastic. Set Up: I had to hardwire this one. I actually ran an entire new line under my siding which took some time, but it was necessary so I didn't have it hooked up to a switch indoors. It runs 247 and I don't have to worry about anyone shutting the system down by switching a light switch inside. How It works.... It's actually amazing. More amazing than I thought it would be. It's camera covered the entire front lawn which is roughly 126ft across. I wad able to also see the he neighbors yard across the street. Downloading the ring app allowed me to set up motion zones so I only get alerts for my yard and not evey car that drives by like my old system did, which was super annoying. The notifications are on point and the hehe night vision is superb. I can now go on vacation and leave for long periods of the hehe one knowing that even when I'm not home I can see my home and protect it. The siren is my favorite feature.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Apr 2019,H Griffin,"I bought 5 of these plus a door bell pro. They’ve been up a couple of months and work well as advertised. Like so many wireless devices your network configuration will determine reliability. I believe people who complain simply don’t understand the intricacies of wireless networks.  I had to add a wired access point to get the signal strength I needed at one end of house. For what it’s worth I used 2 older apple AirPort Extremes and 2 airport expresses all hardwired to cover a larger house and connect these devices.  Haven’t needed support so can’t comment on that. Remote viewing App on iOS works fine, could be much better configuration options though, especially in grouping devices similar to surveillance cams/dvr. Neighborhood notices if properly restricted are surprisingly useful for nearby perps.","Works as advertised, needs a very complete wireless network -better than most."
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Sep 2018,Craig,I really wanted to like this product -- a flood light plus a camera is an amazing idea. Unfortunately they equipped this product with a bad image sensor and lens. I cannot even make out a face from the end of the driveway. I think it was a mistake to use such a wide angle lens. It looks really nice in wide but the details needed to identify a person or read a license plate are lost. I think it has similar megapixels to my camera phone from 2005. (2MP?) Also the app is slow and you can't seem to access live video from a browser.,Great idea but terrible image quality and app
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2019,Dale Gribble,"I bought the Ring Floodlight with the intent to replace the light above my garage facing the driveway. I've replaced ceiling fans, but never an outdoor light. It turned out to be a really simple process that is very similar to changing a ceiling fan, but much easier. I was taking my time making sure everything was secure, but the whole process took maybe 30 minutes. Using the Ring phone app I was able to get the spotlight connected easily. The positives: Everything you need to install the Ring is in the box except for a small pair of pliers or a wire cutter. You can set motion zones during the day and draw lines for your property, works really well if you live on a busy street. Picture quality for me seems pretty clear. I like that I can talk to someone from the light. The negatives: The zone options for the floodlight are very minimal. You can set motion zones on or off and kind of set a distance, but it's all very limited. Not good if you live on a busy street. The built-in siren isn't that loud. Overall I'm happy so far and believe I have everything set how I would like. I'd love to see the floodlight get an update that allows you to set motion zones for night.",Driveway Light Replacement
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2018,TLMKC,"We needed outdoor cameras on a budget.  These are not perfect but they do the job well.  Things you need to know before buying. They do not film and store continuous feed like a DVR system.  They are motion activated.  They film, its stored in cloud backup.  The motion activation is very good and adjustable.  Ours would ignore the squirrels and branches blowing, but the neighbors cat would set it off.  We played around with the settings, and now only a med/lg dog or person will set it off. The two way audio is great.  Our front camera is over the garage.  It catches the door.  If someone comes to the door, I call them to the driveway where I can see them clearly and we chat.  Most people get this now, and some people say its really cool.  It also got rid of the large bald man who I would have been scared to open the door for.  We have two in the back yard, on either side of the ad/on by the door.  We are getting a solar one for the side yard next month. Next Is installations.  What you have in your house will determine your installations.  I am on ATT Fiber, and my husband installed a powerful wifi system and everything is set to the same isp address.  I also have the ring chime/it came free with one of the lights. a total waste of time.  You must at 2G wifi.  If you don't, it won't work.  All things being equal, if you have wifi that will reach the camera and its 2G you are good to go.  Download the RING app.  It actually walks you thru how to install your light with videos if you want it.  Once its on a few pushes of buttons and you are good to go.  After 30 days you have to buy cloud back up, $30 for one device and $100 for multiple.  Everytime you add a new device, if you are still in the trial it resets your free account to 30 days. What does it do?  You set motion perimeters.  They are very precise.  I have mine set to the edge of the yard, and even my jerk neighbor who thinks keeping his car right in the middle of the street in front of my house even thought the street is empty, doesn't set it off when he goes to work at 6am.  When there is motion it records.  When you access Live view it records.  You can access your recordings on your tablet or phone.  Right swipe and you can delete.  They need a better program for deleting, but it has really improved since I got the first camera, so they are working on it.  It does have audio, So I suggest you put the audio/video surveillance sticker out so the neighbors know.  (it got set off in the back yard and I could hear my jerk neighbor fighting with one of his many girlfriends crystal clear in his back yard.)  Pieces of RING equipment I do not care for are the Chime, Chime Pro (poor range if you have a good wifi network, very touchy) or Doorbell.  My brother has the doorbell and it just doesn't work well and the audio is poor.  The floodlight IMO is the best piece so far.  Another thing nice is neighborhood watch.  We actually had a person, reported a package stealer on the Watch network and another person saw him and got his plates.  It is a good introductory item for outdoor surveillance if you cannot afforded a hardwired, professionally installed system with indoor power sources for the cameras.","Very good WiFi camera, worth the price."

Just a few things. My Wi Fi base isn’t that far away, but the light gets a poor signal. I can’t stop the light from coming on, even though I feel like I’ve reduced the action zone to zero. I wish the app had a preview like Arlo so you don’t have to watch every video to make sure you’re not missing something.  All these things could be updated and aren’t huge weaknesses. Otherwise, the pic is usually pretty good (poor Wi Fi at times makes it less and effects the audio worse), the light stays off more often than not, the wide angle captures my whole entrance area, and it’s all pretty easy to set up.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Mar 2018,Phat Matt,"I’ve had this up for about a month now. So far, so good. Setup was easy and took about 30 minutes (including ladder setup and removing the old floodlight). This is mounted approximately 15ft off the ground. The camera connected to my network immediately. Daytime viewing is crystal clear. The viewing angle is very wide, almost if not actually 180°, and allows me to see one whole side of my house, my entire driveway driveway, and the entrances to both my garage and my workshop—exactly what I was hoping for. I had some initial trouble with my flag setting off motion alerts every time the wind blew but thanks to Motion Zones I was able to cut out the flag from the motion detection area and no longer receive alerts for it. As far as I can tell, motion alerts occur within 2-4 seconds of motion detection, which is pretty great, and motion recording appears to start approximately 5 second before actual motion occurs, allowing whatever causes the motion to “enter the scene” instead of just suddenly appearing on the recording. I’m anxious to see how this unit will manage its motion detection settings in the coming warmer months when it will inevitably be swarmed by bugs. I’ve already had it alert me to the motion of a single bug on two occasions. I’m banking on being able to turn down the motion sensitivity to solve that problem, but only time will tell if it works. I’ll update my review as soon as I’m able to find out. Night vision on this unit is not good. Range of vision is reduced by about 50% when activated without floodlights. I prefer to leave the floodlights off while we sleep but due to its limitations I now leave them on all night. I suppose it’s better for home security if I leave them on anyway. Customers experiencing issues with motion detection at night might have more luck if they left their lights on. I have a stray cat that pays us nightly visits and my camera has no trouble picking up his movement from 30-40 feet away. I’ve experienced quite a bit of lagging, both with live view and on recordings. I called customer service and was told that the RSSI was low, and that the solution was to move the camera closer to the WiFi point or vice versa. Unfortunately that’s not possible, so instead I installed a WiFi extender in my garage (about 10-15 feet from the camera and in direct line-of-sight). Problem solved. RSSI was greatly improved. Some lag still occurs occasionally but it’s much better than it was and I never expected it to be perfect. The reset button sits on top of the camera housing, which was a terrible idea. When trying to reconnect the camera to my WiFi extension, I had to drag the ladder back out and climb up the side of the house to reset the camera. I don’t understand why this couldn’t be done through the Ring app or by simply power cycling the camera. Very inconvenient. Crossing my fingers that I won’t have to reset this thing too often. The siren isn’t loud. I can’t even hear it from inside my house. Audio broadcasted from the floodlight is also very quiet. I tried talking to my wife through it but she couldn’t hear me. Of all the features this camera packs, these should have been the easiest things to get right. Fortunately, I didn’t buy it for these reasons and I don’t plan on using them much (if ever) either. The lights are the perfect color (temperature-wise, not too white but not too yellow) and have as much reach as my previous non-LED floodlight. The light schedule feature is awesome! I love being able to set it and forget it. The app itself is very clean and easy to navigate. I’ve had a few different WiFi-connected camera over the years, and nearly all the apps for them were a nightmare. This thing isn’t buggy or bloated with unwanted features. All in all, I’m very happy with this unit. I would buy it again if necessary, and have already recommended it to several friends.","Well-made, reliable, and exactly what I needed"
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Joel H.,"Don’t make the assumption that because Ring is owned by Amazon they have a decent app to control these cameras. I unfortunately made that assumption. The app does not allow you to set a schedule of when not to record. You can prevent it from sending you audible phone alerts. However when you open the app it will have hundreds of alerts /recordings of you when you are home, even when you don’t want to be recorded. I don’t care about the privacy part however every time I go into the app there are hundreds of two minute recordings of when I am home. You literally can’t stop this unless you manually stop the recording every day. Why you can’t schedule when you want it to record (via motion detection) is ridiculous. It’s hard to find a recording you want to see when it’s swamped by hundreds of recordings you could care less about.","Terrible App, makes camera poor investment"

The Ring Floodlight Camera Motion Security Cam comes with all the hardware you need to replace existing outdoor light fixture/floodlight.  The instructions were also pretty clear in execution.  However, Ring really needs to start adding 5 ghz products to their lineup.  The 2.4 ghz channels are getting pretty crowded in my neighborhood, which could present problems down the road.  I also moved a Chime Pro closer to the light to strengthen the 2.4 ghz signal. My only issue thus far is light motion kept cycling on/off every minute, which was annoying.  To resolve this, I simply went through the set up again which cleared what ever was making it cycle.  Not sure if there was any logic in these actions or not, but the solution worked for me.  All-in-all, great product that works and clear video.","So Far, So Good"

I've now put in two of these units along with a stick up cam (where I didn't need flood lights) for monitoring outside the home. Ring will tell you that this is only for vertical installation, however in my second installation, I was able to successfully mount this under my eave by simply removing the camera from the ball joint and rotating it 180 degrees and reinstalling.  However it is mounted, these have been working great. One of my only complaints is that even on the lowest sensitivity, these pick up too much motion. We have 4 indoor and outdoor cats.  They aren't giant, and their motion constantly sets them off.  I'm hopeful that ring will eventually push an update to be able to downgrade sensitivity even more, as it never missed human-sized movement...",Excellent product that is just like your spouse - overly sensitive
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Feb 2020,A. Jones,I received one as a gift last year.  I installed it to monitor my garage.  The viewing angle of the camera is wide; practically a full 180 degrees.  I was able to capture my garage and back door of the house with one unit.  Great picture quality!  Negatives are the monthly subscription fee.  However I liked the added protection so much I purchased an additional unit for the back of my garage.  It is nice to be able to double check if I remembered to shut the garage door.  The total subscription fee is 100 dollars per year for mutiple units.  Not too hateful.  You are basically paying for the video storage.  I now have two floodlights and a doorbell.  The notifications can be overwhelming at times.  I am still adjusting the sensitivity to avoid false alerts.  Extra alerts and fees aside I would recommend this unit and wish I had one 10 years ago.

I have talked with ring support about it and they told me to reset it and set it up again which we did but it still turns off and on all night long. My dog manages to set it off as well during the day even with it on people only setting(but she’s a big dog so i understand why it sets it off) I think the dome part on it is what’s setting it off(a spider web was setting it off every 5 seconds one night until I climbed up and removed the web string) so I’m not sure what the dome part uses to detect motion but I think that’s what’s causing it to turn off and on. I still love it and love ring products just kind frustrating when it turns off and on all night long with no motion detection. My poor neighbors haven’t complained yet thankfully.,Love it except

I've had a foscam camera that I positioned in my bay window to point to my driveway/exterior front entry area for a few years but it didn't work well looking through the glass of my bay window.  They had outside cameras but my husband wasn't interested in ""poking a hole"" through our exterior.  I saw the Ring doorbell in Costco more than a year ago and thought it looked great but my husband brushed me off and wasn't a fan. He is a huge fan of converting our lights to LED - so when I saw this product I knew it was for us!  I went ahead and ordered it and when it arrived he kind of rolled his eyes at me.  I left for the weekend and told him to feel free to install it while I was gone (another eye roll).  A few days later I started getting text messages from him that he thought this was the coolest thing I've ever purchased.  He's the electrical guy and I'm the computer nerd in our house.  So normally I setup all the cameras, etc.  I came home and he had it all setup and said it was super easy.  We absolutely love it and plan to add another one.  Well worth the price! On a side note - I tend to show this product (via the app) to many people because I love it so much.  My Mom and her husband bought one a few weeks ago and they absolutely love it.  My mother is not ""techy"" at-all. I tend to help answer questions with anything techy and I went over to complete the install after her husband installed the floodlight from the electrical standpoint - and much to my surprise my mother had completed the rest of the install herself.

It takes two or three minutes to load video which makes it useless for security. Think about how long three minutes is when it's 2 AM and you don't know what is outside. The camera has wired power and excellent wifi reception so you would expect no problems. Troubleshooting with Ring, they told me this device is not designed to work with mesh networks (I have Eeros). UPDATE: I have spent the last year trying to get this thing to work. I mean, working hand-in-hand with Ring's Tier 2 support, adjusting firewall settings, buying a chime pro, you name it. It's clear there are serious problems with the hardware itself. There is no way your experience will be like the commercials, where you're shouting at burglars and scaring them away.

I only have one zwave extender, although I probably need to add another with the number of items I have connected.  I have 3 of these floodlight cams, two solar cams and the doorbell cam.  I am somewhat tied into the ring ecosystem. These cameras are built well - the lights and housing quality is much better than anything Lowes currently carries.  They are working on integrating these cameras in with the alarm system as well. In the interest of transparency, I have had issues with a couple of window sensors, one of the cameras and a keypad.  All of these issues have been addressed and Ring has replace the items quickly.  This is fairly new technology, I expected to experience an issue or two.  Especially with how complicated my alarm system is.  I have had no false alarms yet.  I have set the alarm off twice on accident and the service has responded quickly.  $100 a year for monitoring is a GREAT price - turned it in to my insurance and my rates went down almost $200 a year (got a $110 check refund last week for the 6 months left in the year (we pay by the year).",Great product so far!

Only problem is lack of google home functionality, forcing users to buy alexa based products is just stupid.  Allowing it to work with both services would only broaden the base of customers.  The reason I'm only giving three stars though is down to the app not having proper 2 factor authentication.  For a security service this is not good.  If you want the subscription service you'll need a bank card attached to the account and there is no way to see if anyone is logging in and gaining access to your information.

The lights are nice looking and pretty bright however night video with the lights on is still black & white sense the low light capabilities of the camera are less than they could be.  The picture quality is pretty good day (color) or night (black & white)  The light motion sensor (dedicated infered sensor) is seperate from the cameras motion detector which utilizes the cameras lens as the motion sensor so there are many times at night were the lights will come on without recording, which isn't a huge deal to me but I did try to minimize this as much as possible by turning down the light motion sensitivity.  Also I have the lights set to turn off 3 minutes after motion which works fine however if the power goes out for a few seconds then the light will come on with the power and stay on until you notice which seems like a bug to me.",Good camera and light combo

We have been sold on the merit of Ring since installing the Ring Doorbell last spring. Installation was straight forward and Ring even supplies the tools. Nice job.  I hardwired the floodlight cam since leaving it connected through the existing wall switch would have definitely caused accidental outages.  The one thing I would love to see added would be the ability to ask Alexa to turn on backyard floodlights.

The placement of the camera is under the eve of my garage which also slopes.  Because the light arms/extensions and the camera extension are short and due to the camera being angled, I am not getting optimal coverage with the lights or the camera.  I have very little room to move them because the arms that allow movement are short.  I called ring hoping they would sell a 2 or 3"" extension that I could add to the the camera so it would reach out further to provide better coverage.  Right now it is crooked and bunched up between the lights.  Unfortunately the sales person said they do not provide an extension which would easily remedy my situation.  Just like ring added a wedge to the door bell to proved better coverage around corners, they should also offer extension for the lights and cameras in the package should they be needed.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 May 2018,Bob,"The Ring Floodlight cam was very easy to install. Ring directions are great and they provide you with everything to install including the screwdriver. I encourage people to strongly consider a wired camera if possible. I tried the Spotlight cam with batteries. It worked fine but there is the need to regularly charge battery(s).  Also, the battery Spotlight cam does NOT allow you to set motion zones. This allows you to adjust the size of the areas the camera looks for motion. It is very specific and very easy to adjust. I like the Spotlight cam automatically turns on its lights with motion at night.  You can manually turn on lights during day. The video from the camera is great, you can see them easily and clearly on you phone. I recommend purchasing the $3 month or $30 year fee to have Ring store the video. For that little price you can always check back to see what triggered your camera(s). The spotlights are not as strong as the led light I had in previously, but it is more than adequate for the camera and if you need to walk around with stumbling over something. If you need an outside camera with lights, I highly recommend this unit.",Great camera for spots you want to light up at night as well as security video

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2018,Mr Mister,"I’ve only had the ring spotlight cam installed for a week. Device looks great and a breeze to install. If you’ve ever installed a fixture in your house, it’s the same thing as long as you have a power, neutral and ground. Instruction are good but not necessary. I have generally consistent and a good connection to the wireless router (between 45 and 50 rssi most times when I check.). Video quality is wonderful and consistent. I am certain it would be a bit better if I had less router congestion on the 2.4ghz frequency and not necessarily be closer to the router. I have consistent 100+ mb download and between 5.5 and 6.5 mb uploads with my internet package provided by Comcast. Now onto a few mishaps that I have to note keeping in mind everything mentioned: 1: It seems that at the start of a motion trigger, video begins to record,  sound begins to record and it sends off a push notification to your device. This gives some jittery feed back to both your live view and recorded video. It causes 1 out of 10 times so far a missed opportunity to see what set off the trigger. It is always during the first 20 seconds of recording or viewing a live feed.  Fair to say that might be my network congestion but could be too much software load for the cameras processing. I have had so far 1 out of hundreds of triggers completely static with no indication anything was even there to set off a trigger. 2: The motion detection system seems good. Maybe a little on the sensitive side. I want to catch cars coming down the street but not receive over 25 messages in less than an hr. This is at nearly the lowest setting. Also I’ve tried moving active detection zone farther away but then that takes away from zoned areas that I do want a trigger to occur. (Small gripe worth mentioning). To go along with this, the light sensor is a bit sensitive and goes off constantly at night. I had to turn off one of the three zones to mitigate that. May have to do with where I have installed the camera. 3: Night vision is great. Only thought would be to ask for a manual release of it when the floodlights kick on. You can actually see much clearer then. The automatic change is about 5 to 10 seconds slow, but does work well. Maybe implement a software button in the + menu during live view. 4: Live view isn’t bad but activating from a pushed notification is slow. There’s the time it takes to get into the app and then the time it takes to load up app, then you have to acquire the video feed which takes a bit. It’s only been about 10 seconds or less each time but it’s enough to always miss a slow passing vehicle or see you’re being monitored and move out of view. Now the subject won’t know that but you do if you do some testing. This could partially be placed on network performance on their end and yours. 5: Time stamping a video feed. As far as I can tell, the only way to show or prove time and date of incident is through the files’ labeled name. I would like to see a time stamp directly laid over the feed for professional use if authorities would ever have to use information to help a case. That is just a request not a minus. Great product. I was iffy for quite a while because of all the jaded and different reviews. I finally decided to just try it myself and would return it if it was that big of a hassle. Currently the device is still under that return policy of mine. I would recommend to try it.",Over all great. Try it yourself.

The same experience with the Alexa app - it said that no new device was detected yet when I checked devices, it was there. I think it needs an option to turn the light on and off by sunset and sunrise times and not just a set time. Surely that could be added in software. I also think that there should be a dim light until motion detected option, but perhaps that would require a hardware change. Seems strange that a high end device like this doesn’t have it.",Excellent picture

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Aug 2017,Raye Lamerdin,"We received the Ring floodlights/camera and installed it immediately.  The picture and response time were perfect.  The only problem was that the microphone on the camera didn't work.  The speaker was fine, so I could talk to someone outside and hit the siren, but they couldn't talk to me.  So I called the Help line and was walked through several steps.  They determined the problem was perhaps my internet (even though the signal seemed strong).  They sent me the Chime Pro (a booster) free hoping that would fix the problem.  The Chime Pro would not light up or come on.  So they sent me a second Chime Pro.  This one came on and worked but made no difference in the microphone on the camera.  They then told me that they had had problems with defective microphones and would send me another floodlight/camera to replace what I had. The second camera came and we hooked it up taking the old one down.  Not an easy task as this was mounted above the garage.  The second floodlight/camera didn't work at all - defective.  We spent an hour on the telephone with the help line getting a woman who insisted it was just my internet (even though the Ring app said the connection was very good)!  When we insisted on talking to someone else, she put us on hold for so long, we hung up.  We reinstalled the first light/camera, and it worked the same - perfectly just no microphone (which we have decided we can live without).  I cannot recommend Ring as their quality seems to be really poor.  Altogether, we had two floodlights/camera that had problems and a Chime Pro that didn't work.  I assume they are getting sloppy and overproducing as they have become so popular.  I love the concept and really like the camera portion.  I feel like $250 is a lot for something that does not work perfectly when there are other options on the market.",Ring Floodlight/Camera

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Mar 2018,Michele D.,"These Ring cameras are amazing. I have an alarm inside, but this is different. Once you get one, you wonder why you waited. I’m not particularly tech savvy either. The Quality is 5 stars. Directions 5 stars. The Tools provided 5 stars. Day & Night vision 5 stars. Ability to Access 24/7 5 stars. Notification on phone 5 stars. Ease of App use 5 stars. Recording clarity of voice 5 stars. Ability to control notifications 5 stars. See what neighbors post/alert (radius of 0-5 miles) if you want to see 5 stars. Zone control 5 stars. Doorbell 2 is a must. You see a very wide view even if not facing the street with this doorbell. Easy to hardwire doorbell 2 & requires no battery charge. Tools provided & nice faceplate options. The spotlight security cam with battery is easy because you can place literally anywhere without hardwiring. I love mine. Only drawback is you periodically need to charge battery with USB cord provided by Ring, of course (which means getting ladder, unscrewing, charging& replacing maybe every 1-3 months depending on use/ how you set your zone alerts). You’re always able to check the battery life on the app. So, other option is the hardwired security spotlight cam. This is probably the ideal if you’re at all handy because you don’t have to worry about ever charging. I believe there’s video instruction online. The sensitivity is so great that you can detect all cars (and neighbors), but this would wear down battery & make a lot of unnecessary notifications. You will find the sweet spot for your address.  The Ring is also helpful if if you have college kids that “promise” they won’t have a party when you’re out of town, but can’t help themselves.  There is an optional subscription you can get for a small fee if you want to save/ access video. Unless you answered the Ring on notification, you would need to get it, but not necessary.  Definitely a deterrent. Now off to buy another for the other side of the house/ backyard. PS Also helpful to check weather if you have dogs.",You will wonder why you waited to buy!

It was a very simple installation as I had a previously wired motion light.  Setup was a breeze, the entire installation and setup took less than 30 minutes.  The video quality is stunning and the range/angle is great, it picks up most of my yard, driveway, plus road.  It works perfectly with my Ring doorbell and Ring Alarm.  The lights aren't as bright as my old motion light, but definitely bright enough!  The sensor is a little touchy but I am ok with that, I would rather it record too much than not enough.  I do have an issue with the light sensor, it turns the lights on even during the day time.  So, I set a time for it to come on but unfortunately, it only comes on and stays on so it doesn't appear to have a way to set it up so the sensor only activates between a certain time period.

The seller is extremely responsive and helpful. The one thing I must warn is that this is the third (of my now five) Ring products to have arrived with some sort of packaging issue. This particular item was clearly previously opened and installed. Again, the seller was responsive and I don’t believe it had anything to do with them. But Ring is apparently sending out refurbished or open box items as “new.” After testing, the product seems to work perfectly, and I can’t be bothered with the time and waste of returning it. I would otherwise give it five stars. However I can’t help but be disappointed in Ring for passing off used items as new. My first Ring doorbell was a dud (not from this seller).

I would return if I could!!!  We purchased the ring doorbell and then our truck was broken into in the drive and not picked up by the ring so we purchased the floodlights thinking the doorbell didn't pick them up because we're a split level design but the lights don't always kick on like our other motion sensor lights.  We need something to deter people from breaking into our vehicles and these will kick on sometimes and others not and that may be because I refuse to pay for 2 ring cloud plans.  We already purchased a ring doorbell recording plan and one would assume you can add both products to the 1 account but you cannot.  Should not have listened to my husband and called immediately when we received it to verify. So we have to pay for 2 cloud services in order to have recordings saved.  During Halloween with both the ring doorbell and the ring floodlights someone came into our yard without setting off either and stole decorations!  The decor was no more than 20' in front of the doorbell and about 35' from the floodlights.  Very disappointed!!!,Not what we expected!

Overall love them and have recommended to friends who have bought them too. HOWEVER whenever it snows we get false alarms which is really annoying.  I have adjusted the motion notifications to the lowest sensitivity setting, people only but that doesn’t help. From the app you have to go in and turn off motion alerts on every camera when it snows...which is a real hassle.  Would be nice to just do one time on app home like SmartThings has.  OR better yet fix the bug. Really want to get the alarm and monitoring services thru Ring, but it’s just not practical in winter with the scores of false alarms. Perhaps all the R&D was in warmer climates, but in upper Midwest snow is a weekly thing for in winter. I have contacted Ring but just received  a technababel answer on the tech of why it triggers.  I have several trail cams set up as well and never get pictures triggered by just snow or false notifications from the Bushnell wireless cam so I know others have figured a solution out.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 May 2018,Shawn B,"The device works great, and looks nice. It was easy to install, and easier setup than the ring doorbell.  They have learned since the doorbell. The reason for the 3 stars is due to a few design and SW flaws that still exist. Design wise: No support for 5ghz. There appears to be extra distortion and blurriness in the top left corner of the camera video.  I contacted Ring to see if this is norma but their support was useless.  They continuously tried to force me to trobleshoot a poor wifi issue when it is clearly not a wifi issue, it is a hardware issue.  After wasting hours of my time and refusing to actually listen to the issue, I gave up on ring support.  They then continued to harass me to keep troubleshooting wifi issues after I asked them multiple times to stop contacting me. The hand tightening clamps for the lights are made too poorly.  I was not able to open or close mine without a wrench which caused them to get scratched, which I then had to recover in paint. Even after using a wrench they are still unmanageable using my hands.  It feels like they may have painted or powder coated the threads.  They should have just used a hex shape and provided a plastic hex wrench. The mounting nuts are not a standard size and the plastic tool to tighten them is too loose, so I had to use a metal wrench again which scratched them, causing them to be repainted. The camera needs a smaller arm so that it can swivel further to the left or right.  While it works fine for direct placement mounting, if you need to mount it on the side and mount it 90 degrees it is not possible. The camera uses a different hand tightened which is hard to tighten enough to hold the camera weight without using a tool. The camera itself uses a screwdriver and a very small screw to lock it in place.  This should use the same hand tightening nut the lights do for the vertical adjustment.  The screen needs to be really tight and will probably strip out after a fee adjustments. The lights use a high powered led array, works well but looks horrible.  They should have put a designed lenses instead of flat glass which would look nicer and expand the beam to cover more area. Software wise: People only still picks up any movement whether it is a person or not. The siren button really needs an option for users to hide it disable it.

I have to mount the light/camera on my soffit which is only about eight feet high. The support neck of the camera is to short and lacks adjustment so that the camera will point/see in a normal view, therefore I had to mount it so that it is viewing ""upside down"".  It works but is inconvenient to view. It just seems to me that if the neck was longer and had more range of adjustment it would work. As well as everything else is designed and constructed, I don't understand why that wasn't thought of. It can't be that my situation is that unique.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,1st time euro traveler,"It's a beautifully designed and packaged product that will please the vast majority of people that intend to mount it vertically on a wall or post. I bought it knowing that I wanted to mount it in pre-existing horizontally mounted junction boxes under my eves, which have a small amount of downward slope. The range of motion of the camera module gimbal required a customized mounting adapter to get the focal plane up high enough to get a field of view that extended more than 10 feet beyond the mounted location. The adapter was relatively easy to fabricate, but is definitely not something for someone without tools and skills to take on. Any good handyman / electrician will be able to accomplish this within a few hours. I installed 2 in this fashion. Again, this was a horizontal installation under the roof eve, not vertically on a wall as the device is designed for. Once installed, the cameras are very easy to set up. The app is very good. I already had the Ring video doorbell, adding two additional devices was very easy. The only significant issue most homeowners may encounter is a weak WiFi signal at the cameras. This is easily remedied with a plug-in WiFi extender that you can obtain anywhere for $20 - $30. The motion detection range and field are easily configured with a free-form selection tool in the app. Camera angles and motion detection settings will have to take into account landscaping affected by wind to avoid excessive motion alerts. Recorded video history is easily accessed and reviewed in the app. An annual subscription fee is REQUIRED to save video after the first 30 days. Ring offers no options to save your video streams locally on your own hard drive or in your own cloud storage account. They currently offer access to the last 60 days of recorded video. App response is very uneven. I regularly encounter long delays or failures when trying to retrieve or review recorded or live video. You can expect to hear a motion alert with your phone in hand, and even when you immediately invoke the app, the person or event that triggered the alert will be gone.  I use both Android phone and Chromebook for the app. In summary, this is easily mounted with just a screwdriver if mounted vertically.  Horizontal installation requires adaptation of the junction box mounting, or an adapter plate to achieve effective field of coverage. Setup and use is easy, but the app can be sluggish, subjecting you irritating delays.","Beautiful product, easy to use, sluggish app response"

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Dec 2019,UI R.,"I installed one floodlight cam over a month ago. Works okay. Bought another (both from Amazon), newest one has issues that many people report: 1) Won't update past firmware 1.16.00273. Multiple attempts with customer service won't fix this. 2) Light comes on every 20-30 minutes for about 20 seconds. 3) Doesn't follow motion schedule. 4) Snapshot capture doesn't work. Just says unavailable. Didn't have any of these problems with my earlier floodlight cam. I've wasted a lot of time during the business day contacting customer support 4 different times. My most recent response was that these are known issues but ""I do not have a time frame of when they will be done looking into this, however I can assure you they are looking into this."" So, a lot of time and money spent on a floodlight cam with known issues. This means we likely won't have working security on that part of the house over the holidays.",Known problems with no timeframe on repairs
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Nov 2017,Yellowrose,"I’m disappointed that it took me this long to make the investment for these cameras/flood lights. Previously, I had light up but the bulbs went out and they were difficult to find replacements. I had an exterior camera but wanted to put up additional ones outside to satisfy my own paranoia. It was until recently that I “thought I had a package missing that I decided to look into the doorbell. My existing one didn’t have a motion so it was useless to determine if someone wakes up to my door. When I decided to take the plunge and buy the doorbell, I decided to go ahead and buy 2 floodlight cameras as well. The only downfall would be that it appears it’s slowing my internet so I’m going to look into wireless extenders to see if it will help eliminate the dragging of the internet. I can’t express how much I LOVE these products so excited to see what else is in the pipeline. Update: after a few weeks of using the product, I am still very much happy with the product. Just a few things would make it better. When an alarm is received on your iPhone, being to view the alert without having to go thru a process of logging into the app,even a quick view, would be great. Also, if you had a tablet and wanted to keep the view on the screen, as a home screen type of thing, that would be a nice option too.",Sad I didn’t invest sooner!

I would highly recommend that no one buy this product. I bought one for my front and one for my back. I had old internet technology and it didn't work. I understood that and installed new high speed internet service. Their advertisement claim was you need 2 Mbps for it to work. My new internet had 9 Mbps upload and it still didn't work. More than 4 times what they said I need. Ring then said it was because my modem was too far away so I had the modem moved. I then had my modem moved to where it was literally 40 ft from each camera. Still doesn't work so I called RING again. Proved to them that my upload speed was more than sufficient via a speed measurement tool on their very own web page . They then said Ring will only work when modem is 30 ft . (yes, feet) from cameras. How can anyone have a modem 30 ft from an outside device.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2018,Wendy,"Initially I have the camera on my guest network along with my kids’ iPad, as soon as I installed the camera, not only the video didn’t work, but it was causing WiFi issues for my kids (mom we have no WiFi!!!!!!!!!!!) since then I made two changes 1) got a fios network extender to boost the signals 2) isolate the camera on another network and put it on channel 1 instead of auto scan and it works!!!! Why I decided to use fios network extender is because the ease of use, you plug in the coax cable and the power and it just work with your existing network without config. I was looking into the mesh network but based on some of the reviews it sounds like a pain to config since your network will be behind a NAT and also, you have to switch from one network to another network manually as you are walking from one zone to another zone. It’s only been one day but so far I’m happy with the results.

I have configured the Ring App and added the Ring skill to Alexa.  When I ask Alexa to turn on the light it says ""Turn on is not supported currently.""  I bought the Ring product because Ring is owned by Amazon so I thought it would more compatible with Alexa to control all of the smart devices.  I can view the camera with an Alexa Show but that is all.  I can turn the light on/off from the Ring app but the point is I can't build any Alexa skills to do that.  I find that pretty stupid for a Smart Home device. Another issue is connectivity.  My router broadcasts wifi on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.  The Ring Flood light does not see the 5 GHz band.  It only lets me choose from the 2.4 GHz signal. I can view the camera with my Ring App.  It seems to be working fine.  I have not had the product long enough to make any observations about the camera.  If you read other reviews, there are a lot of poor reviews regarding the Ring App interface. Given the issues I've listed above and the  recently published security issues with Ring products I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing a Ring product.  Hopefully Amazon can improve the Ring products but so far they are disappointing.  CNET recently gave a recommendation to NOT purchase these products.

Thankfully a neighbor told us that the light was coming for about 5 secs and then going out every time there was a trip event that they saw. Another challenge we had was the event triggers. At first the sensitivity was more than needed so we toned it down to the people setting.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Apr 2018,DougA,"The only thing I like better than my Ring Video Doorbell 2 is my Ring Floodlight Camera.  This thing is awesome.  I had a regular porch light on the eave in the front middle of my garage which I replaced with this device. It was easy peasy to do.  Just take off the old light, and wire the new light in it's place.  The app connected with it quickly and I was soon adjusting all of the settings.  It took a few days of tweaking the settings to find a comfort zone where the light came on when I wanted it and the camera came on when I wanted it - both settings function independently which is excellent.  Some have wondered if this can be installed horizontally - and that is exactly what I did and it works perfectly.  The slope of my driveway may help me with this, because my property slopes several feet down over the 20 foot length of the driveway.  I point this out because with my floodlight camera installed, the motion sensor dome is not perfectly parallel to the ground.  The lights themselves are easily adjustable, but the sensor/camera portion only moves a little bit - but it is more than enough for me. I am extremely happy with my purchase.  If they were any less expensive, I would put them and the other 3 external walls of my house.",The only thing I like better than my Ring Video Doorbell 2 is my ...

Why my rating: Bad video quality: It’s choppy and and at best looks like 480p upscaled to HD. The colors are nice though. I highly doubt that it’s my internet connection as I contracted 100Mbps and Speedtest.net hasn’t measured anything under ~50. It also can’t be Wi-Fi strength since it’s only 5ft away from the router. Notifications and response: It takes a disappointing, worrying, unacceptably long time to get video from an alert notification. On my Galaxy S7 and iPhone it takes about 7 seconds to get an alert and receive video on the app. On many occasions, delivery people have come and gone before I even get to see them on video; thank God they weren’t burglars. In all fairness, the desktop app opens reasonably quick, and once you receive the video feed the lag is only about half a second. The main purpose we bought this was for security and peace of mind, which it did not deliver. I would almost give it 3 stars because the App has a really nice “Neighbor Hood Watch” feature, but I expected more for the cost and the hype of Ring.","In concept it's great, but in practice it's lacking"

It connected to my phone quickly and was up and running in about 45 mins. The camera faces the back of my house giving me a panoramic view of my backyard.  The motion lights are bright and work well, fully lighting the entire backyard which has been awesome in the darker days of winter. I live in an owner occupied duplex where I also have a small business,  and people mostly enter my home through my back door.  The camera has made it great for me to know who is coming and going,  as well as offering security for tenants and clients when it’s dark outside.  I can even talk to my 80 year old mother if she’s leaving my house late at night (which is 7pm for her).  I find this feature more amusing than my friends and family... and my moms little dog... but I like a feature that brings me a laugh.  Hopefully I’ll never have to yell at someone trying to break in but it’s good to know I can! I also have the ring doorbell which is good but,  it informs me of motion after the fact, and needs more battery changes than I’d like.  So I’m finding the hard wired version of the camera totally worth a little extra set up in not having to deal with a battery.  Plus the camera seems to be more efficient?

Since I had a motion light already wired, I thought the added benefits the cam provides might be worth it.  This is used on a second home, so it is very often empty. I can say without hesitation, that I am not disappointed.  First, the setup was a breeze. I was up and running in about 5-10 minutes. The camera view is excellent and the video quality is too.  It jumps a little every so often, which I'm guessing is an internet connectivity issue. Certainly not a deal breaker. Since it is on a second home, here are some of the benefits you may not have thought about in addition to the unwelcome visitor. I can see the coming and goings of authorized guests. (Cleaning company, pest control, contractors, etc.) In live view I can see if I need to have the driveway plowed without being there. If I am coming in late, I can remotely keep the light on, rather than solely relying on the motion activation when I arrive. All in all I think the floodlight cam is a game changer.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2017,Mike H.,"Ring's Floodlight camera is pretty amazing, and it has quite a few good settings on it. It is very customizable and has the ability to set up 3 zones and move them wherever you like where the camera catches video. Nice touch. The product feels heavy and durable. It has a good heft to it and feels like it won't break anytime soon. There is plastic on this device though, so its not all metal. You will want to probably have someone who knows more about electricity and setup if you don't have a junction box ready to go and setup though, as we had to in this case. Probably best for safety as it does require full hardwire 120V setup. Not a bad thing - I never expect a floodlight to run on a battery. You do NEED a junction box though. My biggest complaint is the inconsistency of this camera. While we can't set it up to 9 Feet high due to a roof at 9 Feet, we are able to get it to just above 8 Feet. It could be that, but I highly doubt it, since it does this: During the day, it works perfectly. It will catch anything in the Zones and I have the zones setup so that it can't constantly record for moving cars, but will record our front porch and sidewalk to the house. I've not seen it miss someone yet, even myself. During the night is a whole different story. If I have the camera set to not have lights off - it MAY catch someone... at the highest setting. Anything lower and I get nothing. I can sit out at my driveway, swing arms left and right (with lights off) and it may get it me two or three times in the zones I set up out of 10. Our neighbors have easily walked by with no detection, even at full setting. (So it isn't just me being unseen) If I have the lights on.. its a little better. Maybe 6 or 7 out of 10. However, just recently with the setting to 4/5 (right near the Detect ALL activity) I was able to park at my driveway with lights on in the night, walk to my door and get it completely unseen by the camera. Thankfully my doorbells by Ring don't do this and they caught me before I even got to my door. (It's funny my doorbells from Ring are better at security than this at NIGHT) Another weird thing is that since Winter is upon us the sun will slightly bead at the camera now (Not direct, thankfully). For about 2 hours during the day, EVERYTHING is recorded, even to leaves falling. And I turned the setting down to People Only as it says in the app. Wow. Lens flares from Cars and Sun Beading really affect this sensor, this happens at night too when a vehicle drives by at the right angle and trips the floodlight into everything. But yet - it missed me an entire time once. So daytime the camera is near perfect. With the exception of the sun beading a bit into the camera and sensor, it will work as intended. Nighttime, your results vary big time. It sucks to have to switch from 3/5 Sensitivity to ""ALL"" activity sensitivity everytime the sun sets, then back to 3/5 when the sun rises (otherwise during the day it records even the slightest movement, which it should at ALL activity) Nonetheless, I like the product. It.. works, but it varies. It could be that I'm 1 foot short, but the sensor is parallel to the ground, and works fine elsewise. I recommend it but do note that it may not record everything, especially at night.",Floodlight Works Great with Variants at Night however

In North Carolina, we have plenty of bugs on summer evenings, which means we will get 10-20 of these false alerts/events every night even with the sensitivity on the lowest setting. We've resorted to shutting off alerts during overnight hours, which is completely defeating the purpose of this security camera. We have several other motion lights at our home and none of them have this issue. We also have a Ring doorbell, which does not experience this issue at all.

I though it was the distance from the router but all my other devices work great even several houses down. I have a very strong wifi signal and internet speeds over 100 mbps. I tried putting a wifi extender closer to the camera but I cannot get the Ring camera to log into the extender. Every other device I have; has no problem using the extender. I also keep having to reset the light settings. Not easy to troublshoot. After being contacted by the company the issues have been resolved. The customer service by this company is incredible.,More than pleased now!

My wife and I just purchased a new home without a garage, and this is the perfect set up to make sure our vehicles stay safe at night. Camera quality is surprisingly good and the LEDs are very bright as well. A little bit more advanced to install if you are wiring a new junction box, but still only takes about 45 minutes. Only negative is that it is a little spendy. I feel like they would sell more if they were about $75 cheaper. Still a great product all in all!",Great Product

I liked it so much I ordered three more. It has been detecting squirrels, opossums, and raccoons and deer. It will take a little adjustment to get everything just right but it definitely works well and my wife finds it reassuring. We have had an internal alarm system with motion detectors, but no cameras. This is a nice addition to the monitored alarm system. We were in Italy and the Ring doorbell said ""motion"" at the front door. Looking at the camera, there were two deer on our front entry. Amazing. I haven't used the talk feature yet. With five stations, the animals set it off frequently, and I'm working to make it less sensitive to catch people, not squirrels.","Easy set up, gives peace of mind & works well."

Contacted Ring support before purchase and was told it could be mounted horizonally with camera mount modification, I was told there was a YouTube video on how to do this. Support person also stated this modification would void the warranty. I was told by support that it had a dusk to dawn setting, it does not. The light schedule can be set to the dusk and dawn time.

If there hadn't been exisiting electrical issues it seems like it would have been a relatively quick physical install.

It is installed higher than the recommended 9ft (about 15ft off the ground), but the image is still clear and the option to select alert area is great.  It would be nice if I could also set alert parameters by time and not just area. I opted for the $30 a year, 60 day cloud storage option.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2018,Jim Cady,"Works OK, but it appears to have been a refurbished item that was re-painted and hastily re-packaged. The internal packing was damaged, including tears in the cardboard where the light was inserted, the plastic protector around one of the lights was crushed and torn, the small box with documents was squashed and loose in the box, and the plastic protector over the lens was crooked and looked to have been replaced. Before installation, when I attempted to adjust the sensor/camera assembly, it popped out because it was not fully seated. After installation, I attempted to adjust the lights and that proved to be difficult because the pivoting parts were painted over and stuck together; as a result, loosening the locking rings for the lights required pliers, which scratched the paint off. When I adjusted one light while it was turned on, it kept blinking out.

Due to proximity of neighbors it took a few days of adjustments to get the proper motion detector coverge over two zones without catching unwanted motion.

The video quality is horrible the motion alerts are nonexistent and a person will be on my front porch before it wakes up. All I see is the top of a head that is unrecognizable due to video quality. Now the lights keep going even after turning them off in the app numerous times. I disable in the app and the app turns the toggle switch back on within a minute. I'll be taking it down and depositing it in the dumpster as it is not worth the effort to return. Update Worked with a Ring rep only to discover my ISP upload speed is insufficient. I was advised the only resolution was to get a different provider. The cost of switching providers out weights the $250 cost of the Ring unit. Feeling foolish and cash lite. PLEASE put the system requirements in BIG BOLD print. that simple curtesy would avoid all the disappointment. UPDATE 10/19 I upped my connection speed with my provider to 30 download and 3 upload. Contacted Ring support to retry the setup. Made a phone appt. by email and I waited as the set time came and went. Never received a call nor a email of explanation. So, here it is, I now have a more expensive internet and a $250 security setup that needs still more connection speed to perform as advertised in the listing. Seems that not putting the extreme requirements needed to enable the unit to function as represented is deliberately under-informing/misinforming the purchaser. This would make Ring corp. fraudulent or at least less than forthcoming. Update 12/05 Have done everything Ring has asked of me to try and get the unit to work , including reinstall of a replacement. The replacement has the same issues as the original. When changing them out failed to resolve the lack of functionality the line of communication ended two weeks ago.

First, I thought it would be added to my Ring doorbell account where video is saved in the cloud for a time, it isn’t. You have to add a subscription for each device. The sensitivity of the light motion detector is such that a moth will trigger the light, but not video which is set for human motion, and it’s on all night.  Finally, it is almost a certainty that this light will be some distance from your router and will need a WiFi signal boost, so calculate that into your budget.

The neighbor is 100 feet away and the setting is for 15 feet.  If I adjust even the slightest, it will not go off at all.  Every car that goes in front of my home at night sets it off.  During the day the cars driving down the road do not set if off, only at night.  So I have to disable it every night, which is when I need the most protection.",will not work as advertised
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2018,bikeusa,This is my fifth camera.  Very clear.  I like the ring system.  As long as you have a strong internet system it works great.  Installation is pretty easy.  I have recommended the system to family and friends.  My first camera has survived a year now through an Iowa winter and no complaints with the hardware.  I use it to monitor my fish pond while away.  We had our car broke into Monday.  By Friday I ordered the camera and have it installed and running. Over the driveway.  Last night it functioned exactly as it was programmed.,Ring Flood Light Camera

Setup wasn't really difficult nor was installation. It has quick response to activity. No latency issues that I've seen. My dog actually goes to the door when he hears the chimes on my phone. I've been able to eliminate most false alarms - except for when a bug lands on it (:  Our setup (property layout) may be easier than others in false alarms, but it's been good. Nice to be able to check things out when you are away too. Our reason for going with the Ring is that Amazon bought them and you need to have faith in the app that actually runs this. Having Amazon buy them gave me a lot of faith. Also, the subscription rate is much lower than other cameras especially if you add cameras. We've had it a couple of months now, very happy with it.",Works great!

I have cheaper indoor cameras that have excellent AI for person detection and motion with no false alarms even with indoor pets.

Newton,"I got this to mount over the garage to monitor my back alley facing driveway. It works beautifully once I bought a Ring Chime Pro extender to get the signal to it. The only downside for this unit is that the wireless receiver is apparently pretty weak. In order to get it to even connect to the wireless I had to purchase a Ring Chime Pro extender, which makes it work like it should, but the extender is only about 15 feet closer to my router than the camera, so I am surprised the extender gets a fine signal but the camera couldn't get one at all. So, the floodlight camera is awesome, just be prepared to possibly spend an additional $50 to get it to work if you are not mounting it close to your router.","Works well, but weak wireless receiver"

You'll receive a pop up notification on your phone that says motion detected, and then it wont load any video, spins for 5 mins, then says ""reconnect"" and never seems to be able to open up and show you the camera. By the time you get the camera to load on a device, the motion is gone. Total scam to make you pay for their ""subscription"" to their Cloud (which btw does not speed up the response time of device, even if you do pay. You just end up having to ""rewind"" and check). NOT a security deterrent and I dont feel any safer having this. Someone could be halfway into your home breaking in before the camera even loads.

There are still times where it will tell me it has trouble connecting but it has been more reliable.

I would recommend this as long as you are installing it in a close proximity of router or you have killer wifi signal. Old:  I really wanted this thing to be worth the money but it's not.  Since the install, I have had nothing but issues with video.  The lights work fine but I bought this for the video and all I get is a black screen.  Wifi strength is not the issue. While verifying the wires were connected correctly, I had the video show up on my phone.  As soon as I put it back up on the wall, the video went black.  It is detecting motion and gives me all the warnings but that doesn't help me without video. My neighbor that lives behind me has been seen walking through my yard and up to my back door.

If your signal is not strong enough or you do not have enough bandwidth to handle the cameras, computers and maybe Netflix at the same time, that is probably your problem. I personally have cox cable with 100 megabyte download, an orbi mesh router. This gives me very good signal and bandwidth both in and out of my home.

The night vision is impeccable on the Floodlight Cams, and when motion is detected the actual lighting via the bulbs is great! Mounting was a breeze, took me no more than 15-20 min per unit. Like any product, there are pros and cons... One major con for some will likely be the WiFi signal strength. Though they do work perfectly fine, sometimes they’re a bit slow to load and/or lose connection for a few seconds. The “resolution” for this would be a Ring Chime or Chime Pro, BUT, this will also put a burden on your existing WiFi, so I do NOT recommend going that route... I’ve found the only true resolution for this is to upgrade to higher speeds with your provider and/or purchase a “Whole Home WiFi System”.

Let me first say that customer support and service like that of Ring is hard to find these days. I had ordered an additional Floodlight Cam through the Ring website but was unable to get my handyman out to install it for several months. When he finally arrived, it was determined that my camera could not be wired in the spot I wanted it. I contacted Ring to see about returning it, and they were AMAZING. They were kind enough to process my return for a full refund and also paid shipping costs, even though I was past the return date. Each tech I was in contact with gave me a direct email to reach them if I had any problems or concerns. This should be the standard for every company. To solve my problem, I plan to buy the new Ring Spotlight Cam with solar. I have solar with two of my other stickup cams and they both work like a charm. As for the ""Floodlight Cam"" I am reviewing here, it is AWESOME. It has the best camera of any of the ring products I've tried, and I haven't had any connection issues. It's also very bright and makes me feel secure knowing it lights up the side of my house whenever there is motion. The only downside you might encounter is the install. My handyman had to wire into an outlet on the second story of my house. It's definitely not electrical work I would try myself, but it was worth it.

It works exactly as advertised.  Set up was simple and instructions were very clear.  I am pretty handy and it was pretty easy to wire and mount it.  Getting it connected to WiFi was a breeze.  It works perfectly and I am amazed at the quality of the images.  The app is very intuitive and designed.  I then went ahead and purchased a ring doorbell.  It works perfectly and I was able to seamlessly integrate it with the app and the floodlight camera.  I love this system so much I am adding a camera to my backyard.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Apr 2018,jkriffs,"The floodlight works as advertised but could easily be improved with simple application updates. Having the ability to identify motion zones is great and allowing to to only start recording if motion  is detected and notifying me is great. However, we should have the ability to set a motion zone that allows ring to record but does not notify us. For example, I’d like to have the ability to have ring record when a vehicle comes down my street but I don’t want to be notified of this. Continuous recording to me appears to be a simple application integration and would easily advance the effectiveness of the floodlight. The floodlight overall is great and I would buy another but simple updates could make the product far better. If I come across another competitor that offers the above I’ll quickly replace my ring floodlight.",Good. Could be better.

Motion sensing needs a little bit of tweaking, although narrowing down motion zones, the camera detects the outside area. Installation is quite easy, and the camera syncs up with the base just by following the phone app instruction. It may be a small matter; however, the paint of nuts came off easily while tightening up, the plastic screw which came with the item wore out easily as well, it is better to use a metal hex driver for a clean installation.","Very nice picture quality, easy installation, rest will be assured while you are away from home!"

Also love the option to set sections of my backyard for motion, I left out the very back part of my yard because my neighbors lets their cats roam at night and the cats come over the fence right in that section.

It may be our wi-fi?  We dont normally have a problem with our wi-fi, and our camera is not far from the router, so im not really sure. The sound/picture quality are great!  I would recommmend it though, i think its overall a pretty good product, and installation is pretty simple if you already have a pre-existing wired outside flood light!

I am redoing my backyard so please do not judge.  I am somewhat disappointed in my ring purchases.  The cameras are great and the detail and zoom are fantastic.  This is a hardwired unit that really lights up an area.  The video is taken at 10 pm.  I thought it would be great for entertaining but the light only stays on for 1 minute (camera too) so someone has to move to get it to light up again.  During a recent power outage I found out that without WiFi nothing gets saved, so if you loose power there is no camera footage of anything that happens or any alerts.  I am ordered a battery backup for my modem and router.  The camera only records for 30 seconds if on battery or 1 minute if hardwired.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jun 2018,Phil,"This product has great potential, but the light has some manufacturing flaws and can be challenging to set up. Installation of the hardware wasn't challenging, but connecting to Wi-Fi was a problem. Technical support wasn't very professional or helpful, and I ended up resolving the issue on my own. Once the Wi-Fi issues were resolved, the floodlight worked very well for about three months. Great video quality. A few weeks ago, the light stopped activating at night. It would still identify motion and record, but the lights wouldn't turn on. I could turn the lights on through the app, but that wasn't really the point of this product. I called Ring technical support, which turned out again to be quite pointless. I'd already tried a reset and checked the settings in the app. After further investigation, I found that water has built up in the sensor at the bottom of the camera. Not sure how the water got in there, but the light was installed with a good seal at the junction box. I wrote to Ring support about this issue and was told this was condensation, which should not affect product performance. If you look at the attached photo, it would be impossible for condensation alone to create that much water buildup.","Great video quality, but poor craftsmanship. May leak!"

The video quality is good and in the first 2 weeks I caught a prowler trying to open my car door at night.

I felt like i was going to rip them out with I was twisting the wire caps. I wish they used a higher quality LED bulb that produces more light. It would be nice to be able to turn the lights off during the day and just use the camera for security but it’s an “all on” function now. It would be nice if the camera had zoom.

Now there is a color problem. There is a tint to the color that makes things look greenish and others red. I think the night vision is stuck on. Tried calling ring, they don't answer the phone. Been in two email exchanges with a girl named Heaven and the other Milana which takes about a day to get responses back. Frustrating. They said they rebooted their system. Told me to kill the power for 10 min to reboot mine. I'd post another pic to compare the before it went bad and after but it only let me post the bad pic.

I bought on sale at $199 (20% off). I would not give full price. The installation and setup was super simple. Video quality is great. It is a little trial and error to get your settings and zones right. My only complaint is a flying bug or spider will set off the motion. There is a ""people only"" motion setting that I do not use. Maybe that would help but I would rather get too much motion instead of not enough.",Exceeded my expectations

At the time of writing you still cant get it in the UK, I ordered mine from the US and it shipped in about 2 weeks.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Oct 2019,Joel P.,"We have a vacation home in the Olympic mountains that has an extremely slow DSL connection (1.5M).  We had 2 previous camera systems (1 cheap garbage and the latest, a Lorex/FLIR system).  The Lorex system was very spotty on motion detection and the APP was not great.  They forced users to ""upgrade"" to a new APP that wouldn't allow us to view our cameras at all.  Not joking.  If you look up the reviews on that APP, thousands of people with the same problem.  So my Lorex system became a boat anchor overnight. We installed 3 RING flood light cameras and 2 of the regular RING spotlight cameras.  WOW.  Picture quality, motion detection and APP function are all very good.  Considering we have a substandard internet connection, I expected less performance from these units but have been pleasantly surprised.  With the Lorex units, we would have a deer walking through the yard and 1 out of 4 cameras would send an alert when all 4 should have picked up the deer's walking path.  The RING system consistently catches motion we expect it to.  The customizable motion zones are a very nice feature that allows us to clip out the street from our front camera motion detection so no passing cars are alerted on. You get what you pay for with security cameras.  I've spent triple what I did on the Lorex system and am happy I did.  I'm a believer in the RING products.","Great Picture, Great Motion Detection, Great APP"

It is fairly easy to install if especially if you already have an existing flood light. I did not have it, but my skills were sufficient to perform the task. If you have an existing flood light, the camera comes with all the hardware you need, even a small screwdriver is included. If you don't have an existing setup for the flood light, you will need to do some drilling and to get a round electric box. I picked one up at HomeDepot for under $5. After you install the hardware, everything else is a breeze and you just follow instructions on your phone. Remember that you have to have a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection with a strong enough signal at a location of the camera. I love the camera, the lights are bright and I can manually turn them on if I hang out in my backyard and need light-it's a bonus for me. One thing I wish was different is the sensitivity of the motion sensor.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2018,Kent Feuerbach,"I purchased the Ring doorbell and was so satisfied with it that I ordered the floodlight camera.  I quickly determined that it's night time sensitivity was very poor.  I would have roughly 12 hours of almost no activity.  I performed numerous tests by walking by the camera from various angles at different times of the night.  The camera would only turn on in about one out of four tests.  I contacted Ring and explained my situation.  They were aware that there was a problem.  They sent me another camera with the caveat that I probably wouldn't work any better.  Fast forward two months and after numerous software downloads, the product is not operating any better and to add insult to injury, my work truck was broken into right under the camera and it never turned on.  They know I still have a problem and that the issue is still active, yet they continue to sell the product.  They have stopped communicating with me and apparently are walking away from the problem.  The have never offered to refund my money or compensate me in any way for my stolen tools.  If you buy this product, you are taking a big chance.",DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!

Or as a stand alone security camera.  The viewing angle is very wide. The video quality is very good. And the LED flood lights are very bright. Installing the Ring Floodlight Cam is easy if you already have a floodlight installed.  The install instructions are very easy to follow. Once installed and connected to you network. Adjusting camera settings are very easy using the Ring App.  I do not like that I can not change the light bulb if it ever burns out.  Also not sure if I will have to climb my ladder to press the sync button every time the power goes out. Only time will tell.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jun 2018,John R. Kowalczyk,"Pros - I love the camera triggered by motion detector, especially when paired with the spotlights. Very bright, video quality very good, even at night. It was easy to setup the motion zones, which work great. A great sense of security. We also have the Ring doorbell and this makes a complete package. With the ability to talk through the camera system, it's fun to surprise the landscape workers to ask them questions about their work! Hardwired, so no battery issues. Cons - I have three cameras and two paired very easily with my WiFi network. Third had issues pairing, but after about 5 tries it finally got connected. I don't like the fact that you have to subscribe to their $100 per year plan to save any of the video. I have Arlo cameras installed and I'm able to connect a USB drive to save captured video. That is why I docked a star from really nice cameras. While the apps for your phone/tablet are well done, I don't like that my computer access to the cameras is only to view captured video (plan required). I have no controls or settings available on my computer, which means I can't remotely look at the live video like I can on my phone.

Having owned one of their doorbells for several months, I was expecting a quality out-of-box and installation experience. As expected, this Ring floodlight delivered, except for one unfathomably poor and nearly fatal flaw. The cap nuts that secure the Ring floodlight assembly to its mounting plate are made from a soft alloy that's only slightly stronger than butter. Both stripped out their threads during install (which I didn't notice because the orange handle meant to tighten them is slightly oversized and will also slip over these cap nuts.) Amazingly, the floodlight survived its 8 foot drop onto concrete with only minor cosmetic damage.

You can’t set this to detect motion via IR camera and THEN turn on the light.  You also cannot disable the lights and continue using motion.

I downloaded the app, synced with the camera and light, and done!  Works great...picture is clear and as you can see, I have a large backyard and the camera almost covers the entire thing.  The lights are extremely bright and do the job just fine.  You'll have to adjust the sensitivity and the notifications more than likely because every time a squirrel runs across your backyard, you'll get a chime on the phone.  That gets old quick, so there's a little learning curve to that.  Otherwise, would highly recommend and I'm planning on getting another camera for the front yard.",Great Product

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2018,C. Parrott,"First, the good: Easy to install; only took me 20 or so minutes to replace my existing motion detection/floodlight. The flood lights are quite bright, and can be easily adjusted to any angle/position you wish. Decent wide-area coverage. App was easy to use, and allowed me to create motion ""zones"" to dictate when detector is triggered, and when lights come on. now the bad. the design of the base is inadequate. the directions dictate that the motion sensor on the bottom of the camera should be parallel with the ground. this is only possible if you mount the unit on a wall. if mounting under the eaves of your roof, the camera arm does not articulate well enough to point the camera level. it will point down at an angle, limiting forward visibility. Fortunately, I my eaves are nearly 15 ft in the air, so the angle works just enough to cover my front yard. Second, the quality of the camera is average. from my roof mount, i cannot make out faces. It really doesn't help me to see someone in my yard, if i cannot provide the police with a quality, identifiable face-shot. But my biggest gripe is the lack of recording previous motion alerts. You have to pay Ring a monthly fee to keep your recordings. This means that if your Ring is triggered, you only have the option of viewing footage WHILE that even is happening. If you miss the event, even by a few minutes, it becomes a past event and is no longer available unless you pay Ring monthly fees. If you aren't near your phone, and you miss it, you have no video proof of what caused the trigger detection; therefore, cannot submit to police as evidence. There should be a window of time you can view a current event. All in all, a decent camera/floodlight, but the design could be better to allow mounting under eaves. And there needs to be a window of time you can view a triggered event. If you want to have footage of events, better to purchase a different security camera system -- one that can record to a home DVR. :::As a follow up to some questions, i have included ""selfies"" of me walking my dogs. As you can see, from 15 ft in the air, the camera will capture my entire yard, but just barely. any lower (or a bigger yard) and it wouldn't see beyond the fence. I've also zoomed (via the app) the same pic. My ring is approximately 20 ft away and as you can see the detail is average. It would be hard to make out detail with this if i were a suspicious porch pirate or home invader. This unit might be better if it was mounted right about the walkway, or replacing the wall light fixture beside the main door.",It's average.
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2018,Skbaby,The picture is great. The light is bright and the siren is loud. Here are my gripes: by the time the app loads the video an intruder could already be out of sight and/or in your home. Also if your on vacation like a cruise you have no internet access and therefore will not get alerted nor can set off the alarm if an intruder is spotted. For these reasons I am not sure if the protection is really great. You may br better off with the security system and an indoor camera.,Internet connection is everything.

If you mount this camera anywhere else on your property dont place any bets on identifying anyone unless you already know them. Video quality is dismal at best. Ring community is another story.

The light is placed above my garage and is higher than the recommended distance to the ground, but the image quality is still decent. And even though my wireless router is located in my basement, I still get a good WiFi signal. I’ve had no one try to break into my garage or house while I’ve had the camera, but it did help me catch a trespasser who was clipping roses from my rose bushes. The installation was a breeze. If you’re able to install a new light fixture in your house you’ll be able to install this. The motion sensing light works great and illuminates the surrounding area without blinding my neighbors. I haven’t had any technical difficulties or problems with this light or my Ring doorbell cam. And the only interaction I’ve had with Ring support staff was due to a billing issue, which they resolved quickly. If everything remains good, once my home’s existing security system contract is up, I plan to transition all of my home security to Ring.","Works great, easy installation"

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Nov 2017,Robbi,"1/28/18 ... I'm updating my review from one star to 5. I would give it a 4.5 if it were possible. We bought a new camera and returned the other one, and the new one works great. The only thing I'm not completely happy with is the software that allows us to view our location. We get notified that there's someone outside, and by the time we can get the software to pull up on the screen, it's usually too late to see who it is, unless they remain in front of the camera. I still love the camera and appreciate how we can keep an eye on things, but I wish the software would just pop up the camera view on the phone vs making us take the time to go to the software and open the view. If I can get to my cell phone quick enough to select the link that pops up and says there is motion, then it does open a bit quicker, but I would still prefer the image just pop up. That would save the wasted seconds needed to get a good view of who was in front of the camera. Also, the image we see on our phone or computer is a very clear image. That's another plus. __________________ OLD ORIGINAL POST We had a professional, very experienced company install this and everything works fine expect for the screen image which is always black. There's never a video image. Our modem is close to the camera. We have excellent internet speed and connection (beyond Ring's own website troubleshooting standards). The company that installed for us worked on installing for many hours and now we have a camera installed that is worthless. Very disappointed! We'll be returning this.","Updated review ... had a bad camera, but new one works great."

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2018,Chin,"SPOILER: GET READY FOR A RAGE RANT - PREFACE: Credential wise, I've installed and worked with a decent amount of CCTV, wired, and wireless IP cameras working as a Property Manager in the past so this is not my first go at putting these type of things in and setting them up. I've built PCs, know a little of a few different programming languages, and done Property Management and maintenance for 10+ years. I've installed a Ring Doorbell in the past for a client and they were pleased with it even though they had really bad wifi throughout their house and had to use repeaters on each floor for their 6 story townhouse in Manhattan. And I'm that Asian that has more tech running up in my house than you're average guy, I got more smart sockets plugged in and bins of unused PC parts than probably anyone who doesn't work IT - Anyhow, got this ""thing"" to replace an outdated FOSCAM wireless IP camera I had running inside looking out as FOSCAM went out of business years ago and I was having some issues using it as I was. And I say ""thing"" because every time I look at it, it reminds me of Roberto the robot from Futurama and it just stabbed me in the brain trying to get it working, so yea... think of that every time you look one from now on. Wasn't too pleased that I couldn't save footage locally without their subscription but I was going to bite the bullet and pay the yearly cost once I got it up and running. Anyhow, spent the better part of this morning on a ladder removing the light fixture which was there and installing this ""thing"". Cut the power back on and ran the initial setup and everything was somewhat good. Got good video quality, although somewhat delayed and laggy, but it was working and I was pleased. Walked back inside and less than five minutes later went to check the app, that's where the boss battle began. The camera refused to reconnect to the internet, reran the setup multiple times, reset the power, MOVED MY ROUTER CLOSER! (Which having a couple things hard wired and where it is was a bit of a pain but I was giving it the benefit of the doubt), and still nothing. I have a wifi analyzer and speed test app on my phone and I was getting good signal and decent up/download speeds to that location. My router on the second floor in my bedroom easily less than 10 feet from the installation location with basically only one exterior wall between em so signal strength from the wifi or my internet connection speed should not have been an issue and I refuse to believe I need a wifi extender when everything else gets good signal there (I have the screen shots of the signal meter and speed tests to prove it). Did a search and found a video of a guy claiming that these will not work with ASUS AC routers which might be the issue as I have an ASUS router, but if that is the case why should I change my router for one product when everything else works fine? Could it be a defective model, I will say maybe... am I willing to go through this process again, no. Other than that most other complaints about Ring is their customer service which I'm not about to contact as anytime I talk to tier 1, sometimes 2, tech support of ANY company I tell them more than they know (I've worked in a call center before and they'll generally hire anyone off the street to read the scripts on the screen and training before they hit the call floor is sub par to say the least) - SUMMARY - If I as a consumer, who has dealt with this type of equipment before, is having this much trouble FROM THE START with your product, I have NO REASON, or given even the slightest expectation, to believe it will work for me down the line to get my money's worth out of it. I'll go back to my outdated FOSCAM for the time being and maybe get a NEST or Arlo system instead... I might post pics of the speed/signal strength tests and installation location to go with this later, but for now I'm getting a beer... kthxbye... UPDATE: So... Ring's neighborhood support tech did reach out to me about my review a few times before I responded. After doing some basic troubleshooting/info gathering, I gave him my e-mail so he could see what happened and apparently it bricked in between firmware updates after install, according to him, as I was trying to live view it after install which caused the issue. Then he suggested again that I call him and we walk through initial setup again to see if it would finish the update and work, as he was under the assumption it was still up, but I informed him it was already in the box ready for return and I wasn't going up the ladder again to test it for a second time; as I'd only be more pissed if I did and say worse if it failed. So I'm done... I WILL SAY TO HIS/THEIR CREDIT THAT THEY TRIED TO HELP, but I wasn't about to hop on a ladder again only to deal with removing the light, reinstalling the camera, testing the camera, having it fail again, removing the camera, and reinstalling the light again... nah... I got other things to do considering what I paid for the camera... If it was an out of the box fix (aside from my network setup/lighting issue) for a simple problem it would of worked and I would of bite the bullet in terms of the negatives such as loosing a permanent light and paying for a video subscription due to lack of local saving... But I can tint my windows and use an indoor cam, which I already have, for less cost and more benefits overall. Guess I'm going to learn how to do window tinting now or pay someone to tint one window to avoid the glare on my indoor camera which does more than this ""thing"" for way less... So, FINAL REVIEW: Out of the box and install experience needs major work to say the least. Customer support is there but needs work. As far as final return process, that is TBD...","So long, and thanks for all the fish... My first really bad review..."

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2017,The Chupacabra,"I installed 2 of these on the sides of my house to replace the old school floodlights that were there.  Installation was fairly easy (I had a problem installing on the of the screws into the side of the house, I ended up using apoxy on a molly bolt holder which worked great).  After figuring that out, installation was fairly simple and straightforward.  Get it all installed, turn the power back on then open the app on your phone.  Went through set up no problem.  All installed and worked great for a day.  Then.... floodlight just stayed on.  What?  Called customer support and they said they knew about the issue but didn't have a fix.  What?  They recommended sending these back and getting 2 locally as they may be a newer model.  They also ended up sending me 1 by mail.  Not quite sure why.  Ok.  Gave up for the night and was able to turn the flood lights off, but just not so they were able to do motion sensing... you know the thing that I bought them for.  Figured the next day I would take them down and send them back.  The next day by the time I got around to looking at them they were working fine.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe a software update?  No idea.  They have worked perfect in the time since then so ultimately I have no complaints.  I would say don't throw away the old floodlight in that days trash after installation (yes that happened).  Then give it a day or so for the software to update (I did this manually on the phone with tech support but it seems it needed to do it itself). So ultimately I gave it five stars, because I love the floodlights.  The installation software thing was a pain, but ultimately it works great now.  I can see my backyard whenever I want when I am traveling and it shows me if the pool service guy comes or not.  You get a notification when the floodlight activates, or during the day if motion is detected.  I will say the neighborhood cat occasionally sets it off, as did a huge spider that decided to make its home on the camera.  My kids loved the video of that. The floodlights are bright and it is nice that you can turn them on with the app, so when I am out by the pool I can turn on the floodlights for a little more light without getting water all over the house. The five stars is ultimately that in the end it works perfectly as I had hoped.  I could have knocked off a star for the installation issues, but ultimately I love these things so I am giving it five stars.",I love these.  I have 2 of them.  I had some installation software issues but was able to resolve them.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Nov 2017,The Tunisons,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I like it a lot!! Con: I would give it 5 stars but there are a few small things that could improve. There is about a 10 second delay from when someone or something comes in the yard and a ring message is sent to your phone, buy the time you get the message the someone or something in your yard may be gone.  So I bought the cloud so I will at least know what was there.  Also occasionally, it will not send a message when someone or something is in the yard, not sure why, but that does not happen that often. Pros: High quality video, very clear.  During the day the visual range of camera is wonderful, very wide area covered. Depending on the angle your camera is facing you can see way past your house. At night the visual area is limited to your yard, you can see as far as the spotlights shine.  You can check up on your house anytime, you don't have to wait for a ring alert. If you are expecting a package you are alerted.  You can talk to the person in your yard, as well as hear what they say, but they have to speak loudly.  I highly recommend buying the $30 a year cloud plan, it is very useful.  You can download the video to your personal devise if you chose to save the video.  Like I said in the Con there is a 10 sec delay, so since the cloud records everything it allows you to see what was there. ...

I have 2 of these that were functioning for over 30days  and suddenly they both quit functioning. nothing but a black screen. I also have 2 other ring devices that work just fine so my issue is with this particular hardware. support had me do a few basic things and then sent a replacement in both cases. nothing changed. i then got to a second level support that was even more useless. they didn't do anything other than send me an email 5 days after they said they were going to send me a request for more info  with all the same crap that the first level asked me for more than once and then followed that email up with I'LL close this case in 72hrs if you don't respond ill assume your issue is fixed.  1 other thing was both first and second level told me there were know issues with this hardware and they were working towards resolution. So either it was BS and they were stalling or they know the crap doesn't work. Its interesting that 90% of the bad reviews area  start in october. you would thing they would just back rev the software to when it actually worked rather than allowing all this bad press.

Took a few minutes once I decided where I wanted to install the floodlight cameras. It was easier because I used existing floodlight locations and didn't need to install wiring. It was easy to hookup using my phone and the ring app.,Easiest cam to setup.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jan 2018,Jason Hahn,I love the flood light.

Great product and would definitely recommend to anyone to buy,I love the flood light
"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2017,RichOnTheLI,"I purchased the Ring Floodlight Camera so I would have access to seeing the front of my property when I was out of the house. For some reason, my existing sensor spotlight was mounted on my soffit. I wasn't sure if that was going to be an issue, but I was told that this light could be mounted both horizontally and vertically. That's not true. Mounting this light vertically is almost impossible. There's no way to adjust the camera and lights to be in the position you want them to be in. I called customer service regarding this issue, but unfortunately, they had no answer for me. Luckily, I did have another spotlight that needed to be replaced that was mounted vertically, and replacing it with this Ring Spotlight was very simple and easy. I had no issues connecting it to my Wi-Fi, setting up motion zones, and setting up a timer for the lights to go on and off. The connection between the Ring Floodlight and my router was great and the live-feed to my smartphone was fast and very clear. For the first month, the Ring Floodlight worked perfectly, but now I'm starting to experience some issues with it. I've started noticing that the signal strength between my router and the Ring Floodlight Camera has become ""spotty"". The live-feed still shows a very clear picture, however the recording from the camera isn't as smooth as it was when I first started using it. When motion was detected, I used to get an alert on my devices, then it would show me a high quality video of whatever was going on outside. Now, the video recording isn't nearly as good as it has been. The video seems to be ""pixelated"" and very sluggish. Whenever something is moving on the video, it looks like the subject is moving in slow motion. In addition to this, I've also noticed that there is a delay in the voice communication between the camera and my smartphone. I made sure the installation was done correctly and also made sure to use clear silicon around the base of the light to prevent any water from getting behind it. I don't know why I'm having these issues and I'm hoping this review will lead to a response from someone who might be able to help me address them. I think that the Ring Floodlight Camera is an excellent product, but there just seems to be to many issues going on for me to give this product a better review. The app is constantly being updated, so I don't know if that has anything to do with the issues I am experiencing. If someone could provide some feedback for me, I would really appreciate that.",Could be so much better.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2017,Rich of California,"UPDATE: I am upgrading the Ring floodlight to 4 stars. It seems to be working much better now. I was even able to intercept a delivery and tell the UPS driver where to put my package. It is still not perfect. Connections usually work well, but not always, so 4, not 5 stars. When I was considering sending it back, I looked at several other systems and reviews. There is no perfect system, and this still seems to be one of the best. My doorbell2 has worse issues, but Jessica of customer service, spent a great deal of time troubleshooting it with me, and they are sending out a new unit. Customer service is definitely a plus here. ORIGINAL 1 STAR REVIEW: Very disappointed with this. It worked off and on for awhile, although I never had very good audio. But now it won't connect for long periods of time, at all. I spent $500 upgrading by adding a wifi mesh system that is designed to cover 6000 square feet. I have less than 1000, so it should be plenty of signal for Ring. The doorbell2 is the worst, but my Ring floodlight camera is almost as bad at times.  However, everything else in my house has great wifi coverage now. I am on Fios with a 150/150 mbps system. I guess I will call Ring tomorrow and go thru everything again, before I send it all back. BTW, even when it does connect, it takes way to long. Anyone stealing packages from the porch would be half a block away before I could see a live view.",It seems to be working much better now

My problem with them is they constantly lose Wi-Fi signal.  My signal strength to them is at 14 mbps, which should be more than adequate.  Also, it has a delay in recording so sometimes I get the notification, but there is no record of anyone spotted on the camera.  The doorbell rarely works unless somebody either rings the doorbell or actually opens the door.  I have motion zone set at 20 feet, but that will not activate the doorbell.  If they worked more consistently, I could easily change this rating to 5 Stars because when they do work, picture quality is crystal clear.  I hope they continue to make hardware updates to fix some of my issues.",RING FLOODLIGHT

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Apr 2018,Rick Copeland,"What a disappointment the Ring Floodlight Security Camera has been.  After installing, it functioned as advertised but the one day four months ago went offline never to connect again. Although Ring customer support has been responsive by both phone and email they have yet to find a solution.  All they do is keep coming back with things they want me to check, WiFi signal at the device, router information, ISP provider, etc. I’ve proven over and over again that my WiFi is not the ptoblem.  We have iPhones, iPads, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs connected and functioning on the same WiFi that the Ring device is unable to connect to. Ring has never once offeried to send me a replacement device.  I have never witnessed such a bizarre form of customer service. So what am I to do?  I have 4 months invested in trying to find a solution.  All I have is a high tech device mounted above my garage that produces a dim green flashing light. So, my advice avoid Ring products like the plague and spend your money on proven technology and a company that provides actual customer service to their customers and stands by their products. I’ll just sit and wait until the class action lawsuits start rolling in because I’ve found just from browsing the web I’m not the only one.  The negative reviews in this forum is just the tip of the iceberg. Signed, Future Litigant",What a disappointment the Ring Floodlight Security Camera has been

To say the least I am extremely disappointed in this product and I don’t think it’s ready for production sale. It is only picking up maybe %30 of movement( mostly during the day ) that result in an alert and recording. I have spent the last month trying to tweet the zones and movement sensitivity to get it to work properly, most of the alers are movement in the palm trees, you either get no alerts or every time a blade of grass moves😡. I spent an hour on the phone with Ring support and his suggestions were no help. Do not buy this product now, they have a lot of work to do in order get reliable results, I pretty much paid $250 for a flood that I could have paid $25 for a a big box store!",To say the least I am extremely disappointed in this product and I don’t think it’s ready ...

For some reason, my second camera won't connect to my wifi even after adding a Chime Pro Extender which is like 3 feet away from the camera.  Meanwhile, the first camera I bought works perfectly fine without any wifi extender.  So you would expect Ring Customer Service to acknowledge there is something wrong with the second camera?  Nope, they make you jump through hoops and it still won't connect.  The only way it will connect is if I bring an extension cord and plug the Chime Pro under the camera which makes no sense.  All my other devices don't seem to have an issue including my Ring Door Bell 2. Also, a lot of false positives and the camera seems to turn on a little late.

It is a good product, with a good camera, that zooms & pans, it keeps a record if you sign up for that benefit. It notifies you when your security line is breached with the sound of a chime that is distinctive from other sounds.  The cost is moderate compared to the cameras I originally bought. The system allows you to join a Neighborhood reporting system that keeps you up-to-date in real time on suspicious activity in your neighborhood.  It also allows you to forward video clips or photos by email.  This is a quality, well thought out camera system.  I wish they were publicly traded because I would buy their stock right away.",This is a QUALITY camera system with  a lot of attributes!!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Sep 2017,Elizabeth Miller,I cannot get the product to work. I contacted Ring via phone and they recommend getting a professional electrician to install. The advertising and written instructions included give the false impression the home owner can install. Just be aware that a professional must be hired to install. Also the camera was not attached very well when I opened my box/package but I must now wait for a professional to install and THEN determine if the product is defective (and hope it can easily be replaced by Ring/Amazon). Very disappointed in Ring as this is the 3rd item I purchased and the first two were also not responding initially to the set-up procedure. It took multiple attempts to get it to connect to my WiFi. Nice when they work but a lot of glitches.,Need a professional electrician to set-up; NOT an easy set-up.

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Aug 2017,Steve P. Bobosky,Really not happy with this unit. Maybe I got a defective one but it wont get past flashing green light. Some debug logs to the ring app would be great. Giving up on this and going to try another vendors product. Edit 9/19/2017 - I'm updating this review from one to three stars because I was able to get this Camera working. I replaced my Netgear R7000 router with an ASUS AC3100 router to resolve other issues with multiple Xbox Ones and Xbox Live Party chat. After doing this I figured I would try the Ring Camera setup again just in case the router was the root cause in preventing setup from completing successfully.z Sure enough - the Ring Camera setup without issues with the ASUS AC3100 when it just hung at a flashing green light with the Netgear R7000. My feedback for the Ring team is the same. Better diagnostics in the Ring App would really help here. If there is a port or communication problem a log would be great instead of just flashing colors. A list of compatible and incompatible routers could also be helpful.,Some Routers may not work with the Ring Camera. Updating my Router to the ASUS AC3100 resolved setup issues.

I had a motion sensor at the location so power wasn't an issue but pulling the wire to tie it into my existing security system would be considerable. I figured I would try this as the cost was reasonable when you figure there was a camera, siren, 2 way speaker as well as the motion sensor floodlight. What a great surprise I had after I got steps done in the easy to follow instructions to get the light tied into my wireless network!

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Feb 2018,Poltroon,"Worked fine for a few months. We were quite impressed. Suddenly and without warning, it disconnected and refused to reconnect to our network. I spent hours on my own troubleshooting our network setup and the floodlight camera. I tested other devices for connectivity from the camera's location without any issues whatsoever. The floodlight camera would say there was a problem with the network (there wasn't) then, later, would say the password was wrong (it wasn't). In desperation, I contacted Ring support and spent two hours repeating all the steps I had already taken during my own troubleshooting. The end result? Still doesn't work. It's coming down from it's mounting and is being reinstalled in the trash. If you really have a desperate need to spend the $200 burning a hole in your pocket, spend it elsewhere...","Worked fine for a few months, then..."

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2017,Robert D Shepherd,"Update: I have three floodlight cams, very discouraging when all three disconnect from WiFi , it is tiring to constantly work to reconnect and not dependable at all. My two WiFi routers are within ten feet of two of the cameras and the third is 30 feet away and all have strong signals. Comcast is the internet provider and this is not the problem. Constant attention and WiFi maintenance required. Don't buy these devices! They don't tell you when you buy it that after 30 days you can't see a video of the motion unless you spend money to subscribe to a service which let's you see who was in the range of that camera. If you are on your phone and the alert comes you have to hang up the call immediately or you will never know who just went on your property. This is so wrong, it is like gotcha now, pay more or be deficient. I sent 522 total for two floodlight set ups and unless you act quickly after the motion alarm triggers, you can forget about it unless you want to pay 100/month to save the videos, you don't even get one viewing unless you are quick at the trigger.",Crying Shame

"Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, Black, Works with Alexa",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Sep 2017,Joe M.,"Used this to upgrade our security and general lighting coverage in our backyard, just off our house patio. The lighting is fantastic—super bright, enough to see all corners of a roughly 40x100' backyard space. The motion & corresponding notifications are nice and snappy (we are on a 100mbps fiber wifi connection, so bandwidth and latency issues aren't a problem here). Super simple install to replace an existing porch light. Love the ""zone"" drawing feature to customize the areas within the yard for motion monitoring. Ring makes great products, I am very happy with both my doorbell and now my floodlight cam!","Already a ring doorbell owner, this floodlight was a great addition"

Ring floodlight cam is by far the best option. It seems that viewing angle is much wider. The image is extremely clear. You can set up zones within the image to detect the motion by drawing boxes on the screen, so you don't get motion alerts if part of the field of vision is your street for example. The motion sensors for the lights work well. You can control all the settings in the app. Overall, amazing device.

Its is st its furthest point away and outside.  I'm upgrading my Wi-Fi router to hopefully fix that problem. So as of now with the weaker router I have there is some lag.

The same is true in their advertising.  They give you 30 days free when you activate a device then annoy you with advertising and messages of when your trial period will run out.  Would be a MUCH better purchase if you had the option of saving video to your phone's storage.  So much for the claim by the company owner that he created the Ring doorbell because he wanted to keep people safe.  The Truth?  He just wants to be rich.,View Video

Cons: 1. Recordings are NOT consistent. We had a few incidents that we wanted to look up the recordings, but couldn't find those times because it either recorded black blank(don't know what happened), or had frozen scene in the middle of the recording. There are so many cases like that we don't rely on Ring floodlight anymore. 2. Responding time is long. If you have an alarm saying there was a motion going and are trying to look at the screen, it doesn't connect right away. Camera responding time is really long that there are many times of whatever the action happening  have already passed. Very frustrating. We have used Ring doorbell and floodlight.

There is setting in Ring that movement can be adjusted but I don't have the correct balance yet.,Ring Flood Light
