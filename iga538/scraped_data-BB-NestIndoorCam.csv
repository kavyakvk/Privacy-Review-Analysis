Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Mar 2020,Bestbuy2020,"We bought these cameras to put in our house to check on our dog and of course in case someone were to enter our house unwanted.

The biggest trouble is the app that goes with it, but it works fine as long as your power doesn't go out! Also, I wish it could hear better.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Jul 2020,Nestuser,"The Nest Cam works just as it is advertised to work.  No better and no less.  The night vision feature is poor quality, all in all, but it does function.  The sound feature works pretty well, though I have not been able to have a two way conversation; don’t know why not.  For the money it is a reasonable device, though far too soon to know how reliable it is or is not.  So far, so good.",As advertised

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Miah,Definition of plug and play. The quality is great and the controls are customizable.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Aug 2020,Maine,"The camera performs as expected, but I wish it didn’t have so many connection issues. Despite having the fastest possible internet in my area and the most state-of-the-art modem / router etc. it still spontaneously loses connection at various times while I’m away, or whenever there’s rapid activity on the screen like an animal moving through the frame.

Also— BEWARE— for people who enjoy any modicum of privacy; these camera DO NOT turn off even when in “off” mode. Google has admitted that they merely “close their eyes,” however the cameras still hear and record everything. Considering everything we know about Big Tech and surveillance, you’ll want to consider totally unplugging the cameras from their power source when they aren’t being used.",Not bad but not great

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Nov 2017,Silverwolf,"The camera works very well with great image quality; however, I was unaware of the high monthly costs to store the footage. Nowhere on the packaging dose it mention, that after 30 days, I would have to pay to save the footage. Now I'm stuck with this camera, that I can't even use, unless I pay the monthly fee. For $200+, I should at least have 5 gigs free, to store the footage, then I can rinse and repeat.","Great Product, expensive monthly fee."

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2019,CatCity,"I have purchased 3 of these cameras over the years, and the original one that I purchased over 3 years is still working perfectly. The nest app is fantastic, because it lets you scroll through the entire day of feed, which is different than some camera, which section off your feed by independent clips based on motion. The nest way is far superior, because I can scroll through to find exactly what I’m looking for. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve used this camera to see where my toddler placed a toy that he can no longer find. These devices are amazing.",I own 3 of these
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2015,Lander,"one of the nice features of this camera is the playback but you have to be subscribed for it.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2016,John,"This is a great interior camera system. I already had one for approximately 2 years and used it to watch our dog, while gone from home. The 130 degree lens takes in the entire room. If there is movement, I get a notification on my phone and can immediately check to see what is going on.

We added this second camera and now can monitor both entrances to our home from the inside. We also have the 10 day subscription and I highly recommend it. Should a thief break in, see the cameras and either disable or take them he is still caught. The recording is off site at Nest and can be easily accessed with your phone, pad or computer. Check what a professional system would cost to install and you'll see what a bargain this is.",An inexpensive home camera system
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Dec 2019,Alfster,"I've purchased these before and also cheaper cameras in my past.  Although these are more expensive, they are so much more reliable that the added expense is very worthwhile.   They only go on sale 3 or 4 times a year, so I patiently wait to add to my inventory for these events.   They do give you the first 30 days of history for review for free which is nice, after that it is an added expense, which I've never purchased.",Can't go Wrong

Bought this thinking the indoor cam should work well considering the doorbell works absolutely great. It arrived and I quickly put it out. I played with different areas of my house and the resolution was soooo bad! It didn't matter where I placed it, it did not show clear at all. The image was very pixelated. If I needed to catch someone in it and try to get a clear image of the persons face it would be next to impossible. Needless to say it went back. I'm going to try the HD one and hope it works better if not I'm going to have to do what I didn't want to do which is purchase from a different brand and download a second app different from the Nest one.",It didn't work out for me

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Jondres,"Next is probably one of the best cameras on the market. I only wish the quality of the picture was better. For instance, when mounted on the front of a house you cannot make out alicense plate on a car in the driveway or on the street or details of a persons face. I had someone take something off my front porch right underneath where the camera is mounted and I could not tell who the person was or what they really looked like. That something that could be important if any foul play is detected. Picture is grainy especially when zooming in.",Probably one of the best cameras out there.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,2,23 Nov 2015,Allistar,"At first glance, the Nest Cam is a really great product. However, for those that are more tech inclined or with needs such as outdoor mounting, the Nest Cam falls short.

Pros:
+: Great for those with simple recording or technical requirements.
+: The Nest Cam integrates tightly with the Nest app on the iOS/Android platforms and Nest.com website.
+: Setup is extremely easy.

Cons:
-: Wireless range and performance isn't great Despite a line of sight to my 802.11AC Apple Airport Extreme router, it often has buffering issues.
-: Fully relies on the Nest Cam cloud video recording system to be operational. The highly touted capabilities that require a monthly Nest Aware subscription where motion detection sends alerts to your mobile device, etc. have been down for a subset (myself included) of active Nest Cam users on the Nest Community forums since 7/10/2015 with no notice from Nest.
-: Nest's Phone Technical Support is extremely lackluster. Estimated hold time was 30 minutes, my call was disconnected by their phone system at a hold time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
-: Nest's E-mail support is also poor, they tell you to expect a 3-5 day turnaround time before you receive a response.

I am now currently trying to engage Nest's support via twitter and other venues. I want a refund, I'll roll my own security camera system.","Good camera, but beware of cloud downfalls."

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Drinkie,"Excellent value quality product - Google have made set up and configuration confusing due to working with both Google Home and Nest software, you will also need to subscribe to the Nest software to be able to retrieve up to 30 days of recordings, which is not expensive, but is another cost to factor in.",Great Indoor Camera
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Aug 2020,SanBenito,I use islt a a baby can. Turn it off when not needed. It's integrated with my other nest devices,Works as advertised
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Sep 2020,Bones29,"I now have 6 cameras watching the house. I pay for the 5-day archive and to me, it is worth it. The cost to archive is a little expensive and I think Nest could do better here. However, the cameras are all solid and reliable. I give it a 3 based on the cost of monitoring otherwise functionality is a 5-star rating. You do not have to pay for the archive feature but I like it so I take the hit.",Camera number 6
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2018,SimonSays,"If you've read other reviews, NEST makes some great cameras. You can mount these pretty much anywhere, or just place them on a flat surface. The camera itself can be tilted and turned, so in any mounting situation, you can get your image framed as needed.

The image quality is great. When the light goes off, it switches to night vision, and the image in pitch dark is still amazing, although it's in black and white. (There's no such thing as a color night vision)

Connect the app on your phone, or use the website (home.nest.com) to view the video stream. There are also apps for Apple TV and perhaps some other platforms.

The downside of this camera (the whole NEST ecosystem, really) is that none of the advanced features work without their ""Nest Aware"" subscription. And most of those features don't work well at all. A gust of wind moves a bush? Alert. A shadow moves across the image? Alert. You get the picture. 
Add to that the cost (starting at $100 per camera) for Nest Aware, and it's just crazy.

So for just keeping an eye out on things wherever you are in the world, these are great. For alerting and cloud storage of your video, be prepared to pay a lot.

I haven't measured the data usage, but it's not insignificant, so don't use these when you're on Satellite internet or a slow DSL connection.","Quality Good, Features Mediocre"
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2015,TechIke,"I'm a big fan of Nest products and this was my first purchase. Setup was very simple - the longest part was setting up a Nest account. The camera has either a magnetic base or you can attach it to a wall. Easy to turn and pivot and the wide angle lens is great.

The biggest drawback is to have the ability to go back or save videos, you need to subscribe to a Nest Aware package. Cheapest is 10 days of history for $100/yr or $10/mo. That is pretty expensive and I have yet to buy into that. Also, when you do not have a subscription, the quality of alerts diminishes, so you don't get notified right away if movement is seen in your house. These features could change in the future, and I believe they should. I plan on buying the subscription if I go away on a trip or something like that, but I can't justify it for day to day purchases.",Good entry into the smart home future

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Katherine,"Be aware that you will need to get the Nest Aware subscription to continue having those scrollable timelapse clips/videos of when motion is detected. Your camera will still work and alert you to motion (but not talking or dog barking without Nest Aware), but for the full experience you'll need Nest Aware. The subscription has different pricing models depending on how many days back of video history you want to keep in the cloud, and it does scale according to how many cameras you have on Nest Aware. Overall, I feel it's worth it. The peace of mind I have with this camera is not something to discount lightly. Buy 1, and then buy 1..or 2+ more!","Subscription required, but worth."

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2016,PReed,"I actually have 4 cameras, 3 when they were Dropcam and 1 after it became Nest. The cameras work well in my home. They are placed in ways to keep an eye on the front door, back door and yard. The notifications do get a little annoying because the cameras can't tell much difference between light/shadow from the sun coming in through the trees versus a person. The night vision works well, and I've not had any issues with WiFi at all, but I have a pretty good router. They do consume a fair amount of bandwidth on the internet, but you can set them to non-HD if it's too much. They have alerted my phone within seconds of someone actually crossing the yard, or coming to the door. Once, someone came up through the yard, setting off the first alert to my phone, then they peered in through the door glass of the front door, setting off the second camera alert. I watched them like a hawk until they left, then pulled the recorded clips for safe keeping just in case. I do wish they had a better integration with IF This Then That so they could do more alerting or more things, maybe that will come eventually. The price of the recording is a bit pricey, and now that Arlo is out I might have considered that instead, but it wasn't available when I purchased the Dropcams and Nest cam. All in all I'm still happy with the Dropcams/Nest camera after a couple of years.",Great for keeping an eye on things inside

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2015,EmilyMK,"I bought The Nest Cam after my Dad purchased one for his Summer home so he could keep an eye on it while he was not there. My Dad really loved his Nest Cam and after reading many good reviews I decided to purchase one as well. Now...please don't judge me for this, but I purchased this camera so that I could keep an eye on my dogs while I was out of the house. You can also to talk into the app and it will play through the camera. One thing to know is that you have to screw in the mount to the wall that the camera sticks to (from a magnet on the back of it). When I purchased this the sales person at Best Buy told me I did not have to do that and I did not think to ask my Dad about this part. This is not the biggest deal except that I thought I would be able to move it around more.

Also, consider the cost of adding Nest Aware if purchasing this camera. Nest Aware is the option that saves your recording history. You can check it online or through the Nest App. There are monthly plan options and yearly plan options. The yearly plan just gives you a discount compared to paying monthly. There are also 2 options, a 10-day history or a 30-day history. It is around $10-$30 per month to pay monthly or $100-$300 yearly for one camera. Additional cameras are at a discounted price. The price of this is a bit high and I didn't know this was an additional cost when I purchased the camera. You do not HAVE to have this option, but it is nice to have.",Don't Judge Me...

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Jaysun,"I had purchased this camera with not knowing the quality and capabilities that it had yeah! I seen the YouTube videos but it never did this Nest Cam any justice. When I got tome I was so leary about that I wanted to return it glad I didn't the set-up was a breeze it took a total of 10-12 minutes max. And when the installation and updates was completed I was good to go the video quality is 1080P with night vision and it records audio and you can also talk to a person through the camera but it is not a two way communicator. 

Now let's talk about recording nest offers recording plans either on a monthly basis or by a yearly subscription it starts with a one month free trial but after that you will lose all access to videos that has been recording but it will allow you to view the cam but you will not be able to see any recordings.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Nov 2015,Edwin,Our camera is installed in the garage and if the door is closed is works beautifully! However once the garage door opens the image is washed out and takes about 2-3 seconds to return to focus. Also when the garage door is left open the image outside is far from acceptable. If you're only concerned with the inside image then this camera will be fine. I also tried the camera inside our home and it works fine. After some further issues I realized that this camera lacks when there is sunlight or bright lights in the image. The camera also HEATS UP quickly!

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2016,RayD,"I researched and researched and did some more research before taking a gamble and purchasing NEST. I needed 4 cameras for our business and wanted the following:
1 - something that was wireless
2 - something with great quality (instead of my old analog cameras)
3 - something that was easy to setup
4 - something that was well supported that I didn't have to pay someone to setup and configure

I LOVE these NEST cameras. The only quirk I found was that when setting them up on WiFi make sure you select the higher GHz option ... 5GHz instead of the 2.5/3 GHz as this does make a difference.

The only downside is with the NEST app is that you can only have 4 cameras connect on your account with the 1 app.

Otherwise the app is slick to use, supported by NEST (now Google) and I configuration was easy as a snap. I do recommend buying",GREAT Camera!

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Nov 2015,Steven,"I was researching security cameras to keep an eye on my newly adopted dog during the day. After all the positive reviews on the Dropcam, I was excited when they announced the release of the Nest Cam. I waited until it came out to have the latest and greatest version and have been completely disappointed. I plugged in the camera, followed the directions and added it to my nest app which already has my thermostat etc. It worked for about 3-5 minutes, I then heard an audible click from the camera and it went offline. The only way to get it back online was to unplug it and plug it back on and then re-add it to the app from scratch. This happened 3 times back to back so I called Nest support. Nest support informed me that I had acquired the product earlier than its release somehow, I bought this from Best Buy and picked it up in store mind you, and I needed to try to add it again in two days after the official release. I followed their instructions, re did everything two day later, same issues so I called in. I was told my issue had been escalated to two different departments and I would receive an answer on Monday via a telephone call. Monday came and went, Tuesday came and went and then Wednesday I gave up and returned it. I exchanged it for a Samsung Security Cam and am going to set it up shortly. Hopefully the Samsung works better than the Nest Cam. I wouldn't recommend this product after my experience.",Disappointed

Cons: Nest Aware subscription after the 30 day free trial ranges from $6 to $12 per month (discounts for yearly subscriptions), but does include all cameras.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Bradley42,"I was looking for a camera to attach to the internet and allow me to view our home.  I needed an indoor camera.  While Nest offers two styles of indoor cameras, I selected the Nest Cam indoor.  Nest offers a little higher end indoor camera the Nest Cam IQ that offers a little more intelligence, but for our needs the Nest Cam indoor fit our requirements.

I was looking for a camera that was a little heavier so it would not fall over, could be installed on the wall (if necessary), was connected to the internet and is easy to install.

The Nest Cam indoor fit all our criteria and we are very happy with it.  If you want to purchase a monthly subscription to monitor the history of what the camera is monitoring you have the option to purchase this, but it is not required, but available it you need it. 

The camera took about 5 minutes to install all you need is an internet Wifi connection, your network name and password, plus a power outlet and this allows you to connect the Nest Cam to the internet.  You can monitor the camera with the Nest App.

For a baby I'd still want a sound monitor, as this only lets you hear when the app is open (obviously), but for a toddler it's perfect. 

The mounting is a little abrasive; you have to drill holes and Mount a bracket, but there's really no way around it. The camera itself is heavier than I imagined, you'd need insanely strong adhesive which would probably destroy that spot in the wall anyway. We just have it on my daughter's nightstand.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2016,Greg,"Nest Cam is a really good product, the resolution is perfect, the night vision, the capability to use the microphone, the motion detection by defining area, all these features are great.
But two features are missing.
The first one was a feature available on Dropcam which has disappeared with Nest: share the cam with somebody while staying private. The workaround you can find on the Nest website is to share your account and password, in term of security this unbelievable.
The second missing feature is on the motion detection. The motion is based by making the difference between two images on the area you specified. In this case, why this is not possible to specify some patterns recognition like animals, cars, people and defined some exceptions like ""do not alert me if animals enter in the area"" or ""alert me if people fall to the floor"".",Nice Hardware but the software should be better

This camera has an 'awkward' design and to be honest, it's kind of ugly! The graphite color is nice though.
Works great most of the time, but have recently had lots of issues whereby it would not send push notifications. I intend to replace my modem/router to see if the wi-fi signal strength is the issue, but I don't seem to have this problem with my external cameras that are mounted even further away.

Anyway, it was legit and everything was OK. After that incident, I got this camera so that if that were to happen again, I would have some sort of visual confirmation (literal fire in the house) or auditory clues (fire alarms blasting throughout).

I can see my kids sleeping vividly (or if they are awake!). The camera is EASY to set up with the Nest App on my phone. Sometimes the camera won't connect, but I think it's because my WiFi is a bit weaker on the area of the house where the camera is placed. The only bummer is the microphone function. It's not active two-way. In other words, I could talk in the mic but I have to turn off my mic to then hear what the kids are saying in the room. I wish it was more real-time/two-way where I can talk and hear at the SAME moment. Otherwise, super glad I have this camera (well, two of them)!",Great for Kids' Rooms (quality night-time views)

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2015,Bamboo,"The live stream looks good and runs smooth.

Playback of old clips is another story. The software for phones and tablets is a little unstable when viewing past clips. The rewind and fast forward buttons sometimes cause the apps to crash. Sometimes you can play past the end of an event segment, sometimes you can't. Sometimes there's no archived footage available for hours at a time. If you want to rewind to a few seconds or a minute before a noise event to watch what led up to it, good luck, I was able to do this once during the 30 day free trial. The other times I tried it would either crash, jump to live feed, or skip back to previous event. Rewinding past the beginning of an event seems to have random results.

These are all software issues on mobile clients, so hopefully they will get that sorted out some day.","Live stream good, history playback not so good."

However after plugging it in and watching the video side by side my Dropcam Pro I quickly realized that the 1080p on the Nest Cam was only very slightly or not really noticeably better than the 720P on my Dropcam Pro. The color was also more dull on the Nest Cam. I was expecting a whopping difference due to the fact that on 1080p can take up to 1.2mpbs upload vs the Peak upload for the Dropcam Pro is around .5 mpbs. For me the trade off that gobbles up that much upload speed isn't worth the difference in video quality.

Luckly I found out these Nest indoor cameras can be used outdoor with in inexpensive weatherproof enclosure I found online. Works great.

The view is nice and wide so theres not much need to strategically place it to capture the whole room. Notifications can be texted and emailed to your phone when the camera hears something, detects motion or hears dogs barking. It's worked flawlessly so far.

Then Nest told me that I had to have a subscription to have anything recorded. I thought the rather expensive camera would have a free subscription for a year or something...I was wrong.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,AJBeastro,"All in all, I am happy with my purchase. Very few drop outs and working on my wifi router location to make sure there’s even less. The hardware is great but there are some things I would do to change the app and interface. First, I would make it so the main splash page for multiple camera viewing could be reconfigured. Something that would allow you to size each window differently so you can see the important screens bigger and use all available space without any borders. Next, I would make the app for iPhone and iPad have the ability to ‘always listen’. My previous baby cam allowed for this so you could hear what’s going on even if you were in a different app. Lastly, the price for multiple cameras if you sign up for cloud storage history is a bit steep.

There is an included feature that turns the camera on when you leave, based on your phone leaving a certain range. This feature is extremely helpful and works pretty reliably, as it has only not activated twice in the two months that the camera has been in use. Besides this, you can always turn the camera on manually from your phone anyways. Nest Aware is another subscription feature that is extemely useful, saving your video history and highlighting areas where the camera catches movement and sound.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,GizmoVance,"Nest does a great job with their products, setup, directions, and packaging.
These cameras are great quality and look really nice.

As for the web app, it's working great. The Alerts are sensitive and accurate.
The quality of video leaves a bit to desire. Even though it's 1080 and my network is solid, the imagery isn't enough to read a license plate from a car that's less than 40 feet away, for example. 

 
Lag time it not bad, but far from realtime. In other words, you'll have a hard time reacting to a visitor. Most always, you'll have to review the recorded clips.
As for recording, it's pretty much mandatory to subscribe to NEST AWARE if you want all of the nice features. That'll cost you $50 a year plus $10 for additional cameras.
All in all, for a wifi camera, I think this is about the best you can get.",Great product and class act

The Nest mobile app is also significantly worst than the Dropcam app in performance and functionality. Auto notification on/off doesn't exist in the new app and the app is very sluggish. iPad version of the app also lacks significant functionality from the Dropcam version. You can't review video from a specific time unless it has triggered motion detection. The camera goes offline more frequently than the Dropcam.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Evlwevl,"Excellent camera for indoor use.  This is my second indoor nest camera. I purchased one for my garage however The Wife decided it was better placed inside the house  to monitor the kids and pets . This one here is my replacement for the inside of the garage. Night time monitoring is unbelievable even in pitch black room  you can clearly see all the detail of the room. Daytime monitoring is extremely clear and  we use the very simple smartphone application to talk to our kids when they get home from school. The wide angle lense can fill in the entire room and catch multiple entrances in the frame and the clarity to my phone is unbelievable Even when zooming in on particular parts of the video.  Frames per second are much faster than the other branded outdoor cameras I am running on the same network.  I utilized the Cloud Recording service from Nest however did not purchase  The service after the initial trial was over.  The notifications on my phone are helpful in telling me what kind of notification whether visual or sound. After the initial  Recording trial is over, I simply use the image captures to see what’s going on at my house  whenever the cameras are triggered and can quickly switch over to live vireing as recording is not necessary for me. This is my go to camera for indoor use.  I purchased this one on sale $30 off of regular price  which is a great deal",Excellent camera for indoor use

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Nov 2016,PappaGeorgio,"Camera worked great, but unit looks utilitarian. Does not blend in well with home environment. Main issue is the packaging is not at all clear that you must submit to their $10 minimum a month tariff in order to actual record any video and actually have a record of any event. So there's a minimum recurring cost of $120 dollars a year (for it to be of any actual use to you).

The only reasons I didn't give this product a 5, though very solid, is the fact that you have to pay a monthly subscription for any kind of recording functionality (once the week or 2 trial is up), and given that there are other products such as the Arlo that offer complete wireless solutions.

So I thought I'd pick up the Nest Cam. Although the build quality of the product is outstanding, it falls way short on performance. The fisheye look to the recorded images is distracting and adds to the poor quality videos. The cam also gets disturbingly hot when activated. To top it off Nest requires you to purchase a subscription in order to save the recorded video. Needless to say I returned the device due to these issues.

Once Google took over, it quickly became the worst and most useless camera I own. First, reliability is hit or miss. My original Nest cam still works over a half decade later. My most recently purchased Nest cam began malfunctioning within the first year.  Second, the old Nest would at least show you video clips from the same day without requiring a plan. Now, unless you have a subscription or continuously monitor the live feed, you’ll never see video from events, just useless snapshots. And it only covers the preceding few hours. Alerts are also hit or miss on whether Or not they’ll be sent. I liked the old Nest but the new Nest is terrible. I’d suggest anything over Nest cam at this point.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,LLMN55014,"Bought these to keep an eye on our new dog that doesn't like being left alone. For this purpose, they work quite well, but keep in mind there is a few seconds lag time between what's actually happening and what you see in the app/web interface.

Set up with a smartphone was relatively easy. Hardest part was connecting to the Wi-Fi (which wasn't really that hard). For some reason, the cameras didn't want to connect or stay connected to the 5 Ghz band. After switching to the 2.4Ghz band, they connected. There's a chance it is an issue with my router and not the cameras, but don't know for sure. The app and the web interface for the streaming feed are convenient and relatively easy to use. Comes with a 30-day trial of the NestAware service that stores your video on their server. Comes with screw-on mounting brackets for wall mounting and magnetic camera bases, which are plenty heavy enough to to hold the camera upright on a flat surface. The cameras are black and the mounts dark gray, but the 10' USB cables are white, so if you're looking for a discrete installation, you may need to get different cables.

Keep in mind that if you have a data cap on your internet service, any streaming service uses it up, this included. Nest explains all this on their website in the FAQs, including an approximation of how much data each camera uses at the various video qualities. You can manually adjust your cameras in the app to a lower video quality to reduce data usage and/or maintain a steady video stream.",Easy to use

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Nov 2019,Muppet,"This camera was ""OK"" when I was in the free promotional period for the Nest Aware service.  However once that period is over, you either have to pay $30 or $40 per month for it, or you can just use the camera with motion capture stills that are stored for up to like 6 hours.

Here are the problems:
1.) This cam sometimes just ""shuts off"" for 30 minutes to an hour.  I THINK it's updating the software or something.  Either way, it's annoying because you get a notification that your camera is offline.  This was very frequent for the first year or so, but lately has been a lot less often.
2.) Sometimes the history just disappears.  Both with the nest aware service AND without it, sometimes when I access the history using the app, it's all just gone.  I don't know if it's just a disconnect from the cloud where the data might be stored, but this happens all the time.  I'll go back to look at stills from 1 or 2 hours ago (not using Nest Aware) and it's all gone.  Major annoyance/problem for me.
3.) The ""stills"" that are captured (not using the nest aware service) are almost useless.  99% of the time, the capture is almost 1 to 2 seconds after the initial motion is detected.  In other words, it will catch the ""end"" of the over all ""activity."" So if my dog walks from the kitchen through the living room and heads around the corner out of frame, the only still that will be captured is the back half of his body and tail leaving the frame.  They are often times very blurry... Almost like it's taking a panorama picture where something is moving.  So it inconveniently blurs the one thing you would need to see, someones face or clothes...
4.) When watching the camera ""live"" using the app or an online browser and when it first recognizes and starts ""recording"" the motion still, there is buffering moment that occurs and causes the camera to freeze for about 2 seconds, all the way up to about 20 to 30 seconds (depending on the amount of motion).  So often times when I'm trying to watch something happen in live action, it's almost useless because you miss about 80% of it from the ""buffering"" data send ""freeze""...
***On a side note to the above #4, when a notification comes through, the app and connection to the cameras is very slow.  Most of the time when a notification comes through, you can't open the app and view the camera fast enough to catch most the action.
5.) When using the advertised ""two way audio"" don't be mistaken.  Yes, you can hear what's going on and yes, you can speak through the camera too.  However, when using the microphone/speak function, you cannot also hear the audio at the same time.  I understand why that is (so you don't hear a sound loop), but the problem is that often times there is a 2-10 second delay before the audio turns back on after mic use.  This makes it, 1. almost impossible to have a conversation, and 2. very hard to keep track of what's going on especially combined with the ""buffering freeze"" mentioned above.
Various small issues:
Often times there is motion that goes undetected.  The zoom in feature is nice, but very poor quality (naturally). Sometimes the Notification system is bugged and I won't get any notifications even though they are on and there is a lot of motion taking place.  The camera picks up some sort of annoying static sound, it's not excessive, but I'm not sure where it comes from...

Now for the issues that I probably should have known or recognized before I made the purchase:
1.) These only work if there is a Wifi connection. The poorer the connection, the less useful they are.  So imagine the ""buffering freeze"" that I mention above on a camera that struggles to get an average quality of connection.  If I had done more reading, I'm sure I would've figured it out, but I just assumed there would be some sort of internal storage for instances where the Wifi unexpectedly can't be reached.
2.) These camera's are almost useless in terms of home security.  The only way I would use these for home security would be to monitor manually on my phone, and once a notification comes through, view and examine the threat.  From there I'd trigger my home security system manually (if it's not already going off) and call the police myself.  (using the camera without nest aware)
3.) The camera's are tough to position.  Need for power outlets, high placement to capture spaces in full frame, and general mobility of unit.

Now, some notes about me.  I'm not a ""security system"" or ""camera"" pro.  This was my first time buying a ""security camera"" and I ended up buying 2.  I mainly use this system to keep an eye on my dog and to act as my own personal security monitoring individual.  I'm an normal person with an above average knowledge of technology and overall ""handyman-ness"" (if that makes sense). I am aware that some of these issues are situational and would not be the case for others, but this is my personal experience.

In hindsight:
-I would invest my money in a better overall system that can run/record without Wifi and still has the capability to watch 'live'.
-Nest Aware is not worth the subscription. It would be easier and cheaper for me to purchase and pay for monthly monitoring and the security camera package offered by the company that I use for the rest of our security system (doors, windows, glass break, carbon monoxide/smoke detectors, etc.).
-Reliability would be a priority for me (as these are not very reliable).

Feel free to respond with questions (if that's even possible) because I am on BestBuy daily and will respond if I can.

I hope this review helps someone out there.",I Expected Better

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Jan 2020,iwishtoremainanonymous,"I paid full price ($199 plus tax) for this camera thinking I would get what I paid for! WRONG! You MUST pay an additional $50 per year for a subscription to see anything but live video. Otherwise, when the camera sees something it saves a snapshot -- it even says how long it ""saw"" video, but that video is inaccessible -- only the snapshot, which may or may not have anything useful. So, unless you get the notification and IMMEDIATELY go to live stream, whatever it captured is lost. 

I purchased a WYZE camera for far less money and it gives me the video for at least the day of the recording, if not more. And, it cost way less. In fact it cost less than the annual Nest subscription!

I will never purchase another NEST product.",Read the fine print -- this camera is NOT for YOU!

You can still use the camera without the monthly subscription but it won't record past  24 hours and you cannot save the recordings without it. Notification picks up everything and you can turn it off. It has the option for face and package recognition but you have to pay for the subscription to get it. Night vision is very clear and it has the option for 180 flip on the app. 

Installation was extremely easy, power cord is really long, base is heavy if you don't want to install it on the wall but it does come with the wall installation.","Great camera and sound, not great for baby monitor"

Well so far I'm in love with this system.....It is easy to set up, operate, has decent video quality and was cheaper!! I've had zero connectivity issues and just couldn't be happier......I do have to say I liked the batteryless feature of the NetGear cameras but then again nothing can compete with the raw power of an 120 volt electrical outlet........except a semi-smart thief who turns off the power so a backup power system is needed for all crucial operating systems (modem, router and cameras) and of course with wiring a person must plan a little better.

They don’t turn and you have to pay for a subscription if you want to see anything that happened I think over 24 hours. But well worth it. The picture is clear.

I can stream full HD video/audio without issue so it seems strange that I can't set the camera to 1080 and have reliable performance.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Tamwyn,"I really like these Nest Indoor Cams. I have 3 of them. I've used them as baby monitors, pet monitors, and for security. When you have the video set to the highest quality then the camera does get warm. Also, you don't get the full functionality unless you pay the monthly subscription. They can do 720 or 1080p video resolution and they zoom decently but not awesome. I love the wide angle lens though. I have one in a corner of the room as a security cam and I can see all 4 different doors into that room and the stairs. I only need one camera to see the whole room. I feel like they could keep optimizing the Nest App. It has gotten faster over time but it still feels like it loads slow when there is an ""emergency"" and I want to see the camera feed immediately. I like the ""2-way"" talk, but be aware that this means you can either hear what is going on, or you can turn on the mic and speak to the room, but not both at the same time. When you are speaking, you can't hear until you turn the mic off. This makes sense so you don't get an echo, etc. but it lags by as much as 2 seconds in my experience, so it doesn't work to carry on a conversation, if that is what you are looking for. You'll probably miss the first couple words every time.",Works well

We had to turn that off because we have pets. It was great to be able to see them on our vacation. The only negative is that you are suppose to be able to talk over the camera. When I tried it, the camera would lock up and I would have to unplug it. It wasnt a concern for me since I cant see why I need that feature. Overall, I like it and I plan to add a couple more.",Works great

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Booradley,So far everything manufacturered by Nest has been top quality. The camera only took a few minutes to setup and does everything I could want it to do and more. The only downside so far is the cost of the Nest cloud plan to save the data is a bit expensive. There isn't a way to save it to SD card or other storage at this time. The picture quality is amazing in both during both day and night shots. Being able to turn off the camera automatically using your phone GPS when you're inside the house is a handy feature. There are so many to count.

My sister said setting it up was very easy. (I have a Nest thermostat and can vouch that the Nest products seem to be geared for extreme user friendliness and easy set up.) The lens provides a wide viewing angle and has a very clear picture even in the dark. They plan to use an iPad as the primary viewing monitor although they both have the app on their iPhones as well. Of note, due to the camera being a wi-fi camera, you will need a fast internet connection to support the streaming.

* Very easy to set up, and both the phone app and web app are very easy to use.
* The wide angle lens allows me to see the entire room with only one camera.
* Very sleek looking device
* The camera pops out of the metal case for different mounting options

Cons;
* Very expensive. comparable options are much cheaper, but I have not tested them, only compared features.
* Nest Aware is nice additional feature, but costs $100 a month. It let's you store 10 days of footage in the cloud, create time lapses, and create points of interest in the video feed for smarter alerts, but I don't think $100 a month is worth it for my usage.
* camera gets very hot even when it's not recording.",great surveillance camera but a little pricey

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,TLER,We like the cameras but have discovered that we probably need to get rid of our router and install a mesh type set up.

It serves its purpose and has the capability of talking to the camera as well through the app. The only thing i didn't like about this camera is that you have to pay for subscription after a few months or so if you want to store the videos for some reason. Without a subscription, it'll only store pictures within 24 hours.",Great Indoor Cam

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,Kostas,"Overall, these cameras met my expectations. The setup is easy on my android phone but not as good on my iPad. Once setup, the two apps both work well. Rated 4 stars for ease of set up but I believe they are expensive and the yearly 200 cost for cloud monitoring is also pricey. I have them set up in my windows looking outside. This works well as long as there isn't much light inside to cause glare.",Nice set of cameras

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2016,Btom,"Camera was easy to set up except for linking it to my Wifi network. I had to reenter the password about 10 times before it successfully joined the network. I verified my password each time prior to selecting ""enter."" The video from it is clear and seems to cover a fairly wide area. Major complaint is the cost to store the video, $100 per year for 10 day backup and $300 for a 30 day backup on an annual basis. Cannot store the video to your own computer. This video is to go along with my home security system.",Good Security Camera choice for remote monitoring

It only took 10 minutes from opening the box to fully functioning as I already had the Nest account with my thermostat. If you are new to nest you could add another 5 minutes for setting up your account.
It found my network without a hitch and started sending me alerts right away.
Only draw back is the requirement to buy the monitoring account starting at $10 per month in order to view activation history. Without this you can only see live action.

Hardest part is deciding which three spots in the home I wanted them. Great resolution, easy app, cool mic feature. I haven't yet opted to pay the subscription (required for saving video to cloud), but may exercise the option over time. Biggest con (wrapped up in a positive, sadly) is the bulky white power cord.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2016,Frederick,"I set up the camera to snoop through my front living window onto my covered front porch (I have a corner home and the local kids were using my porch as a late night lounge/trash can). The setup was perfect, the WIFI was easy to setup and it worked very well. This is a very solid indoor camera, but you will need to add the Nest Aware cloud storage option to get full functionality. One minor problem I had was the night vision camera was affected by the porch's motion activated security light - the sudden on/off glare seemed to throw off the night vision camera and I ended up with a distorted image with a bright sparkle. I disabled the night vision option and the sparkle went away without significant loss of night vision (my street is fairly well lit at night). The best feature is without a doubt the remote feature options which gives you control of the entire unit using my iPhone/iPad. This is a great indoor camera and even for the slightly hybrid way i am using it it is almost perfect.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Nov 2015,chris,"I purchased a few of these for my home in the hopes that if I had a problem I would be able to use the footage. 2 of my cameras are position for an inside view and 2 for an outside view. My car was broken into last week so it was my chance to put this to use - the outside videos at night were not very good - Since the cameras cannot be installed outside, they are positioned against a window and because the night vision ""lights"" reflect against the window , they have to be turned off (I do have to say they work great at night inside though). The driveway and road views are well lit with street lights so figures were clearly visible (athough it took me hours to find the footage because the activity zones did not catch activity) but nothing that can be used to identify the thieves. As I mentioned, the movement was not detected so this is a major negative for this system - I pay $25 a month for my 4 cameras to store footage for 10 days and I have set up ""activity zones"" so I think there should be a better way to access footage. Seriously disappointed in that aspect. The good points are that it does take clear video in the house and the activity zones in the house work well. I purchased these cameras initially to monitor activity inside the home and they were great but now that I have changed their purpose, they don't work as well...",Nice camera but has some issues

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2016,GMoney,"The NestCamera is still one of the best (if not the best) camera that you can get out there. The optics are still producing better images and video, especially at night, than the cameras on the market in this price range. 

The Google services for receiving notifications are good and the ability to scrub through the stored videos is good. One thing to note is that this camera does not just record clips like other cameras. It records EVERYTHING 24 hours a day, every day until you tell it to stop. While this is cool, that means that the cameras consume a LOT of bandwidth once you put 3-4 of them on a house. But if you want to see everything - you won't have a choice. Many cameras that simply start recording once they detect motion will miss many events and certain ""unnamed"" battery based cameras will die in any environment where there is a lot of activity. So if you want to see it all, this is still the best thing around.

Unless of course you want to record outdoors. These cameras are NOT rated for outdoor use. You can remedy this by doing a search for ""nestcamera enclosures"" and you will come across some solutions that will help with that problem. But know that the camera is neither designed nor warranty'd in that environment. 

Note: If you're thinking about getting more than one of them, but the Google bundle that has 3 cameras in it - you'll same a lot of money that way.","Excellent camera, but not for outdoor use"

When you replay video on your phone it doesn't allow for full screen viewing and zooming. They seemed to take what drop cam had and wasn't broken and tried to fix it. The camera doesn't have much of an upgrade as far as functionality from dropcam pro aside from pixels and I can't configure alerts to only send in app during certain times without the camera being off too.

They are not full-duplex. They are half-duplex, which means you can talk by pushing the microphone button, but then you have to disable it and wait for the other person to respond. It's like an old school walkie-talkie.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2018,teacher,"I love these cameras. I now have 4 of them. You get a free month of service each time you add a camera to your system. I suggest you add each camera one at a time to maximize your free months. I have not subscribed to the service. 

There are different packages , but I have the one that is $100 per year for the first one and $50 per year for each one after that if you pay for the year all at once. It is a little pricey, but I consider it to be like an insurance expense. (The good part is that you don't have to have a DVR or anything at home. No extra equipment. It is all saved in the cloud and you can rewind to see what happened.)

This indoor camera does have to be hooked up to electricity at all times. I wish it were wireless. The camera is black, but the cord is white. I wish it were black as well. I wish it did have a longer cord, but we just used an extension cord.

The IR reflecting off glass and window covering kills view.",Good entry level cameras
Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,nittanyatl,"The video that this camera produces is very good. It also has a wide field of view. When buying this, I was concerned about the lack of pan/tilt capability, but the field of view is so wide, that's not an issue.

The audio is decent -- I can have a conversation with someone viewing through the nest app or computer.

The cam comes with a free 30 day trial of nest aware, which keeps a 10 day video history. I'll probably go ahead and pay the $100 per year for that, but it still provides some basic security features without that. It's pretty easy to scan through the video history on the app as nest aware tags times where it saw movement.

I would have given this a 5* rating except the camera disconnects a couple times a week...and only unplugging for a minute fixes things. I now have it plugged into a wemo plug so I can ""unplug"" the camera remotely. I have screaming fast wifi in my house, so I don't think the issue lies with my wifi.

One thing to be aware of...is that nest says the cam uses about 120 gig of data per month...and that's consistent with what I'm seeing. You can set the cam to turn off (eg. at night or when anyone is home) to cut that back a bit. So if your internet provider has a low monthly bandwith max, you could bump into that. (Mine has a 1,000 gig max, so no issues).",Better than expected

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Nov 2018,KvG347,"The camera is quick to set up, and that's where the positives end. We have it mounted about 12 feet off the ground and at that height, the video image is ok but even at the highest resolution setting, you can't see a person's face clearly unless the sun is shining super bright into the house. I give video quality only 2 stars. Audio is acceptable, but when you communicate back and forth through the Android app and the camera, you can't always hear the person respond on your phone. The person near the camera can always hear the person that is on the phone, but not vice versa...1 star in this category. Also, to keep a video history of the past 10 days, you have to pay a subscription fee for a camera that is already super costly with poor quality in every category. There are systems out there that do not require a subscription fee. Also, there are a high number of false alarms. If the sun comes out from behind clouds or jumps back behind clouds, the camera alerts your phone that there is someone near the camera. You will get alert fatigue with this camera. Another problem, the camera sometimes will stop streaming to the Android app...we've had to shut off and turn on the camera 3 times in the past 2 weeks to restore video streaming capabilities on the Droid app. They should allow free or highly discounted upgrades to that new Nest cam which is supposedly light years ahead of this one, because this model is a total disappointment and waste of money.","Overpriced camera, poor vid quality, false alarms"

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Nov 2019,IAmSwell,"I liked them at first, but apparently ""they"" can change major functionality features.  Specifically, when I bought these in June to keep an eye on my disabled mother and her aids, I was able to turn off the LED power indicator light, enabling the camera to be very discreet.  I walk in today, and the cameras are lit up like Christmas trees, and are no longer hidden cameras.  Apparently, during a ""software update"" they were able to remove the option to turn off the light, so ""customers are always aware of the camera status.  The light is solid when camera is on, and blinks if someone is viewing it.  Well, heck, I bought the cameras TO VIEW, not be viewed, so I don't need the blinking light to tell me if the video is being viewed, since I'm the one viewing!  I'm pretty PO'ed that they took a feature that was part of my selection process, and removed it, basically changing the product I bought.  I bought cameras that would have no indicator light so I could hide them in my house.  I also am not crazy about the subscription based cloud recording.  I don't like any of my data on a cloud; I prefer to maintain control of my own privacy and security.  

What I REALLY want to now is what the LED light pattern is when Google is watching and/or listening.  

I'm going to try to find something where the basic features cannot be changed or removed, as well as self contained recording, not cloud/subscription based.  Not even sure if there is such a thing anymore","I liked it at first, but ""they"" have too much cont"

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Terry,"I originally purchased a set of dlink cameras to use as baby monitors for a newborn. They were somewhat effective, but not particularly nicely so. Resolution on them was enough to see him moving, but frequently not enough to see him sleeping. Night vision was similarly grainy - we could make it work, but it wasn't convenient. The biggest mark against the dlinks that prompted the upgrade, however, was app responsiveness. Sometimes their app would take a full minute to load and connect on my phone.

All issues improved with the Nest cameras. Resolution is high enough to watch breathing movement. Night vision is crisp. Audio is sensitive. And the app loads and connects in seconds from phone or desktop.

The only downside is that the Nest cameras don't have remote pan and tilt control. They do, however, have a much better field of vision, and can cover almost the whole room anyway.

Ultimately, highly recommended​.",Strong and effective

Very good pictures and motion detection. The new detection that has face recognition rather than just movement is a huge improvement. These are great for keeping an eye on your pet when away from the house. And, being able to watch and talk are a huge plus. Also like the video recording, but think there should be an option to simply download to your own computer system so you do not need to pay a fee to Nest to store online - interesting observation is that every time you buy a new camera you get the online storage for a free trial. So, if you buy one camera, then add another camera later you can actually get a free online storage for both cameras.",NestCam

What exceeded my expectations is how easy it was to install and the flexibility is has that you can almost mount it anywhere. Setting up is a breeze which is what I love about nest products. Keep in mind that it really doesn't fall in the same category as other dedicated security cameras and you will have to pay at least $10 a month for a nest aware subscription to get 10 days worth of video stored in the cloud. The subscription is the only way to use this camera at it's full potential. If you want a good quality camera and don't need all the bells and whistles, this is the camera to get.

The aspect that changed my life was me seeing myself in the cameras and seeing how out of shape I was. I have changed my eating habits, cut out soda and been working out regularly and this all because of seeing myself in Nest Cam video playbacks.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Nov 2017,edocentric,"The wife and I use both Ring Video Doorbells & Ring Stick-Up Cams for our exterior and inside our garages and those are great cameras for those use cases. When we started researching security cameras for inside the living areas of our house, we decided on these cameras due to their ability to plug into electrical outlets which was more appealing for an indoor security camera. Installation was quick and easy - very comparable to the Ring Cameras. I also like having the option to download videos and camera screen captures to our DropBox account (also available with the Rings). The one thing to watch out for is that since the electrical line is very obvious coming out of the camera, one simply has to unplug it to disable the camera. Overall, a solid camera and a good option for an indoor security camera",Solid Well-Built Security Camera

My only issue is the camera going “offline” randomly. I’ve sent one back to Nest and received a replacement. First they said it was the power cable/ now it’s MY internet- but everything else works fine in the home. Then they say it’s common if the camera is 50’ from your router. Mine is less than that, but not on the same floor. We use it mainly as a baby monitor and second floor security, so you can see why we’d be frustrated when it goes offline while the power and internet are both on and full speed.",Works great- most of the time

It was nice to see the history so that we knew it was the cats that knocked over the kitchen chair and pulled the tablecloth on the floor, not an intruder!! :-D We could tell from the history when our house/cat sitter had entered so we could give her privacy (grandma) and only check in when she wasn't there.

The cameras themselves are heavy duty and very sturdy. I love the way these cameras work with my Nest Thermostat and setting them up in ITTT.com to work with my Phillips lights was super easy. The only reason I didn't rate these cameras a 5 star is because of the initial cost and the monthly fee you have to pay - the cost is a little high.

Google - Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Black,1,1,23 Nov 2019,KOLun,"We bought this to monitor our dog while we are out. It can do that but..... the setup requires a password. While the password I chose met the requirements, it would not let me use it. I put the capital letter in he middle of the word instead of the first letter and it worked. Why?? To use it your phone has to be on WiFi. Not so useful when shopping. Using public WiFi is very risky. Also Nest is owned by Google. I have serious trust issues with them especially since they appear to be saving the video. Bottom line I wasted my money and it’s too late to return it.",Waste of money
