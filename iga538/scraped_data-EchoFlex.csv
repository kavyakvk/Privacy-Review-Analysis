Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,Drumlord29,"I added another echo device to my collection! I've got every single kind of echo in the market. For obvious reasons, the speaker isn't the best. It is surprisingly smaller than I thought. I use it in my garage for when I close the garage using Alexa. I have the MyQ garage opener which i can open or close with my echo auto in my car. But after I turn off my engine, so does my echo auto. So I have to pull out my phone or manually push the garage opener on the wall. So I plugged it underneath my garage door opener so I can tell Alexa to close or open the garage door from anywhere in my garage without my phone or pushing a button. I don't really intend to use this for playing music. It's really for doing simple Alexa tasks in my garage. It is an echo device that is not meant to look and sound pretty. It's Alexa at its most basic form. Small, no cables, small speaker, and works like any echo device. I believe it's meant for a garage bathroom or hallway if uppity have the night light or motion detector accessory. If you want to play music with it, a bluetooth or wired speaker is highly recommended. Although I had very little expectations with this being that I meant to use it to just open and close my garage, I did notice one negative thing on it. I tried adjusting thre volume from the Alexa app but it switches back to 70% everytime. No idea why. Perhaps there built in speaker is best heard at 70% and if connected to a better speaker, it will allow for a louder volume. I'm going yo have to try that someday. But for now, it's perfect for what I wanted to use it for. If you know what you need it for, don't expect it to be more than that. If you want a better sound, get a dot or something bigger. For simple uses, this will do fine for all your Alexa needs. I may use it for my echo microwave which is currently paired with my echo input connected to a speaker. Don't blame the equipment if you want it to do more than what the hardware can achieve. Be fair to the gadget on what it is capable of doing.","Small, not for music, great for basic Alexa"

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Nov-19,Scott Andrews,"I bought this to replace my first generation echo do hanging in the outlet in my bathroom. I mainly use this unit for morning news while getting reading in the morning.  The sound quality, in regards to volume, is terrible. With the sound turned all the way up and standing within 2 feet of the Flex, I can barely hear Alexa. I can only imagine how useless the Flex is in a larger room.",Sound sucks
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Nov-19,Planet PuertoRico,"Its very small, alexa sounds like a chipmunk, the attachments are nice but the audio should have been a priority as its the main way of interaction and the first thing you notice, any chance of using the usb port for a better internal speaker attachment? it comes with an aux output for an audio system and bluetooth connectivity for expanded audio options. It's sold as a smart speaker but it just sounds really, really cheep.",Small / the audio quality sounds terrible
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Nov-19,D. Newton,"REVISED TO 5 stars: One of the latest updates established connectivity and functionality, and it now works exactly as expected. It’s a small speaker, and thus won’t provide anything but minimal sound, nor is it designed to. Understand this beforehand and you won’t be disappointed like so many others who didn’t think through what it was designed for. If you need great sound/music quality, then other Echos are designed for that. So far, the Alexa app hasn’t been able to see/recognize/connect to the Flex, no matter what I do. I’ll box it up and wait a couple of months for an update to fix this issue. I have 14 other Alexa units in total, so this was just a purchase out of curiosity, not necessity.","Understand the niche for this, and why the speaker is small, and you will be happy."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Oct-20,Amazon Customer,"This is by far the worst echo device I have ever used, and I have four other various models. The Echo Flex consistently drops out of multi room audio groups and has to be unplugged and plugged back in to resync. The built in speaker is terrible and useless if you are more than a few inches away from it. It also has by far the worst microphone and struggles to hear me even when I'm in the same room.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Nov-19,Fabriezy,In a quiet space the speaker is loud enough to hear but just barely and it sounds terrible.  I get way better sound from my phone so forget using it for anything but giving Alexa commands.  Maybe for a hallway with the nightlight option but even then I think I would rather have a Dot so I could use it elsewhere if I wanted.,For most a Dot with a mount is the way to go. Heres why...
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Nov-19,J. Hall,"I'm so surprised Amazon brought this to market.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Nov-19,Rafael,"UPDATE: After having it for almost a year I been having problems where it disconnects often and sometimes won't respond all the time I can tell it to turn off the light but then tell it to do something else like ask the time and it seems confused, won't answer, but then the next day it does. I lked it for the motion thing but just going to get a regular dot for the garage. I have this in my garage and works perfectly when I'm working there and want to turn on lights I have connected to a smart plug. Also if I want to know the weather or if I have a question in general works great. I can play music on it but it's not great for sound, but I don't think that was the intent for this. If your buying it for higher quality sound get a Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa. Or pair it up with a Bluetooth speaker or use the 3.5 mm audio jack and hook it to your stereo. I did the drop in with an echo dot in the house and it worked great. I could hear them clearly and they could hear me, which is nice if someone needs me they can drop in on the garage. I also have a camera in the garage so I can also see and now talk to whoever is there. Overall I'm happy with it. Oh and if the LED is flashing a yellowish color it's the way it notifies you you have a notification. Found that out when The one I have in the house was also flashing indicating I have a notification.","UPDATE:..... Nice little Device, works perfectly as intended."

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Nov-19,Valag,"The Flex is a great option if you don't like having cords dragging across surfaces. It does everything a regular Echo or Echo Dot can do. and It's actually smaller than I expected. Only occupies the lower plug without blocking the top one. Great for kitchen and bathroom, or anywhere that has above-counter-level plugs. Produces enough sound that I can hear it while in the shower, but, the speaker quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't expecting top-notch, Bose-quality sound from this small of a device, but Alexa sounds like she's talking to me through a Solo cup. So I guess this won't replace any of my other Echo devices for playing music, but it's certainly good enough for listening to the news and weather while getting ready for work.",The Echo device that won't Flex your wallet.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jan-20,KT - Six Eight Tall,"We are here to pump up this review! Amazon Flex? More like Amazon Flabby... Ya! This device is so puny that it must go back to the gym to earn it's name! Here is our loser friend to explain why such a flabby device can only lift one star.... <clears throat> Mmmm k. As avid Amazon smart product users, we purchased the Flex based on it's small design form (in that it would occupy the least amount of space and be a perfect kitchen addition to keep our counters open). On this front it is perfect. Speaking in the kitchen, the Echo Dot Second Generation in our living room was actually picking up our voices better than the Flex which was in the same room. To Echo* what other reviewers have said, the sound on this device is tinny and distracting. Considering most smart phones can generate, the small footprint of the Flex isn't a great excuse in 2020 for skimping on sound to this extent. With commands and recipes is was displeasing but with music it was downright distracting. Imagine an old building doorway intercom speaker as an upgrade to this and you get what I mean. I'm guessing the positive reviews are mainly concerned with the small footprint which again, is excellent but even at a discount we had to return this and the accompanying motion sensor in favor of mounting another Echo speaker in our kitchen. Here's hoping Amazon invests just a tiny bit more on the quality of the speaker and microphone array though for future generations of this product because this first gen Flex was an absolute miss for our household. * puns provided free of charge for this unbiased loser review",Did someone say Flex?

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Jan-20,Mike,"So initially I thought this would be a great addition to my garage as a smart speaker. I thought to my self it’s small, doesn’t need a cable or a desk to be displayed on (mounts directly to the  wall vía it’s plug), and it should fill the garage with some smart tech easily, only that wasn’t exactly the case. My main gripe is with the sound quality, it’s awful and basically ruined the product (Especially since it’s all about voice activated features and doesn’t have a screen). Alexa sounds hollow/awful and music sounds even worse. There is limited to no bass and the mids/highs aren’t anywhere (good) to be found either. That being said, there also aren’t enough redeeming qualities to make this a well rated product. Yes I did pay a decent price on it (Amazon had a 50% off sale around the end of 2019) and it has a built in USB port on the bottom. So then you’d think that’s cool it was cheap and there is a port (basically giving you an extra charge outlet for a phone or something) and yeah I’d agree with that thought process, then I noticed the two official add ons for the USB port (a night light and a motion sensor) are half the MSRP of the unit and honestly should have just been built in (with a better speaker). Then, and only then, would this have been a 4 star or better product but instead it’s barely a 3, more like a 2 star product if you paid full price. I’d say wait for gen two or another steep discount before you buy this thing.",Half baked “smart” speaker...
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Nov-19,TBS,The concept of this is nice but the sound quality is not good at all.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Nov-19,Ashley N Ward,"I was SUPER excited to have an echo I could easily plug into my bathroom wall. I even ordered this a month in advance. However, when they say ""mini smart speaker"" they really mean MINI smart speaker. Even when you do the ""level 11"" secret volume, these are still so quiet. I have a regular echo dot (3rd gen) and the volume is perfect. However, I have a vent fan in my bathroom that turns on when I turn on the light and I can barely hear it over the fan. I'd expect that if the volume was at a 5 or 6, but a 10 or 11? The sound quality is even a bit fuzzy despite being so quiet. I don't expect it to be as loud as a normal echo, but it's big enough they could have added better speakers. Very disappointing.",Way too quiet
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Nov-19,Ashley,"I think these might be a little expensive for what you’re getting. I mean it’s a nice concept but the sound quality is horrible. I expected it from a small device but at least it’s nice to put in a small space. I put them in the bathroom so I can make announcements that dinner is ready or something like that. I’m planning on playing some Christmas music on it for the bathroom which I think would be nice with the decorations I have in there. Definitely wouldn’t be able to hear the music if you were in the shower tho. If you could, it would be very faint.",They’re okay but not necessary.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Feb-20,capo,"I have Echo devices of one kind or another in every room and have had others that I’ve decided to let go (original Echo and Echo Auto). They’ve all performed their smarthome duties acceptably well. My biggest complaint across the board is sound quality. Alexa always sounds like she’s talking to you from underneath a pile of pillows. Bass? Sure, on the Echo Show, at least. Treble? Nada. Sure, you can use the app’s “equalizer”... but it’d take an oscilloscope to detect the minuscule difference that makes in the sound quality. I’d given up on getting any more devices... until I saw a review of the Flex on Paul Hibbert’s YouTube channel... he liked it, but said (I think) that it sounded ‘trebly’. Trebly?! That’s a magic word to my ears. I ordered one up and found that it indeed sounds ‘trebly’ (call it tinny of you like) but who cares? Who seriously listens to music on these tiny little devices anyway?! I can understand what Alexa says now - all the plosives are there. I still wonder why Amazon can’t tune the rest of the Alexa enabled devices for better higher frequency clarity.","Treble! Hooray, I can understand Alexa now!"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Dec-19,Consumer Advocate,"Compared to Echo Dots, the Echo Flex is a good space-saving idea but the microphone(s) were unreliable and the speaker was a joke so the 1st one I ordered was returned.

Either they improved the device considerably or the first one was defective because the 2nd one is WORKING LIKE A CHAMP!",Nice case design improved microphone & speaker ?
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Nov-19,JC Fazzone,"As with all Amazon product, it is better to wait for next generation products as with time the products do get better. This item is a disappointment with sound and volume control. While it fits in small spaces, it’s worth while to buy an Echo Dot with mounting bracket. Very disappointed that 14.99 is necessary to purchase the night light. Not recommending this product.☹️",Will pay to wait
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jan-20,Jason H.,"After writing this review and rating it 2 stars, I received a call from Amazon.  They wanted to tell me that the speaker on the Echo Flex is not meant to be the main audio source.  The intent of the design is to use Bluetooth to connect to an external speaker.  This would, of course, resolve my concern with the sound quality, so I increased the rating to 3, or okay.  But in thinking about the Flex alone, I don't think I would rate it as good or great, because it has limited appeal without additional investment. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of adding a speaker just to have this device, because I could buy a Dot instead.  However, I concede that there are niches where this functionality and price savings would be useful.  For example, after thinking about it further, I realized that I could connect it to my Bluetooth enabled treadmill and have Alexa right up front for music or any other questions I might have without having to mount an Echo Dot on the wall.  The Flex plugs in securely to a wall socket and leaves the second outlet open.  It's not heavy and doesn't sag like some two-pronged, heavy transformers do. Installing this was a simple as unpacking it and plugging it in.  It had already been integrated into my account and the WiFi login was automatic. Notifications cause the LED to blink brightly.  It's much harder to ignore it, when you already know what the notification is.  You have to ask, what's my notification, in order to clear it. The sound is like a cell phone's speakerphone, and is hard to listen to.  This device would go best in a garage or out of the house, where you might want access to announcements or activating guards, but not where you want to hear it every day.  (edit:  you are expected to connect to a Bluetooth speaker by design) Giving plenty of space in front of the device helps with communication.  Putting it in a tight space can cause echoes or chirps and clicks that interfere with it.",For someplace you won't need to listen to it every day.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Nov-20,Sandra Knight,"I have had this for a year and it works flawlessly.  I use it for alarm time setting when I am cooking, playing music, weather, getting correct time and date, movie listing, etc.  I find it play music loud enough for me.  I have it in my living room, and can hear it in bathroom, bedroom and kitchen.  Of course I live in a 1000 sq ft. apartment and the sound is very good.  When I am talking on phone, the other party on line says they can hear it very plainly so it is loud.  Don't know why the comments say its bad for hearing, must have an extra large house.  Right now its so loud that I have to have Alexa turn it down some.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Nov-19,Ella Belle,"I just got my Echo Flex - Plug-in smart speaker with Alexa this morning and I'm already totally in LOVE with it! With it I also bought that ""Made for Amazon"" THIRDREALITY Smart Night-Light for Echo Flex, and I love it too! I had been wanting to put an Echo Dot in a very tiny bathroom, but I was trying to figure out how, since I have no counter space and didn't want to use up my last outlet. Then, along comes this Echo-Flex thingy, so I decided to give it a try. I've been super delighted with it all morning long! I love how it just plugs right into an outlet and is totally out of my way but still basically does most of what the echo Dots do. I had a regular nightlight in the room that took up an outlet socket, so this new Smart Nigh-Light was a great solution because it plugs right into the bottom of the Echo Flex, so just the Echo-Flex is using that 1 outlet now. It's so cool too because I can ask Alexa to change the lights colors! I've bought 4 of the Echo Dots for my home and I am in love with all of them. This Echo-Flex is just a smaller version that is so perfect for small bathrooms, laundry rooms and basically anywhere else where you just don't have counter or table space for an Echo Dot. I also love how easy it is to set these devices up! Just be sure the little box below the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Buy Now"" buttons is checked ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup""! It really does simplify the set-up wonderfully! Anyway, I am totally loving this new Echo-Flex so much and I already have ideas of getting some more of them for other tiny places around my home that I had not considered before. These things are just so helpful AND so fun! UPDATE 08/16/2020: I've now bought 4 of these echo Flexes with the nightlights. One for the laundry room, one for my Kitchen and 2 for my small bathrooms. I use these every day and they have become indispensable!  Sure, the sound is not super great for music, but the fact that these are not stealing any counter space is paramount for me. I have other Echo's in other rooms for music anyway. I love these things! UPDATE 10/13/2020: I am STILL in love with these cool little Echo Flex gadgets!  I use them many times daily! A great size for small rooms like Bathrooms, laundry rooms, store rooms, mud rooms, garage, even out in our woodshed! I happily got more today on Prime Day!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Dec-19,Mr Huskey,"It is very bulky robbing room from other items you might want to plug in.  The speaker quality sucks.  No where near as good as the Echo plus speaker.  Playing music on the Flex's built in speaker sounds like listening to an old transistor pocket radio.  It does pair easily to my blue tooth speakers which sound really good. Motion detection works, but is almost useless until the Amazon Alexa app matures a bit more.  Settings in the app are too cumbersome to want to use at the moment.  Controlling a light seems easy enough, but I wanted it to turn on a Wyze switched outlet.  I had to create a new group... assign the Wyze switch to it... create a routine to turn on the group.  There was no skill that let me just turn on/off the switch without creating the group first.  Seemed like way more hassle than it should have been. The night light seems nice, but I haven't spent much time playing with it yet.  I just picked the first color that was bright enough to fill the room.  Too bad you can't have motion sensing and the night light in one module.

It was barely audible plugged next to the bathroom sink standing 2 feet away... even less so in the shower. Although you can plug an external speaker to it, it defeats the purpose of it. It could work if you prefer using an external speaker (3.5mm will support drop-in, bluetooth will not) and just want to plug something in the wall and not worry about cables.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-19,D. Coral,"I set up this cute little Echo Flex + Motion Sensor in the garage.  It was easy to add Routines in the Alexa app to turn On and Off the WeMo light switch for the garage light.  I had this automation ready to go in about 5 minutes.  It’s real nice to have the garage light come on automatically whenever I open the garage door.  I also set it to turn off the light after no motion is detected for 1 hour (choose any time period). You can also have the motion sensor activate an Echo device to speak a custom phrase, give a news flash briefing, traffic report, play music, etc. There is a setting to specify the time when the motion sensor should perform the Routine (anytime, or between a certain time period) and to suppress a repeat of the Routine for a configurable time period so it won’t keep doing the same thing every time there is motion, if you don’t want it to.  For example you can have it give you the traffic report or news briefing when you enter the bathroom in the morning but only if the motion happens between 6-8am. This is super useful — after trying out the first one, I’m going to buy a few more to play with around the house.",Motion Sensor is Handy!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-19,Spyder2014,"If you are looking for a quality speaker to listen to music while you are in the bathroom or kitchen... pay a little extra and get an echo dot. The flex is perfect if you want to add another echo device for the sake of controlling smart home devices, taking advantage of the guardian functionality or for the occasional drop in. You also get the added functionality of either a motion sensor or night light with the available accessories. We replaced our bathroom night light with the flex and it is great! The light accessory gives off more light than our old night light and my wife loves the different colors you can choose due to the built in rgb LEDs. I tested the drop in feature as well and it was loud and clear while talking to my wife in the next room. I highly recommend the flex if you want an additional echo device in a bathroom, kitchen or spare room and don't want the hassle of hiding the cables, or if you want to add motion sensor triggers or a night light to a room.",Perfect... for what it is!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Jan-20,Debra T,"I am in the midst of setting up an Alexa eco-system in my home. I have a Fire TV, first generation Echo, Fire Tablet, Echo Show 5, and several smart plugs. I wanted an Alexa-enabled device in my bedroom to do the ""basics"" ... respond to my voice commands ... and to turn the smart plugs on my bedroom lamps on and off. So I got an Echo Flex. I set it up in less than a minute, and soon it was turning my lamps on and off, telling me the time, answering my silly questions and telling me jokes! People, this is how technology should work. The world would be a much techno-friendly place if all technology was this easy to set up. I didn't get this for the sound quality of an Echo or for the screen time of an Echo Show. If I had wanted those features in my bedroom, I would have spent more more money to get them. I can never figure out why people buy an entry level product here on Amazon that does ""the basics"" and then give it a bad review when it doesn't do everything the ""cadillac version"" does. Sheesh. What I love about this product: --It's a great price. --It does what it's intended to do. --It can be enhanced with a bluetooth speaker, a nightlight or a motion detector. --It's out of the way. --It only takes up one outlet. The other one is still available for use. --You can plug in a USB device to it, like a smartphone, to charge it. What I dislike about this product: --Nothing. Because it does what I bought it to do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Nov-19,Amodeus1971,"Besides the speaker being small and sounding like garbage the Flex has gotten better over time. The motion sensor I have come to like now that I have adapted to it and they have seemed to iron out some of the problems. My main problem now is they limited the use of it because they are only allowing you to own two of these with the motion sensor per Amazon account unless you have a business account. No other explanation besides they tried to get me to sign up for an Amazon business account. I have one in my bathroom and wanted to put two in my kitchen are because there are two entrances and I wanted to make my lights fully motion-controlled in my kitchen.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jul-20,Moore Family,"I got the Echo Flex to go along with weatherproof Bluetooth speakers on our covered deck. I Love that there are no external cables, and it's easy to unplug and take inside. The Bluetooth connection has been rock-solid so far. Things stay pretty dry on the deck, but rain does come in from the side during heavy thunderstorms, so I designed and 3D-printed a simple cover for the Echo Flex to keep it dry. So far it has stayed totally dry. If you're interested, search thingiverse dot com for ""Echo Flex Splash Guard"" and you'll find it. As far as the Echo Flex itself: I'm very happy with it as a way to play music and podcasts over Bluetooth speakers. Previously, I tried using a Google Home Mini (in a zip-lock bag) and it kept disconnecting constantly. While it's great to ask for the news, weather, etc without needing a mobile device, the voice interface can be very awkward for getting certain specific content (podcasts, albums, etc). Most of the time, you end up hearing something similar to, but not quite, what you asked for. For that reason, it's nice that you can cast to the EF from the Amazon music app. Regarding voice recognition:  we do have to yell at it a bit more than the Echo Dots inside the house. This may be due to the rain cover blocking some of the sound and/or sound dispersing more outside than it does inside. Still, not a big issue. We're in a pretty secluded area, so I'm not that worried about security, but I get that this would be an issue for folks in more crowded areas. As is well documented, anyone expecting much out of the internal speaker would be very disappointed. OTOH, it's nice that Amazon chose to release a low-cost/high-function product and still make it easy to connect to external speakers with the 3.5mm or Bluetooth interfaces. Overall, given the price, size, quality and the way I'm using it with external speakers, I'm extremely happy with the Echo Flex.",Works great with external Bluetooth speakers. 3D Printed cover makes it more weather resistant.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-May-20,Average Joe,"I purchased this product to extend Alexa function with my existing echo dots. I like the dots, but I was attracted to this one because of size, price, and the ability to attach another supporting device such as the motion sensor (which I also purchased). The sound volume is horrible. I was rather impressed with the dot's volume level and sound quality for their size and figured since the echo flex is roughly 60% the size of the dots, then I would have to accept around a 40% loss of volume and sound quality. WRONG!! Try about a 90% loss. Really, the volume from the flex is about the same quality and level as your cell phone is with the volume (of your cell phone) set to 10-15%. Seriously, the echo dot two rooms away can be heard over this echo flex in the same room. Next, the echo flex often loses wifi connection. For example, the two echo dots I have lost wifi connection about 6-8 times last year (collectively). More the half of these instances were for legitimate reasons (power outages mostly). The echo flex has lost internet connection more than twice this week alone (or so sayeth my phone notifications). The echo flex is only about 25 feet away from the router. The echo dots are 18 and 35 feet away from the same router. Why the flex loses wifi connection so often is unknown to me. The motion sensor add on does work. It's just that it stops working now and then. I actually sent the first one back after this happened and got a second one when it did the same thing. It took me a little while to figure out that it would begin working normally after the echo flex was unplugged, then plugged back in. In hindsight, I feel like the motion sensor I returned was not defective and that it is, in fact, the echo flex that is the heart of the issue. The echo flex motion sensor add on combo isn't reliable enough for security purposes. I feel like the echo flex was rushed into production before it could be fully developed. It doesn't have the refinement that the other echo products I have used does. Could a firmware push solve some of these issues? Probably, but I feel like the low volume is inherent to the design and cannot be fixed with software.","Low volume, product needs further development"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Oct-20,LiveWithTech,"I have 3 echo dots in my home along with 1 echo show, 1 echo auto & 1 Alexa in EcoBee thermostat. Also, I do have 4 google home mini. The echo devices have multiple pros compared to google home and is a must in any smart home. I installed this in my guest bathroom. Now when coming from a full-fledged device to this echo flex, definitely there are differences. My 2 cents below: Pros: - Alexa integration to all 3rd party devices works the same as all other echo devices and to set the routine is a cake piece - It Is a modular device with multiple attachments available that can go along with the device, like a clock, motion sensor, night light, etc. All other models miss this modularity - Well built product - Takes only one space on a 2-prong device, I was able to use Air Wick diffuser and Flex on a single board - Very reasonably priced Cons: - Sound is very feeble and meant for small rooms only. Listening to music is not a great experience on this device - Echo flex doesn't have far-field view technology as echo show does so sometimes it fails to trigger the recognition if you face the other side and speak",A must have voice assistant device for any smart home !!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Dec-19,l33tDad,"First of all, this is our 5th Echo device and have been more than happy with all of them, but as the headline says, it has it's flaws. First of all, don't get this for the sound quality as you will NOT be happy. The speaker is adequate for ""general"" things like announcements but is very small making music sound about as good as an inexpensive cell phone. However, I have this connected through bluetooth to a small amplifier in a kitchen cabinet which powers a couple of ceiling speakers and for this, it's fantastic. The nice thing about this device is that since it plugs directly into a wall outlet, it takes no table/counter space Why didn't I rate 5 stars? Well, the sensitivity for voice recognition is no where are good as our other devices. It's almost like I need to make it a point to speak loudly and clearly at the device for it to recognize that I'm trying to give it a command while our other Echo's can hear me from across the room looking the other way. If Amazon were able to fix this with maybe a firmware upgrade, it would be 5 stars. Other than that, it works great.","Works great, but has it's flaws"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Sep-20,Dale Hemphill,"I bought this echoflex on May 13th 2020. It worked fine until September 4th 2020. For some reason, my Amazon app would not recognize it when I try to change the Wi-Fi on the device. I did everything I new to do, including resetting the flex device itself, resetting my Wi-Fi modem, deleting and reinstalling the Amazon Alexa app, and yet still, it would not recognize the device for whatever reason, considering I had just change the Wi-Fi on it two weeks ago! after several text conversations with support and two phone calls to live support, no one can come up with an answer. The best they could do is offer a trouble ticket and have someone call me after the labor day I bought this device specifically for the labor day holiday to hook with a blue to amp in my backyard! However, now I am not able to accommodate my guests with music in our outdoor affair! I live less than a mile from the Amazon distribution center and I could certainly just go and buy another one for less than $24, but this one I would have thought is still under warranty, or at least I could get a suitable resolve to my problem. However, the best they could offer is that they will put in a trouble ticket and give me a call after the holidays!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Oct-20,Anita,The device is really convenient. I have it in the bathroom with a nightlight attachment. The sound quality can be compared to a typical smartphone speaker. I mostly use it to listen to NPR (talk radio) or ask about the weather forecast while I'm getting ready and for that the quality is totally fine. It wouldn't be great for listening to music loud enough to hear over running water,Perfect for NPR while I get ready in the morning
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jan-20,MarkO,"Two issues with quality. I bought it to mount on an outlet above our kitchen counter (wide open counter area)  between two of my echo devices:  one Dot 20' away - through a open arch and around a corner and an echo plus 18' away in the opposite direction in an open room but behind a wing wall. I can be facing the Flex from 5' away and either of the other echos in the other rooms will respond before the Flex. I bought the flex because sometimes the other echos can't be heard well depending on sound level set for music, and the make mistakes if not elevating my voice when adding items to list, asking for conversions etc. I basically have to really be close to it to have it work or the music playing on the other two will cut out and respond. It's why I freaking bought it. I have to be 6' away facing it directly. Second the speaker sounds just awful. I mean, I don't play any music on it at all, just the response sounds like a toy. I realize it's cheap, but I'm disappointed. I wish I would have bought a Dot 3 or used Dot 2 with a outlet mounted holder like I did for my garage workbench. Try to save a few bucks and you get what you pay for. Lastly, I thought the add on motion sensor was a cool idea until I read how horrible the reviews are for it after I bought the Flex.  At least I saved my money by not buying it as a package. Edit: Apparently my echo flex read my review and decided to be the alpha female on my first floor. Now she will be the responding device if I talk in a normal tone anywhere now on my first floor - even 4' from my other devices when the flex is almost 20' away. Except when I am 5' away from the flex and speaking directly to it, then it ignores me. It has managed to make my wife and I hate it and my two adult children when visiting have told me to get rid of it. Ordered a wall mount for an echo dot 3 that is underutilized on another floor of the house to replace the flex. I'll buy another dot next year on prime day or black Friday. The flex will - I don't know, hide it in the mechanical room in case I want to know what time it is when I change my furnace filter a few times a year.",disappointing so far.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Dec-19,Casey,"So, I am an Echo fanatic.  I have all of them except for the Echo Look (???this product is just weird). That said, I am deeply saddened by this product.  I could only bring myself to provide it a 5 start feedback on Volume Control.  It has the same volume control as any other Echo. Sadly, this is where the usefulness stopped. It is huge, it doesn't really save space over any other product, it just happens to hang on your wall.  What it does do, is look ugly and sound awful.  The speaker on the DOT is infinitely superior to this one.  Even at MAX volume, you can barely hear the responses from this echo even at a couple feet away. I think they halfheartedly  tried to make it NOT useless by adding a USB port to the bottom.  Yes it has an auxiliary port but then why not just get the Amazon Input? (which is about as useful as Amazon Auto (which you don't want to get me started reviewing)). Don't buy it unless you positively have no where to set an Echo Dot.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jan-20,Megan Campbell,"I’m not sure why there are so many negatives regarding sound on this thing. I feel this is a niche product that is meant to be a filler for home automation. I have a small apartment with 2 dots: one in my sons room, another in my main room. Our morning routine has me going to the Alexa app and turning off his alarm and turning on his music and lights for his wake up routine. I’ve wanted a voice activated device that wasn’t a full blown dot to help me automate our morning routine. I already have a nice Yamaha speaker in my room so I wasn’t wanting an echo. Also, I prefer some privacy in my bedroom (my other dots tend to pick up at random times). This will work perfectly for that purpose. I can update this review after I’ve had this for a bit. Yes the sound is smaller and a bit distorted but this isn’t meant to be a true speaker. I see it as an intercom to help automate my household.

I didn't expect great sound, but I did expect to be able to hear it.  The volume is so inadequate, that I am returning it. The Echo Dot is a far better choice if small size is your driving force. Sure, you can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker, but that kind of negates the small footprint. If you just need something to control lights or other devices, I suppose it's ok.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Dec-19,Kit Clayton,"The sound quality is far inferior to an Echo or even a Dot.  But, guess what?  This is a Flex, not an Echo or Dot!  One of these is plugged in right next to my home’s intercom, with the stereo jack right into the intercom system.  The horrible Flex speaker is moot, since it feeds directly into the home intercom and associated speakers - which all are far superior to even the echo or Bluetooth speakers.  So, even rooms ,utility/workroom, garage, porches, and decks without an Echo devices now have Alexa.  Check it out - since Flex is right next to intercom, can trigger Alexa through the intercom!  Brilliant, right?  True - not as convenient as just talking (and why there are still 4 echo devices in strategic places throughout the home) but in outdoor and other places (such as garage and work room) where it is not a good idea for an echo, a good way to smart home up everything.  And here I thought intercoms were worthless in this day and age.... I got a second Flex just to - well, flex.  Can plug it in anywhere (screened in outdoor gazebo in summer) on the property for instant voice activated Alexa for when I am too lazy to get up and push an intercom button.... Soooo, this is a great device if used for intended - and advertised clearly on product page - purpose.  You want barely passable music, then get an Echo for five bucks more when they are on sale.  you want a easy p,ug in flexible unit (er, hence the device’s name) for voice activating Alexa - or, in my case to Alexify (yes, “Alexify” is a verb in my world) my whole home intercom system, then this device is perfect.  5 stars - clearly, as I bought another one already, is recommended if used for how it was designed.",Outstanding Alexa extension!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Aug-20,Somebody,"I received two Echo Flex devices today. I'd read all the one-star reviews before ordering, so I was prepared to send them back if they were as awful as some folks say. But when I unboxed them and plugged them into outlets, I was glad to see how quickly and automatically they connected to my wifi. Ready to use in about a minute or less. Yes, those who say the audio is tinny are right. Not at all as good as my Echo Dots, Echo Show, or the original Echo tower. But the two locations where I wanted to put the new devices aren't areas where the quality of the audio matters: living room and bathroom. So far, Alexa has had no problem hearing me, nor have I had trouble hearing her. I even tested the living room one to see if Alexa could hear me when the TV is on. I raised my voice only slightly above conversation-level. No problem. I also heard her despite the TV's audio. I noticed that the Flex in my bathroom sounded louder than the one in the living room, so I put the living room one in the bathroom to compare them. No difference. My guess is that the Flex sounds louder in the bathroom because it's a tiny room, while the living room is considerably larger. Also, I'm closer to the Flex in the bathroom (about 15"" when standing at my washbowl) than in my living room where I am across the room from it (about 9'). The one glitch my living room flex has is the volume control. The bathroom's volume is set at 100%, but the living room's volume is stuck at 70%. Now, having said that, it sounds just like the 100% volume on the other Flex. I tried repeatedly to boost the volume to 100%, following the directions in the app to do that, but no luck. I have emailed support to see what I can do to get it to 100%, but truthfully it doesn't matter. As just about everyone says, the Flex is not suitable for listening to music -- but I decided to give it a try. I told Alexa to play Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"". It was far from good, but it was also nowhere near horrible. All in all, I'm pleased that I decided to replace my clunky Dots which were hanging from the outlet in holders (to keep from having to deal with cords). The Echo Flex is *much* better aesthetically, and it meets my needs.","Didn't expect much, but happy with the purchase"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Nov-19,John Silvia,"I've installed this in my garage - adds intercom capabilities and kills my old clock-radio. Overall the Echo Flexs' performance has been good.  It has limitations - but those are kind of expected given the packaging and price. Mounted at shoulder level over my toolbench, I'm rather happy with its performance so far.  The microphones aren't as sensitive as the ones in my Echo Dot's, so I have to speak a bit louder. The on-board sound output is weak - very low-fidelity. Definitely meant for low-traffic areas, sounds like a walkie-talkie due to it's tiny speaker. The 3.5mm output drives external speakers without trouble. I'm finding that volume 10 is the line-out volume - leaving you with 100% manual volume control on the external speakers.  I'll be trying it with my old Microsoft subwoofer setup later for kicks. Overall this is a great little Alexa, but I would not purchase this in lieu of it's bigger brothers in most cases. It's sound quality and microphone aren't as good as the larger units, but this can make it perfect in some remote low-traffic areas, or maybe hallways or large closets. Add the motion detector for full coverage. The casing is hard-plastic - it has a more appliance-rugged finish - looking very much more like an ultrasonic vermin repeller than an Internet thing.","Great ""Low-Fi"" Alexa"

It does everything I need it to and is functionally no different from any other Echo device when it comes to voice commands and responsiveness.  The sound is a bit lacking, but I never considered it my primary source of audio entertainment either.  It's good enough for listening to the weather, news, or anything else not requiring premium sound.  But honestly, the sound quality is no worse than the stock radio in a 1980s K-car, if you know what that is.  The Flex performs well as an additional listening sensor for glass breakage while in Alexa Guard mode and having more sensors also expands your voice control options throughout the house.",Great way to expand the Alexa presence in your house.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Dec-19,Wills944,"To start, I have a few technical grumbles about the platform itself but I do enjoy my ""Dots"" They [1 in the Living Room, 1 in each of the 2 bedrooms] have operated reasonably well, the only technical hickup with them is the occassional device dis-association from a room group..i.e. walk into a room say ""turn on the lights"" and it responds 'Can't find a device called Lights"". So far its about once a week on one of the Dots.. The Flex's haven't had this happen and they've been unplugged and reinserted a few times.. The Flex's appear to only have 2 mic pinholes. I have had a little bit of a time finding placement for the Flex that allows it to pick up audio better. Our 2BR Apartment has laminate floors with the kitchen on one end, the combined entry/dining room acting as a echo chamber, and the carpeted living room and it's Dot at the other end. The kitchen Flex would pick up from the living room and visa versa.. Others have noted the sound ""quality"" as bad, but in all fairness it is about the same as the speaker function on a cellphone. It's not bassy like the dots, but I have played music while in the bathroom and it is not a bad/horrible experience. It is great to listen to the news while shaving/cleaning up or just waiting.. Once the shower is on though, external speakers would be required. On the positive notes.. The look of the device is demure enough that it blends in without being too ""in your face"". Hopefully skins will become available. These Flex's, Dots and Shows are great, but I hope more useful devices are in the mix. Maybe a Kitchen Device that includes a barcode scanner for maintaining a real shopping/pantry inventory, with a extension that could perhaps go over the garbage bin to scan out items. It's nice to to be able to voice add items to a list, or have a fridge that questimates usage, but a easy in/out scanner would be fantastic.. I'd also like to see the Prime Video/Music apps accept Alexa commands. I get the reasons behind branded devices, but it would be just as easy to add subroutines into the apps that intergrate commands from the platform. It would be great to have a the ability to simply have apps that can be put on devices for reading news flashes, then a simple ""Alexa show me the news on the living room TV"" through my android media box... Apps are easier to get to market on devices that are already global.. So hopefully Amazon expands the line in some real useful ways..",Good step in the right direction
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Jan-20,Branson Mom living in Chillicothe,"There are SO MANY things this little device can do.  Initially I bought them exclusively as intercoms, but because I didn't understand the correct way to use them, I rated them a 3*, now that Amazon Flex expert contacted me and spent nearly an hours educating me to the device WOW, and I mean WOW...!!!! Okay it is like an extension to your Alexa or Echo Dot, but it does things I'm not even sure they can do.  These are amazing, and now instead of 2 I'm probably going to have 2 more for downstairs. Be sure to educate yourself on the differences, they can be subtle so if like me you might miss some big pieces of info. One, you can name each differently, so when you 'drop in' (not any other way as I was doing) you can have a conversation with the persons that are at that Flex.  So yes, an intercom.  You can broadcast announcements to every device, or 'drop in' to just one. I now have so many Ring and Amazon devices my house probably should be seen from outerspace, lol.  And I am far from finished.  I want every bulb to be a smart bulb (you gotta try those, omg), I want every room to have a Flex (okay I have 16 rooms, maybe not every room), I already have a plethora of Ring cameras inside and out, but also am trying a different brand that works with Alexa too, but tons less expensive (and Ring truly is not what it use to be).

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Jan-20,Mike,"So initially I thought this would be a great addition to my garage as a smart speaker. I thought to my self it’s small, doesn’t need a cable or a desk to be displayed on (mounts directly to the  wall vía it’s plug), and it should fill the garage with some smart tech easily, only that wasn’t exactly the case. My main gripe is with the sound quality, it’s awful and basically ruined the product (Especially since it’s all about voice activated features and doesn’t have a screen). Alexa sounds hollow/awful and music sounds even worse. There is limited to no bass and the mids/highs aren’t anywhere (good) to be found either. That being said, there also aren’t enough redeeming qualities to make this a well rated product. Yes I did pay a decent price on it (Amazon had a 50% off sale around the end of 2019) and it has a built in USB port on the bottom. So then you’d think that’s cool it was cheap and there is a port (basically giving you an extra charge outlet for a phone or something) and yeah I’d agree with that thought process, then I noticed the two official add ons for the USB port (a night light and a motion sensor) are half the MSRP of the unit and honestly should have just been built in (with a better speaker). Then, and only then, would this have been a 4 star or better product but instead it’s barely a 3, more like a 2 star product if you paid full price.

I'd expect that if the volume was at a 5 or 6, but a 10 or 11? The sound quality is even a bit fuzzy despite being so quiet. I don't expect it to be as loud as a normal echo, but it's big enough they could have added better speakers. Very disappointing.",Way too quiet

I mean it’s a nice concept but the sound quality is horrible. I expected it from a small device but at least it’s nice to put in a small space. I put them in the bathroom so I can make announcements that dinner is ready or something like that. I’m planning on playing some Christmas music on it for the bathroom which I think would be nice with the decorations I have in there. Definitely wouldn’t be able to hear the music if you were in the shower tho. If you could, it would be very faint.",They’re okay but not necessary.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Feb-20,capo,"I have Echo devices of one kind or another in every room and have had others that I’ve decided to let go (original Echo and Echo Auto). They’ve all performed their smarthome duties acceptably well. My biggest complaint across the board is sound quality. Alexa always sounds like she’s talking to you from underneath a pile of pillows. Bass? Sure, on the Echo Show, at least. Treble? Nada. Sure, you can use the app’s “equalizer”... but it’d take an oscilloscope to detect the minuscule difference that makes in the sound quality. I’d given up on getting any more devices... until I saw a review of the Flex on Paul Hibbert’s YouTube channel... he liked it, but said (I think) that it sounded ‘trebly’. Trebly?! That’s a magic word to my ears. I ordered one up and found that it indeed sounds ‘trebly’ (call it tinny of you like) but who cares? Who seriously listens to music on these tiny little devices anyway?! I can understand what Alexa says now - all the plosives are there. I still wonder why Amazon can’t tune the rest of the Alexa enabled devices for better higher frequency clarity.","Treble! Hooray, I can understand Alexa now!"

This item is a disappointment with sound and volume control. While it fits in small spaces, it’s worth while to buy an Echo Dot with mounting bracket.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jan-20,Jason H.,"After writing this review and rating it 2 stars, I received a call from Amazon.  They wanted to tell me that the speaker on the Echo Flex is not meant to be the main audio source.  The intent of the design is to use Bluetooth to connect to an external speaker.  This would, of course, resolve my concern with the sound quality, so I increased the rating to 3, or okay.  But in thinking about the Flex alone, I don't think I would rate it as good or great, because it has limited appeal without additional investment. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of adding a speaker just to have this device, because I could buy a Dot instead.  However, I concede that there are niches where this functionality and price savings would be useful.  For example, after thinking about it further, I realized that I could connect it to my Bluetooth enabled treadmill and have Alexa right up front for music or any other questions I might have without having to mount an Echo Dot on the wall.  The Flex plugs in securely to a wall socket and leaves the second outlet open.  It's not heavy and doesn't sag like some two-pronged, heavy transformers do. Installing this was a simple as unpacking it and plugging it in.  It had already been integrated into my account and the WiFi login was automatic. Notifications cause the LED to blink brightly.  It's much harder to ignore it, when you already know what the notification is.  You have to ask, what's my notification, in order to clear it. The sound is like a cell phone's speakerphone, and is hard to listen to.  This device would go best in a garage or out of the house, where you might want access to announcements or activating guards, but not where you want to hear it every day.  (edit:  you are expected to connect to a Bluetooth speaker by design) Giving plenty of space in front of the device helps with communication.  Putting it in a tight space can cause echoes or chirps and clicks that interfere with it.",For someplace you won't need to listen to it every day.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Nov-20,Sandra Knight,"I have had this for a year and it works flawlessly.  I use it for alarm time setting when I am cooking, playing music, weather, getting correct time and date, movie listing, etc.  I find it play music loud enough for me.  I have it in my living room, and can hear it in bathroom, bedroom and kitchen.  Of course I live in a 1000 sq ft. apartment and the sound is very good.  When I am talking on phone, the other party on line says they can hear it very plainly so it is loud.  Don't know why the comments say its bad for hearing, must have an extra large house.  Right now its so loud that I have to have Alexa turn it down some.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Nov-19,Ella Belle,"I just got my Echo Flex - Plug-in smart speaker with Alexa this morning and I'm already totally in LOVE with it! With it I also bought that ""Made for Amazon"" THIRDREALITY Smart Night-Light for Echo Flex, and I love it too! I had been wanting to put an Echo Dot in a very tiny bathroom, but I was trying to figure out how, since I have no counter space and didn't want to use up my last outlet. Then, along comes this Echo-Flex thingy, so I decided to give it a try. I've been super delighted with it all morning long! I love how it just plugs right into an outlet and is totally out of my way but still basically does most of what the echo Dots do. I had a regular nightlight in the room that took up an outlet socket, so this new Smart Nigh-Light was a great solution because it plugs right into the bottom of the Echo Flex, so just the Echo-Flex is using that 1 outlet now. It's so cool too because I can ask Alexa to change the lights colors! I've bought 4 of the Echo Dots for my home and I am in love with all of them. This Echo-Flex is just a smaller version that is so perfect for small bathrooms, laundry rooms and basically anywhere else where you just don't have counter or table space for an Echo Dot. I also love how easy it is to set these devices up! Just be sure the little box below the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Buy Now"" buttons is checked ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup""! It really does simplify the set-up wonderfully! Anyway, I am totally loving this new Echo-Flex so much and I already have ideas of getting some more of them for other tiny places around my home that I had not considered before. These things are just so helpful AND so fun! UPDATE 08/16/2020: I've now bought 4 of these echo Flexes with the nightlights. One for the laundry room, one for my Kitchen and 2 for my small bathrooms. I use these every day and they have become indispensable!  Sure, the sound is not super great for music, but the fact that these are not stealing any counter space is paramount for me. I have other Echo's in other rooms for music anyway. I love these things! UPDATE 10/13/2020: I am STILL in love with these cool little Echo Flex gadgets!  I use them many times daily! A great size for small rooms like Bathrooms, laundry rooms, store rooms, mud rooms, garage, even out in our woodshed! I happily got more today on Prime Day!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Dec-19,Mr Huskey,"It is very bulky robbing room from other items you might want to plug in.  The speaker quality sucks.  No where near as good as the Echo plus speaker.  Playing music on the Flex's built in speaker sounds like listening to an old transistor pocket radio.  It does pair easily to my blue tooth speakers which sound really good. Motion detection works, but is almost useless until the Amazon Alexa app matures a bit more.  Settings in the app are too cumbersome to want to use at the moment.  Controlling a light seems easy enough, but I wanted it to turn on a Wyze switched outlet.  I had to create a new group... assign the Wyze switch to it... create a routine to turn on the group.  There was no skill that let me just turn on/off the switch without creating the group first.  Seemed like way more hassle than it should have been. The night light seems nice, but I haven't spent much time playing with it yet.  I just picked the first color that was bright enough to fill the room.  Too bad you can't have motion sensing and the night light in one module.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-19,D. Coral,"I set up this cute little Echo Flex + Motion Sensor in the garage.  It was easy to add Routines in the Alexa app to turn On and Off the WeMo light switch for the garage light.  I had this automation ready to go in about 5 minutes.  It’s real nice to have the garage light come on automatically whenever I open the garage door.  I also set it to turn off the light after no motion is detected for 1 hour (choose any time period). You can also have the motion sensor activate an Echo device to speak a custom phrase, give a news flash briefing, traffic report, play music, etc. There is a setting to specify the time when the motion sensor should perform the Routine (anytime, or between a certain time period) and to suppress a repeat of the Routine for a configurable time period so it won’t keep doing the same thing every time there is motion, if you don’t want it to.  For example you can have it give you the traffic report or news briefing when you enter the bathroom in the morning but only if the motion happens between 6-8am. This is super useful — after trying out the first one, I’m going to buy a few more to play with around the house.",Motion Sensor is Handy!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-19,Spyder2014,"If you are looking for a quality speaker to listen to music while you are in the bathroom or kitchen... pay a little extra and get an echo dot. The flex is perfect if you want to add another echo device for the sake of controlling smart home devices, taking advantage of the guardian functionality or for the occasional drop in. You also get the added functionality of either a motion sensor or night light with the available accessories. We replaced our bathroom night light with the flex and it is great! The light accessory gives off more light than our old night light and my wife loves the different colors you can choose due to the built in rgb LEDs. I tested the drop in feature as well and it was loud and clear while talking to my wife in the next room.

I have a Fire TV, first generation Echo, Fire Tablet, Echo Show 5, and several smart plugs. I wanted an Alexa-enabled device in my bedroom to do the ""basics"" ... respond to my voice commands ... and to turn the smart plugs on my bedroom lamps on and off. So I got an Echo Flex. I set it up in less than a minute, and soon it was turning my lamps on and off, telling me the time, answering my silly questions and telling me jokes! People, this is how technology should work. The world would be a much techno-friendly place if all technology was this easy to set up. I didn't get this for the sound quality of an Echo or for the screen time of an Echo Show. If I had wanted those features in my bedroom, I would have spent more more money to get them. I can never figure out why people buy an entry level product here on Amazon that does ""the basics"" and then give it a bad review when it doesn't do everything the ""cadillac version"" does. Sheesh. What I love about this product: --It's a great price. --It does what it's intended to do. --It can be enhanced with a bluetooth speaker, a nightlight or a motion detector. --It's out of the way. --It only takes up one outlet. The other one is still available for use. --You can plug in a USB device to it, like a smartphone, to charge it. What I dislike about this product: --Nothing. Because it does what I bought it to do.

The motion sensor I have come to like now that I have adapted to it and they have seemed to iron out some of the problems. My main problem now is they limited the use of it because they are only allowing you to own two of these with the motion sensor per Amazon account unless you have a business account. No other explanation besides they tried to get me to sign up for an Amazon business account. I have one in my bathroom and wanted to put two in my kitchen are because there are two entrances and I wanted to make my lights fully motion-controlled in my kitchen.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Jan-20,thornhillatthemovies.com,"I'm not thrilled with the Echo Flex. I have an Echo and love that, I have a bunch of plugs connected to it, and control the lights throughout our small apartment with it. I have had some difficulty getting other smart plugs to communicate and connect with Alexa and our Echo. So, when I saw the Echo Flex on Amazon, I initially thought it was a smart plug with Alexa built in. It isn't. And that's my mistake. Our apartment is very small, so I plugged the Echo Flex into the wall (it really looks like a multi-plug you plug into a regular outlet) and connected it. A few days before, I got a wall clock made by Citizen and connected it to the Echo. With the Echo Flex plugged in, and connected, all of the voice recognition was going through the Flex and the Smart Clock no longer did the countdown with a timer, as it did with the Echo. I unplugged the Echo Flex. The smart clock worked fine. I think if you have a bigger house and more rooms to cover, using the Echo Flex is a good way to get more coverage. But in our small apartment, it isn't necessary. I can control the Echo in our living room, from our bedroom. When the Echo Flex was plugged in, it seemed to recognize my voice well. But the speaker on it reminds me of playing something through a small speaker on a cheap cassette player. Remember those? It is hollow and tinny and would not be a good vehicle for music or other audio. If Amazon could come up with a smart plug directly tied into the Alexa range, I would buy that.",Possibly Good For Some Situations... But There Are Problems
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Nov-20,Lenny,"I have this in my garage, where it's more useful than I expected. I originally got this so that I can turn on the garage light when I come in from the side door (the light switch is at the other side of the garage, near the kitchen entrance). I set up an Alexa routine so that it will turn on the light for a minute, giving me enough time to walk to the other end of the garage to enter the house without tripping over things, before turning itself off. So far that has worked very well. The USB port also turned out to be more useful than I expected. With so many things that recharge from USB these days, such as my bicycle headlights, it's nice to have another charger in the garage. I measured the charging current at 1.6A, I'm not sure if that's the maximum current, or just how much my light draws when recharging, but it is more than I expected. Finally, having it as a plug in form factor saves me the hassle and expense of getting a separate mount for it. Downsides, the speaker is not as good. It specifically says it's not suitable for playing music, but within a few days of using this, Alexa said that I haven't asked it to play music and if I would like to do so. I guess someone didn't program it properly. Finally, the microphone isn't as good as the other Echo devices I have. Even the 1st generation Echo Dot does a better job of recognizing my commands when there's extra noise in the background.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Apr-20,Discriminating Buyer,"I've been putting in echo dots and shows around the house, really to be used as an intercom/announcement system and for control of some smart items.  My parents are elderly and my Mom had a stroke a few years ago so I prefer to have some sort of communication system around that is voice activated (as long as they can speak) in an emergency.  It's also proved handy for them to control lights, view some cctv cams, fans, the air conditioning, etc. I bought the flex used based on the poor reviews that it got, I figured that if they didn't work at least I wasn't out the cost of a new one.  I wanted these for areas where I don't have dots.  Setup was probably easier than any other Echo device I've had.  It apparently uses bluetooth so that has to be turned on on the phone.  I did a test speaking close into the dot and it transmitted to all the other echo devices.  The sound from it isn't that bad, I was expecting some really tinny sound but Alexa sounds much the same as on the other devices.  I haven't tried music on it to see how that sounds but I did make Alexa sing the 20 second wash your hands song and it sounded okay. UPDATE I tried music on it and while it wasn't terrific it wasn't all that bad.

I need to be within a few feet to hear it at all and ideally within a few inches to understand.  I have an echo plus and a couple of dots and have them about halfway because they can be loud.  The flex at full is way too quiet, would never buy another and wouldn't recommend for that reason.  That being said, I really only need it if I fall down the steps and need to call for help.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Nov-20,Clayton M.,"I bought this for my mother, who has been looking for a nightlight for her bathroom. Paired with the ThirdReality smart night-light accessory , this lovely little Alexa device gives you peace of mind in areas you can't easily place one of the larger Echo devices with a surprisingly bright adjustable LED lamp. The pictures I've attached show the night-light using the sensor mode - it's off when the lights are on, and turns on when the room gets dark. You can see also that it shows as a controllable light in the Alexa app. There are several colors to pick from and a slider to set brightness; I have it set to 2% here because the bathroom is connected to a bedroom - the light can definitely be much brighter if you want that. === PROS === - Small form factor doesn't take up space. - Plug on the bottom lets you mix and match accessories (night-light, motion sensor, etc). - If you don't want an accessory, use the bottom plug to charge your phone! - Works great with mid-wall plugs like those you find in bathrooms (near the counter) or kitchens (by the sink). - Use a 3.5mm cable or Bluetooth to connect a dedicated speaker for playing music. === CONS === - Audio quality is ok, not meant for music playback using the built-in speaker.

But, besides that, I like having an echo in the bathroom so I know what time it is, so I can listen to music or my morning routine, check the weather, all without having to go into the bedroom or living room.  I know, first world problems, but it works for me. I just answered a question about if you can use the Flex to make phone calls.  Yes, you can.  It's not a Bose speaker quality, but, I have to say, it's actually better than my phone sometimes is. So, I can chat on the phone when I'm getting ready, too.  Nice. I really like that it's so small and plugs right into the wall outlet.  It doesn't take up much space, and especially in the bathroom where counter space is at a premium, it's great that it can live on the wall and not the counter.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jul-20,"A fan from Meriden, CT","Its has been a while since I wrote an Amazon Review, but I felt I had to for this. It is a WONDERFUL Product ! I already had a 1st Gen Echo Dot that is setup in my living room. And after some early trepidations, everyone in my family uses it. I got a smart light to go along with it & that is great as well. So when I recently got a couple more smart lights to set up in my Office, I needed another echo to control that. And that's why I got the Flex. My office is in the basement so using the Echo in the living room to control the lights isn't ideal. All I needed was something small, so the flex is a perfect fit. I just tucked it into a corner by my stereo receiver and plugged it into a short extension cord. Bingo ! Now I have full Alexa capability downstairs. I use it to turn on the lights (I added a smart plug to my desk lamp as well) when I come downstairs to start my day & it can hear me easily from across the room. And while the sound of the on-board speaker isn't great, I plugged it into the Audio Input on my stereo & now it sounds FABULOUS. What else do I need, ? And at only HALF the price of a Dot (and a quarter of the price of a full size Echo) why WOULDN'T you get one ? Thanks for making this, Amazon - it's perfect ! UPDATE: Make that slightly LESS than perfect. Please be aware this may not be the Echo's fault ... BUT I have had to redo the WiFi connection on it TWICE since setting it up. I thought rthat maybe it was an issue witth My Amazon Connectivity in General, but I verified that the Dot in the Living room & my App both work fine - its just the Flex. And its not because the Flex is farther away, its MUCH Closer, The Router is literally NEXT TO where the Flex is installed. And there are no sources of interference nearby that I am aware of. The only thing I can think of is my son does have a WiFi extender set up in the living room, and MAYBE the Flex is confused about which network to use. I know that both times I( redid the WiFi I had to use the SECOND lusting for my house since the first said the Password was incorrect. Anyway, other than that, I've had no issues.

I've read the reviews others have posted, both positive and negative, and I haven't experienced the negative.  It is true that the tiny speaker is not music quality, but when you come right down to it, neither are any of Echo devices except for the largest devices.  It's a speaker about the size of my smallest fingernail, who in their right mind considers that capable of music quality? OTOH, I've found the speaker to be loud, and clear; and the microphone quite capable of picking up my voice anywhere in my kitchen (roughly 12x25 feet opening onto a semi-open great room.  Lots of space for sound to dissipate).  I suspect placement is key with this tiny device, but I've found that to be true with any of the Echo devices for premium performance. Set up was easy, and it went into setup mode as soon as it was plugged in.  In my mind, except for music, this functions as well as the Echo Dot. UPDATE:  I moved my office to a different location just off the family room.  My office is in a room with 2 open doors and is separated by about 40 feet from the first open door.  this Echo flex picks up my voice fine with the doors open.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,Drumlord29,"I added another echo device to my collection! I've got every single kind of echo in the market. For obvious reasons, the speaker isn't the best. It is surprisingly smaller than I thought. I use it in my garage for when I close the garage using Alexa. I have the MyQ garage opener which i can open or close with my echo auto in my car. But after I turn off my engine, so does my echo auto. So I have to pull out my phone or manually push the garage opener on the wall. So I plugged it underneath my garage door opener so I can tell Alexa to close or open the garage door from anywhere in my garage without my phone or pushing a button. I don't really intend to use this for playing music. It's really for doing simple Alexa tasks in my garage. It is an echo device that is not meant to look and sound pretty. It's Alexa at its most basic form. Small, no cables, small speaker, and works like any echo device. I believe it's meant for a garage bathroom or hallway if uppity have the night light or motion detector accessory. If you want to play music with it, a bluetooth or wired speaker is highly recommended. Although I had very little expectations with this being that I meant to use it to just open and close my garage, I did notice one negative thing on it. I tried adjusting thre volume from the Alexa app but it switches back to 70% everytime. No idea why. Perhaps there built in speaker is best heard at 70% and if connected to a better speaker, it will allow for a louder volume. I'm going yo have to try that someday. But for now, it's perfect for what I wanted to use it for. If you know what you need it for, don't expect it to be more than that. If you want a better sound, get a dot or something bigger. For simple uses, this will do fine for all your Alexa needs. I may use it for my echo microwave which is currently paired with my echo input connected to a speaker. Don't blame the equipment if you want it to do more than what the hardware can achieve. Be fair to the gadget on what it is capable of doing.","Small, not for music, great for basic Alexa"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-20,TexasDude,This shouldn’t be an issue but it actually is and is why I took away a star. These pick up voice and respond much faster than my normal echos and echo dots (latest generations). This is a problem because I bought these for the times when I’m not really close enough to the main echos and wanted to not have to yell (What I call “filler” echos). BUT when I’m trying to talk to a closer Regular echo these pick me up too fast and from far away so they sometimes get what I’m saying wrong or they are not the specific device I was trying to control (for like music etc) USB port is pretty sweet. I have one in my bathroom that I use for a phone charge. One in the hallway that I have the motion hooked up to. And one in another hallway with the light on it for a night light and notification light. The accessory attachments respond quite fast and consistently. People comment on music sounding bad... well duh! The product specifically says these are not meant for music. I’ve actually found them useful in hallways when I have multi room music going and then the flex has low volume for vocals while passing through hallways to the next room. It’s quite pleasant.,It’s actually a problem that these can hear and respond better than normal echos
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Dec-19,BD,"I love the idea of the echo flex! We have Sonos throughout our house, and don't need to play music on our echo devices. So the echo dot has worked very nicely. However it was bulky and unattractive plugged in to the walls. The flex seemed like the perfect solution, so I bought one... and was disappointed. The size was great! Exactly what I thought it would be. But then I tried using it... It is very quiet! I have 4 small children at home and so there's always some noise happening... This echo would not work well in any kind of main room in my house because of how quiet it is. So, I moved it to the baby's room, but was still disappointed... I can be sitting right next to it and it won't wake to Alexa... I'll have to repeat to get it to respond.

It’s a small speaker, and thus won’t provide anything but minimal sound, nor is it designed to. Understand this beforehand and you won’t be disappointed like so many others who didn’t think through what it was designed for. If you need great sound/music quality, then other Echos are designed for that. So far, the Alexa app hasn’t been able to see/recognize/connect to the Flex, no matter what I do. I’ll box it up and wait a couple of months for an update to fix this issue.

I lked it for the motion thing but just going to get a regular dot for the garage. I have this in my garage and works perfectly when I'm working there and want to turn on lights I have connected to a smart plug. Also if I want to know the weather or if I have a question in general works great. I can play music on it but it's not great for sound, but I don't think that was the intent for this. If your buying it for higher quality sound get a Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa. Or pair it up with a Bluetooth speaker or use the 3.5 mm audio jack and hook it to your stereo. I did the drop in with an echo dot in the house and it worked great. I could hear them clearly and they could hear me, which is nice if someone needs me they can drop in on the garage. I also have a camera in the garage so I can also see and now talk to whoever is there. Overall I'm happy with it.

It does everything a regular Echo or Echo Dot can do. and It's actually smaller than I expected. Only occupies the lower plug without blocking the top one. Great for kitchen and bathroom, or anywhere that has above-counter-level plugs. Produces enough sound that I can hear it while in the shower, but, the speaker quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't expecting top-notch, Bose-quality sound from this small of a device, but Alexa sounds like she's talking to me through a Solo cup.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jan-20,KT - Six Eight Tall,"We are here to pump up this review! Amazon Flex? More like Amazon Flabby... Ya! This device is so puny that it must go back to the gym to earn it's name! Here is our loser friend to explain why such a flabby device can only lift one star.... <clears throat> Mmmm k. As avid Amazon smart product users, we purchased the Flex based on it's small design form (in that it would occupy the least amount of space and be a perfect kitchen addition to keep our counters open). On this front it is perfect. Speaking in the kitchen, the Echo Dot Second Generation in our living room was actually picking up our voices better than the Flex which was in the same room. To Echo* what other reviewers have said, the sound on this device is tinny and distracting. Considering most smart phones can generate, the small footprint of the Flex isn't a great excuse in 2020 for skimping on sound to this extent. With commands and recipes is was displeasing but with music it was downright distracting. Imagine an old building doorway intercom speaker as an upgrade to this and you get what I mean. I'm guessing the positive reviews are mainly concerned with the small footprint which again, is excellent but even at a discount we had to return this and the accompanying motion sensor in favor of mounting another Echo speaker in our kitchen. Here's hoping Amazon invests just a tiny bit more on the quality of the speaker and microphone array though for future generations of this product because this first gen Flex was an absolute miss for our household. * puns provided free of charge for this unbiased loser review",Did someone say Flex?

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Dec-19,Nobody777,"What can I say?  It's an Echo device.  It does the job perfectly and I love it...  This is probably one of the easiest Echo devices to setup.  I also like its small form factor and I am currently using it in my garage to control lights and the garage door, and to drop in to chat with my wife in the house on occasion.  The device works flawlessly and I am happy with my purchase and certainly can recommend this device. My only real complaint is with the sound level...  There are no volume controls, just a default setting, which is not very loud.  It's functional and if you're standing close enough in proximity, you can hear it and it gets the job done, but I do wish it was louder.  I never expected this device to be great for anything other than basic Echo functions (which is why I bought it - to control smart devices in the garage), so I wasn't expecting great audio quality...  That having been said, a little bit more volume would have been appreciated.  For that, and that only, I have to knock off a star and give it only one star for volume control because there isn't any.  Sound quality is okay.  I can hear Alexa speaking clearly and she responds perfectly, so the two microphones work well, but since the volume is so quiet, I have to knock off a couple of stars for sound quality.  For the device to be adequately functional, it does need audio... even if it's crappy audio, it should be louder than it is. The one saving grace here is that you can plug in an external speaker (and I presume Bluetooth connections work also) so it's not a total loss here.  There are alternative options that can make the slight negatives here seem unimportant.  I have a decent Bluetooth speaker I use for music when out in the garage, so I'll just pair it up and problem solved. All-in-all, great little device that fits the budget, sets up easily, has a small form factor, and does the job.  Hard to complain about that.","Performs well, setup is easy, good price.

A small little ""Alexa"" to put in the kitchen, so that my Wife doesn't have to yell at the ""Alexa"" in the living room. I was super excited when this went on sale for $15, so I ordered one. I plugged it in, configured it and figured I was good to go. On first use, I could BARELY hear it. I though... ohhh, the volume must be all the way down. Well.... looking at the app, it was at 70%. So I turned it up to 100%. It really didn't get that much better. I mean, it's a small device, so I wasn't expecting booming sound... but the room has to be completely silent in order to hear it. My phone has a tiny little speaker and it's way louder and clearer than the Flex. In a last ditch effort, we hooked up a bluetooth speaker to it and had to power it off the USB. Having that wire and the speaker sitting next to it completely defeats the purpose of it's small form factor. I might as well just have gotten a dot.",The sound quality is horrible.

Pros - very much convenient to pull and put into any outlets. Look and shape is perfect. Cons - you will be lucky if you get it work, the first 3 months it was ok without any connection issues, at the same time the sound quality is the first Marconi Radio, so good enough for commands - Alexa turn on a light.

Finally they refunded me $20.00 but they are not in a mood to understand the root cause, I have been using Echo since the first version came in 2015 and that works perfectly. I have 6 different models of Echo including the auto. I also have request them that if they can downgrade the software so it works, but they were not willing to listen.  I'm trying to get a mesh wifi, may be that can improve the signal as they were asking me to reset all the time.

It is definitely the easiest-to-install Echo device in my network, which includes the original Echo, several Dots, and a host of Alexa-enabled devices. The only difficulty I have encountered is that the Flex's microphone seems more sensitive than the other Echo devices', and sometimes it responds to commands intended for a device in another space. Of course, this is not a serious problem, just an observation. I am very, very happy with the Flex, and I plan to obtain another.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Jan-20,Kitchen Mouse,"We have too many Echo devices, by some folks’ standards — a Spot in two bedrooms, a Dot in another bedroom and a Dot in the garage, and a Show.  The show was originally in the kitchen. It was used to check calendars, add to shopping and to-dos etc.  I found the allrecipes skill to be useless, which is why I bought it initially. So I replaced it with the Flex. I was immediately dismayed by how frequently it did not respond and misunderstood me. None of the others have this difficulty. So I put the Show back in the kitchen and moved the Flex to my living room and plugged in a long Apple-compatible charging cable. That turned out to be a great idea because I can charge and use my iPad in the morning as I plow through email and read the e-edition of my local paper. I do use it to turn on my TV, but it doesn’t hear clearly enough to do much else, especially with background noise. I had to cover the mic on my hallway-located Ecobee because when ever I talk to any of my Echo devices, the Ecobee would butt in.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Nov-20,B.

I just got this tiny echo device yesterday, and am very impressed! i was concerned about connectivity because of my previous nest experience. but so far after unplugging it several times and left off over night, it reconnects all on it's own. good start! i was able to connect it to my amazon music, pandora, and i heart music accounts with very little effort. I haven't tried to connect a bluetooth speaker yet, but it seems to not be that difficult. the device is very responsive, alexa surprised me with some lil bits of humor and side comments/conversations and politeness (spooky).  she walked me thru the music app connections, and made helpful suggestions. the google nest never did any of this. the size of this device is really small (2 decks of cards?). so keep in mind, if you plan on using it for listening to really good music, get a really good speaker to go with it. or, connect it to your stereo system. on it's own, the sound is very much like a transistor radio, and probably will not be good in a large room. which is fine if you just need basics. i've been able to listen to music fine without an additional speaker while taking a shower, and Alexa can hear me fine as well. since i can't give half stars (amazon, please fix that), i gave it 4 stars (4.5 stars) because i'd like a male voice called Alex. Also, it seems it will not connect with my google smart tv. i'll assume that's because google is competition. over all, i like it a lot. so much, i bought another the next day - 1 for the bathroom, and one for the bedroom. well worth the $9.99. buy a bunch and give them away as stocking stuffers at that price. enjoy!","Alexa, help me write this review!"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Aug-20,Gary Fisher,"I now own two of these incredibly useful Echo / Alexa Flex devices, and will likely add more in the future. Requiring no cable, no adapter, and no hanger, the Flex simply plugs into any available AC outlet and begins to work. Setup, if you don't receive it pre-paired to your Amazon account, is accomplished just as with other Echo devices. The Privacy and Action buttons on the front panel function like those on other Echoes, and the Flex will respond to all the usual Echo commands. While the speaker is far from Hi-Fi quality, it's perfectly adequate for the spoken word and can give you the news, weather, time, notifications, etc. perfectly well, and at least AM Radio-quality music. The Flex can control lights, appliances, etc. by voice command exactly like other Echoes. On the bottom of the Flex you'll find a full-size USB socket. While handy for charging a phone, etc., this connector is particularly intended to be used with Echo Flex accessories, of which there are currently two, a ""night light"" and a motion sensor. I own neither of these at this time, but Amazon's information indicates the motion sensor could be used, for example, to initiate a ""welcome"" sequence when someone walks by, or to turn on lights or perform other functions when it senses motion, without impacting other Alexa functions. The ""night light"" can be remotely set to an of a variety of colors, perhaps for aesthetics or possibly as a color-coded warning or alert scheme. Once again, the accessories are not required, and so far I haven't justified a need for them. But I'm working on it. 😉 I own a fairly large number of Echo devices, most of which could be used interchangeably.

While this will NOT call 911 for you, I can ask it to call my son or daughter if I'm home alone and fall.  Problem is the sound quality.  The outlet is on a far wall, so while it does recognize my voice nicely, I can't hear the response very well as the speaker is very poor for an older person or if there is any other noise.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Sep-20,Nicholas H,"I bought the Flex for my kitchen and I'm very disappointed with it. So straight to the point... 1) Terrible microphone. Unless you're in a quiet room, the device has a lot of trouble understanding me. I have to repeat my commands slower and more loudly, but when I do that, the echo dot in my bedroom upstairs and down the hall responds to me instead. It's basically impossible to use when other people are speaking in the same room. I have to ask everyone to be quiet while I ask Alexa a question. It has come to the point where it's almost a joke if she actually hears me correctly. I don't have this problem with the echo dot. 2) Similarly, unless you're in a quiet room, you can barely hear the response--not just because of its very low max volume, but because the sound quality is terrible--something like a typical kids talking doll toy. 3) This goes for all echo's, getting a Bluetooth speaker connected is painful to say the least. The device name usually doesn't show up so you're guessing at which is the correct device when only the device code is displayed. It also does not reconnect to the Bluetooth speaker automatically and cannot reconnect to a previously connected device through voice command. The idea of telling Alexa to ""play music on my Bluetooth speaker"" is just a fantasy. You'll have to go through the Alexa app and reconnect manually each time--by which time, you might as well just stream your music from your phone to your Bluetooth speaker instead. 4) When connected to Bluetooth, the volume changes back to level 5 constantly, so you have to keep asking Alexa to go back to volume 10. At level 5, it's barely audible so you might not realize it's connected unless the room is dead silent. Overall, the Flex is virtually useless because it simply doesn't understand me or I can't understand it most of the time (and I mean really MOST of the time) whereas I have no issues with my Dot devices which can understand me in a crowded room even with music playing. In my opinion, the Echo Flex might only be a reasonable solution for a small bathroom although I'd warn you about it still getting your questions wrong if you have the faucet or shower running. Otherwise, I highly recommend getting the Dot instead.",Nearly useless unless you're in a very quiet room

We use in the kitchen to assist in cooking.  Controlling lights etc is a  breeze along with setting the ""Guard"" feature when leaving home. Having the add on devices is a big plus to expand it's capabilities. What should be added is a way to utilize both the motion detector and nightlight at the same time by plugging the nightlight into the motion detector. It is going to be an interesting expansion capability if more add on devices are developed. I am already considering a few more to cover the basement, among other places.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Aug-20,🥇Customer,"I purchased an Echo Flex plus the companion smart night light to replace what I had in a small bathroom and free up a socket.  In the bathroom I had an Echo Dot 3rd gen in an outlet hanger, plus I had a nightlight plugged into an Amazon Smart Plug.  So, both electrical sockets were used and there was a lot of hardware hanging off the electrical outlet (see pics).  The Flex is perfect for my needs.  It’s much more compact even with the night light (smaller is good, Amazon!) and the second outlet is wide open. Comparison: —Sound:  The Flex sound (both quality and volume) is not as good as the Dot’s.  To me, it’s good enough in order to have a more compact dual device.  Plus my Dot’s sound quality was partially muffled by the prongs on the outlet hanger.  I have Dots in most of the bedrooms and would not replace them with a Flex.  But for the bathroom, the Flex is good. —Light:  The Flex night light is not as bright as the one I had.  Both lights allegedly have 6 LED chips, but my old one is definitely way brighter.  However, the Flex light can be dimmed and turned a few different colors.  There are people around here who like asking Alexa to change the color. —Heat:  The Flex definitely runs very warm just sitting in the socket. —Alexa:  Her pickup of your commands is slow.  You need to be facing her for her to pick you up.  If you speak to her from the side, you may have to raise your voice for her to recognize that you’re speaking to her.  I suppose the acoustics of the room play a role, but that is not an issue when using other Echo devices.  In addition, there seems to be a lag in responsiveness.  For instance, if a song is playing and you ask her to stop playing, sometimes the song continues playing a few seconds as it fades out, or it plays in the background as Alexa is answering a question.  I don’t notice that phenomenon on my other Echo devices. —Looks:  It’s not the most attractive looking device.  Though it looks a lot better than what was there. —Set-up:  Fairly easy.  In my case, I used a Fire tablet for the set-up.  Since my router has MAC filtering enabled, once the Flex showed in the Alexa app list of devices, I got the Flex MAC address and went to my PC to add it to my router settings.  Then, on my Fire tablet, I had to switch to the temporary Amazon WiFi for the set-up.  Good to go from there.",This is a great device for where being compact counts

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Oct-20,Jamie Lee Sanders,"I got one of these to put in the outlet outside of my bathroom to activate the lights on the way in because the switch is in a very impractical place. You have to go all the way inside the bathroom and shut the door to reach it which ranges from mildly annoying in the daytime to very frustrating at night when it's too dark for that sort of nonsense. Alexa Flex could not hear us at least half the time. We'd walk into a dark bathroom, step back and tell her again, walk into dark bathroom again, then go back and lean down to yell at her to turn on the bathroom lights and she still didn't do it every time. Luckily, I already have two dots or I wouldn't have had any faith at all in alexa. I put a dot in the living room about ten feet further away from the bathroom than the flex is, and when we tell the flex to turn on the bathroom lights, the dot actually picks it up and gets the light instead. I finally moved the flex to the kitchen where I had the dot and it seems to do a little better since it's now closer to our face instead of by the floor. I bought her to get the bathroom lights but now she gets the kitchen and entrance lights. I would only recommend the flex if it's truly going to be in a small space where it will be sure to hear you.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Oct-20,avgcustomer,"This is a convenient device to have, it brings Alexa to more areas in the home. I got it with the nightlight attachment which is great because I have it set to turn on and off automatically at my bathroom sink. My issue is not with the tinny sound through the speakers because I don't really use it to listen to audio, the problem is that the lower quality seems to have carried over to the microphones as well. I frequently have issues with the Echo Flex understanding the commands I'm giving it, and I'm constantly having to tell Alexa to cancel or outright ripping it out of the socket while she's going through the incorrect script. It's especially worse at night when I'm repeatedly having to re-issue commands to turn on my bathroom lights at a dimmed setting and she's initializing burglary detection or looking for a nearby restaurant. I've resorted to carrying my smartphone with me more often so I can just issue commands through the Alexa app. This is in contrast to the Echo Dot which I rarely have issues giving commands to, it has twice as many speakers (4 vs 2 in the Flex) and it sounds better so I'm assuming the microphones must be better to. Do I recommend that you purchase an Echo Flex? Possibly if you need it to use Alexa infrequently in an odd location, but for something as frequent as controlling your bathroom lighting you might want to opt for something with better voice recognition.",Too much compromise on quality
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Apr-20,Eric McCann,"I picked two of these up to mess around with, one with the night light attachment. These were pre-set by Amazon before delivery, so I can't speak to how easy or hard they are to set up - from experience this tends to be quick and painless, though. Brief review on the night light attachment - it's slick and integrates well, and seems to be secure. You can tweak the light color, and yes, it detects low light just fine. It does what it is supposed to and looks like part of the Echo Flex. I see reviews with people complaining about the sound from the speaker. If you're expecting awesome sound from a tiny little speaker, be realistic - this is fine for telling you what the weather's like if you ask, or if you see a notification or other basic information. Playing music... maybe if you want to recreate the early days of radio. It does not do most music justice on its own - but I'm not knocking it for that because (a) that's not what I bought it for and (b) it would be ridiculous to expect it to. If you want to put this somewhere and play music, it *can* pair with a bluetooth speaker (and does come with a speaker out.) Use those, or look into something like an Echo Dot. I am being realistic with the sound quality rating at three stars, though. Fine for notifications or voice. Awful for music. This does take up one of your plugs. It's low enough the other is free (assuming, obviously, you put it on the lower outlet.) This is one thing I'd like to see adjusted - having an outlet passthrough would be nice, though not strictly needed. Perhaps even turning it into a smartplug as well. I'd like to see more accessories for this. The only ones I can see are the night light and motion sensor. Something as simple as a clock to hang off the bottom. A speaker, for those wanting something slightly better without a second device (or someplace to mount a dot.) Maybe a small camera for helping do things like baby monitoring. I think there's potential in this device that's not being used.","Works for what it's designed for, could use a tweak or two."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,TnT,"Only been using it for a few days but so far it's been working great for my application, I'm extremely happy with the product!  In my house I have a central audio system that has built in speakers in the ceiling of all the rooms which is hardwired to a single Echo Dot. So adding these Flex units to rooms that are out of earshot of the main Echo Dot, for example the garage or upstairs bathroom, it's something like adding additional microphones.  I can speak a command and everything plays normal out of the central system as if I'm speaking to the main Echo Dot. People that are complaining about the internal speaker sounding lousy, it says in the description over and over these aren't intended alone for music. After set up the internal speaker is not really used. It will give acknowledgement tones from it but everything else plays to the ""preferred speaker""  which you designate within the Alexa app. Adding additional Echo dots with probably accomplish the same thing but this does it in a super compact clean simple plug in module with no loose wires. I haven't tried the motion or the night light optional devices for this but I plan to pick them up","It's like adding ""extra ears"" to Alexa 👍"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Dec-19,RoboTech,"First off, the product description SPECIFICALLY STATES that it is not made for music. It is NOT a replacement for an Echo Dot as far as sound quality goes. I am not going to due the product a disservice by giving it a 1-star rating for that reason alone, like other have. I also own several Dot's attached to wall mounts. They are in areas that are clean and dust free, whereas the Flex can be hooked up in a dusty garage or shed without worrying about the speaker cloth getting torn, dirty or moldy. The Flex can be just wiped off with a damp cloth. Even with the Dots on sale, the total cost with a good wall mount is at least $35. The Flex is replacing my Echo Inputs and a couple of my Dots. No cords or mounting worries and about the same price as the Input. I bought the Flex to use in the garage connected to a stereo system and also in a hallway with the night light plug-in. The Flex is the perfect solution and a lot cheaper than a Dot w/wall mount configuration in tight spots where you are not going to use the internal speaker anyhow. Plus, the added benefit of a USB port on the bottom to charge your phone, plug in a night light, or to power a set of USB speakers. As for the microphones, I am not sure why people are reporting that the microphones don't work well. All (3) of my Flex pick up my voice just fine from across the room. Just because the Flex has only 2 microphones, doesn't mean as much as you'd think. The DOT is usually mounted flat on a table and needs all 6 mics to pick up your voice from all angles. The FLEX on the other hand, is plugged into a wall and only has to pick up your voice from a much narrower angle. I have found that the microphones on the DOT can get ""confused"" when mounted vertically on the wall. The blue ring on the Dot that lights up when activated, has a brighter spot on the ring that corresponds with the direction of your voice. Sometimes you will see the ring on the Dot ""spinning"" as it picks up your voice bouncing all over the place. The 2 mics on the Flex are better suited for wall mounting. More is not always better. Realistically, nothing is perfect and sure, they could have put a bigger speaker in it. A larger speaker most certainly would have increased the price and made it physically larger. People would then be complaining about that. For me, I am glad is has a speaker for audible Alexa responses at least. In summary, the Flex is not perfect, but for specific purposes and for the price it can't be beat as long as you are not expecting to use it for music (or in a noisy environment) using the built in speaker.",Perfect solution for using in a tight space connected to another speaker system.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Apr-20,Jerry,"I purchased this Echo Flex for a problem area in my house.  I have a staircase leading upstairs to a hallway between the bedrooms.  I have smart bulbs throughout my house including the hallway/staircase.  The problem: If I needed to go in the hall/staircase, I would have to remember to tell Alexa to turn on the light before I entered, or it would be me yelling to Alexa to “turn on the hall light”.  Half the time, she did not hear or understand me as I don’t believe Echo Dots were designed to respond well to yelling from a distance. With the Echo Flex, I simply plugged it into an existing hall power socket after setup.  I now can control the hall/stairway lights in my normal voice.  No more yelling! Some features I like: • Flex costs less than a Dot.  Yes, Flex does not have as good of a speaker, or microphone as a Dot, but I don’t need a great speaker where I have it located and the microphone that is in the Flex works great in the hall/staircase. • Flex is built to hang from a wall socket.  I don’t need a table, nor do I need to buy a hook to hang it from the socket. • Flex does everything voice-wise that my echo Dots do, it can control my smart lights, my smart thermostat, any smart devices I have hooked to my Dots, I cam make and receive announcements, etc.  It is simply a scaled down version of the Dot. If you already own Echoes and/or Dots, Cubes, etc and need better voice coverage in a somewhat enclosed area of your home, the Echo Flex is the perfect add-on.  It appears that this situation is exactly what Flex was designed for.  I give the Echo Flex a very firm 5 stars!",Perfect for enclosed problem areas of the home.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Jan-20,En Yu,"I only started using devices like echo dot or Alexa recently. It started 2018 Black Friday echo sale I believe. Only started using it properly spring 2019. I began to realize how helpful it can be. Alarms, lists, music, orders, time, weather, news, topic look up, definitions & so much more. Then I discovered the smart bulbs which are really helpful. I don't have to stumble around to turn on my lamp anymore. Then I discovered the smart plugs which I mostly use for starting kitchen appliances. When I got an email about this being on a 50% off sale, I took the leap to get another area in my home Alexa friendly. I knew that the speaker would not be very loud after reading the introduction but we have a sound bar that can be linked to it when we need it to be louder. Setting it up was easy peasy with the Alexa App. I've also learnt how to 'intercom' between Echos so another discovery! I also love that its plug in so no wires & we save table/counter space.

And forget about it if there's noise like music in the room, it dose fit nicely where it's at though and the echo it replaced was a bit to big for the spot so what I did was add a remote which is like a hearing aid for the flex. Now I use the remote and can whisper to the flex and it responds quickly. I would rather it be hands free but maybe they'll update the firmware to address this major flaw. Does everything great now. Update, It's morning and went to turn flex on with remote and nothing! It shows as paired but remote will not wake it. After pairing again it's working, will see how long it works! Don't buy this as it's not ready for the public if it's deaf! Okay, appears batteries had low power so put in a fresh pair and problem solved.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Jul-20,Suzannah,"I have tons of Alexa devices, this is by far my least favorite. It seems I have to reconnect the device every other week and I’ve had it less than a year. I’ve only had to do that once to my Echo Show in the two years I’ve had it. I bought the Flex for my laundry room so I can continue to hear my audiobook as I do my chores moving from room to room while the book plays on the everywhere group. This DARN hunk of plastic is always suddenly disconnected from the group and from my network every other week while all my other devices continue working perfectly fine. I didn’t even mind the tinny/weak speaker it has because I listen to books mostly but without a connection it just sucks up my electricity until I can stop what I’m doing and reset/reconnect everything.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Jan-20,Lynn,"First I'm not sure why I bought this. I own several Alexa devices. Echo dots, firestick, firetv etc. I don't know why I thought the usb ports would work by Alexa but they don't. That's fine I misunderstood and jumped the gun. I havent bought any of the only two accessories that exist for the flex so far. I may or may wait and see if Amazon comes up with more or better accessories for the flex. I use this is my kitchen right now away from the Dots. The sound quality is mediocre at best but that doesnt bother me. My 3rd G Dot has great sound. I am actually ok with the sub par sound because late at night if I ask Alexa anything my dots volume is usually up pretty loud and startles me. I don't think to ask her to turn her vol down first and whisper mode never works right for me. The flex is quiet lacking any bass sound or EQ features. At 3 am I can appreciate the mono sound not startling me or disturbing anyone in the house. My most negative opinion is that several times Alexa failed to respond to me after multiple request repeating ALEXA ALEXA. Nada. Most of those times happened while I was listening to music through the flex. I had to unplug it each time to stop the music. A few other times while silent the flex just didn't activate at all. I have debated returning it.  But I haven't and I decided to hold off and see if any of the accessories make it worth the buy.","Not for music enthusiast.

Then I got the big boy stud Echo Studio for the home gym and used if for great sounding music. Pair up two for great sounding stereo for under 500 bucks! Then I came the Echo Plus for the kitchen and it too sounds good but not as good as the Studio behemoth. The gates were breached and a flood of plugs, switches and dimmers followed.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Dec-19,Tex75,"I'm a big fan of the Echo Dot but I don't like looking at the untidy cord. When I saw this for pre-order I thought it would work great in the kitchen to replace the Dot. Set-up was simple and it looks decent enough but the audio... The sound is the equivalent to the worst AM radio. The volume can't be adjusted from the Flex, you have to go into the app, which is not at all convenient. Attempting to raise the volume is frustrating because although you may set it to 100%, when you reopen the app it is at 70%. No matter how many times you try to leave it at 100%, and boy did I try, it always turns itself back down. Needless to say, with the poor quality speaker and the inability to turn up the volume, if I am making any kind of noise in the kitchen (running water, frying food, running the microwave) it drowns out the Flex to the point I can't understand what is being said. I have no choice but to bring the Dot back to the kitchen and move the Flex to a quieter part of the house where it will see less use. The idea was good but poorly done. My hope is that Amazon will learn from this mistake and give us a much-improved Flex 2.",Not a good alternative for the Dot

This plus the nightlight plugin solved both issues.  It’s voice recognition seems to be almost on par with a dot.  The speaker is plain and simple abysmal.  I’m sure they did this on purpose.  I’m not just talking about it’s not able to play music, but even it’s Alexa voice sounds like it coming from a tin can tied to a string. But it’s voice recognition is good. I have an echo show and spot sitting in drawer because they sucked at voice recognition, the spot is by far the best product on the market and it seems like this does a good job too.  But it’s only good as a control interface where you need extra coverage and one of its extra interfaces would be useful.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Feb-20,FYI,"I have an Echo, 3 Echo Dots, an Echo Input, and now this Echo Flex.  The Flex was given to me as a gift.  Overall, it really doesn't do anything for me.  Positive aspects may be that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet eliminating the need for a power cord, and possibly future accessories that hopefully are forthcoming.  Currently the two accessories that are available don't offer any wow factor for me.  Negative aspects:  not visually attractive; the speaker is basically useless because of low volume it generates and lack of tone.  It would probably function better pairing with a blue tooth speaker.  I would recommend spending a little more for the Echo Dot -- or maybe even the Echo Input.  The Dot has decent sound reproduction as a stand alone, and the Input looks better than the Flex but does require a power cable and some sort of extension speaker.  I think the Flex was a ""swing and a miss"" for Echo devices. Update:  spoke with an Amazon rep this morning following my posted review (great customer service Amazon!).  After elaborating on my opinion regarding the Flex, the rep provided me with some suggestions as to how to get better sound performance out of it.  I followed the advice and was able to produce better sound (volume and tone).  With that, I would change my rating on the device to 2 stars.  I am still of the opinion that this is not one of Amazon's better products, but I understand it will fit the needs of other customers.  I will continue to try the Flex in different locations to see if I can make it more usable for me.",Lackluster Device
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,19-May-20,Liss,"Overall, I like this Echo Flex, but it was an absolute bear to install.  It made me re-enter my wifi password so many times I nearly gave up.  A few weeks later my phone informed me there was a new Echo available to install--and sure enough, this little Echo Flex had somehow dropped out of my devices.  I fought valiantly for over an hour to reinstall it--it literally kept telling me my network password was wrong.  I got online to search for help and found nothing that worked. I thought I was going to have to return it.  I was about ready to turn off my wifi/network and endure the slow cycle of everything coming back up, but I decided--what the hell--why don't I at least try unplugging and replugging the confounded Flex. And that fixed it.  I didn't even have to reinstall.  It was suddenly back in its rightful place in my devices.  Shrug. The sound quality is minimal, but it serves its purpose in my little utility room.  I use it with a motion sensor so I don't have to say or do anything to have the lights come on when I'm toting a big load of laundry into the room.  It's a reasonable little machine.  I do think, however, that it's much harder to install (because it seems to have trouble grasping onto wifi signal) and a bit more glitchy than the other Echo devices.  Still, I don't regret its purchase.","Pretty good, but with a few glitches"

The Echo flex is small, and I dont have a lot of counter space left in there, so it fits right in. She hears me while I'm in the shower, although I do have to talk a little loud, but *for me*, the volume is perfect.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Dec-19,Clintre,"First off, it is not a great device for music or hi-fi sound. Do I wish that it was better? Sure, but I did not expect that and it works great for what we wanted it for. What we like... It is great for those tight spaces and areas that you want the convenience of Alexa, but don't have counter/table space. The fact that it is a small plug-in device makes it great for those areas. While the sound could certainly be better, it does do great for doing routines or dropping into other rooms in our house. We have one in our bathroom to listen to news and run routines, while getting ready. What is not to like? Pretty much just the sound quality. It would have been nice if they could have gotten close to even a cheap smartphone's speaker sound quality. Don't understand why it is not at least a little better. Overall... We have bought a second one to use in another area that has limited space.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Oct-20,imnorm,"The Flex is perfect in form - well thought out, easy to install in hallways, etc without the need for cords hanging anywhere.  The voice-recognition in the Flex works really well - sometimes better than a full-size Echo.  I see two ""misses"" and if I'm being totally honest I can't say the one is the Flex or the motion sensor attachment. Issue #1 - the motion sensor attachment goes wonky every few weeks and the way I've found to fix it is to unplug the Flex from the wall, wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Issue #2 - I didn't expect the speaker to be used for music and so I have the Flex set to play music on another Echo device in an adjacent room.  That's great, but what I needs is the ability to tell the Flex to use that other Echo for music, but let the Flex handle other verbal output so that if I play music it goes to another Echo with decent sounding speaker, but if I just ask Alexa a question or give her a command, the response should come from the Flex whose speaker is sufficient for verbal responses.","Perfect form, could use a bit of help in function"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Nov-20,Grady Richardson,"Okay, I didn’t need this. I already had Echos in almost every room in my house.

I put it in my hallway, just so in the 10 seconds or so that I’m walking from the family room (which has a Show) to the guest bedroom ( which has my original Echo) and the bathroom (which has a ceiling mounted Dot) door happens to be closed, I can still use Alexa without raising my voice. Maybe my wife is right. Maybe I do need help. Anyway, as to the merits of the device itself. It’s a really nice piece of technology. It’s ridiculously easy to set up. I plugged it in, got my iPad, opened the Alexa app and Alexa announced that my device was ready. Seriously. I didn’t have to do anything at all. I did rename it and put it in a hallway group, but that’s it. It’s an Echo. That is, it does everything any other Echo does, just smaller and cheaper. The only drawback is its tiny speaker, but no one is going to buy this to listen to music on (or they shouldn’t, anyway).

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Oct-20,S. Johannsen,"I have a couple of these, one with a sensor module, one with a nightlight module. There are some places that don't really have a good place for an Echo, but could stand some of the convenience. I have the one with the sensor in a walk-in pantry. The sensor allows the light to be turned on when  entering with hands full, which happens frequently in a pantry. The Echo functions let you drop in somewhere to have someone add something to a grocery list, or you could add to a digital list directly, when you see something is running low. The one with the night light is in a 'guest' bathroom. (Kids have left home, so now it's a guest bathroom). The nightlight works like any other and is good for guests to find their way without flipping on bright lights. The Echo part lets you broadcast, hey, we need TP in the guest bathroom, without straining your voice. I had one in the garage for a while, announcing 'Someone's in the garage', based on the sensor. Could easily be used to trigger lights in the garage as well. So there are some use cases that can benefit from these. I'd stick to places that have outlets a bit higher than the normal ft above floor ones. The microphones on these are fine, the speakers are not to loud, and certainly not intended for music.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Feb-20,James T.,"The new Echo Flex does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is why I bought one.  Amazon came up with this small Echo device to give people the ability to add an Alexa enabled device literally anywhere you have an electrical outlet, so that you can control all your smart devices with your voice, and make your life a bit easier. For this, I gave it 5 stars.  I wanted to have an Alexa enabled device in my kitchen so I could turn some lights on and off with my voice when I am busy cooking, or to ask for food measurement conversions, to set timers for cooking different things, and to also answer the phone when my hands are messy.  All of these things it does, and does perfectly. I also bought it to have voice activation of all my music, which I have it play over my WiFi speakers that I have in all the rooms of my house.  Again, for this, it does that function perfectly.  My kitchen is the loudest room in the house, especially at meal times!  And the very tiny speaker built into the Echo Flex gets drowned out very quickly when people are talking, exhaust fans are going, and spoons and other utensils are banging against pots and pans.  So to try to listen to music on the actual Echo Flex is never going to happen.  Not even in a quiet room. That is not the Echo Flex's intention.  People are bashing the sound that comes out of the Echo Flex as being really poor quality.  And it is, compared to larger Echo devices like the Echo Dot and regular Echo.  If you want to listen to music using the speaker in an Echo device, you have to buy a larger one!  You buy the Echo Flex to expand the areas of your house/garage/basement that you want to have voice control in! My favorite feature of the Echo Flex is that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet with the male prongs on the back of it.  It does not use a long cable like all the other Echo devices.  This puts it up and out of the way of other things you normally have on your counter tops or shelves.  By getting it up off your workspace you don't have to worry about knocking it off or damaging it by accident. Another feature the Echo Flex has is that there is a USB port on the bottom of it that you can connect USB enabled devices to.  There are night lights you can plug into it, and there is even a motion sensor you can plug into it that you can use to program WiFi enabled lights to turn on and off when you enter a dark room.  That is pretty cool. Overall, the Echo Flex is a great little Alexa enabled device that expands the areas that you want voice control of all your WiFi and smart items.  Think of it as your assistant, or helper.  You tell it what to do, and it does it.  For that, it works great.  Using it as your only means of listening to music?  No way.  It is not designed for that, and you will be disappointed in the sound quality.  You want a larger Echo device for that. But if you buy it for what it is, and what it was made to do, you will love it, and it will make your life easier and more enjoyable. Jim","Does exactly what it is supposed to do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Dec-19,P. Smith,"Like the other Alexa devices, the Flex was easy to setup and get running. It’s biggest drawback is the quality of sound from the speaker. If you’re expecting the quality of sound of the Echo Show or Dots you will be disappointed. The speaker sounds like one out of a cheesy transistor radio. However, if you are looking for just a basic Alexa device to get the weather, time, set/get reminders or alarms, but no music, then the ease of placement in a variety of nooks and crannies with a power outlet where it can be placed will be appealing. What I’ve done with it is place it in an entry hallway with the optional motion detector. I created a routine with the options set for Monday-Friday starting at around 5:30-7pm, if motion is detected, it will greet me, announce across all my Alexa devices that I’m home to alert the family, turns on the various downstairs lights (if they aren’t on already) where I have on smart plugs and bulbs. Then I set it it to wait for 60 minutes before it will trigger this routine so it won’t go off every time I pass by from that point on. You could also create another routine that every day of the week, after the time when you go to bed til you wake up, if motion is detected send a custom alert to any Alexa device in your home (such as your bedroom) and then set off a buzzer/alarm on the Flex device this serving as a poor man’s alarm system. Of course, if you have any pets wandering around this sort of alarm won’t be very useful. On the just for fun side, I have another routine that is triggered when motion is detected during a certain time period where Alexa will say a random compliment. Yeah I know, totally frivolous, but keeps the kids entertained. The routines you can build with the motion detector have some very well thought out options and actions that work flawlessly. So if you can tolerate the chintzy speaker, the Flex has some good usage possibilities.",Good if you set the right expectations
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Oct-20,D. Sah,"Love these little guys. When we bought our house, we took out the master for the intercom in our remodeling and I’ve been screaming for my kids ever since. I don’t enjoy screaming. It’s not a huge house but if they have any music going our they are zoning out, talking (loudly is their usual base), I have to yell louder. Although we aren’t an Alexa house, these were on sale during prime day so I thought, wth and bought a couple. The kids love asking Alexa random crap, having her play music (even on the crappy speaker); and hubs and I enjoy dropping in and making announcements unexpectedly. Especially when they aren’t brushing their teeth or doing their distance learning as they’re supposed to be. As an aside, I set up one in their bedroom and they the kid controls I put it on do not disturb. The. Forgot I did this (it takes awhile to figure out all the set ups) and could not get it out of do not disturb through the other more obvious settings. I had to call support, and they couldn’t figure it out. Finally, after a few resets and pretty much giving up, I realized it was out of service until 8 am 2 mornings in a row, I remembered vaguely setting a kid control. So if I went thru the right kid (which was attached to the device) I could remove that schedule.",Perfect- using as intercom
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Sep-20,Eric K.,"The Amazon Flex was on sale super cheap, so I decided to get one.  I thought it would work perfectly in our master bathroom so we could listen to music, the news, or ask Alexa questions when in the shower, bath, or getting ready for work.  Our Amazon Echo is in the living room, which is too far from the bathroom to be able to shout to, and I certainly wouldn't be able to hear it very well. The Flex was easy to set up.  I just plugged it in.  My Alexa app recognized it right away and I just had to follow the simple instructions with a couple of clicks (and inputting my Wi-Fi security code).  You then have to leave your phone within a few feet of the Flex while it's connecting everything. While not very visually appealing as the Echoes and Echo Dots have been getting, the Flex works just as well, as it connects to my main Echo via Wi-Fi.  The sound quality was pretty good, even better than my original Echo Dot from years ago. Why get a Flex instead of an Echo Dot?  For one, it was a lot cheaper at the time I bought since a great deal was going on.  Two, it doesn't need to ""sit"" anywhere.  It's plugged into an electrical outlet (which we rarely used in the bathroom anyway), so it's not taking up any counter or shelf space.  Three, there are no unsightly cords either.",Great Addition to our Echo Family

Got rid of the Dot and plugged this little thing into the wall, then connected it to the speaker with an audio cable.  Perfect.  Alexa is loud and clear and the hockey puck no longer takes up desktop real estate.  I know it could have connected with Bluetooth, but prefer a good old-fashioned, trouble-free 3.5mm audio cable connection because it's one and done.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Oct-20,Rob Howell,Based on the reviews and descriptions (and prime day price) I decided to purchase a Flex so that I could add a third party speaker to my speaker group. Unfortunately the sound does not sync up properly with the Echo and Dots that make up the rest of the multi-room group. Testing music directly on the Flex syncs up but on its own this also syncs right if using an aux cable but not when connecting via Bluetooth to a speaker. I tested with two different speakers by different manufacturers but came to the same result.  On the plus side the device itself is louder then expected and can be heard a room over clearly. I wouldn't recommend it over the dot for this purpose but for spoken audio (standup/audio books/pod casts/etc) and normal Alexa usage besides a morning alarm it works fantastically.,Good standalone micro speaker but not good for Bluetooth multi-room grouping

M Young,"Our laundry room is downstairs and often I cannot hear the bell go off when the washer or the dryer is finished. We had a cheap baby monitor in the laundry room and the receiver in the living room and monitored the laundry that way, but it was fifteen years old and static-y. Audio-only baby monitors in stores had terrible ratings and were about 30 dollars. For reasons too long to enumerate, we bought an Echo Show 5, so we moved the previously-used Echo Dot in the laundry room and used it for drop-ins; the sound was so much better. But I wanted the Dot for use in another room and using it just as a ""baby monitor"" seemed silly. Then I saw this little Flex on sale! Since I won't be playing music on it, there's no need for optimum sound out of the tiny speakers, and it's still useful for dropping in, asking the time or the temperature, etc. This is a great alternative to the Dot if you're not concerned with sound fidelity; talked to my husband on it via drop in and he says the sound coming via the Flex is pretty good!",Nifty If You Don't Mind Sound Quality

I did read that the device was not ""music quality"" sound and thought that was fine as all I needed it for was mainly alarms and daily functioning, unfortunately that description was an understatement. The sound quality was awful. At volume 10 (max volume) the sound was maybe comparable to volume 3 of regular alexa devices, on top of that it was very grainy sounding. Alexa had a hard time hearing us, even though she is supposed to have long range listening. I had another device in my room next to my bed, maybe four feet from the head of the bed and she wouldn't recognize when I spoke to her from that distance. I was able to charge my phone from the USB port on the bottom but that was about the only good function. Overall the idea was great, making a more compact alexa device and having the motion light attachments etc, but after a month of testing it out it wasn't worth it and we upgraded to 3rd gen Dots instead (so much better).",Just spend the extra for a dot
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jun-20,Chris G.,"Flex can hear you farther than the 1st Dot.  My Kitchen Flex is constantly eavesdropping while I'm talking to the LivingRoom Dot. Flex's integration is awesome, and in some instances, better than Dot. However, her voice needs an upgrade in both quality and volume.  It's almost painful to listen to her relatively squeaky voice especially when you combine it with a Max 10 Volume sounding close to a 3 Volume Dot. The only solution is to get a constant-power BT Speaker to sync with her.  Maybe that's why they gave the flex a USB charging port. Well, for the price I paid for her, the $10 cheap speaker is still a good deal.","Ears like a wolf, mouth like a mouse."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Dec-19,Alisha,"I bought the flex for a specific purpose. To use in my basement to disarm my alarm so we can enter/exit the basement door and for the Alexa guard abilities since I have windows in my basement.  We don't use the basement door often, so I didn't want to waste a dot for that use, plus there is no convenient place to put a dot. The flex is perfect here. I also purchased the light mostly to play with and have been impressed with it as well. The flex is not for listening to music, and if you get one for that you will be disappointed. It is a device whose main purpose is to control smart devices, integrate Alexa in lesser used spaces, or for very small rooms where a dot would be too much. I think the light or motion sensor should come with the flex so I deducted a star, but in all honesty, I don't need either one for my use. It is also funny to have Alexa say 'Get out of my basement!' when motion is detected.",Works well for its intended purpose.

With that said, I’m not using this for music but for an additional voice prompt in a different part of the house so I don’t have to yell into the next room...so this does the job perfectly - range of voice pickup is as good as previously from what I can tell, and the convenience of being able to put into an outlet and still leave the other outlet available is a plus.

I was used to speaking to a normal echo dot or the full size echo, but this one is nowhere near as sensitive as those.  Nearly every time I want to use it I have to repeat myself 2-3 times, each louder than the last.  Once you can get it to respond it operates like any other Alexa device but getting it to wake up is a miserable.  Even my Echo Auto has better voice pickup than this thing does. It is also lacking volume control buttons.  It's even harder to get it to wake up when it's playing music.  I have to yell at the thing to get it to respond. I used this to replace an Echo Dot next to my bathroom sink because I didn't like having it on the counter top and I didn't like the cord running to it.  I like the idea of it plugging directly into the wall but the mic problem has to be fixed.  It pairs with my blue tooth speaker easily. Amazon has a dozen better Alexa devices than this one.

After I received them on the 6th I plugged each one in, connected it to my software and network, then checked/changed settings and ran it through its paces to ensure they were all up to snuff. The problem was that two of them, even though they responded to ‘alexa’, had an error that it was waiting for wakeword which never updated. Not a huge problem unless I want to change the wakeword, which knowing me as I do, I probably will. I deregistered all three and oddly all of my information remained on the device, even the changes to alarms and audio, which seems wrong. So I factory reset all three and guess what? All of my information was STILL on the device afterward! Amazon needs to address this issue right quick! Six days later now each unit is able to let me change the wakeword.

If you were planning to play music out of the internal speaker you will be disappointed BUT (and it's a big Serena Williams BUT') you shouldn't be using the internal speaker for that.

It is then that you will have sound quality that far exceeds any stand-alone smart speaker you can find at ten times the price.  Additionally, that little internal speaker actually articulates better than the larger echos because it doesn't even try to reproduce the low frequencies, so for reproducing voices like news, audio books, Alexa-read Kindle books and phone calls it also functions better.

I admit it in order to say: even for me, someone whose bargain smart TV doesn't have a soundbar, etc, the tinny sound quality of Alexa's voice on this device was distracting and well,  distressingly bad.  I mean, I cringed... and prepared  to return it.  My husband decided he didn't mind, so this went in his own study where I won't hear it as he asks for the days sports updates when he returns from work.  I can't bear to listen to it.  I've had long distance calls to foreign countries in the 80s sound better than this. Alexa makes my world work better, I love having her all around my house for music, for making hands free phone calls, etc. (This alone is why I think crappy tinny sound is not ok.... I don't think anyone would understand me over this plug-in if I tried.) If you have ears that work, I suggest you just wait for a sale on the echo dot.  (Don't pay more than $22 if you are thrifty.)","Tiny sound incredibly distracting, way beyond ""not optimized for music playback"""
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Nov-19,Paul Lucas,This is Amazing! I love that Amazon placed a device in a package that is easy to plug right into an outlet without having to worry about finding a place to set it. It’s a nice slim form factor and I have this one placed in my laundry room so I can easily drop in on my wife while she folds clothes. That one of the rooms I didn’t have a device nearby.,Slim form factor and easy to place
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Oct-20,iFoxy,"If you want a taste of what Amazon products can do, this is a easy and cheap way to get into it without investing fully on a Echo Show. While it is not as loud as my Echo show, I love having it in those places like the bathroom and bedroom. I can still have access to music and also tell it to add something to my shopping list which is super helpful for me since I can forget on the way to the living room. I would say on of the main benefits of having one of the Echo Show products is if you need to remove or edit something, its easy cause you can ask it show you your list and then you can touch the items to edit or swipe the item off your list. Also you can ask it to remove an item with audio. Also the Echo show lets you watch movies and the sound is awesome. I recommend all the Amazon Alexa products! So many things I love to do with it to be honest. I would totally get another one if I could. Its just that good. When I move out and get my own house, I'm going to buy more. :)",While its no Echo show....it is a great starter speaker.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Feb-20,Impetigo,"I really love this device except that the response is slow.  I love the simple, Apple-like design.  I love the utility of having a small Echo device that plugs directly in the wall in rooms (e.g. bathroom) where you don't want a full sized Echo (and I am not a fan of the small Echos, the Echo Dot) or it's not practical (or too costly).  The speaker quality is completely fine for what it is.  I love being able to make announcements from any room, to any room. But what I don't love is that there is often a delay with the responsiveness, especially the farther you are from your wifi source (which makes sense since the voice commands are sent to the Amazon data centers that process the commands, like Siri on Apple), that is not an issue with my full sized Echos.  Still, the utility is great so I still like them, just hope they will work on the responsiveness.",Awesome!! Except poor responsiveness at times.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jan-20,Tammy Jones,"I have several Echo devices. Each one has a different purpose. I installed the Echo Flex in my basement (where I do my laundry and occasionally sift through seasonal items or stored items) I didn’t need a lot of features down there since I spend very little time in this area of the house. I just needed Alexa to answer questions, tell me the time, give me a reminder or notification, or just keep me company. The Echo Flex works perfectly for my needs in the basement. I have an Echo Show in the kitchen and a big Echo (with excellent speaker volume and sound) in the bedroom. I took it upon myself to buy the right device, for the right room, to meet my needs. I encourage everyone to do the same and remember, you get what you pay for. This works perfectly as described and at its price point! If you need richer sounds or louder volume, buy an Echo device that is designed for that. If you don’t care much about listening to music and you just need a reliable interaction with Alexa that can do all the things you expect her to do, you will definitely appreciate this one!",Exactly what I need for my basement!

I bought this for my garage, which due to my new COVID19 project list/honey do's has been converted into a wood shop.  My desire was two fold: 1. I wanted to be able to hear the Ring doorbell. 2. I wanted to be able to cut all power to my tools and work bench without having to hit switches, via a smart plug that I already had. Within 10 minutes both had been accomplished.  I actually had it all working before the notification came in regarding the delivery of the flex. I was then able to get my wifi garage door opener working with it. Now I can close the garage when I'm done working in there, or turn on/off the light on the opener. Additionally, I was able to play my Spotify playlist through it, like my other Echo devices. The sound quality isn't the best as it's through a tiny speaker but it isn't nearly as bad as others have claimed.  I was actually impressed by the sound quality, given the tiny footprint. Overall, I'm impressed with the device even without any of the attachments.

I have her everywhere including in my car- she is literally the best personal assistant I’ve ever had! My Echo Flex is in my bathroom and keeps me company while I get ready in the morning- gives me my news and weather, maybe she reads me a book while I take a bath, or helps me remember a song I was thinking of.. at night while I brush my teeth she reports a little “good news” and is always around to help me remember something I need at the store, or that it’s time to rinse out my conditioner.. I can also drop in on another room, when I forgot my towel!

The speakers on this are minuscule, even at the maximum volume, it's a very low volume. If you have a TV, people talking, or music in the background, forget about hearing the response this device has to say. I'm glad Alexa is build into such a small and cheap device you can plug into the wall, but slightly louder speakers could make this very handy and more useful. I know you can plug an external speaker into the device, but I don't think most people buy this to use it that way. If you're thinking about using this in your bathroom while you're showering, you can forget about it. Overall, buy it when it is on sale, I don't think the full price is a good deal.

This product does what is intended to do, period. It is not a music player,  but can be, if paired with a bluetooth speaker. It wasn't designed for you to use it listen to 'talk radio' in the shower ( you should thank Amazon for that... seriously). It is best used in a small room or space,  for basic Alexa purposes. I have not tried any of the accessories,  nor do I plan to at this time. There are reviews about the poor volume, once again...designed for a small space.  I have mine about 6 feet from my bed and desk (between the two, I don't sleep on my desk...but have fallen asleep at it.). For the price, and for my needs,  I am quite satisified.

You can have an echo dot answer instead of this device if you want good sound. You can also hook up a Bluetooth or wired speaker (but that's an extra cost). So why do I have it? Guard Mode is part of my home security. I keep this in my bathroom to detect glass breaks. This is a cheaper alternative to a dot. I also pair this with my shower speaker. The USB plug is a bit handy as well. I know it’s really meant for the motion sensor or night light, but I use it as a charger. Update: After a few months, I'm happy with it.

I already had an echo dot and thought that this would do well in the kitchen since it's more out of the way. Unfortunately, it's just not that great of quality. I was hoping for better sound.

The reason it took me so long to purchase, was because other reviewers had stated that the sound was very low and you could hardly understand Alexa and hear music being streamed. After reading just ONE review from someone stating they had bought it for their bathroom and it was everything that they wanted it to be with sound volume and size, I decided to purchase. To my surprise, it was everything I wanted it to be. The volume emitted was perfect and I could hear the music perfectly while in the shower.

Now I have 3 total in my house! So far, both have been amazing! I have one in the bathroom to ask for the morning news, weather, and the time. This is called the “Flex” because of the flexibility to relocate it to anywhere there is WiFi access. The response tome is about the same as my 3rd gen Dot. This Alexa is small but I see room for improvement for this tiny device. I don’t get why it is so huge but the audio is sub-par. (I would guess the AC to DC conversion but how much space does it need?) They could of easily put inside a bigger speaker driver in the space. If they could do it for the Echo Auto, so can they do it for the flex. On the flip side, one thing I like about the Flex is that I can plug in my own speakers and usb device in with no problems (has 3.5mm headphone jack on the side and a USB A port on the bottom).

The sound quality isn’t the best, but for the price I wasn’t expecting it to be. Besides, it has an audio port to attach any external speaker one could want. Sometimes it has difficulties hearing me when playing music at full volume, but its just minor difficulties, I’ve never had to stand there yelling at it in order for it to hear me. I’ve found this super especially useful around the house with making ‘Alexa announcements’. We have a flex in our kitchen, and another in my fathers office (which is located outside in a garage). He never has his phone on him, so whenever it’s time for dinner we no longer have to run outside to let him know, we can simply say “Alexa, announce dinner time!” and he will know! I’ve also been using a flex in my bedroom with the motion sensor attachment, and WOW does it feel otherworldly to get home from work and have my house greet me with my lights and tv coming on and a little ‘hello’. This is by FAR the cheapest option to adding motion sensors to Alexa to automate routines, all others I could find required some sore of hub (which is too expensive) or were in themselves too expensive.

Which, I am not sure why there is another one, as there is one built into it. Perhaps the external one is more sensitive. Either way, it’s a great little night light. It is also able to change colors. I have used Red, White and Blue. Not certain if it can do other colors.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jan-20,Seth I Levine,"This is a pretty OK Echo device. It certainly has its good points! When used with the motion sensor (which is what I'm doing), it really could only work in a hallway type of situation. The problem, as I see it, is that it needs to be plugged directly into an outlet, and, in my house anyway, most of the outlets in rooms where I might want this to work, are below knee level and behind furniture - except in the hallway. I suppose the nightlight option would work well in the hallway situation, too, but it's too bad you can't have both the nightlight AND motion sensor. The Alexa functionality of this device is just like all other Alexa devices. It can hear from all around a room and answer questions or follow commands. The speaker is definitely not worthy of playing music with much fidelity. Right now, I'm using it in my garage to control an adjacent smart switch to turn the garage lights on in reaction to the motion sensor. That seems like a perfect fit for this combination of devices. I'm not really sure how else one might use this, because most outlets in most homes in the US are not accessible in a way that would work with this thing. If I had a very specific use case where I knew this would work, I'd buy it again. Otherwise, I wish there was a motion sensor option from Amazon that didn't require being plugged directly into a wall outlet.",It's an odd combination of brilliant and dumb
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Oct-20,Matt Seegers,"I wanted to try out the Flex right when Amazon announced the new product but only recently had a chance to purchase them. My intended use-case was for the two bathrooms in my apartment.  My wife and I almost exclusively listen to NPR while we're in the bathroom getting ready for the day and have been resorting to using one of our phones to play it.  This works pretty well but obviously can lead to some risks/issues:  the phones' speakers are *almost* loud enough to hear while in the shower.  If you place the phone in a sink it boosts the volume just enough.  As one may expect, this has resulted in many close calls with water. Initial Setup: Fantastically easy, just like any Amazon Echo device Physical Size: just small enough that it shouldn't block both outlets in a dual outlet... outlet. Experience:  Speech recognition just as good as any Echo device, but I have only used them in bathrooms, which is likely easier for the mic(s) to pick up.  Loading apps (like NPR) or pairing using bluetooth is just like any other Echo device (ie fast and relatively painless).  Audio sounds good--but, as is essentially mentioned in product description, is not designed for rich (ie music) audio and does not get very loud.  I would rate the loudness to be lower than an iPhone 7 or later. Takeaway: This is a great device to integrate voice control in a small/medium room.  However, if you want to use it for audio and there is any ambient noise in the room I would recommend either using external speakers (plugged in to the audio-out and/or USB port) or external bluetooth speakers.  If your main goal was to get audio into a room it may be more cost effective to find an all-in-one solution that can support voice control and also has solid speakers.  For me, I am hoping that there will be more Flex accessories that could potentially address this issue (ie a Flex Speaker that plugs into the USB port and fits the same form factor).",Great for adding voice control to any small/med room with low ambient noise

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Nov-20,Oliver,"AS far as Echo devices go this is by far the most convenient - just plug it into the wall and you're good to go without the need for desk space. This does everything you would expect an Echo device to do, but it has one glaring flaw that was enough to knock it down two whole stars. That flaw is the audio quality. The sound out of is sounds like it's coming out of an old transistor radio. It sounds like you're listening to a bad recording of a recording of an echo over the phone. Now it's a small device so I'm not expecting audiophile sound quality, but any low end at all would be welcome. The saving grace and why this didn't get knocked down any lower is that you can hook this up either to a Bluetooth speaker or via the 3.5mm audio jack to an amp or to powered speakers. The USB port on the bottom is a nice touch even though I have yet to try one of the Flex accessories.",Convenient device with terrible sound

Nice idea, all in one unit so it get plugged in and that's it. The speaker is underwhelming though. When you max it out, you feel like it'll blow the speaker because you get that ""buzz"" during speech or music bass. So much that thankfully I already had a bluetooth speaker wall mounted so I paired it with that, otherwise I would have returned it if I paid full price. I tried this out during the lightning deal (thank goodness). This also doesn't hear as well as the echo dots. I find it misunderstanding my command more and I again rely on the paired speaker. Maybe the placement could be better but the avg house has outlets that aren't above waist level or in a predominantly silent room so I would imagine the everyday practicality of this is not great. Biggest plus for me is the all in one plug into the outlet and that's it. No wires. Would I buy it again? Not at full price. Half price? Maybe but hesitant.",speaker quality and loudness is lacking

I'm giving it one star so Amazon will pay attention to this problem. I used Alexa on my Kindle Fire HD 8 to set up my new Echo Flex and everything was fine until I tried to pair the Flex with any of my Bluetooth speakers.  According to my Fire, the Flex couldn't find any Bluetooth devices. I called Amazon and they were good enough to send me a replacement.  Unfortunately it had the same problem.  I then tried to pair each of my four Echo Dots with any of my Bluetooth speakers using Alexa on my Fire and, yet again, none of the Dots could find any Bluetooth devices. Finally, I tried using Alexa on my Android phone to do the pairing and, lo and behold, it worked perfectly.

I'm not one to feel that every minute must be multi-tasked. However, what used to be several random boring parts of the day, now has the possibility of a few minutes of helpful productivity or just relaxation. We can knock out a couple tasks (shopping list, check the weather, log weight) or even learning (language lessons, podcasts, Audible, etc). We can listen to music, daily news, or check traffic for the morning commute. The night light add-on is also very handy in one of the bathrooms.

The mic is so good, the Flex sometimes hears things when dots and my screen devices don't. Of course, that's good and bad, because the speakers are much better on all of my other devices, and I'd rather they answer before the Flex does.

I also wish you could increase the volume more, even if you can't increase the sound quality. I guess it was worth buying one at 50% off but about a week after I bought an Echo Flex, I bought an Echo Dot and the difference in volume and sound quality is about to be 10-fold.

What I didn't expect is how bad the microphone is - nowhere near the sensitivity or usefulness of a dot, even. If music is playing on the external speaker (which works fine, by the way), the flex doesn't register its wakeup word, so you end up shouting Alexa over and over again. You have to be right up on it before it registers that you are calling it.  Very annoying, especially when it is the kids in the pool screaming it repeatedly.

We didn't have one in the foyer and were shutting off lights on the way out the door by yelling into the kitchen. It worked, but for $12 on sale, I figured I'd give this little guy a try in a nearby outlet. It's small and relatively unobtrusive. There are two issues we are having. 1) Its tiny speaker is very tinny and not very good. Loud enough, but underwhelming it all other ways. Asking Alexa for the weather is audible but honestly grading on the ears. Compared to the Dots we have, this is inferior sounding. In one of our bathrooms we just used 3M Command Strips to attach a Dot next to an outlet. This works very well and sounds way better. 2) The mic must be way more sensitive on this unit because when we're in the kitchen where we have an Echo Show 8, half the time we ask Alexa for something, she responds from the foyer 15' away. This messes with kitchen timers, alarms and in general, just makes the setup a bit frustrating. I gave up and unplugged the unit. I'll likely put it in the garage instead where audio quality (for us) isn't a priority. Again, for the price, especially when it's not on sale, I'd recommend the Dot and a 3rd party outlet mount or some Command Strips.",Spend just a bit more and get an Echo Dot

I wasn’t expecting any bass, and there isn’t any, but I expected it to be able to get as loud as my phone speaker at least. Again, it’s a tiny unit so I was perhaps expecting too much. The third party nightlight is a nice touch also. I only run it on about 40% intensity because it’s quite bright. You can also change it to all sorts of colors if you like This also is compatible with Alexa Gaurd, so it’s another mic listening for fire/CO alarms or glass breakage while you’re out.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,17-May-20,Duane C. Stanton,"I wanted a back porch voice (Alexa) control system.  I made a water proof Receptacle box that can handle size of the flex and the nightlight.  I have several “Alexa” driven devices in my yard, and having a fill in unit on the patio and in the backyard to activate the various devices...  like bistro lights, stereo system, fill in lighting etc. At the price and flexible use of this device it just great.  Forget it for audio use for music, but it’s great asking it questions and time.  And I’m looking at using them for security uses too. I enjoy having them in my shop area too.

This Echo Flex worked perfectly! It plugs in to the outlet on my patio (is rather unnoticeable, which is a plus so that I can leave it outside), set up immediately with my Alexa app, paired effortlessly with my bluetooth speakers; and, gave me the functions I desired (just like my Echo Dots). The price point (on sale) was also unbeatable! The only thing I notice is that you have to be within fairly close range (about 10 feet) and directly facing it for it to hear your voice commands in an outdoor setting; in an enclosed space, I am sure it would have further range.

I used to have an Echo Dot in the bathroom, but without hearing aids, the sound seemed muffled and muddy no matter how I adjusted the sound to emphasize the treble.  The sound from the Flex is much like the pocket-size transistor radios back in the '50s...sort of tinny.  But, that's what I like about the Flex because its sound is much easier for me to understand.  I guess that I have a spare Dot on my hands, but the tradeoff was well worth it for me.

It's very tinny and I wouldn't attempt to listen to music on it. But that's not why you purchase an Echo Flex. What you can do is plug in a good speaker set using the jack, connect a good speaker via Bluetooth, and save yourself some space compared to any other Echo device. Or, if you know you're not going to have music in a certain room but would like the convenience of having Alexa available, say the garage, a bathroom, or college dorm, for instance, then this is a killer option.

The problem has now been fixed, so a review is in order.  If you can get it cheap enough as compared with a Dot, this is an excellent device to use as an internet radio.  Although the Flex speaker is a joke for anything but echo responses (Amazon clearly stresses this), just add any good set of powered speakers like a moderately good computer speaker set with sub woofer and you have a pretty neat and compact internet radio, assuming that you are a Prime subscriber with access to Amazon Music.

In addition, one can get a motion sensor for the echo flex. It is easy to program it to turn on the lights or take other actions when you enter a room. For example, you could program it to turn off your robot vacuum or send it to another room when you enter a room. Sure, the speakers aren't has high quality as the echo, but I don't listen to music in every room. The main limitation is the echo flex (and its accessories) come in only one color, white.

There is a tool room, a drafting room, the furnace, some storage... It's not a place where people will hang out. However, one of the best things about this is it is small, inconspicuous and you still have full Alexa availability.

However the audio quality is nowhere near as good as even the Echo Dot.  I have it in the bathroom to listen to music while in the bath or shower, and it is definitely not loud enough and the quality of the audio is mediocre at best. For basic issuing of commands to tell devices what to do and asking for the weather and other simple things it's ok, but I would not recommend this for anyone wanting to listen to music.  Also, if you are buying the nightlight attachment, be sure to measure the amount of space you have under the outlet.

Also, the sound it makes when the timer goes off is higher pitched than the dot and I found it annoying.

Not a problem for a small space like a bathroom, but after using the Dot devices for some time it throws you off. I also don't like that there is no manual button(s) for volume control.

This is exactly when I need.  I already have a cheap WIFI camera with 2 way communications, but it doesn't alert me, nor it is capable of turning the light on.  Our porch gets pretty dark at night and I now have some light for unlocking the door.  If people actually came to the front porch, I would do that one too.  No need for a doorbell.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Dec-19,Captav1,"Tried the flex to replace my original dot to free up space on the table. The setup was identical to the Echo Dot . Some of the critiques about sound pickup are true but I think that is because of the new location on the wall plug while the Echo was on the table. My biggest complaint is the bluetooth pickup. I continually lose bluetooth reception with my bluetooth speaker, an issue I never had with the Echo Dot. This might be due to the placement of the Echo Flex on a wall plug lower in line of sight with the speaker. The distances are identical within 2 feet, far below the 30 foot threshold bluetooth provides. The idea is great (allowing you to free up table space).

One issue I had is that I had to use the voice command to change the wake word as it never allowed me to change it via the device configuration. I have also noticed that it has a harder time understand some commands. I have a Kevo lock and told it to unlock the door and it said, Ok, locking front door. I suspect this is due to the fact it only has two mics. So far I have dots, echos, Fire cubes, dash and echo auto. They all have their pros and cons. This new flex is another echo that fits in the echo line and has a place. I use several routines and look forward to the continued growth of the ecosystem.",Simple Setup and works nicely.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Dec-19,Ken Y,"I use a sound bar so I didn't really need a speaker of any kind in the echo device. I connect via Bluetooth. This is compact and offers a USB port which helps to keep the outlet useful. Physically very satisfied with it. However, it's ""hearing"" was supbar. And I'm comparing this to Echo Dots (2nd and 3rd Gen) which I have and wanted to replace with this. It seemed to need everything repeated twice, almost like the first time to wake it and the second time to execute something. I had to speak louder as well. It really was enough of a step down to be aggravating. I sent the two that I purchased back and am using the Gen 2 dot that I already had and upgraded one to a Gen 3.  Both are far superior in function It's too bad, I really liked the idea of these when I saw them.",Perfect device but poor results

I purchased the night light to go in a guest bathroom and it's a great addition!  Love that the night light can change colors by just telling Alexa to change it!  Also able to tell the unit when to turn on and off the night light.  The unit gives all the benefits of the larger Echo or big brother Dot.  The sound quality is lacking in comparison to the larger units but that just makes sense since it's a very compact unit.

The sound coming from this is probably compared to the original echo Dot or less. It definitely can be heard easily but don't be expect to be blown away if you are a audiophile. The Alexa response needs some work but it eventually responds while the music is playing. I originally made this purchase during the holidays for one of the upcoming parties. We had music playing through out the house with the connected echoes and so this was available in the restroom to continue hearing the festive music. Needless to say, it was a big hit with the guest and several purchased one afterward to use likewise. I love it for what I use it for daily because it's just as convenient but out of sight.

Also if you thinking about putting an outlet and using the outlet above it, you may want to think about adding a TP link extension ac plug. The thing is is that it sets off the wall and if you’re gonna plug it into the bottom part of your plug if you wanted to plug-in perhaps a blow dryer in the bathroom you won’t be able to without the extension.. Something to think about. The cool thing is that the nightlight can be set up on the Alexa to be turned on and off.

Priest,"I found this device at a significantly reduced introductory price during the holidays and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm very pleased that I did... I'm using this in my bedroom to add additional voice control.  First, the device plugs directly into the wall, meaning it's out of the way with no troublesome wires or power adapters to deal with.  The device has the ability to connect to Bluetooth speakers, or can attach directly to a speaker input using an audio cable.  In addition, the device has a built-in speaker that's more than adequate for voice response.  I previously purchased a couple of the Echo Input devices, which I've been quite happy with, but actually this device is much more capable, more responsive and even easier to set up and use.

For these purposes it works well, and that's all I need it to do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jan-20,Simon,"Echo Flex is super simple to set up; just plug it into an outlet and add Flex to the devices in your Amazon App. It picks up my voice, at a normal tone, throughout the room. It's important to not install Flex in a plug behind something or have items in front of it (b/c it may interfere with Alexa's listening capability). Echo Flex is small and - without an extension, like a motion detector - allows access to the other outlet. The speaker is tiny, of course, and the sound quality is rather ""tin""-ee, but that's to be expected with such a small speaker.

For the most part, the Echo Flex itself does what I need it to do. I wasn't expecting any good sound quality (hence why I connected it to another speaker system) but the microphone is very lackluster as well. It would have been nice to have that sorted since I do use that feature quite often. One has to speak directly at the Echo Flex for it to register the voice input. Even then though, I would have given this a 3 star rating because it does what I expect, but the 2 star is due to the motion sensor add on. Beware the motion sensor adapter is terrible. I have to jump around in front of it for it to register movement. I've tried moving it around the room, different lighting methods, etc., to no avail. Very disappointing.",Meh

He also uses it to listen to music while he takes a bath. If he's low on toothpaste he asks it to remind me to buy some. I also use it to talk with him while he gets ready for bed and I am at work. We have one in the laundry room. I really like the motion sensor in there! My BF has it programmed to detect movement and turn on the lights for me. Again setting reminders for laundry detergent is great or using it to drop into the upstairs and summon a child/help keeps us from yelling through the house.

I like using this device (echo flex) to turn on / off lights, and play music from other devices. It’s a small compact device that has all abilities of a regular Alexa, just you know with poor speaker quality.

The Echo Dot had no issue picking up my voice over the music playing and the other noises in my garage, the Echo flex microphones struggle to hear what I am asking Alexa in a large space like a garage.

The integrated speaker isn't qualified to play music, but it does work well for the voice commands.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Jul-20,Jake W.,"As I got more smart home products, I wanted to make sure that users could control those products from every room. Many other smart speakers really weren't good for this, as they're either too big, too expensive, or add more annoying wires to trip over. This form factor is great, since it just takes a little space around the outlet, with no wires. If you can get it at discount, it might even be cheaper than installing new smart switches in every room. My only complaint is that sometimes, the microphone is *too* sensitive. It will hear me say ""alexa"" from a few rooms down, but it's so far away, that the rest of my sentence will be too faint for it, and it will misunderstand me.","Great, inexpensive way to make your whole home smart"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Feb-20,B. J. Turk,"I own an Echo, 3 Echo Dots, a pre-release Echo Auto, and two Echo Flex devices, so I can speak from a breadth of experience with audio-only Echo devices. But for two issues, this could replace an Echo Dot: 1. Audio quality is not nearly as good. Even though it is clearly noted as not being optimized for music, the sound is a bit tinny. It also seems somewhat less clear. I have had to ask it questions more than once because the first answer was not clear enough to be readily understood. 2. It seems less likely to clearly understand commands. This may be because the outlet into which I've plugged it is close to the floor. Still, most outlets are close to the floor, so it should have been designed to be more sensitive due to the likelihood that it wouldn't sit as high as a counter or tabletop, and therefore would be more likely to be obstructed. I would not use an Echo Flex where there was much noise. Also, it will work better if placed higher than your typical wall outlet. It might be useful in a bathroom, since you wouldn't necessarily have counter space for an Echo or Dot. However, if you like music when you shower, you're better off pairing a Bluetooth speaker to an Echo device than to use a Flex.","Much less than merely ""not a Dot"""

I leave the Flex always connected to the sound bar, but I experience a weird issue where I have to reset my speaker after a week or two because the Flex refuses to reconnect to it.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Jul-20,Robert Drazich,"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal.

You don't buy this particular device for the sound. Yes the sound works just fine for asking questions but it doesn't sound that great for music. Still works fine for music just don't expect big deep sound. If you want something that sounds better get a dot or 2nd gen echo. I most definitely wouldn't give this a bad rating based off sound because ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO SOUND GREAT SMH. The attachments for it are great also.

Amazon clearly states (now) on the Flex item page that it is not intended as music speaker, and if that's what you want plug better speakers in via 3.5mm jack.  That's what I was going to do anyway.  And it works great!  Pairing with my iPhone took about 5 seconds, and I was streaming to the speakers immediately.  With the deal and a sale on a refurb, I got 3 of these to enable me to stream to the older receivers and powered speakers that are not wi-fi or bluetooth enabled.  It's great.  Oh and that it's an Alexa device is just icing on the cake.",Works excellent as a bluetooth receiver to non-bluetooth enabled speakers/receviers
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Nov-20,bookpoodah,"I use this mainly as a news radio beside my bed. I rated the sound quality 3 stars, but, for me, it's 5 stars. For music lovers, it's not so great. But the narrow frequency range makes voices much more understandable (I can even understand BBC News now!), and it doesn't bother my wife as a more full-bodied speaker does. A minor downside is that the voice recognition is not as good as that of my Echo Dot. Occasionally I have to tell it twice what I want. I guess that's because of a smaller and less efficient microphone. I wrote a sleep timer routine for it that gradually lowers the volume before turning off. That way, there is no abrupt shut-off to wake me up. If all you want in a given area is control, the Flex is a better price than the Dot.",Perfect for the job.

I have a full smart home and wanted these low profile Alexa's to add coverage for my voice commands in rooms that did not have them.  The plug in wall with no chord was appealing.  I didn't care about sound or speakers, I just wanted it to understand my ""turn on outside lights"" commands and similar.  After 6 months or so, I gave up and replaced them with the traditional puck style Echo's.  They just had a hard time understand my voice commands. Always asking me for some type of clarification.

I plugged it in next to my bed so once I crawl into bed, I ask Alexa to set the alarm clock, turn off the bedroom light and check the weather for the next day.  I was concerned that if the electrical power went off in the middle of the night and then came back on, would it remember the alarm command.  So I tested it by setting the alarm clock with my voice command.  Then I unplugged it for 10 minuted and plugged it back in and YES the alarm went off as scheduled.  The set up was easy.

I got Echo Flex at the special sale and it serves the purpose. It is not fancy and it has a plain vanilla speaker. It is great if you need it to supplement unreachable spaces or where great sound is not required. It's simple and serves the purpose. By the way, you can attach a couple of other devices to it  (light, clock) which will make it a lot more useful. And if the sound is an issue, pair it with a Bluetooth speaker of your choice.

I have a shop light plugged into a smart plug to use as a signalling device-if someone in the house wants to get my attention, they tell Alexa to turn on the light (which I will see-I might not hear an announcement if working with tools).  I can also use the announce feature to ask someone in the house to come out to the garage.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Dec-19,Q,I like the flex and use it in the bathroom paired with a Google home mini that I have set up as a Bluetooth speaker (since I have found Google assistant pales in comparison to Alexa). However the Flex does have poor mic performance compared to the Dot. It has a very hard time hearing me over the Bluetooth speaker while music is playing and the speaker is placed more than two feet from the Flex. The speaker that is built into the Flex is mostly useless. I wish they would come out with a detachable add-on speaker. I do have the nightlight and it is great. Overall the Flex does what it should and I'm glad that I got it. It is priced well at around $20. I would not pay more than that for it. I feel like it should be $15.,Not bad.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Nov-20,Sam,"Works as expected. We were looking for an inexpensive way to bring Alexa functionality into the bathroom without cords or having to find a place to setup another Echo Dot. The Echo Dot achieves this goal. Alexa functionality is great and you are able to use this for all the features you’d expect from an Alexa enabled device. Sound quality isn’t great. But hey, that’s to be expected when you’re trying to fit so much into such a small package for such a great price. We have a Bluetooth enabled Bose speaker in the bathroom for listening to music. The Echo Flex pairs perfectly with the Bose speaker, making the built-in sound quality of the Flex irrelevant in my case. The built in sound quality is definitely sufficient for understanding what Alexa is saying and for using the device. It’s just lacking in sound quality when trying to play music through the built in speakers. I would definitely recommend the Echo Flex for people looking to add Alexa to a small room where an Echo dot would be less practical.","Great for small rooms, with no room for Echo Dot."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Feb-20,Thayne Allen,"Like all echo devices, the flex is well built and aesthetically pleasing.  The sound quality is decent considering it isn't designed for playing music.  It's perfect if you already have a speaker or sound system you want to use, as it has a built in aux jack, as well as blue tooth functionality.  The guard feature is great.  When you aren't home, it will listen for signs of trouble like smoke alarms or glass breaking and will notify you on your cell.  The only issue I have is with voice recognition.  It misunderstands what I'm saying more often than I would like, and sometimes it doesn't hear me at all if my tv is on.  Other than that it's great!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Jan-20,Jennifer,"I  just got these today. I bought two of them. My sole purpose in buying them was to extend my voice command capabilities throughout the house. Having already downloaded the Alexa app to use my other devices, the Flex units were immediately recognized. When you buy them here, there is an option to add them to your account and I did. So, when I plugged them in, my app picked them up and added them. It took less than 2minutes to be up and going.  They work well for what I need them for, voice commands to power light, cameras, etc. You can ask her questions, like ""How many quarts in a gallon"" and she will answer. However, if you plan to use it for playing music, such as on Spotify, Amazon, Pandora, etc, you may want to go ahead and purchase an echo. It almost sounds like an old portable FM radio when you play music. But, I don't think they were made for streaming music.  They are small and fit nicely in one outlet leaving the other one open to use. There is a convenient USB port on the unit to make up fo the outlet you are using.

If you want to use this for music, there is a ""line out"" plug that allows you to connect to external speakers.  For the price, this worked way better than expected.

It also has one other issue, every now and then it will display a red light and say something like ""I am having trouble understanding now, please try again later"". Its pretty annoying when that happens.  It can take a while before I am able to use it again. Again the other Echo dots have no issues at all.  The wifi is also perfect in that location so that’s not the problem. Between the microphones and the other hardware issues, this isn't a great buy.

Even though the speaker is loud enough, it does not sound very good compared to the Echo dot. It is pretty lean on bass. I had to attach an external speaker. My only real issue with this device is that after unplugging it from the wall to move it to another outlet, the device got partially messed up and Alexa was no longer able to take my voice commands until I reset everything using the Alexa App. This never happened to me with my Dot.

It currently occupies a location that was occupied by a Dot. I wanted something a little sleeker for the hallway (with a nightlight function).

Ordinarily that wouldnt be a bad thing if you had just one Echo device. But when i have many, it defeats the functionality and ease of saying ""Alexa, turn off lights"".

I -really- want to return it, but my husband likes the convenience of not having cords attached, so it stays. The trouble is, I purchased this to plug into the kitchen wall next to my sink, so that I could use it while cooking/washing dishes, etc. without taking up counter space, or having cords in my way. That has been a problem with other Echo devices we have. It works okay when I'm not running water, but once water is running, I can't hear anything coming from the speaker but rubbish, even at volume 10, nor can the Echo detect my voice over the sound of the water. Furthermore, without running water, voice detection is random at best, and frequently our other Echo devices respond from other rooms well before this will with us standing right in front of it.

You shouldn’t expect stereo quality sound from something so small. I connected a Bluetooth speaker to mine to solve this issue. I purchased both the motion sensor and the night light with the flex.

At first I did not expect it to be so tiny however, I think I’ve grown to like the size. It’s easy to fit in awkward small spaces and it saves counter space. Currently I have it behind a night stand which I think is a pretty awkward place to fit. I bought it because I didn’t want to shout through my house for my other echo dot to hear me. In this sense it works just fine. Pros, I love that it has a USB port, I use it to charge my phone and it’s been working great! I love the idea of the add-ons/night light feature and I think that will be my next purchase. Cons, it is not optimal for music playback but that’s a given. When reading the review before my purchase I saw someone said it sounds like a little radio, that would be an accurate description. But for me it works just fine if I want low music in the background or sleepy time white noise. I’ve tried playing audiobooks on a louder setting and I think the sound quality was pretty crisp for a small radio, it’s definitely not like a BOSE SoundLink.

Alone it's not great for music but It adds vocals for music if you have a main echo in ear shot for the instrumental and bass.  The flex does fine in at least hearing the words and lyrics and adding some sound reinforcement to the songs to compliment what's already coming out of your other main speakers.

I used to use my phone as a connection to an old set of really good Altec-Lansing computer speakers in my studio. Always had a problem with the connection.  I bought the flex , plugged the speaker cord into the Flex’s jack and voila, Bob’s your uncle! The speaker is fine for typical Alexa conversation, just mediocre  for music and it has no problem understanding me from anywhere in the studio. This was a great bonus as once I get working my hands are covered in clay.  It was well designed and doesn’t interfere with other plugs in the same outlet when it is plugged in.",Great!!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jul-20,happyshopper,"The speaker isn't very good for music listening and even with volume set to the max it can be hard to hear in an environment where other sounds are going on.  I had placed it first in the kitchen, so I could easily add to my lists, timers, announce, drop in etc.  But I ended up getting another Echo Dot for the kitchen and moved the Flex to my computer/craft room where things aren't as noisy and here she's good as I can add to lists, have her print without having to go to the family room to tell my Echo Dot in there. So overall I'm glad I got the Flex, you just need to think about where it will work best for you.",Good for asking Alexia to do things
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Nov-20,Diane L,"Purchased 2 of these to go with the other Alexa devices we already have. Setup was fast and had no problems 30secs or less. Other reviews state the sound quality is not the best however having setup both and tried them with several different types of music, I disagree. These are not meant to be a large speaker however the music quality plays well and volume can be controlled like other Alexa devices. When all your devices are used as a “group” the same song can be played throughout the home. I placed one in the dining room and the other in the second floor bathroom. Great way to mesh together your smart home! May buy one or two more.",Great small device and great sound

The sound of the Dot and Echo Show is much better, but I don't feel comfortable using the other more costly devices in some spaces.  That's where this comes in and perfectly as an extra.  This acts as an intercom for everyone in the family for the whole house.  Now we don't miss each other no matter where we are.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Aug-20,Christina,"I was so excited to see this Echo device at a $20 +/- price point.  It meant that I could extend coverage throughout my home.  Although I am normally a huge fan of Amazon and the Echo products, this is extremely disappointing.  After two weeks of struggling...I felt I owed others an honest review. The sound quality is very poor.  I was actually willing to let that go, accepting that it could be reasonable for the price I paid.  I just grabbed the good BT speakers I had sitting around and paired them to my Mini's.  When connected, the speaker sound is good because I have very good speakers...but the Mini still sends garbled audio to the speakers when Alexa is talking.  Another problem is that the Mini drops the connection a lot. Integration with Alexa is somewhat dicey.  I have Dots, Alexa on my phone and laptop and have used the Invoke for years...so I know what to reasonably expect.  With the Mini, I can say ""turn off bedroom light"" get the response, ""I can't find a device called bedroom light,"" *immediately* repeat the command verbatim (""turn off bedroom light"") and have the Mini say ""OK"" and turn off the light.  This type of burp is common. I experience inconsistent availability.  I will say ""Alexa"" and it may be a number of seconds until she ""listens"" (the listening sound is also flaky, so I've learned not only to wait for the sound but look at the LED) or she will not start listening at all.  I may have to say ""Alexa"" a few times...  A few times, I've just given up and gone on my laptop or phone. I'm experienced with these devices.  I've had the Invoke and Dot in the same location with no problems.  I also have a mesh network and routers in every room that has a Mini...my network is strong (I also have smart TVs and experience no lag in streaming...) and I have these devices identified as ""priority"" in the network configuration (so nothing else on the router will be using more bandwidth). Which brings me to the last thing that jumps to mind...  The ""listening sound"" is inconsistent.  Sometimes it bonks, sometimes it doesn't.  The the Mini is not in eyesight where you can check for the LED, you just have to guess whether or not the Mini is ready.  Really an irritation. To be honest, I would love to pack up all the Mini's and return them with the light accessory I purchased (the cost of the Mini and light are the same as one Dot).  I would immediately buy Dots to replace them.  But I was so excited when they arrived that I threw away the packaging.  DUH!  A newbie mistake by someone who should know better!  So I guess I'm sadly stuck with them.  😢",Not worth the money...Buy a Dot for $20 more.

The speaker quality isn't great but thats not what I bought it for...I put it in a bathroom off of my office and the problem is that while i'm sitting at my desk with an echo show in front of me, the echo flex in my bathroom acts on everything i say...if I try to set a reminder or an alarm, the echo show on my desk ignores me and the reminder is set in my bathroom. I have to shut the door to make this work. Occasionally this happens with other models but coming from someone who has Echo's in every room, I can tell you this is different.

It seems to pick up our voices as well as any of the other Echo units. It also provides us with two USB ports for charging- A handy feautre.

If you buy this expecting a quality speaker, then you didn't read the description from Amazon. Amazon says the built-in speaker is low quality not recommended for listening to serious things.

I use this in my bedroom since my Echo Dot can't easily hear my commands (it's located in my living room). It's not nearly as sensative as the Echo Dot, but it does work and for the price that's not really an issue. I need to remove it from the wall socket and use an exension cord to put it into a location where it'll hear me speak a littler better. The audio out of it is very low even after giving the command volume 10. I'll be attaching an external speaker to it.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Nov-20,my2cents,I purchased two Echo Flex units each with motion sensors to control the Smart lights in two rooms.  I set routines to turn the overhead light on when it detected motion and another routine to turn the light out when motion was not detected after one minute.  They were both working perfectly until a few days ago.  Now the motion sensors have both stopped registering when motion is not detected and they will no longer turn the lights out.  Other users are reporting exactly the same problem in forums so it is apparently programming Amazon has pushed making these units now useless for my needs.,No longer runs my motion sensor routines correctly
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Jan-20,Physics Girl,"The Echo Flex has been a nice addition to our household, which already included a 3rd gen Echo Dot and an Echo Input. I got it primarily to add a motion sensor to our living room, and it lives up to its promise for that application. When paired with the motion sensor, it's a cheap upgrade to the little bit of home security offered by Alexa Guard. I was able to create a routine that sends me an alert on my phone when motion is detected as well as turning on lights and blaring an alarm sound from the speakers connected to my Input. It's easy enough to enable this routine from my phone when leaving and disable it when I get home. The Flex has also been handy for night time routines that automatically turn off living room lights when no one is moving around but turn on a very dim light for a few minutes when motion is detected. Setup was effortless, and the build quality is impressive for such a cheap device. The Flex gets a fair amount of use as an intercom, allowing us to drop in on each other when on different levels of the house. The built-in speaker quality is pretty terrible, but Amazon is upfront about Flex's limitations in this regard, and it's adequate for use as an intercom, checking the weather and news, and getting responses from Alexa. The Flex paired readily with my UE Roll 2 over Bluetooth and also includes an aux out port. Indeed, I find myself grabbing it to bring to the bathroom to control podcasts and music played over my waterproof Roll while enjoying a soak in the tub. I've found so many more uses for this gizmo than I anticipated, and I'd give it a hearty five star endorsement and suggest it replace the Input for most users if it weren't for one factor: the microphones. The change to two far field microphones from the four on the Dot and Input has handicapped the Flex. It picks up the wake word and commands just fine in a quiet bathroom a few feet away from the tub, but performance suffers greatly if there is noise or in a bigger room. In sharp contrast to my experiences with the Dot and Flex, I find myself having to raise my voice and frequently repeat myself when Alexa can't understand the first time. My husband, who has some speech impediments, finds the Flex so frustrating he would like me to get a different device for the living room and relegate the Flex to motion detection only, its microphone switched off.","Makes my smart home smarter when paired with motion detector, but microphones need improvement."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jul-20,Muscman,"Was excited about the flex, but it just okay at best.  It's not really powerful and constantly disconnects from the wifi.  But it must listen well because it responds to asking Alexa anything even when not in the room.  That gets a little annoying.  Ask Kitchen Echo something and the Flex in the bathroom also responds (even with the bathroom door closed), usually saying it can't connect. So then I have two Alexas talking at the same time and not about the same thing. I don't see the benefit of a motion sensor or night light for my application, but an add on speaker accessory...that would be great.",Meh!

We got her the echo flex to plug into her room and it’s been great for everything she could need but with one exception. The volume controlled by Alexa on my flex device seems to be wonky. It kind of jumps around a little bit on volume on its own. But it’s a great little device that does all that Alexa is enabled to do for our household and more skills to come.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Aug-20,Jim from Boston,"I use the Flex with the optional night light, and am very happy with it.  It illuminates the upstairs hallway at night, and I like the ability to change colors by voice, or routines.  As expected, the speaker is small so I do not use it for music, but do use it for sports score updates, weather, time, voice commands to other smart home devices including an air conditioner.  The location at the top of the stairs could only be served by the Flex, the larger devices would not be feasible.  I have other Echo devices with better speakers when I want to listen to music, or streaming radio.  I have no complaints with the sound as I knew beforehand it was not designed for music.

I wanted to be able to say, ""Alexa, send a message to the flex saying it's time for bed."" I contacted Amazon to find out how to do this and was told that this option is not available on the flex.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Sep-20,Rochelle holland,I wanted to give this device a chance so I decided to wait almost a year before giving it a complete review. Why I bot this and not the echo dot: -I bought this device because it was under $20 that was the main reason the other reason was because it plugged directly into the wall and it had the option to purchase a nightlight attachment. I like the fact that echo has the ability to drop in two different devices throughout the home if I want to announce some thing I can announce it to every device in the house I like that feature and this was a way to put one in the man cave so I can call my husband down when I need him. My husband is also horrible at keeping his phone charged so because he spends all his time in the man cave I can call him on the device if I need him. Pros: -Having an Alexa device in another room of the house at a very very affordable price all the benefits of Alexa Low price - love the night light attachment - It plugs directly into the wall -I have a ring doorbell this device let my husband know someone is at the door when he is up in his man cave Cons: Horrible sound quality I don’t know if it’s my device or the device period.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Nov-20,Dean Michael,I was under the impression Echo Flex is supposed to tie into my Echo Show basically making it one single network but it didn't work that way.

I find the phone and told Alexa to hang up the phone but Echo Flex said we aren't on a call to hang up.  I had to go back into the room where I originally said the command and ask it to hang up again.  If that's how they work then what's the point?

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Dec-19,Brian G. Hughes,"Since the introduction of the echo+ with ZigBee technology I have kind of geeked out with the smart home devices, basically every time I decide its inconvenient to walk up a set of stairs to turn out a light, I put in a smart switch. Once I put in a switch I also want to be able to voice control it, in this case I put a smart switch on the main light in our bonus room, then decided to put in the flex so the kids could voice control the light. I really like the formfactor where it gets power and is also mounted by plugging it into a standard outlet. Obviously the 0.7 inch built-in speaker is not going to be a viable option for streaming audio, but if you ask it the outside temp you can hear the resulting answer. And its fine for what I intended, turning the light on and off. Negatives... about a week after I received my $24 flex, the current generation Echo Dot's went on sale for about the same price. apples to apples, I would get the Echo dot every time. If Amazon were to make the price of these proportionable to the capability, like $10 I would put one in every room.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Aug-20,Mike W.,"Purchased  the Echo Flex to replace an Echo Dot without taking up shelf space or requiring a long dangling power cord.  Definitely provides the Alex functionality and stays conveniently out of the way, so very successful in those respects. I expected there to be a tradeoff in sound quality due to the small size, but since I mostly use it with an external bluetooth speaker, this is not a problem for me.  However, one thing I did not expect is that the microphone that picks up your speaking voice also seems to be less sophisticated than the Echo Dot. Overall, I'd say that things do work OK, but sometimes I do need to speak more loudly and towards the Echo Flex as I talk.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-May-20,Los Angeles Windows,"My Echo 2nd gen. is hooked up to my stereo via 3.5mm to RCA connectors. I play Amazon music on the Echo and it streams through my home's stereo system. The Flex cannot be connected via RCA, unless you are ok with hearing a hum in the speakers. Amazon sent me a 2nd Flex and it had the same issue so it is most likely a flawed design with a grounding issue causing the hum. My bluetooth speaker has a 3.5 mm input and hooking up through that input works fine. Another design negative is that if Echo or Flex are hooked up to a stereo, their apps audio settings for bass, mids and treble won't alter the music tone. Only when music is playing through the Echo devices internal speaker, can the tones be adjusted using the app. I'm not sure that the app integration is the best. I thought I had everything set correctly but when trying to play music through the Flex, it would sometimes play through the Echo 2nd gen.. I may not understand the app well enough, not sure but either way, I think the app language and logic isn't great.",Flex hum/grounding noise with 3.5mm to RCA plugs

I know nothing about computer technology,  but I can read,  and I read these reviews. Thank you to all ! This was not immediate gratification,  it was patience. I followed all the easy directions for pairing the devices with my Echo. The Flex responded and said ""you are connected"" ( you must be within 10 feet of your Amazon Echo/Alexa to pair the flex ) They were "" on line "" according to the Echo App,  but they were not responding. It was the ""wake work ""  that was not connecting.  A issue many people seem to be having. I left it alone overnight,  re-booted my internet in the early morning ,  and I was connected. Now both Flex were responding to the  ""wake word"".  The App now also showed them connected with the ""wake word""  ( they STILL were not before the morning reboot ) Luck,  patience,  time,  the system reboot,  did I do something wrong during the initial set up.....I can not say. I can say they are now working perfect. The Flex are very convenient and worth the cost. The sound is similar to a transistor radio from days ago, but so is the price !

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Oct-20,David Goldblatt,"I have a larger echo third generation and a first generation Echo Dot on our main floor.  I wanted to have an echo device when I go downstairs to the basement for just having a little background music or news or perhaps to look up something.  The echo flex appears to have only two microphones as opposed to multiple microphones around the perimeter of the dot and the echo.  As a result you have to be fairly close to the flex to have it picked up your voice. The built-in speaker is very small so naturally it  does not have a lot of volume or sound quality. Fortunately it does have a USB jack and a stereo mini jack for output.  By combining the echo flex with an  external speaker by Meetue  also sold by Amazon, that makes up for the lack of volume and sound clarity coming from the device. For less  than the cost of an Echo Dot you have a pretty workable system that sounds pretty good.  The speech recognition probably works as well as the larger echoes but the lack of the additional microphones forces you to be facing the device and be closer to it which Impacts its speech recognition.",The echo flex does a very good job if it is combined with an external amplified speaker.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Dec-19,Kevin,The Echo Flex is basically a lower quality Dot. The speaker is adequate for getting info from Alexa but the quality is very poor for playing music for instance. I like that it plugs directly into a wall socket and doesn't cover up the other plug. Also it has a USB A port for charging your devices or plugging in one of the accessories. I don't have any of the accessories as I am waiting for more variety being available. I did notice that the mic is not as sensitive as the one on the Dot. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall I like the Echo Flex.

With that being said the one I got often doesn’t recognize my voice, and when it does it lags to turn on some of the lights in my apartment unlike my Echo Dot. I’ve been having a lot of problems with it ever since I got it, and currently it’s having issues connecting to the internet while my Echo Dot is connected perfectly.

I eventually plugged it in by the kids bathroom as a nightlight. It's in a spot a bit further from my other devices, so it's a good supplement. You can control the nightlight by voice, change color.

Walls and objects like empty boxes easily disrupt it.  Not to mention, when playing music on these devices, the sound level is so low, you are better off playing your Alexa device in one room and while in another location.  The connection gets continuously lost, and you have to re-establish it by bringing it back to the primary Alexa device again.  The initial connection process leaves much to be desired.  The directions are not as straightforward as it can be.  Even the customer service told me to disregard them as they walked me through them.  My advice is if you are going to purchase one of these, purchase one at a time until you see how it works for you.  Please do not do like I did buy four of them, and be stuck all four wall plugs.

Sounds quality isn’t great, but that’s no surprise given the size  I didn’t buy it to listen to music. If you want a quick and easy way to expand Alexa functionality all over the house, this a great accessory.",Great little Echo
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Nov-19,Ben Pflieger,"I really love this product. I got this, plus the motion sensor, for my home office. I have an old home and the room I use as an office has no light switch and the outlets are not near the door in any way, meaning you need to walk through the room to turn on any of the lamps. I already have a Feit Smart Bulb in one lamp and with the Flex and the motion sensor, I was able to easily set a routine for the light to turn on when I enter the room and then turn off after a set amount of time when no motion is detected. Additionally, I can use voice commands on the Flex to change the color, dim, turn it off, etc. At times, the motion sensor works better than others, but overall, it works wonderfully. The sound quality on the Flex is nothing great and I would personally not use it as a speaker to play music. I truly see this device as just being a great way to give voice control to areas in your home where you don't need/want a different Echo device, or to have very affordable motion sensing capabilities.",Great Addition to a Smart Home
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Feb-20,Laura Killian,I love the mini Alexa! I bought it for my 13 year old son's room as he is alone sometimes when I work late. it is perfect for me to get him to answer when he is too busy on YouTube and he cannot hear the main Alexa in the kitchen. All I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go I have not played music on it but I have done relaxing sounds like rainfall and it sounded very clear and soothing. I just bought another one for my room as my kids sometimes likes to be in my room so I can get in touch with him when I need to and he's at the house by himself. You can never have too much technology to keep an eye on your kid.,Great way to keep in touch with teens and latchkey kids.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Jan-20,Jim.Moor,"Pros: Excellent voice recognition No cord Able to use usb for sensor, etc Sensor unit has 2 level sensitivity Cons: Cheaper sensors available that can point, this combo is more expensive if only sensor is needed. Limited to where you have outlets Not able to prioritize 2nd Alexa in same room, since this is so sensitive it tries to take over whole room. Big & clunky Sensor not aim-able (see pic of card taped to block an area), also note that microphone is disabled. Takeaway: Dot is more versatile, better sound by far.

I bought the nightlight with mine, and that works great.  I have another Echo spot in the same room for listening to music, so I have the Flex speaker turned off.  I just wish I could turn off the red LED, as every time I see it, I think, ""Uh oh... something is wrong!"" then I remember it's just muted.  I guess you can't have it all.  Other than that, it's nice to have the nightlight be voice controlled.  I got mine at the introductory price, and I don't think I would spend full price on one...

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Dec-19,Ed,You need a plug with nothing around it and probably not close to the floor.. Plug it in to a plug about a foot off the floor with a bookshelf about a foot to the side of it and it worked okay but I have to speak louder for it to hear me.  Works better in the kitchen plug at counter height. For the current price compared to the Echo Dot or Echo Show 5 I would say the Echo Dot or Echo Show 5 is the better deal. However if it were priced at half the price of an Echo Dot then I might be a good buy depending on if you have ideal place to plug it in.,Pricey For What It Does

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-May-20,Nicole/Frederic,"You definitely don't want to start your Alexa experience with the flex, but it is a good little addition to a small bathroom or kitchen. The sound quality isn't the greatest so having a bluetooth speaker if you want to listen to music is a must, & the mic doesn't seem to pick up very well from very far away. Otherwise this little guy is convenient since it plugs straight into the wall, so no worry about food or water getting to it.

So I tried them.  Not much range of volume.  Full blast is equal to about a 4 on the dot, and a 1 on the flex is like a 2 on the dot.  disappointing.  The next issue was setup.

A definite buy in my book (we have two of these). The price is right.

With this, Alexa can hear me all downstairs allowing me to set timers, drop in or play music from my speaker without having to yell.

Zuckett,"Exactly what I wanted, I used it as a motion sensor to turn on lights and of course as an additional Alexa in a side room.  The only gotcha I have is its microphone is better than the Echo Show in the main area.  At times when I am asking Alexa a question the Flex answers and not the Show (even though I am much closer to the Show).  I solved this by changing its wake word but it would be great to have this pick issue corrected (same problem upstairs with my other Show and Echo v2 btw). As to sound, I figured it was not the best but I have never expected the units themselves to have ""great"" speakers so no issue for me there.

As other reviewers have stated, the internal speaker is really bad, somewhat reminiscent of the old portable transistor radios of the 60s, but if you pair this with a good Bluetooth speaker, you'll be really happy. I bought this as an alternative to the Echo Dot which needs a separate power source. The Flex plugs directly into a socket and I simply pair my Bose speaker using Bluetooth.

The echo flex's strongpoint is hallways and in bathrooms. I think it is great for places that an echo dot isnt good for. It is small, and the night light attachment is wonderful. I use Alexa as the wake work for my echo dots and Echo as the wake word for both flexes. It helps with only waking one device instead of two. My echo flex can do everything my dot can just with a smaller speaker and such. When I walk to the kitchen I ask my hallway flex to turn on the kitchen smart bulbs, and when I walk out I tell her to turn them off. It is the perfect sidekick to the echo dot to me, and I highly recommend it. It beats having to buy a wallmount for an echo dot to do what the flex can do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Jul-20,Thomas R Scott,"Relatively inexpensive.  The audio is nothing to crow about but it is sufficient as long as not listening to music. Voice recognition seems great. Only took 10-15 minutes to unpack and integrate into my existing system with Alexa on another device. It is portable within the structure wherever there is power. So easy to move to another room if I choose to upgrade to an Echo Dot or something in this room.  Thus, no loss of investment if I want something with better sound or some, as yet unknown, additional feature. Very satisfied.",Great little addition!

This just plugs in under my desk and can do the things I need, like add something to shopping list, get my calendar, the weather, and control lights, etc.  Sound quality is a little ""tinny"" I think, but I didn't expect much from a plug-in device such as this.

I was not expecting HD sound from such a small device but the Flex's sound is a big downgrade from even an early version of the Echo Dot and as such it is not really great for streaming music.

It also has issues integrating with my Alexa/Hue smart home configuration. There are specific rooms setup with lights that it will not control. For example, if I say “Alexa, turn off the basement lights” the Flex will respond with “I don’t know that device.” None of my other Echo dots have any issues with this, just the Flex does.

This was a small compromise, as the ability to set timers in the kitchen and not have alarms going off in other rooms made the Flex worth it.","Great for small spaces, audio needs improvement"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Mar-20,Stephanie K.,"We were looking for (something) that would help with our son's bedtime routine as sneaking out of his room after being put to bed was obviously more exciting than actually going to sleep at a decent hour... We opted away from the Dot/Kids Dot as we didn't want the unit within reach for even more distraction (out of sight out of mind mentality) and the Flex direct plug was able to be perfectly hidden in a corner plug behind the bed. For the most part, the voice recognition works just as well as our other devices ... besides the times our son is using his silly voice so totally his fault. As some other reviews mentioned, the speaker isn't as great as other devices, but also wouldn't expect it to be. We do play sleep stories/sounds at a low volume as part of our bedtime routine and haven't had any issues with the sound.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Sep-20,Patrick L Ball,"So I bought four echo flex to create a in home intercom system so my wife didn't have to shout at the top of her lungs to get myself or our home care assistant attention. I created a series of routines for her to say ""Alexa, I need help"" for the system to announce ""____ needs assistance"" or if she asks for to contact me in my study. I created another routine for her to contact my phone but haven't really test drive that one very much. Otherwise the units are great for setting reminders, checking time, setting timers, alarms, checking the weather, playing poor sound quality music, listening to NPR. I have no need to order stuff so that feature is ignored. In addition, it alerts me on Amazon apps updates and deliveries. The ""drop in"" feature is a bit muggy but that has to do with sound levels of the units needing to be lower than usually to accommodate our home needs. I opted not use that feature for the com and instead having Alexa say the need for assistance. Most of this stuff like adjusting volume and setting routines required some research from users rather than Amazon itself. One feature I would like is for Alexa to acknowledge when I say thank you. Me and my wife are just that polite so say it often and I just like to show appreciation to my little AI.

The sound quality was never supposed to be its appeal.  The Flex is small, takes less space than either Echo Dots (with the special outlet mounts), and pairs easily with Bluetooth speakers.

I also paired it with Sengled light bulb Bluetooth speakers and now they have quality sound without needing to take up limited counter space.  The only problem I've noticed is that the Mic is not as sensitive and is not able to pickup commands as easily as the Echo dots it replaced.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Dec-19,Adam Brooks,"I wanted this to work. I'm not sure if it's this device or something about Amazon software that's buggy. Like some other people have mentioned, the timing in routines doesn't work. I have a 5 minute timer, but it turns off after 2. I haven't continued to troubleshoot, but that's a pretty basic function they should be able to get right.  I bought this to act as a microphone and a motion sensor. I have two different dots mounted in a remote space that feed speakers by where I placed the flex. As is well understood, the speaker on the flex sucks. No problem, except that I want to turn it off. Doesn't seem possible, so now I have to listen to this tinny sounding POS.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Mar-20,Dennis Keane,"I regularly call into our house to check on the kids using the Drop In feature.  On our previous Echo Dot, the kids could talk relatively normal and I would be able to hear them.  With the Flex, they have to be a bit closer and shout a bit for it to pick up what they are saying. It is all or none too, if they are too far away or not talking loud enough - you hear nothing - not muffled or too soft.  So the microphones are a bit less sensitive than our old Dot.  Other than that,  works fine.",Drop In Calls are Tough
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Nov-20,Mr. B,"It's pretty good. But it has its down side. The speaker isn't that loud but works adequately. The voice recognition has issues a little. This is the smallest of the echos it would work well for a kitchen or bedroom, maybe bathroom depending on a person's needs.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Aug-20,Chris O.,"Set up easy and works just fine. Has no problem with the wifi connection. Just a little on the chunky side, but acceptable considering the USB ports. The speaker, though, is shockingly bad. Volume is OK for a bedroom, but the sound quality is just awful. Not just music either - even Alexa sounds a bit harsh, like she's shouting over an old payphone in a cafeteria.  Makes my Echo Dot sound positively symphonic by comparison.","Compact and Convenient, but sound quality is quite bad"

I can drop in or announce it’s time for dinner or ask him a question if I’m not home. I don’t have to yell down there haha. The sound quality isn’t as good as the dot but it works.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Nov-19,Matthew Kilburn,Delivered as expected. Easily set up. Just took a few moments to get connected to Wi-Fi and to set up itself. Including changing the Wake word. Sound is expected as it is compact. Not as well-rounded as the main echo or the echo Dot. But it works clearly. I have yet to look into any of the add on items such as a night light. But I will update my review when I do get that. But this also controls the wireless lighting I have in my home from Philips Hue bulbs. And it is working excellently as advertised.,Excellent addition to the echo family.

The sound is really tinny. If you're looking for whole house sound, skip the Flex and buy an Echo or an Echo Dot.

I purchased this Flex with a night light attachment. The speaker is decent. Honestly, it could be better, but it does the job. It gets decently loud, but I have to say it's not as loud as a Echo Spot or anything. We use this for the family in the kitchen, where there are Spanish-only speakers and English speakers.  The Alexa portion is very helpful in that way. We are really happy with how the product looks and performs!

I also can’t get it to work with my other Alexa devices. In the bathroom, it is an outlet hog so if you have 4 outlets together, this thing is just too big.

It plugs on the wall so no power adapter needed. I use it to play light music so it does the job.  I don't listen to the heavy metal or anything in high volumn anyway.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Oct-20,K. V. Harris,I've bought about 6 or more of these. They're great for playing music/sound from various apps including Amazon Prime Music and Spotify. A great feature is the line-out 3.5mm jack. I use it to connect to larger self-powered speakers or sound systems. The grouping feature is helpful too since I can set up zones and send music to many Echo Flexes at the same time.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Feb-20,Brian B.,"I was really excited to use this and even bought the nightlight add-on for added utility.  The microphones do not seem to pick up my voice nearly as well as the Dots I have around the house.  I tried talking to the Flex from 2 feet away and the Dot more than 20 feet away activated, which is kind of a testament of the mics in the Dot, but not great for the Flex.  I had to get closer to it and speak more quietly for it to work.  It continually frustrates my wife because it will not respond.  The integrated speaker is just too quiet and I have to leave it at max volume to hear it at a normal volume.  Concept is great but in reality it left me wanting more. I do like the form factor though and ease of placement.  I will say though that the night light has been great and I love the ability to change colors.",Great form factor but needs improvement!

I have amazing hearing but I can not hear this over the faucet or shower or even my ceiling fan (admitted a rather loud one). I’d hate to try multiple noises such as kids goofing off or a vent fan. Terribly disappointed. One can not simply quit an excellent audiobook at a crucial plot point...nerds everywhere will surely understand. It is not designed to offer excellent music playback (this I knew) but I had expected better voice capability/quality. It would, however, make an excellent night light and story playback device for a child’s bedroom or perhaps dedicated voice chat device for people working from home but is largely useless outside of this sort of niche.",Dreadful disappointment sadly

The speaker's not the greatest but it is certainly good. The only complaint I have is that it's VERY bulky.

I thought I’d give it a try because it seemed to be convenient to have this directly plugged near the kitchen counter so that I could listen while cooking and cleaning. I thought slightly worse sound quality should still be bearable. Well, I was totally wrong. I couldn’t stand the sound even  for a few minutes and had to remove it almost immediately. I switched it with an old echo mini and use the mini in the kitchen for listening purpose, and put the flex somewhere else just to give commands to control smart devices. Even for that purpose it seems to be inferior to echo mini. I put the flex at exactly the same spot where I used to put my echo mini, but somehow it doesn’t catch my commands as easily as my echo mini, and I had to talk louder sometimes.

While, understandably, the sound quality is not great — in a small space it fits, connects with all my other echo dots, and is programmed to do five things in the morning for me when I rise and am brushing teeth for work.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Jan-20,soc,"The Flex works well for all AI functions (takes your instructions) - exactly as you'd expect from any Alexa device. The plug in format is helpful in some cases ... but the sound quality and severe volume limit make it limited as a speaker.  Since a DOT is roughly the same size, with hugely better sound quality ...  plug-in vs powercord management + $10 is the only reason to go w a Flex vs a DOT.  If you want it to ""play"" something vs simply take your instructions, I'd go with a DOT.","Nice format and great for taking instructions like ""lights off/on"""

I suggested to our elderly parents to have these in bathrooms in case of emergency. They could notify of trouble with announcements or drop in. Also testing the add on motion detector. When it works, 75% of the time, it's great. Once again the motion detector could be used to turn on lights on the way to the restroom at night.

If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the Dot, the flex qualifies. It will pretty much do the same thing. It’s one drawback is it’s sound quality. It is very tinny. It does allow you to hook up speakers but adding the cost of speakers takes away any savings. Since I use the flex to turn on lights (with the use of smart plugs) the flex works fine. If I wanted to listen to music (I.e Pandora, Sirius, I heart, etc)?the tinny sounding flex would be painful. Hope that helps anyone interest in buying one.","Flex uses a cheap tinny sounding speaker.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,3-May-20,Mike Connors,"Set-up was a piece of cake. Just launch the Alexa app, plug it in, and Alexa takes over. It does take a few minutes for the AP to recognize the unit and prompt you to start the set-up, depending on the WiFi strength in the area you plug it in to. I bought 3 for several rooms in the house, and I only had to set up voice recognition on only one of them. The music is a little tinny. But, in all fairness, Amazon does tell you that music quality is not the best without an additional speaker plugged into the 35mm Jack, and I didn't buy them strictly to expand listening to music throughout the house. The size of the unit is non-obtrusive and it has a convenient USB port underneath for charging a phone, adding a speaker or one of the optional accessories available for the Flex.

It helps me set the alarm, weather report, latest news, add action items to my to-do list, and play my favorite song, Switch-off/on the connected devices; it can work as an intercom. Cons: I am a native Tamil Language Speaker. Tamil is one of the oldest languages of this world, still spoken globally, and there are 75 million people in various countries speaking this language. So, I am curious when Alexa would start speaking in Tamil. I do see Alexa has issues with recognizing the audiobook titles (audible) in the Tamil language. Alexa has acquired a lot of new skills now since when it was released. I can easily perform simple actions now, and I feel that it might take some years for Alexa to answer more intelligently.","Alex has more skills now, but I am curious about when it will start speaking in Tamil?"

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Dec-19,Jay G,Perfectly fine but likely has a rather limited use cases.  Would likely be more attractive if the plugin module allowed both a nightlight and motion detector.  It continues an annoying trend where you can’t rely on the closest device to respond which is aggravating when setting timers or reminders.  Amazon really needs better sensitivity control than simply on or off.,Fine if you have a specific need

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Dec-19,DPerry,"This is the echo custom built for the bathroom but it suffers from more faults than useful features. We’ve had our echo flex for about two weeks and would not recommend this device to friends or family. It’s a bit ironic that a device with the word echo in the name is severely limited in reliability due to the bouncy, echo-y sound environment of a typical bathroom. We have to shout or constantly repeat commands for the flex to hear and obey. Without a doubt the speaker is so weak that it can only be classified as barely functional. On the positive side of things, the nightlight attachment is fantastic. Also, setup of the flex is the fastest and easiest process of any of the multiple echo products we have owned. Final word: Spend five more bucks for an echo gen 3 and you won’t regret it.",Weak product but great idea

Boom, it is done! This has been so great. We really appreciate it. Also, my 9 and 13 yr. old love playing trivia games on it.

But when I'm in another room and trying to talk to my Fire tablet, it somehow hears me all the time. Obviously when I'm talking to my tablet, I want it to open an app. But for some unknown reason, the Flex assumes I must be talking to it even though it's about 40 feet away.

At times I can't even hear her. There has also been several times the voice recognition hasn't even acknowledged my voice. I have asked Alexa a few times in a roll (close up to the device) before with no response. I would eventually give up and login onto my app to do what I am asking her to do.

The best reason for getting this is for the USB addons, either the night light or, in my case, the motion sensor. I mounted it in my garage on our freezer using a old hard drive magnet, an extension cord, and a few twist ties. Now Alexa automatically turns on the garage light when I open the door to go in there(and after 15 mins of no motion it turns it off in case I forget to ask it to turn it off myself). So far so good, and If I want any other motion sensors, this is probably the easiest solution for a house that's already bought in to working with Alexa.",Buy this for either the motion sensor or nightlight.

The kids room we use it as a noise machine at night and the kids like to play music during the day while they are playing. The only down side is that the voice recognition isn’t the best.

With the Echo Flex, I find myself having to repeat the trigger word and commands multiple times even when standing less than 5 feet from the device. By comparison, I can speak at normal volume and my Dots can hear me from across the room without issue. A few times, though the Flex right next to me wouldn't hear my command, I would be answered by one of my Dots in an adjacent room. The two pinhole mics on the Flex just can't pick up your voice as well as the multiple mics on the Dots. The Flex would also lose its connection to my bluetooth speaker periodically, which my Dots never did. Spend a few bucks more for the Dot and save yourself the frustration.",Hard pass.

It can fit into places that might not be so convenient for the bulkier Alexa models. The small size combined with that low price tag has got me putting them everywhere in my house. It has all the functionality that you’ve come to expect from Alexa devices. The only con is the small sound. It just doesn’t have the volume of the other devices. I think it’s to be expected for its size. It does have a 3mm port to plug in a auxiliary cord to connect it to other devices as well as Bluetooth support.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Feb-20,crb42,"I had an Echo Dot in my bathroom to listen to the news when I shaved in the morning.  The problem was it took up counter space and was prone to getting splashed.  The Echo Flex plugs directly into the outlet so is off the counter and out of harm's way.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jan-20,Chris Caudill,"This is a great little Echo device and for $20 it's hard to be too critical, but I would love it if the speaker got a little louder (it's a bit hard to hear from across the room) and the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as the new echo dots. I would also love it if the device was *slightly* narrower (it almost blocks the light switch next to it) but I really like that I don't have 2 feet of extra power cable sitting on the kitchen counter and the USB port on the bottom is great as well.",Almost Perfect
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Feb-20,Trish,"I thought it would be great to add a speaker to Alexa in different parts of the house.  Unfortunately this speaker must be plugged into an outlet less than 10 feet from Alexa.  And doesn't really work if you're 6-10 feet away and there's a wall between the two items.  Also even within 10 feet of Alexa, you'd think having stereo with multiple speakers, well this little twit has terrible tinny sound, and tiny sound. So simply detracts from the sound of Alexa.  I'd return them but I bought them few months ago and put them back in the box but then forgot about them.  Trying to save you the trouble now.",This product has little to no value
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Feb-20,ZoomFROG,"I guess I should have expected less for my $20. The sound quality is horrible, the max volume is still too low to be heard from a distance. Considering this thing plugs into a wall outlet, placement location is limited. Many home outlets are located behind furniture, TVs, bookcases, desks, etc.  I like the concept but it just isn't as useful as I had expected.  Perhaps the kitchen counter outlets are the best use for this device. Forget about listening to music on the Echo Flex. The sound quality just isn't good enough.",Sound quality is disappointing.

It’s a small device that comfortably fits at any wall outlet. It’s ideal for hallways and in places you want to be able to access Alexa and not have to have something big and bulky protruding from the wall. Now I will warn you the sound quality is not like the Echo Dot. It resembles the sound quality of the new iPhone in my opinion.

I also observe similar problems in the echo show 5, which also has 2 microphones.

Now, we can just ask for a Pandora station, an amazon station or FM station to play  in this area and it does!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,Drumlord29,"I added another echo device to my collection! I've got every single kind of echo in the market. For obvious reasons, the speaker isn't the best. It is surprisingly smaller than I thought. I use it in my garage for when I close the garage using Alexa. I have the MyQ garage opener which i can open or close with my echo auto in my car. But after I turn off my engine, so does my echo auto. So I have to pull out my phone or manually push the garage opener on the wall. So I plugged it underneath my garage door opener so I can tell Alexa to close or open the garage door from anywhere in my garage without my phone or pushing a button. I don't really intend to use this for playing music. It's really for doing simple Alexa tasks in my garage. It is an echo device that is not meant to look and sound pretty. It's Alexa at its most basic form. Small, no cables, small speaker, and works like any echo device. I believe it's meant for a garage bathroom or hallway if uppity have the night light or motion detector accessory. If you want to play music with it, a bluetooth or wired speaker is highly recommended. Although I had very little expectations with this being that I meant to use it to just open and close my garage, I did notice one negative thing on it. I tried adjusting thre volume from the Alexa app but it switches back to 70% everytime. No idea why. Perhaps there built in speaker is best heard at 70% and if connected to a better speaker, it will allow for a louder volume. I'm going yo have to try that someday. But for now, it's perfect for what I wanted to use it for. If you know what you need it for, don't expect it to be more than that. If you want a better sound, get a dot or something bigger. For simple uses, this will do fine for all your Alexa needs. I may use it for my echo microwave which is currently paired with my echo input connected to a speaker. Don't blame the equipment if you want it to do more than what the hardware can achieve. Be fair to the gadget on what it is capable of doing.","Small, not for music, great for basic Alexa"

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jan-20,KT - Six Eight Tall,"We are here to pump up this review! Amazon Flex? More like Amazon Flabby... Ya! This device is so puny that it must go back to the gym to earn it's name! Here is our loser friend to explain why such a flabby device can only lift one star.... <clears throat> Mmmm k. As avid Amazon smart product users, we purchased the Flex based on it's small design form (in that it would occupy the least amount of space and be a perfect kitchen addition to keep our counters open). On this front it is perfect. Speaking in the kitchen, the Echo Dot Second Generation in our living room was actually picking up our voices better than the Flex which was in the same room. To Echo* what other reviewers have said, the sound on this device is tinny and distracting. Considering most smart phones can generate, the small footprint of the Flex isn't a great excuse in 2020 for skimping on sound to this extent. With commands and recipes is was displeasing but with music it was downright distracting. Imagine an old building doorway intercom speaker as an upgrade to this and you get what I mean. I'm guessing the positive reviews are mainly concerned with the small footprint which again, is excellent but even at a discount we had to return this and the accompanying motion sensor in favor of mounting another Echo speaker in our kitchen. Here's hoping Amazon invests just a tiny bit more on the quality of the speaker and microphone array though for future generations of this product because this first gen Flex was an absolute miss for our household. * puns provided free of charge for this unbiased loser review",Did someone say Flex?
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Nov-19,Barbara Black,"I have an Echo and an Echo Show, both of which are great.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jul-20,Moore Family,"I got the Echo Flex to go along with weatherproof Bluetooth speakers on our covered deck. I Love that there are no external cables, and it's easy to unplug and take inside. The Bluetooth connection has been rock-solid so far. Things stay pretty dry on the deck, but rain does come in from the side during heavy thunderstorms, so I designed and 3D-printed a simple cover for the Echo Flex to keep it dry. So far it has stayed totally dry. If you're interested, search thingiverse dot com for ""Echo Flex Splash Guard"" and you'll find it. As far as the Echo Flex itself: I'm very happy with it as a way to play music and podcasts over Bluetooth speakers. Previously, I tried using a Google Home Mini (in a zip-lock bag) and it kept disconnecting constantly. While it's great to ask for the news, weather, etc without needing a mobile device, the voice interface can be very awkward for getting certain specific content (podcasts, albums, etc). Most of the time, you end up hearing something similar to, but not quite, what you asked for. For that reason, it's nice that you can cast to the EF from the Amazon music app. Regarding voice recognition:  we do have to yell at it a bit more than the Echo Dots inside the house. This may be due to the rain cover blocking some of the sound and/or sound dispersing more outside than it does inside. Still, not a big issue. We're in a pretty secluded area, so I'm not that worried about security, but I get that this would be an issue for folks in more crowded areas. As is well documented, anyone expecting much out of the internal speaker would be very disappointed. OTOH, it's nice that Amazon chose to release a low-cost/high-function product and still make it easy to connect to external speakers with the 3.5mm or Bluetooth interfaces. Overall, given the price, size, quality and the way I'm using it with external speakers, I'm extremely happy with the Echo Flex.",Works great with external Bluetooth speakers. 3D Printed cover makes it more weather resistant.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-20,TexasDude,This shouldn’t be an issue but it actually is and is why I took away a star. These pick up voice and respond much faster than my normal echos and echo dots (latest generations). This is a problem because I bought these for the times when I’m not really close enough to the main echos and wanted to not have to yell (What I call “filler” echos). BUT when I’m trying to talk to a closer Regular echo these pick me up too fast and from far away so they sometimes get what I’m saying wrong or they are not the specific device I was trying to control (for like music etc) USB port is pretty sweet. I have one in my bathroom that I use for a phone charge. One in the hallway that I have the motion hooked up to. And one in another hallway with the light on it for a night light and notification light. The accessory attachments respond quite fast and consistently. People comment on music sounding bad... well duh! The product specifically says these are not meant for music. I’ve actually found them useful in hallways when I have multi room music going and then the flex has low volume for vocals while passing through hallways to the next room. It’s quite pleasant.,It’s actually a problem that these can hear and respond better than normal echos
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Dec-19,BD,"I love the idea of the echo flex! We have Sonos throughout our house, and don't need to play music on our echo devices. So the echo dot has worked very nicely. However it was bulky and unattractive plugged in to the walls. The flex seemed like the perfect solution, so I bought one... and was disappointed. The size was great! Exactly what I thought it would be. But then I tried using it... It is very quiet! I have 4 small children at home and so there's always some noise happening... This echo would not work well in any kind of main room in my house because of how quiet it is. So, I moved it to the baby's room, but was still disappointed... I can be sitting right next to it and it won't wake to Alexa... I'll have to repeat to get it to respond.

The Echo Flex consistently drops out of multi room audio groups and has to be unplugged and plugged back in to resync. The built in speaker is terrible and useless if you are more than a few inches away from it. It also has by far the worst microphone and struggles to hear me even when I'm in the same room.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jan-20,Megan Campbell,"I’m not sure why there are so many negatives regarding sound on this thing. I feel this is a niche product that is meant to be a filler for home automation. I have a small apartment with 2 dots: one in my sons room, another in my main room. Our morning routine has me going to the Alexa app and turning off his alarm and turning on his music and lights for his wake up routine. I’ve wanted a voice activated device that wasn’t a full blown dot to help me automate our morning routine. I already have a nice Yamaha speaker in my room so I wasn’t wanting an echo. Also, I prefer some privacy in my bedroom (my other dots tend to pick up at random times). This will work perfectly for that purpose. I can update this review after I’ve had this for a bit. Yes the sound is smaller and a bit distorted but this isn’t meant to be a true speaker. I see it as an intercom to help automate my household. I plan on testing it bright and early tomorrow.",So far so good
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-May-20,Average Joe,"I purchased this product to extend Alexa function with my existing echo dots. I like the dots, but I was attracted to this one because of size, price, and the ability to attach another supporting device such as the motion sensor (which I also purchased). The sound volume is horrible. I was rather impressed with the dot's volume level and sound quality for their size and figured since the echo flex is roughly 60% the size of the dots, then I would have to accept around a 40% loss of volume and sound quality. WRONG!! Try about a 90% loss. Really, the volume from the flex is about the same quality and level as your cell phone is with the volume (of your cell phone) set to 10-15%. Seriously, the echo dot two rooms away can be heard over this echo flex in the same room. Next, the echo flex often loses wifi connection. For example, the two echo dots I have lost wifi connection about 6-8 times last year (collectively). More the half of these instances were for legitimate reasons (power outages mostly). The echo flex has lost internet connection more than twice this week alone (or so sayeth my phone notifications). The echo flex is only about 25 feet away from the router. The echo dots are 18 and 35 feet away from the same router. Why the flex loses wifi connection so often is unknown to me. The motion sensor add on does work. It's just that it stops working now and then. I actually sent the first one back after this happened and got a second one when it did the same thing. It took me a little while to figure out that it would begin working normally after the echo flex was unplugged, then plugged back in. In hindsight, I feel like the motion sensor I returned was not defective and that it is, in fact, the echo flex that is the heart of the issue. The echo flex motion sensor add on combo isn't reliable enough for security purposes. I feel like the echo flex was rushed into production before it could be fully developed. It doesn't have the refinement that the other echo products I have used does. Could a firmware push solve some of these issues? Probably, but I feel like the low volume is inherent to the design and cannot be fixed with software.","Low volume, product needs further development"

Also, I do have 4 google home mini. The echo devices have multiple pros compared to google home and is a must in any smart home. I installed this in my guest bathroom. Now when coming from a full-fledged device to this echo flex, definitely there are differences. My 2 cents below: Pros: - Alexa integration to all 3rd party devices works the same as all other echo devices and to set the routine is a cake piece - It Is a modular device with multiple attachments available that can go along with the device, like a clock, motion sensor, night light, etc. All other models miss this modularity - Well built product - Takes only one space on a 2-prong device, I was able to use Air Wick diffuser and Flex on a single board - Very reasonably priced Cons: - Sound is very feeble and meant for small rooms only. Listening to music is not a great experience on this device - Echo flex doesn't have far-field view technology as echo show does so sometimes it fails to trigger the recognition if you face the other side and speak",A must have voice assistant device for any smart home !!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Dec-19,l33tDad,"First of all, this is our 5th Echo device and have been more than happy with all of them, but as the headline says, it has it's flaws. First of all, don't get this for the sound quality as you will NOT be happy. The speaker is adequate for ""general"" things like announcements but is very small making music sound about as good as an inexpensive cell phone. However, I have this connected through bluetooth to a small amplifier in a kitchen cabinet which powers a couple of ceiling speakers and for this, it's fantastic. The nice thing about this device is that since it plugs directly into a wall outlet, it takes no table/counter space Why didn't I rate 5 stars? Well, the sensitivity for voice recognition is no where are good as our other devices. It's almost like I need to make it a point to speak loudly and clearly at the device for it to recognize that I'm trying to give it a command while our other Echo's can hear me from across the room looking the other way. If Amazon were able to fix this with maybe a firmware upgrade, it would be 5 stars. Other than that, it works great.","Works great, but has it's flaws"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Sep-20,Dale Hemphill,"I bought this echoflex on May 13th 2020. It worked fine until September 4th 2020. For some reason, my Amazon app would not recognize it when I try to change the Wi-Fi on the device.

However, now I am not able to accommodate my guests with music in our outdoor affair! I live less than a mile from the Amazon distribution center and I could certainly just go and buy another one for less than $24, but this one I would have thought is still under warranty, or at least I could get a suitable resolve to my problem.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Oct-20,Anita,The device is really convenient. I have it in the bathroom with a nightlight attachment. The sound quality can be compared to a typical smartphone speaker. I mostly use it to listen to NPR (talk radio) or ask about the weather forecast while I'm getting ready and for that the quality is totally fine. It wouldn't be great for listening to music loud enough to hear over running water,Perfect for NPR while I get ready in the morning
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jan-20,MarkO,"Two issues with quality. I bought it to mount on an outlet above our kitchen counter (wide open counter area)  between two of my echo devices:  one Dot 20' away - through a open arch and around a corner and an echo plus 18' away in the opposite direction in an open room but behind a wing wall. I can be facing the Flex from 5' away and either of the other echos in the other rooms will respond before the Flex. I bought the flex because sometimes the other echos can't be heard well depending on sound level set for music, and the make mistakes if not elevating my voice when adding items to list, asking for conversions etc. I basically have to really be close to it to have it work or the music playing on the other two will cut out and respond. It's why I freaking bought it. I have to be 6' away facing it directly. Second the speaker sounds just awful. I mean, I don't play any music on it at all, just the response sounds like a toy. I realize it's cheap, but I'm disappointed. I wish I would have bought a Dot 3 or used Dot 2 with a outlet mounted holder like I did for my garage workbench. Try to save a few bucks and you get what you pay for. Lastly, I thought the add on motion sensor was a cool idea until I read how horrible the reviews are for it after I bought the Flex.  At least I saved my money by not buying it as a package. Edit: Apparently my echo flex read my review and decided to be the alpha female on my first floor. Now she will be the responding device if I talk in a normal tone anywhere now on my first floor - even 4' from my other devices when the flex is almost 20' away. Except when I am 5' away from the flex and speaking directly to it, then it ignores me. It has managed to make my wife and I hate it and my two adult children when visiting have told me to get rid of it. Ordered a wall mount for an echo dot 3 that is underutilized on another floor of the house to replace the flex. I'll buy another dot next year on prime day or black Friday. The flex will - I don't know, hide it in the mechanical room in case I want to know what time it is when I change my furnace filter a few times a year.",disappointing so far.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Dec-19,Casey,"So, I am an Echo fanatic.  I have all of them except for the Echo Look (???this product is just weird). That said, I am deeply saddened by this product.  I could only bring myself to provide it a 5 start feedback on Volume Control.  It has the same volume control as any other Echo. Sadly, this is where the usefulness stopped. It is huge, it doesn't really save space over any other product, it just happens to hang on your wall.  What it does do, is look ugly and sound awful.  The speaker on the DOT is infinitely superior to this one.  Even at MAX volume, you can barely hear the responses from this echo even at a couple feet away. I think they halfheartedly  tried to make it NOT useless by adding a USB port to the bottom.  Yes it has an auxiliary port but then why not just get the Amazon Input? (which is about as useful as Amazon Auto (which you don't want to get me started reviewing)). Don't buy it unless you positively have no where to set an Echo Dot.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Dec-19,Nobody777,"What can I say?  It's an Echo device.  It does the job perfectly and I love it...  This is probably one of the easiest Echo devices to setup.  I also like its small form factor and I am currently using it in my garage to control lights and the garage door, and to drop in to chat with my wife in the house on occasion.  The device works flawlessly and I am happy with my purchase and certainly can recommend this device. My only real complaint is with the sound level...  There are no volume controls, just a default setting, which is not very loud.  It's functional and if you're standing close enough in proximity, you can hear it and it gets the job done, but I do wish it was louder.  I never expected this device to be great for anything other than basic Echo functions (which is why I bought it - to control smart devices in the garage), so I wasn't expecting great audio quality...  That having been said, a little bit more volume would have been appreciated.  For that, and that only, I have to knock off a star and give it only one star for volume control because there isn't any.  Sound quality is okay.  I can hear Alexa speaking clearly and she responds perfectly, so the two microphones work well, but since the volume is so quiet, I have to knock off a couple of stars for sound quality.  For the device to be adequately functional, it does need audio... even if it's crappy audio, it should be louder than it is. The one saving grace here is that you can plug in an external speaker (and I presume Bluetooth connections work also) so it's not a total loss here.  There are alternative options that can make the slight negatives here seem unimportant.  I have a decent Bluetooth speaker I use for music when out in the garage, so I'll just pair it up and problem solved. All-in-all, great little device that fits the budget, sets up easily, has a small form factor, and does the job.  Hard to complain about that.","Performs well, setup is easy, good price.

A small little ""Alexa"" to put in the kitchen, so that my Wife doesn't have to yell at the ""Alexa"" in the living room. I was super excited when this went on sale for $15, so I ordered one. I plugged it in, configured it and figured I was good to go. On first use, I could BARELY hear it. I though... ohhh, the volume must be all the way down. Well.... looking at the app, it was at 70%. So I turned it up to 100%. It really didn't get that much better. I mean, it's a small device, so I wasn't expecting booming sound... but the room has to be completely silent in order to hear it. My phone has a tiny little speaker and it's way louder and clearer than the Flex. In a last ditch effort, we hooked up a bluetooth speaker to it and had to power it off the USB. Having that wire and the speaker sitting next to it completely defeats the purpose of it's small form factor. I might as well just have gotten a dot.",The sound quality is horrible.

Cons - you will be lucky if you get it work, the first 3 months it was ok without any connection issues, at the same time the sound quality is the first Marconi Radio, so good enough for commands - Alexa turn on a light.

I have 6 different models of Echo including the auto. I also have request them that if they can downgrade the software so it works, but they were not willing to listen.  I'm trying to get a mesh wifi, may be that can improve the signal as they were asking me to reset all the time.

It is definitely the easiest-to-install Echo device in my network, which includes the original Echo, several Dots, and a host of Alexa-enabled devices. The only difficulty I have encountered is that the Flex's microphone seems more sensitive than the other Echo devices', and sometimes it responds to commands intended for a device in another space. Of course, this is not a serious problem, just an observation. I am very, very happy with the Flex, and I plan to obtain another.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Jan-20,Kitchen Mouse,"We have too many Echo devices, by some folks’ standards — a Spot in two bedrooms, a Dot in another bedroom and a Dot in the garage, and a Show.  The show was originally in the kitchen. It was used to check calendars, add to shopping and to-dos etc.  I found the allrecipes skill to be useless, which is why I bought it initially. So I replaced it with the Flex. I was immediately dismayed by how frequently it did not respond and misunderstood me. None of the others have this difficulty. So I put the Show back in the kitchen and moved the Flex to my living room and plugged in a long Apple-compatible charging cable. That turned out to be a great idea because I can charge and use my iPad in the morning as I plow through email and read the e-edition of my local paper. I do use it to turn on my TV, but it doesn’t hear clearly enough to do much else, especially with background noise.

I just got this tiny echo device yesterday, and am very impressed! i was concerned about connectivity because of my previous nest experience. but so far after unplugging it several times and left off over night, it reconnects all on it's own. good start! i was able to connect it to my amazon music, pandora, and i heart music accounts with very little effort. I haven't tried to connect a bluetooth speaker yet, but it seems to not be that difficult. the device is very responsive, alexa surprised me with some lil bits of humor and side comments/conversations and politeness (spooky).  she walked me thru the music app connections, and made helpful suggestions. the google nest never did any of this. the size of this device is really small (2 decks of cards?). so keep in mind, if you plan on using it for listening to really good music, get a really good speaker to go with it. or, connect it to your stereo system. on it's own, the sound is very much like a transistor radio, and probably will not be good in a large room. which is fine if you just need basics. i've been able to listen to music fine without an additional speaker while taking a shower, and Alexa can hear me fine as well. since i can't give half stars (amazon, please fix that), i gave it 4 stars (4.5 stars) because i'd like a male voice called Alex. Also, it seems it will not connect with my google smart tv. i'll assume that's because google is competition. over all, i like it a lot. so much, i bought another the next day - 1 for the bathroom, and one for the bedroom. well worth the $9.99. buy a bunch and give them away as stocking stuffers at that price. enjoy!","Alexa, help me write this review!"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Aug-20,Gary Fisher,"I now own two of these incredibly useful Echo / Alexa Flex devices, and will likely add more in the future. Requiring no cable, no adapter, and no hanger, the Flex simply plugs into any available AC outlet and begins to work. Setup, if you don't receive it pre-paired to your Amazon account, is accomplished just as with other Echo devices. The Privacy and Action buttons on the front panel function like those on other Echoes, and the Flex will respond to all the usual Echo commands. While the speaker is far from Hi-Fi quality, it's perfectly adequate for the spoken word and can give you the news, weather, time, notifications, etc. perfectly well, and at least AM Radio-quality music. The Flex can control lights, appliances, etc. by voice command exactly like other Echoes. On the bottom of the Flex you'll find a full-size USB socket. While handy for charging a phone, etc., this connector is particularly intended to be used with Echo Flex accessories, of which there are currently two, a ""night light"" and a motion sensor. I own neither of these at this time, but Amazon's information indicates the motion sensor could be used, for example, to initiate a ""welcome"" sequence when someone walks by, or to turn on lights or perform other functions when it senses motion, without impacting other Alexa functions. The ""night light"" can be remotely set to an of a variety of colors, perhaps for aesthetics or possibly as a color-coded warning or alert scheme. Once again, the accessories are not required, and so far I haven't justified a need for them. But I'm working on it. 😉 I own a fairly large number of Echo devices, most of which could be used interchangeably.

The outlet is on a far wall, so while it does recognize my voice nicely, I can't hear the response very well as the speaker is very poor for an older person or if there is any other noise.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Sep-20,Nicholas H,"I bought the Flex for my kitchen and I'm very disappointed with it. So straight to the point... 1) Terrible microphone. Unless you're in a quiet room, the device has a lot of trouble understanding me. I have to repeat my commands slower and more loudly, but when I do that, the echo dot in my bedroom upstairs and down the hall responds to me instead. It's basically impossible to use when other people are speaking in the same room. I have to ask everyone to be quiet while I ask Alexa a question. It has come to the point where it's almost a joke if she actually hears me correctly. I don't have this problem with the echo dot. 2) Similarly, unless you're in a quiet room, you can barely hear the response--not just because of its very low max volume, but because the sound quality is terrible--something like a typical kids talking doll toy. 3) This goes for all echo's, getting a Bluetooth speaker connected is painful to say the least. The device name usually doesn't show up so you're guessing at which is the correct device when only the device code is displayed. It also does not reconnect to the Bluetooth speaker automatically and cannot reconnect to a previously connected device through voice command. The idea of telling Alexa to ""play music on my Bluetooth speaker"" is just a fantasy. You'll have to go through the Alexa app and reconnect manually each time--by which time, you might as well just stream your music from your phone to your Bluetooth speaker instead. 4) When connected to Bluetooth, the volume changes back to level 5 constantly, so you have to keep asking Alexa to go back to volume 10. At level 5, it's barely audible so you might not realize it's connected unless the room is dead silent. Overall, the Flex is virtually useless because it simply doesn't understand me or I can't understand it most of the time (and I mean really MOST of the time) whereas I have no issues with my Dot devices which can understand me in a crowded room even with music playing. In my opinion, the Echo Flex might only be a reasonable solution for a small bathroom although I'd warn you about it still getting your questions wrong if you have the faucet or shower running. Otherwise, I highly recommend getting the Dot instead.",Nearly useless unless you're in a very quiet room
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Dec-19,Rabid Ron,"So far this has been one of the best echo products Amazon has produced.  We use in the kitchen to assist in cooking.  Controlling lights etc is a  breeze along with setting the ""Guard"" feature when leaving home. Having the add on devices is a big plus to expand it's capabilities. What should be added is a way to utilize both the motion detector and nightlight at the same time by plugging the nightlight into the motion detector. It is going to be an interesting expansion capability if more add on devices are developed. I am already considering a few more to cover the basement, among other places.  As purely a voive control device this ranks as number One in my book.",Great way to expand voice control to small spaces.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Aug-20,🥇Customer,"I purchased an Echo Flex plus the companion smart night light to replace what I had in a small bathroom and free up a socket.  In the bathroom I had an Echo Dot 3rd gen in an outlet hanger, plus I had a nightlight plugged into an Amazon Smart Plug.  So, both electrical sockets were used and there was a lot of hardware hanging off the electrical outlet (see pics).  The Flex is perfect for my needs.  It’s much more compact even with the night light (smaller is good, Amazon!) and the second outlet is wide open. Comparison: —Sound:  The Flex sound (both quality and volume) is not as good as the Dot’s.  To me, it’s good enough in order to have a more compact dual device.  Plus my Dot’s sound quality was partially muffled by the prongs on the outlet hanger.  I have Dots in most of the bedrooms and would not replace them with a Flex.  But for the bathroom, the Flex is good. —Light:  The Flex night light is not as bright as the one I had.  Both lights allegedly have 6 LED chips, but my old one is definitely way brighter.  However, the Flex light can be dimmed and turned a few different colors.  There are people around here who like asking Alexa to change the color. —Heat:  The Flex definitely runs very warm just sitting in the socket. —Alexa:  Her pickup of your commands is slow.  You need to be facing her for her to pick you up.  If you speak to her from the side, you may have to raise your voice for her to recognize that you’re speaking to her.  I suppose the acoustics of the room play a role, but that is not an issue when using other Echo devices.  In addition, there seems to be a lag in responsiveness.  For instance, if a song is playing and you ask her to stop playing, sometimes the song continues playing a few seconds as it fades out, or it plays in the background as Alexa is answering a question.  I don’t notice that phenomenon on my other Echo devices. —Looks:  It’s not the most attractive looking device.  Though it looks a lot better than what was there. —Set-up:  Fairly easy.  In my case, I used a Fire tablet for the set-up.  Since my router has MAC filtering enabled, once the Flex showed in the Alexa app list of devices, I got the Flex MAC address and went to my PC to add it to my router settings.  Then, on my Fire tablet, I had to switch to the temporary Amazon WiFi for the set-up.  Good to go from there.",This is a great device for where being compact counts
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Dec-19,Deandra,"I don't hate it enough to send it back but I like my echo dot WAY more. I'd buy 400 more echo dots before I buy another echo flex. It's really quiet all the time, even in the middle of the night when everything seems loud, you know? It doesn't listen to me a lot of the time, so I'll be in the kitchen screaming ""ALEXA PLAY SPOTIFY!"" that the dot will hear me 3 rooms away from where it is. I can't be as cool as I'd like showing off all my Alexas because this one is insubordinate. But it looks really nice and small, so at least there's that.",Just get an Echo Dot.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Oct-20,Jamie Lee Sanders,"I got one of these to put in the outlet outside of my bathroom to activate the lights on the way in because the switch is in a very impractical place. You have to go all the way inside the bathroom and shut the door to reach it which ranges from mildly annoying in the daytime to very frustrating at night when it's too dark for that sort of nonsense. Alexa Flex could not hear us at least half the time. We'd walk into a dark bathroom, step back and tell her again, walk into dark bathroom again, then go back and lean down to yell at her to turn on the bathroom lights and she still didn't do it every time. Luckily, I already have two dots or I wouldn't have had any faith at all in alexa. I put a dot in the living room about ten feet further away from the bathroom than the flex is, and when we tell the flex to turn on the bathroom lights, the dot actually picks it up and gets the light instead. I finally moved the flex to the kitchen where I had the dot and it seems to do a little better since it's now closer to our face instead of by the floor. I bought her to get the bathroom lights but now she gets the kitchen and entrance lights. I would only recommend the flex if it's truly going to be in a small space where it will be sure to hear you. I have one by my bed as well and she doesn't respond as well as I'd like there either. I would suggest getting the dot if you're able.",Only for small spaces
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Oct-20,avgcustomer,"This is a convenient device to have, it brings Alexa to more areas in the home. I got it with the nightlight attachment which is great because I have it set to turn on and off automatically at my bathroom sink. My issue is not with the tinny sound through the speakers because I don't really use it to listen to audio, the problem is that the lower quality seems to have carried over to the microphones as well. I frequently have issues with the Echo Flex understanding the commands I'm giving it, and I'm constantly having to tell Alexa to cancel or outright ripping it out of the socket while she's going through the incorrect script. It's especially worse at night when I'm repeatedly having to re-issue commands to turn on my bathroom lights at a dimmed setting and she's initializing burglary detection or looking for a nearby restaurant. I've resorted to carrying my smartphone with me more often so I can just issue commands through the Alexa app. This is in contrast to the Echo Dot which I rarely have issues giving commands to, it has twice as many speakers (4 vs 2 in the Flex) and it sounds better so I'm assuming the microphones must be better to. Do I recommend that you purchase an Echo Flex? Possibly if you need it to use Alexa infrequently in an odd location, but for something as frequent as controlling your bathroom lighting you might want to opt for something with better voice recognition.",Too much compromise on quality
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Apr-20,Eric McCann,"I picked two of these up to mess around with, one with the night light attachment. These were pre-set by Amazon before delivery, so I can't speak to how easy or hard they are to set up - from experience this tends to be quick and painless, though. Brief review on the night light attachment - it's slick and integrates well, and seems to be secure. You can tweak the light color, and yes, it detects low light just fine. It does what it is supposed to and looks like part of the Echo Flex. I see reviews with people complaining about the sound from the speaker. If you're expecting awesome sound from a tiny little speaker, be realistic - this is fine for telling you what the weather's like if you ask, or if you see a notification or other basic information. Playing music... maybe if you want to recreate the early days of radio. It does not do most music justice on its own - but I'm not knocking it for that because (a) that's not what I bought it for and (b) it would be ridiculous to expect it to. If you want to put this somewhere and play music, it *can* pair with a bluetooth speaker (and does come with a speaker out.) Use those, or look into something like an Echo Dot. I am being realistic with the sound quality rating at three stars, though. Fine for notifications or voice. Awful for music. This does take up one of your plugs. It's low enough the other is free (assuming, obviously, you put it on the lower outlet.) This is one thing I'd like to see adjusted - having an outlet passthrough would be nice, though not strictly needed. Perhaps even turning it into a smartplug as well. I'd like to see more accessories for this. The only ones I can see are the night light and motion sensor. Something as simple as a clock to hang off the bottom. A speaker, for those wanting something slightly better without a second device (or someplace to mount a dot.) Maybe a small camera for helping do things like baby monitoring. I think there's potential in this device that's not being used.","Works for what it's designed for, could use a tweak or two."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,TnT,"Only been using it for a few days but so far it's been working great for my application, I'm extremely happy with the product!  In my house I have a central audio system that has built in speakers in the ceiling of all the rooms which is hardwired to a single Echo Dot. So adding these Flex units to rooms that are out of earshot of the main Echo Dot, for example the garage or upstairs bathroom, it's something like adding additional microphones.  I can speak a command and everything plays normal out of the central system as if I'm speaking to the main Echo Dot. People that are complaining about the internal speaker sounding lousy, it says in the description over and over these aren't intended alone for music. After set up the internal speaker is not really used. It will give acknowledgement tones from it but everything else plays to the ""preferred speaker""  which you designate within the Alexa app. Adding additional Echo dots with probably accomplish the same thing but this does it in a super compact clean simple plug in module with no loose wires. I haven't tried the motion or the night light optional devices for this but I plan to pick them up","It's like adding ""extra ears"" to Alexa 👍"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Jan-20,Mike,"So initially I thought this would be a great addition to my garage as a smart speaker. I thought to my self it’s small, doesn’t need a cable or a desk to be displayed on (mounts directly to the  wall vía it’s plug), and it should fill the garage with some smart tech easily, only that wasn’t exactly the case. My main gripe is with the sound quality, it’s awful and basically ruined the product (Especially since it’s all about voice activated features and doesn’t have a screen). Alexa sounds hollow/awful and music sounds even worse. There is limited to no bass and the mids/highs aren’t anywhere (good) to be found either. That being said, there also aren’t enough redeeming qualities to make this a well rated product. Yes I did pay a decent price on it (Amazon had a 50% off sale around the end of 2019) and it has a built in USB port on the bottom. So then you’d think that’s cool it was cheap and there is a port (basically giving you an extra charge outlet for a phone or something) and yeah I’d agree with that thought process, then I noticed the two official add ons for the USB port (a night light and a motion sensor) are half the MSRP of the unit and honestly should have just been built in (with a better speaker). Then, and only then, would this have been a 4 star or better product but instead it’s barely a 3, more like a 2 star product if you paid full price. I’d say wait for gen two or another steep discount before you buy this thing.",Half baked “smart” speaker...

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Nov-19,Ashley N Ward,"I was SUPER excited to have an echo I could easily plug into my bathroom wall. I even ordered this a month in advance. However, when they say ""mini smart speaker"" they really mean MINI smart speaker. Even when you do the ""level 11"" secret volume, these are still so quiet. I have a regular echo dot (3rd gen) and the volume is perfect. However, I have a vent fan in my bathroom that turns on when I turn on the light and I can barely hear it over the fan. I'd expect that if the volume was at a 5 or 6, but a 10 or 11? The sound quality is even a bit fuzzy despite being so quiet. I don't expect it to be as loud as a normal echo, but it's big enough they could have added better speakers. Very disappointing.",Way too quiet

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Feb-20,capo,"I have Echo devices of one kind or another in every room and have had others that I’ve decided to let go (original Echo and Echo Auto). They’ve all performed their smarthome duties acceptably well. My biggest complaint across the board is sound quality. Alexa always sounds like she’s talking to you from underneath a pile of pillows. Bass? Sure, on the Echo Show, at least. Treble? Nada. Sure, you can use the app’s “equalizer”... but it’d take an oscilloscope to detect the minuscule difference that makes in the sound quality. I’d given up on getting any more devices... until I saw a review of the Flex on Paul Hibbert’s YouTube channel... he liked it, but said (I think) that it sounded ‘trebly’. Trebly?! That’s a magic word to my ears. I ordered one up and found that it indeed sounds ‘trebly’ (call it tinny of you like) but who cares? Who seriously listens to music on these tiny little devices anyway?! I can understand what Alexa says now - all the plosives are there.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jan-20,Jason H.,"After writing this review and rating it 2 stars, I received a call from Amazon.  They wanted to tell me that the speaker on the Echo Flex is not meant to be the main audio source.  The intent of the design is to use Bluetooth to connect to an external speaker.  This would, of course, resolve my concern with the sound quality, so I increased the rating to 3, or okay.  But in thinking about the Flex alone, I don't think I would rate it as good or great, because it has limited appeal without additional investment. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of adding a speaker just to have this device, because I could buy a Dot instead.  However, I concede that there are niches where this functionality and price savings would be useful.  For example, after thinking about it further, I realized that I could connect it to my Bluetooth enabled treadmill and have Alexa right up front for music or any other questions I might have without having to mount an Echo Dot on the wall.  The Flex plugs in securely to a wall socket and leaves the second outlet open.  It's not heavy and doesn't sag like some two-pronged, heavy transformers do. Installing this was a simple as unpacking it and plugging it in.  It had already been integrated into my account and the WiFi login was automatic. Notifications cause the LED to blink brightly.  It's much harder to ignore it, when you already know what the notification is.  You have to ask, what's my notification, in order to clear it. The sound is like a cell phone's speakerphone, and is hard to listen to.  This device would go best in a garage or out of the house, where you might want access to announcements or activating guards, but not where you want to hear it every day.  (edit:  you are expected to connect to a Bluetooth speaker by design) Giving plenty of space in front of the device helps with communication.  Putting it in a tight space can cause echoes or chirps and clicks that interfere with it.",For someplace you won't need to listen to it every day.

When I am talking on phone, the other party on line says they can hear it very plainly so it is loud.  Don't know why the comments say its bad for hearing, must have an extra large house.

With it I also bought that ""Made for Amazon"" THIRDREALITY Smart Night-Light for Echo Flex, and I love it too! I had been wanting to put an Echo Dot in a very tiny bathroom, but I was trying to figure out how, since I have no counter space and didn't want to use up my last outlet. Then, along comes this Echo-Flex thingy, so I decided to give it a try. I've been super delighted with it all morning long! I love how it just plugs right into an outlet and is totally out of my way but still basically does most of what the echo Dots do. I had a regular nightlight in the room that took up an outlet socket, so this new Smart Nigh-Light was a great solution because it plugs right into the bottom of the Echo Flex, so just the Echo-Flex is using that 1 outlet now. It's so cool too because I can ask Alexa to change the lights colors! I've bought 4 of the Echo Dots for my home and I am in love with all of them. This Echo-Flex is just a smaller version that is so perfect for small bathrooms, laundry rooms and basically anywhere else where you just don't have counter or table space for an Echo Dot. I also love how easy it is to set these devices up! Just be sure the little box below the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Buy Now"" buttons is checked ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup""! It really does simplify the set-up wonderfully! Anyway, I am totally loving this new Echo-Flex so much and I already have ideas of getting some more of them for other tiny places around my home that I had not considered before. These things are just so helpful AND so fun! UPDATE 08/16/2020: I've now bought 4 of these echo Flexes with the nightlights. One for the laundry room, one for my Kitchen and 2 for my small bathrooms. I use these every day and they have become indispensable!  Sure, the sound is not super great for music, but the fact that these are not stealing any counter space is paramount for me. I have other Echo's in other rooms for music anyway. I love these things! UPDATE 10/13/2020: I am STILL in love with these cool little Echo Flex gadgets!  I use them many times daily!

The speaker quality sucks.  No where near as good as the Echo plus speaker.  Playing music on the Flex's built in speaker sounds like listening to an old transistor pocket radio.  It does pair easily to my blue tooth speakers which sound really good. Motion detection works, but is almost useless until the Amazon Alexa app matures a bit more.  Settings in the app are too cumbersome to want to use at the moment.  Controlling a light seems easy enough, but I wanted it to turn on a Wyze switched outlet.  I had to create a new group... assign the Wyze switch to it... create a routine to turn on the group.  There was no skill that let me just turn on/off the switch without creating the group first.  Seemed like way more hassle than it should have been. The night light seems nice, but I haven't spent much time playing with it yet.  I just picked the first color that was bright enough to fill the room.  Too bad you can't have motion sensing and the night light in one module.

It’s real nice to have the garage light come on automatically whenever I open the garage door.  I also set it to turn off the light after no motion is detected for 1 hour (choose any time period). You can also have the motion sensor activate an Echo device to speak a custom phrase, give a news flash briefing, traffic report, play music, etc. There is a setting to specify the time when the motion sensor should perform the Routine (anytime, or between a certain time period) and to suppress a repeat of the Routine for a configurable time period so it won’t keep doing the same thing every time there is motion, if you don’t want it to.  For example you can have it give you the traffic report or news briefing when you enter the bathroom in the morning but only if the motion happens between 6-8am.

No other explanation besides they tried to get me to sign up for an Amazon business account. I have one in my bathroom and wanted to put two in my kitchen are because there are two entrances and I wanted to make my lights fully motion-controlled in my kitchen.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Jan-20,thornhillatthemovies.com,"I'm not thrilled with the Echo Flex. I have an Echo and love that, I have a bunch of plugs connected to it, and control the lights throughout our small apartment with it. I have had some difficulty getting other smart plugs to communicate and connect with Alexa and our Echo. So, when I saw the Echo Flex on Amazon, I initially thought it was a smart plug with Alexa built in. It isn't. And that's my mistake. Our apartment is very small, so I plugged the Echo Flex into the wall (it really looks like a multi-plug you plug into a regular outlet) and connected it. A few days before, I got a wall clock made by Citizen and connected it to the Echo. With the Echo Flex plugged in, and connected, all of the voice recognition was going through the Flex and the Smart Clock no longer did the countdown with a timer, as it did with the Echo. I unplugged the Echo Flex. The smart clock worked fine. I think if you have a bigger house and more rooms to cover, using the Echo Flex is a good way to get more coverage. But in our small apartment, it isn't necessary. I can control the Echo in our living room, from our bedroom. When the Echo Flex was plugged in, it seemed to recognize my voice well. But the speaker on it reminds me of playing something through a small speaker on a cheap cassette player. Remember those? It is hollow and tinny and would not be a good vehicle for music or other audio. If Amazon could come up with a smart plug directly tied into the Alexa range, I would buy that.",Possibly Good For Some Situations... But There Are Problems
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Nov-20,Lenny,"I have this in my garage, where it's more useful than I expected. I originally got this so that I can turn on the garage light when I come in from the side door (the light switch is at the other side of the garage, near the kitchen entrance). I set up an Alexa routine so that it will turn on the light for a minute, giving me enough time to walk to the other end of the garage to enter the house without tripping over things, before turning itself off. So far that has worked very well. The USB port also turned out to be more useful than I expected. With so many things that recharge from USB these days, such as my bicycle headlights, it's nice to have another charger in the garage. I measured the charging current at 1.6A, I'm not sure if that's the maximum current, or just how much my light draws when recharging, but it is more than I expected. Finally, having it as a plug in form factor saves me the hassle and expense of getting a separate mount for it. Downsides, the speaker is not as good. It specifically says it's not suitable for playing music, but within a few days of using this, Alexa said that I haven't asked it to play music and if I would like to do so. I guess someone didn't program it properly. Finally, the microphone isn't as good as the other Echo devices I have. Even the 1st generation Echo Dot does a better job of recognizing my commands when there's extra noise in the background. Overall, for the price and utility, it deserves 5 stars.",Inexpensive device for where you don't need to play music
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Apr-20,Discriminating Buyer,"I've been putting in echo dots and shows around the house, really to be used as an intercom/announcement system and for control of some smart items.  My parents are elderly and my Mom had a stroke a few years ago so I prefer to have some sort of communication system around that is voice activated (as long as they can speak) in an emergency.  It's also proved handy for them to control lights, view some cctv cams, fans, the air conditioning, etc. I bought the flex used based on the poor reviews that it got, I figured that if they didn't work at least I wasn't out the cost of a new one.  I wanted these for areas where I don't have dots.  Setup was probably easier than any other Echo device I've had.  It apparently uses bluetooth so that has to be turned on on the phone.  I did a test speaking close into the dot and it transmitted to all the other echo devices.  The sound from it isn't that bad, I was expecting some really tinny sound but Alexa sounds much the same as on the other devices.  I haven't tried music on it to see how that sounds but I did make Alexa sing the 20 second wash your hands song and it sounded okay. UPDATE I tried music on it and while it wasn't terrific it wasn't all that bad. I decided to put this in the carport instead up near the ceiling and it definitely is tinny sounding there and not very loud.  I maxed the volume through the app and it still wasn't very loud.  It seems to hear okay though.",Better than I expected!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Dec-19,Sharon Clark,"I bought this for the basement as I am terrified of falling down my cement steps and being unable to get help.  I placed it in the center of the basement in the only available outlet.  Volume goes up to 10, which, unfortunately, is very low for my slightly impaired hearing.  I need to be within a few feet to hear it at all and ideally within a few inches to understand.  I have an echo plus and a couple of dots and have them about halfway because they can be loud.  The flex at full is way too quiet, would never buy another and wouldn't recommend for that reason.  That being said, I really only need it if I fall down the steps and need to call for help.  I have asked the time, etc occasionally from the flex, it does hear me better than I can hear it so I have protection from ""I've fallen and can't get up"".  Old ladies living alone need inexpensive safety measures and this one is great for that.",Works great and gives piece of mind
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Nov-20,Clayton M.,"I bought this for my mother, who has been looking for a nightlight for her bathroom. Paired with the ThirdReality smart night-light accessory , this lovely little Alexa device gives you peace of mind in areas you can't easily place one of the larger Echo devices with a surprisingly bright adjustable LED lamp. The pictures I've attached show the night-light using the sensor mode - it's off when the lights are on, and turns on when the room gets dark. You can see also that it shows as a controllable light in the Alexa app. There are several colors to pick from and a slider to set brightness; I have it set to 2% here because the bathroom is connected to a bedroom - the light can definitely be much brighter if you want that. === PROS === - Small form factor doesn't take up space. - Plug on the bottom lets you mix and match accessories (night-light, motion sensor, etc). - If you don't want an accessory, use the bottom plug to charge your phone! - Works great with mid-wall plugs like those you find in bathrooms (near the counter) or kitchens (by the sink). - Use a 3.5mm cable or Bluetooth to connect a dedicated speaker for playing music. === CONS === - Audio quality is ok, not meant for music playback using the built-in speaker. Very tempted to buy a couple more of these on sale; I am sure I can find a few more spots in our home that could be introduced to Alexa!",Makes a great smart nightlight
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Dec-19,Adrienne Boswell,"We live in a two-bedroom apartment.  We have an Echo Dot in the living room that shares a table with a Google Home Mini.  Then I have an Echo Dot in my bedroom, and my son has a Google Home Mini in his bedroom.  I also have a Fire Tablet in the kitchen that I use for recipes, music, etc.  There was only one room missing in order to make this apartment fully Amazoned out - the bathroom.  Now, Alexa can hear me no matter where I am in the house, and I really like that. But, besides that, I like having an echo in the bathroom so I know what time it is, so I can listen to music or my morning routine, check the weather, all without having to go into the bedroom or living room.  I know, first world problems, but it works for me. I just answered a question about if you can use the Flex to make phone calls.  Yes, you can.  It's not a Bose speaker quality, but, I have to say, it's actually better than my phone sometimes is. So, I can chat on the phone when I'm getting ready, too.  Nice. I really like that it's so small and plugs right into the wall outlet.  It doesn't take up much space, and especially in the bathroom where counter space is at a premium, it's great that it can live on the wall and not the counter. I recommend the Flex if you want Alexa coverage all over your home.  These little ones are inexpensive, small and unobtrusive. Great product.",Great new member of the family
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jul-20,"A fan from Meriden, CT","Its has been a while since I wrote an Amazon Review, but I felt I had to for this. It is a WONDERFUL Product ! I already had a 1st Gen Echo Dot that is setup in my living room. And after some early trepidations, everyone in my family uses it. I got a smart light to go along with it & that is great as well. So when I recently got a couple more smart lights to set up in my Office, I needed another echo to control that. And that's why I got the Flex. My office is in the basement so using the Echo in the living room to control the lights isn't ideal. All I needed was something small, so the flex is a perfect fit. I just tucked it into a corner by my stereo receiver and plugged it into a short extension cord. Bingo ! Now I have full Alexa capability downstairs. I use it to turn on the lights (I added a smart plug to my desk lamp as well) when I come downstairs to start my day & it can hear me easily from across the room. And while the sound of the on-board speaker isn't great, I plugged it into the Audio Input on my stereo & now it sounds FABULOUS. What else do I need, ? And at only HALF the price of a Dot (and a quarter of the price of a full size Echo) why WOULDN'T you get one ? Thanks for making this, Amazon - it's perfect ! UPDATE: Make that slightly LESS than perfect. Please be aware this may not be the Echo's fault ... BUT I have had to redo the WiFi connection on it TWICE since setting it up. I thought rthat maybe it was an issue witth My Amazon Connectivity in General, but I verified that the Dot in the Living room & my App both work fine - its just the Flex. And its not because the Flex is farther away, its MUCH Closer, The Router is literally NEXT TO where the Flex is installed. And there are no sources of interference nearby that I am aware of. The only thing I can think of is my son does have a WiFi extender set up in the living room, and MAYBE the Flex is confused about which network to use. I know that both times I( redid the WiFi I had to use the SECOND lusting for my house since the first said the Password was incorrect. Anyway, other than that, I've had no issues. And if I figure out what is causing this I'll post another update.",This is my favorite Echo yet !
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Oct-20,Terry D,"I bought this for my bathroom because I wanted to listen to music while in the shower.  I figured as cheap as it is who cares if it shorts out after awhile.  So far though, despite my fiance' taking 45 minute 8000 degree showers, it has held up just fine.  The volume is a little low, as can be expected based on its size.  And the voice recognition seems to be a bit more challenging than with the regular echo dots.  I find myself screaming at it more than I usually have to scream at these devices.  In the end though it usually works pretty well.  For the price, definitely glad to have it for the bathroom.  It'd probably be a good thing to have in the garage too as long as you weren't using power tools.","Works pretty well, volume not great - voice recognition not great either."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Oct-20,GBarrington,"This was not life-changing, merely darned good. I've read the reviews others have posted, both positive and negative, and I haven't experienced the negative.  It is true that the tiny speaker is not music quality, but when you come right down to it, neither are any of Echo devices except for the largest devices.  It's a speaker about the size of my smallest fingernail, who in their right mind considers that capable of music quality? OTOH, I've found the speaker to be loud, and clear; and the microphone quite capable of picking up my voice anywhere in my kitchen (roughly 12x25 feet opening onto a semi-open great room.  Lots of space for sound to dissipate).  I suspect placement is key with this tiny device, but I've found that to be true with any of the Echo devices for premium performance. Set up was easy, and it went into setup mode as soon as it was plugged in.  In my mind, except for music, this functions as well as the Echo Dot. UPDATE:  I moved my office to a different location just off the family room.  My office is in a room with 2 open doors and is separated by about 40 feet from the first open door.  this Echo flex picks up my voice fine with the doors open.  Now it's true, I have one of those voices that 'carries', but even so, that is still surprisingly good for a tiny echo device with just 2 microphones not aimed directly at my new office.",I save 5 stars for a life changing experience.

Sure, you can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker, but that kind of negates the small footprint. If you just need something to control lights or other devices, I suppose it's ok.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Dec-19,Kit Clayton,"The sound quality is far inferior to an Echo or even a Dot.  But, guess what?  This is a Flex, not an Echo or Dot!  One of these is plugged in right next to my home’s intercom, with the stereo jack right into the intercom system.  The horrible Flex speaker is moot, since it feeds directly into the home intercom and associated speakers - which all are far superior to even the echo or Bluetooth speakers.  So, even rooms ,utility/workroom, garage, porches, and decks without an Echo devices now have Alexa.  Check it out - since Flex is right next to intercom, can trigger Alexa through the intercom!  Brilliant, right?  True - not as convenient as just talking (and why there are still 4 echo devices in strategic places throughout the home) but in outdoor and other places (such as garage and work room) where it is not a good idea for an echo, a good way to smart home up everything.  And here I thought intercoms were worthless in this day and age.... I got a second Flex just to - well, flex.  Can plug it in anywhere (screened in outdoor gazebo in summer) on the property for instant voice activated Alexa for when I am too lazy to get up and push an intercom button....

You want barely passable music, then get an Echo for five bucks more when they are on sale.  you want a easy p,ug in flexible unit (er, hence the device’s name) for voice activating Alexa - or, in my case to Alexify (yes, “Alexify” is a verb in my world) my whole home intercom system, then this device is perfect.  5 stars - clearly, as I bought another one already, is recommended if used for how it was designed.",Outstanding Alexa extension!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Aug-20,Somebody,"I received two Echo Flex devices today. I'd read all the one-star reviews before ordering, so I was prepared to send them back if they were as awful as some folks say. But when I unboxed them and plugged them into outlets, I was glad to see how quickly and automatically they connected to my wifi. Ready to use in about a minute or less. Yes, those who say the audio is tinny are right. Not at all as good as my Echo Dots, Echo Show, or the original Echo tower. But the two locations where I wanted to put the new devices aren't areas where the quality of the audio matters: living room and bathroom. So far, Alexa has had no problem hearing me, nor have I had trouble hearing her. I even tested the living room one to see if Alexa could hear me when the TV is on. I raised my voice only slightly above conversation-level. No problem. I also heard her despite the TV's audio. I noticed that the Flex in my bathroom sounded louder than the one in the living room, so I put the living room one in the bathroom to compare them. No difference. My guess is that the Flex sounds louder in the bathroom because it's a tiny room, while the living room is considerably larger. Also, I'm closer to the Flex in the bathroom (about 15"" when standing at my washbowl) than in my living room where I am across the room from it (about 9'). The one glitch my living room flex has is the volume control. The bathroom's volume is set at 100%, but the living room's volume is stuck at 70%. Now, having said that, it sounds just like the 100% volume on the other Flex. I tried repeatedly to boost the volume to 100%, following the directions in the app to do that, but no luck. I have emailed support to see what I can do to get it to 100%, but truthfully it doesn't matter. As just about everyone says, the Flex is not suitable for listening to music -- but I decided to give it a try. I told Alexa to play Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"". It was far from good, but it was also nowhere near horrible. All in all, I'm pleased that I decided to replace my clunky Dots which were hanging from the outlet in holders (to keep from having to deal with cords). The Echo Flex is *much* better aesthetically, and it meets my needs.","Didn't expect much, but happy with the purchase"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Nov-19,John Silvia,"I've installed this in my garage - adds intercom capabilities and kills my old clock-radio. Overall the Echo Flexs' performance has been good.  It has limitations - but those are kind of expected given the packaging and price. Mounted at shoulder level over my toolbench, I'm rather happy with its performance so far.  The microphones aren't as sensitive as the ones in my Echo Dot's, so I have to speak a bit louder. The on-board sound output is weak - very low-fidelity. Definitely meant for low-traffic areas, sounds like a walkie-talkie due to it's tiny speaker. The 3.5mm output drives external speakers without trouble. I'm finding that volume 10 is the line-out volume - leaving you with 100% manual volume control on the external speakers.  I'll be trying it with my old Microsoft subwoofer setup later for kicks. Overall this is a great little Alexa, but I would not purchase this in lieu of it's bigger brothers in most cases. It's sound quality and microphone aren't as good as the larger units, but this can make it perfect in some remote low-traffic areas, or maybe hallways or large closets. Add the motion detector for full coverage. The casing is hard-plastic - it has a more appliance-rugged finish - looking very much more like an ultrasonic vermin repeller than an Internet thing.","Great ""Low-Fi"" Alexa"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Nov-19,amazon_shopper,"I like that it's a simple plug-in that sits there; no adapter, no cable, no hassle.  It does everything I need it to and is functionally no different from any other Echo device when it comes to voice commands and responsiveness.  The sound is a bit lacking, but I never considered it my primary source of audio entertainment either.  It's good enough for listening to the weather, news, or anything else not requiring premium sound.  But honestly, the sound quality is no worse than the stock radio in a 1980s K-car, if you know what that is.  The Flex performs well as an additional listening sensor for glass breakage while in Alexa Guard mode and having more sensors also expands your voice control options throughout the house.",Great way to expand the Alexa presence in your house.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Dec-19,Wills944,"To start, I have a few technical grumbles about the platform itself but I do enjoy my ""Dots"" They [1 in the Living Room, 1 in each of the 2 bedrooms] have operated reasonably well, the only technical hickup with them is the occassional device dis-association from a room group..i.e. walk into a room say ""turn on the lights"" and it responds 'Can't find a device called Lights"". So far its about once a week on one of the Dots.. The Flex's haven't had this happen and they've been unplugged and reinserted a few times.. The Flex's appear to only have 2 mic pinholes. I have had a little bit of a time finding placement for the Flex that allows it to pick up audio better. Our 2BR Apartment has laminate floors with the kitchen on one end, the combined entry/dining room acting as a echo chamber, and the carpeted living room and it's Dot at the other end. The kitchen Flex would pick up from the living room and visa versa.. Others have noted the sound ""quality"" as bad, but in all fairness it is about the same as the speaker function on a cellphone. It's not bassy like the dots, but I have played music while in the bathroom and it is not a bad/horrible experience. It is great to listen to the news while shaving/cleaning up or just waiting.. Once the shower is on though, external speakers would be required. On the positive notes.. The look of the device is demure enough that it blends in without being too ""in your face"". Hopefully skins will become available. These Flex's, Dots and Shows are great, but I hope more useful devices are in the mix. Maybe a Kitchen Device that includes a barcode scanner for maintaining a real shopping/pantry inventory, with a extension that could perhaps go over the garbage bin to scan out items. It's nice to to be able to voice add items to a list, or have a fridge that questimates usage, but a easy in/out scanner would be fantastic.. I'd also like to see the Prime Video/Music apps accept Alexa commands. I get the reasons behind branded devices, but it would be just as easy to add subroutines into the apps that intergrate commands from the platform. It would be great to have a the ability to simply have apps that can be put on devices for reading news flashes, then a simple ""Alexa show me the news on the living room TV"" through my android media box... Apps are easier to get to market on devices that are already global.. So hopefully Amazon expands the line in some real useful ways..",Good step in the right direction
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Jan-20,Branson Mom living in Chillicothe,"There are SO MANY things this little device can do.  Initially I bought them exclusively as intercoms, but because I didn't understand the correct way to use them, I rated them a 3*, now that Amazon Flex expert contacted me and spent nearly an hours educating me to the device WOW, and I mean WOW...!!!! Okay it is like an extension to your Alexa or Echo Dot, but it does things I'm not even sure they can do.  These are amazing, and now instead of 2 I'm probably going to have 2 more for downstairs. Be sure to educate yourself on the differences, they can be subtle so if like me you might miss some big pieces of info. One, you can name each differently, so when you 'drop in' (not any other way as I was doing) you can have a conversation with the persons that are at that Flex.  So yes, an intercom.  You can broadcast announcements to every device, or 'drop in' to just one. I now have so many Ring and Amazon devices my house probably should be seen from outerspace, lol.  And I am far from finished.  I want every bulb to be a smart bulb (you gotta try those, omg), I want every room to have a Flex (okay I have 16 rooms, maybe not every room), I already have a plethora of Ring cameras inside and out, but also am trying a different brand that works with Alexa too, but tons less expensive (and Ring truly is not what it use to be).

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Apr-20,Jerry,"I purchased this Echo Flex for a problem area in my house.  I have a staircase leading upstairs to a hallway between the bedrooms.  I have smart bulbs throughout my house including the hallway/staircase.  The problem: If I needed to go in the hall/staircase, I would have to remember to tell Alexa to turn on the light before I entered, or it would be me yelling to Alexa to “turn on the hall light”.  Half the time, she did not hear or understand me as I don’t believe Echo Dots were designed to respond well to yelling from a distance. With the Echo Flex, I simply plugged it into an existing hall power socket after setup.  I now can control the hall/stairway lights in my normal voice.  No more yelling! Some features I like: • Flex costs less than a Dot.  Yes, Flex does not have as good of a speaker, or microphone as a Dot, but I don’t need a great speaker where I have it located and the microphone that is in the Flex works great in the hall/staircase. • Flex is built to hang from a wall socket.  I don’t need a table, nor do I need to buy a hook to hang it from the socket. • Flex does everything voice-wise that my echo Dots do, it can control my smart lights, my smart thermostat, any smart devices I have hooked to my Dots, I cam make and receive announcements, etc.  It is simply a scaled down version of the Dot. If you already own Echoes and/or Dots, Cubes, etc and need better voice coverage in a somewhat enclosed area of your home, the Echo Flex is the perfect add-on.  It appears that this situation is exactly what Flex was designed for.  I give the Echo Flex a very firm 5 stars!",Perfect for enclosed problem areas of the home.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Dec-19,RoboTech,"First off, the product description SPECIFICALLY STATES that it is not made for music. It is NOT a replacement for an Echo Dot as far as sound quality goes. I am not going to due the product a disservice by giving it a 1-star rating for that reason alone, like other have. I also own several Dot's attached to wall mounts. They are in areas that are clean and dust free, whereas the Flex can be hooked up in a dusty garage or shed without worrying about the speaker cloth getting torn, dirty or moldy. The Flex can be just wiped off with a damp cloth. Even with the Dots on sale, the total cost with a good wall mount is at least $35. The Flex is replacing my Echo Inputs and a couple of my Dots. No cords or mounting worries and about the same price as the Input. I bought the Flex to use in the garage connected to a stereo system and also in a hallway with the night light plug-in. The Flex is the perfect solution and a lot cheaper than a Dot w/wall mount configuration in tight spots where you are not going to use the internal speaker anyhow. Plus, the added benefit of a USB port on the bottom to charge your phone, plug in a night light, or to power a set of USB speakers. As for the microphones, I am not sure why people are reporting that the microphones don't work well. All (3) of my Flex pick up my voice just fine from across the room. Just because the Flex has only 2 microphones, doesn't mean as much as you'd think. The DOT is usually mounted flat on a table and needs all 6 mics to pick up your voice from all angles. The FLEX on the other hand, is plugged into a wall and only has to pick up your voice from a much narrower angle. I have found that the microphones on the DOT can get ""confused"" when mounted vertically on the wall. The blue ring on the Dot that lights up when activated, has a brighter spot on the ring that corresponds with the direction of your voice. Sometimes you will see the ring on the Dot ""spinning"" as it picks up your voice bouncing all over the place. The 2 mics on the Flex are better suited for wall mounting. More is not always better. Realistically, nothing is perfect and sure, they could have put a bigger speaker in it. A larger speaker most certainly would have increased the price and made it physically larger. People would then be complaining about that. For me, I am glad is has a speaker for audible Alexa responses at least. In summary, the Flex is not perfect, but for specific purposes and for the price it can't be beat as long as you are not expecting to use it for music (or in a noisy environment) using the built in speaker.",Perfect solution for using in a tight space connected to another speaker system.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Nov-20,Grady Richardson,"Okay, I didn’t need this. I already had Echos in almost every room in my house. But when Amazon put this on sale for $10, I figured that for 10 bucks, I’d find a use for it. I put it in my hallway, just so in the 10 seconds or so that I’m walking from the family room (which has a Show) to the guest bedroom ( which has my original Echo) and the bathroom (which has a ceiling mounted Dot) door happens to be closed, I can still use Alexa without raising my voice. Maybe my wife is right. Maybe I do need help. Anyway, as to the merits of the device itself. It’s a really nice piece of technology. It’s ridiculously easy to set up. I plugged it in, got my iPad, opened the Alexa app and Alexa announced that my device was ready. Seriously. I didn’t have to do anything at all. I did rename it and put it in a hallway group, but that’s it. It’s an Echo. That is, it does everything any other Echo does, just smaller and cheaper. The only drawback is its tiny speaker, but no one is going to buy this to listen to music on (or they shouldn’t, anyway). I’d probably have put it in the garage for Smart Home control, except that’s where I keep my Tap. Highly recommended for places where you want voice control and don’t care about sound quality.",The littlest Echo.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Oct-20,S. Johannsen,"I have a couple of these, one with a sensor module, one with a nightlight module. There are some places that don't really have a good place for an Echo, but could stand some of the convenience. I have the one with the sensor in a walk-in pantry. The sensor allows the light to be turned on when  entering with hands full, which happens frequently in a pantry. The Echo functions let you drop in somewhere to have someone add something to a grocery list, or you could add to a digital list directly, when you see something is running low. The one with the night light is in a 'guest' bathroom. (Kids have left home, so now it's a guest bathroom). The nightlight works like any other and is good for guests to find their way without flipping on bright lights. The Echo part lets you broadcast, hey, we need TP in the guest bathroom, without straining your voice. I had one in the garage for a while, announcing 'Someone's in the garage', based on the sensor. Could easily be used to trigger lights in the garage as well. So there are some use cases that can benefit from these. I'd stick to places that have outlets a bit higher than the normal ft above floor ones. The microphones on these are fine, the speakers are not to loud, and certainly not intended for music. As a cheap intercom, they are great.",Useful in some specific cases
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Feb-20,James T.,"The new Echo Flex does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is why I bought one.  Amazon came up with this small Echo device to give people the ability to add an Alexa enabled device literally anywhere you have an electrical outlet, so that you can control all your smart devices with your voice, and make your life a bit easier. For this, I gave it 5 stars.  I wanted to have an Alexa enabled device in my kitchen so I could turn some lights on and off with my voice when I am busy cooking, or to ask for food measurement conversions, to set timers for cooking different things, and to also answer the phone when my hands are messy.  All of these things it does, and does perfectly. I also bought it to have voice activation of all my music, which I have it play over my WiFi speakers that I have in all the rooms of my house.  Again, for this, it does that function perfectly.  My kitchen is the loudest room in the house, especially at meal times!  And the very tiny speaker built into the Echo Flex gets drowned out very quickly when people are talking, exhaust fans are going, and spoons and other utensils are banging against pots and pans.  So to try to listen to music on the actual Echo Flex is never going to happen.  Not even in a quiet room. That is not the Echo Flex's intention.  People are bashing the sound that comes out of the Echo Flex as being really poor quality.  And it is, compared to larger Echo devices like the Echo Dot and regular Echo.  If you want to listen to music using the speaker in an Echo device, you have to buy a larger one!  You buy the Echo Flex to expand the areas of your house/garage/basement that you want to have voice control in! My favorite feature of the Echo Flex is that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet with the male prongs on the back of it.  It does not use a long cable like all the other Echo devices.  This puts it up and out of the way of other things you normally have on your counter tops or shelves.  By getting it up off your workspace you don't have to worry about knocking it off or damaging it by accident. Another feature the Echo Flex has is that there is a USB port on the bottom of it that you can connect USB enabled devices to.  There are night lights you can plug into it, and there is even a motion sensor you can plug into it that you can use to program WiFi enabled lights to turn on and off when you enter a dark room.  That is pretty cool. Overall, the Echo Flex is a great little Alexa enabled device that expands the areas that you want voice control of all your WiFi and smart items.  Think of it as your assistant, or helper.  You tell it what to do, and it does it.  For that, it works great.  Using it as your only means of listening to music?  No way.  It is not designed for that, and you will be disappointed in the sound quality.  You want a larger Echo device for that. But if you buy it for what it is, and what it was made to do, you will love it, and it will make your life easier and more enjoyable. Jim","Does exactly what it is supposed to do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Dec-19,P. Smith,"Like the other Alexa devices, the Flex was easy to setup and get running. It’s biggest drawback is the quality of sound from the speaker. If you’re expecting the quality of sound of the Echo Show or Dots you will be disappointed. The speaker sounds like one out of a cheesy transistor radio. However, if you are looking for just a basic Alexa device to get the weather, time, set/get reminders or alarms, but no music, then the ease of placement in a variety of nooks and crannies with a power outlet where it can be placed will be appealing. What I’ve done with it is place it in an entry hallway with the optional motion detector. I created a routine with the options set for Monday-Friday starting at around 5:30-7pm, if motion is detected, it will greet me, announce across all my Alexa devices that I’m home to alert the family, turns on the various downstairs lights (if they aren’t on already) where I have on smart plugs and bulbs. Then I set it it to wait for 60 minutes before it will trigger this routine so it won’t go off every time I pass by from that point on. You could also create another routine that every day of the week, after the time when you go to bed til you wake up, if motion is detected send a custom alert to any Alexa device in your home (such as your bedroom) and then set off a buzzer/alarm on the Flex device this serving as a poor man’s alarm system. Of course, if you have any pets wandering around this sort of alarm won’t be very useful. On the just for fun side, I have another routine that is triggered when motion is detected during a certain time period where Alexa will say a random compliment. Yeah I know, totally frivolous, but keeps the kids entertained. The routines you can build with the motion detector have some very well thought out options and actions that work flawlessly. So if you can tolerate the chintzy speaker, the Flex has some good usage possibilities.",Good if you set the right expectations
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Oct-20,D. Sah,"Love these little guys. When we bought our house, we took out the master for the intercom in our remodeling and I’ve been screaming for my kids ever since. I don’t enjoy screaming. It’s not a huge house but if they have any music going our they are zoning out, talking (loudly is their usual base), I have to yell louder. Although we aren’t an Alexa house, these were on sale during prime day so I thought, wth and bought a couple. The kids love asking Alexa random crap, having her play music (even on the crappy speaker); and hubs and I enjoy dropping in and making announcements unexpectedly. Especially when they aren’t brushing their teeth or doing their distance learning as they’re supposed to be. As an aside, I set up one in their bedroom and they the kid controls I put it on do not disturb. The. Forgot I did this (it takes awhile to figure out all the set ups) and could not get it out of do not disturb through the other more obvious settings. I had to call support, and they couldn’t figure it out. Finally, after a few resets and pretty much giving up, I realized it was out of service until 8 am 2 mornings in a row, I remembered vaguely setting a kid control.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Sep-20,Eric K.,"The Amazon Flex was on sale super cheap, so I decided to get one.  I thought it would work perfectly in our master bathroom so we could listen to music, the news, or ask Alexa questions when in the shower, bath, or getting ready for work.  Our Amazon Echo is in the living room, which is too far from the bathroom to be able to shout to, and I certainly wouldn't be able to hear it very well. The Flex was easy to set up.  I just plugged it in.  My Alexa app recognized it right away and I just had to follow the simple instructions with a couple of clicks (and inputting my Wi-Fi security code).  You then have to leave your phone within a few feet of the Flex while it's connecting everything. While not very visually appealing as the Echoes and Echo Dots have been getting, the Flex works just as well, as it connects to my main Echo via Wi-Fi.  The sound quality was pretty good, even better than my original Echo Dot from years ago. Why get a Flex instead of an Echo Dot?  For one, it was a lot cheaper at the time I bought since a great deal was going on.  Two, it doesn't need to ""sit"" anywhere.  It's plugged into an electrical outlet (which we rarely used in the bathroom anyway), so it's not taking up any counter or shelf space.  Three, there are no unsightly cords either.",Great Addition to our Echo Family

Got rid of the Dot and plugged this little thing into the wall, then connected it to the speaker with an audio cable.  Perfect.  Alexa is loud and clear and the hockey puck no longer takes up desktop real estate.  I know it could have connected with Bluetooth, but prefer a good old-fashioned, trouble-free 3.5mm audio cable connection because it's one and done.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Oct-20,Rob Howell,Based on the reviews and descriptions (and prime day price) I decided to purchase a Flex so that I could add a third party speaker to my speaker group. Unfortunately the sound does not sync up properly with the Echo and Dots that make up the rest of the multi-room group. Testing music directly on the Flex syncs up but on its own this also syncs right if using an aux cable but not when connecting via Bluetooth to a speaker. I tested with two different speakers by different manufacturers but came to the same result.  On the plus side the device itself is louder then expected and can be heard a room over clearly. I wouldn't recommend it over the dot for this purpose but for spoken audio (standup/audio books/pod casts/etc) and normal Alexa usage besides a morning alarm it works fantastically.,Good standalone micro speaker but not good for Bluetooth multi-room grouping
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Dec-19,Tex75,"I'm a big fan of the Echo Dot but I don't like looking at the untidy cord. When I saw this for pre-order I thought it would work great in the kitchen to replace the Dot. Set-up was simple and it looks decent enough but the audio... The sound is the equivalent to the worst AM radio. The volume can't be adjusted from the Flex, you have to go into the app, which is not at all convenient. Attempting to raise the volume is frustrating because although you may set it to 100%, when you reopen the app it is at 70%. No matter how many times you try to leave it at 100%, and boy did I try, it always turns itself back down. Needless to say, with the poor quality speaker and the inability to turn up the volume, if I am making any kind of noise in the kitchen (running water, frying food, running the microwave) it drowns out the Flex to the point I can't understand what is being said. I have no choice but to bring the Dot back to the kitchen and move the Flex to a quieter part of the house where it will see less use. The idea was good but poorly done. My hope is that Amazon will learn from this mistake and give us a much-improved Flex 2.",Not a good alternative for the Dot

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Feb-20,FYI,"I have an Echo, 3 Echo Dots, an Echo Input, and now this Echo Flex.  The Flex was given to me as a gift.  Overall, it really doesn't do anything for me.  Positive aspects may be that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet eliminating the need for a power cord, and possibly future accessories that hopefully are forthcoming.  Currently the two accessories that are available don't offer any wow factor for me.  Negative aspects:  not visually attractive; the speaker is basically useless because of low volume it generates and lack of tone.  It would probably function better pairing with a blue tooth speaker.  I would recommend spending a little more for the Echo Dot -- or maybe even the Echo Input.  The Dot has decent sound reproduction as a stand alone, and the Input looks better than the Flex but does require a power cable and some sort of extension speaker.  I think the Flex was a ""swing and a miss"" for Echo devices. Update:  spoke with an Amazon rep this morning following my posted review (great customer service Amazon!).  After elaborating on my opinion regarding the Flex, the rep provided me with some suggestions as to how to get better sound performance out of it.  I followed the advice and was able to produce better sound (volume and tone).  With that, I would change my rating on the device to 2 stars.  I am still of the opinion that this is not one of Amazon's better products, but I understand it will fit the needs of other customers.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,19-May-20,Liss,"Overall, I like this Echo Flex, but it was an absolute bear to install.  It made me re-enter my wifi password so many times I nearly gave up.  A few weeks later my phone informed me there was a new Echo available to install--and sure enough, this little Echo Flex had somehow dropped out of my devices.  I fought valiantly for over an hour to reinstall it--it literally kept telling me my network password was wrong.  I got online to search for help and found nothing that worked. I thought I was going to have to return it.  I was about ready to turn off my wifi/network and endure the slow cycle of everything coming back up, but I decided--what the hell--why don't I at least try unplugging and replugging the confounded Flex. And that fixed it.  I didn't even have to reinstall.  It was suddenly back in its rightful place in my devices.  Shrug. The sound quality is minimal, but it serves its purpose in my little utility room.  I use it with a motion sensor so I don't have to say or do anything to have the lights come on when I'm toting a big load of laundry into the room.  It's a reasonable little machine.  I do think, however, that it's much harder to install (because it seems to have trouble grasping onto wifi signal) and a bit more glitchy than the other Echo devices.

Sure, but I did not expect that and it works great for what we wanted it for. What we like... It is great for those tight spaces and areas that you want the convenience of Alexa, but don't have counter/table space. The fact that it is a small plug-in device makes it great for those areas. While the sound could certainly be better, it does do great for doing routines or dropping into other rooms in our house. We have one in our bathroom to listen to news and run routines, while getting ready. What is not to like? Pretty much just the sound quality. It would have been nice if they could have gotten close to even a cheap smartphone's speaker sound quality. Don't understand why it is not at least a little better. Overall...

The voice-recognition in the Flex works really well - sometimes better than a full-size Echo.  I see two ""misses"" and if I'm being totally honest I can't say the one is the Flex or the motion sensor attachment. Issue #1 - the motion sensor attachment goes wonky every few weeks and the way I've found to fix it is to unplug the Flex from the wall, wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Issue #2 - I didn't expect the speaker to be used for music and so I have the Flex set to play music on another Echo device in an adjacent room.  That's great, but what I needs is the ability to tell the Flex to use that other Echo for music, but let the Flex handle other verbal output so that if I play music it goes to another Echo with decent sounding speaker, but if I just ask Alexa a question or give her a command, the response should come from the Flex whose speaker is sufficient for verbal responses.","Perfect form, could use a bit of help in function"

I havent bought any of the only two accessories that exist for the flex so far. I may or may wait and see if Amazon comes up with more or better accessories for the flex. I use this is my kitchen right now away from the Dots. The sound quality is mediocre at best but that doesnt bother me. My 3rd G Dot has great sound. I am actually ok with the sub par sound because late at night if I ask Alexa anything my dots volume is usually up pretty loud and startles me. I don't think to ask her to turn her vol down first and whisper mode never works right for me. The flex is quiet lacking any bass sound or EQ features. At 3 am I can appreciate the mono sound not startling me or disturbing anyone in the house. My most negative opinion is that several times Alexa failed to respond to me after multiple request repeating ALEXA ALEXA. Nada. Most of those times happened while I was listening to music through the flex. I had to unplug it each time to stop the music. A few other times while silent the flex just didn't activate at all.

This little gadget is loud enough.. and has no problem hearing me...AND with the addition of the night light module, she provides me with a nice red glow for late night trips- no more turning on the jarring room lights!! Love her! Always have!","A baby Alexa.. just right for your powder room! Or laundry room, or garage...."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Jan-20,Sunny,"Unless you're in an extremely quiet room or a very small bed room, it's a little hard to hear this device. The speakers on this are minuscule, even at the maximum volume, it's a very low volume. If you have a TV, people talking, or music in the background, forget about hearing the response this device has to say. I'm glad Alexa is build into such a small and cheap device you can plug into the wall, but slightly louder speakers could make this very handy and more useful. I know you can plug an external speaker into the device, but I don't think most people buy this to use it that way. If you're thinking about using this in your bathroom while you're showering, you can forget about it. Overall, buy it when it is on sale, I don't think the full price is a good deal. I love my Echo Dots way more than the Echo Flex. The Echo Flex is average at best.",Need louder speakers.

You've been looking for that spot in the house where you dont want a power supply, trailing cable and puck sat on the top but you do need alexa coverage, this is it! Pro's Neat and Tidy.  Plug it in, add it to your Alexa environment and off you go. Also con : The sound is very tinny.  Clearly the minute speaker has no Bass reproduction but then thats fine - I find I can actually 'hear' it with improved clarity over the Alexa V3 sometimes.  Sometimes less IS more!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Jul-20,One Eyed Jack,"Far too many poor reviews from people who clearly failed to comprehend the purpose of this device. This product does what is intended to do, period. It is not a music player,  but can be, if paired with a bluetooth speaker. It wasn't designed for you to use it listen to 'talk radio' in the shower ( you should thank Amazon for that... seriously). It is best used in a small room or space,  for basic Alexa purposes. I have not tried any of the accessories,  nor do I plan to at this time. There are reviews about the poor volume, once again...designed for a small space.  I have mine about 6 feet from my bed and desk (between the two, I don't sleep on my desk...but have fallen asleep at it.). For the price, and for my needs,  I am quite satisified.

Pretty cool for the price! Definitely not great with the sound...but what do you expect with a tiny little speaker!?! Bottom line, if you want to have a little music or the news in a small space in your house or if you just want this device put in the hallway because the other echo dots or whatever you have cannot hear you, this is for you.

The sound quality is pretty good for how small it is and it projects quite a bit so you can hear it pretty well across a pretty decent distance.

This is something quite different that’s meant for another purpose. The sound is a quite a bit “tinny”. It’s meant to mainly be a receiver not a speaker. You can have an echo dot answer instead of this device if you want good sound. You can also hook up a Bluetooth or wired speaker (but that's an extra cost). So why do I have it? Guard Mode is part of my home security. I keep this in my bathroom to detect glass breaks. This is a cheaper alternative to a dot. I also pair this with my shower speaker. The USB plug is a bit handy as well. I know it’s really meant for the motion sensor or night light, but I use it as a charger. Update: After a few months, I'm happy with it.

I went with the night light, but wish I had gone with the motion instead.  The sound is shallow without a lot of range. I also feel like it can't hear as well. I already had an echo dot and thought that this would do well in the kitchen since it's more out of the way. Unfortunately, it's just not that great of quality. I was hoping for better sound.

I recommend pairing the Flex with an Alexa Echo Dot or Echo Plus. Yes, the Flex has a speaker, but it's suited mostly for feedback from Alexa responding to your commands or questions. Music sounds tinny.  I love the Flex's USB port, which enabled me to charge an auxiliary Sony SRS-XB12 speaker, plus I used the Flex's 3.5mm jack to feed audio direct into the Sony.

I wanted an Alexa speaker so that I could listen to music in addition to asking Alexa about the time and weather all while getting ready for work in the morning. The reason it took me so long to purchase, was because other reviewers had stated that the sound was very low and you could hardly understand Alexa and hear music being streamed. After reading just ONE review from someone stating they had bought it for their bathroom and it was everything that they wanted it to be with sound volume and size, I decided to purchase. To my surprise, it was everything I wanted it to be. The volume emitted was perfect and I could hear the music perfectly while in the shower.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Nov-20,EDISONTECH,"OMG! Amazon! Your Alexa sale really got me to buy 2 more Alexas for my house. Now I have 3 total in my house! So far, both have been amazing! I have one in the bathroom to ask for the morning news, weather, and the time. This is called the “Flex” because of the flexibility to relocate it to anywhere there is WiFi access. The response tome is about the same as my 3rd gen Dot. This Alexa is small but I see room for improvement for this tiny device. I don’t get why it is so huge but the audio is sub-par. (I would guess the AC to DC conversion but how much space does it need?) They could of easily put inside a bigger speaker driver in the space. If they could do it for the Echo Auto, so can they do it for the flex. On the flip side, one thing I like about the Flex is that I can plug in my own speakers and usb device in with no problems (has 3.5mm headphone jack on the side and a USB A port on the bottom).

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Jan-20,zwis,"It’s exactly what it looks like - a small, plug-in box that brings Alexa to even more places. The sound quality isn’t the best, but for the price I wasn’t expecting it to be. Besides, it has an audio port to attach any external speaker one could want. Sometimes it has difficulties hearing me when playing music at full volume, but its just minor difficulties, I’ve never had to stand there yelling at it in order for it to hear me. I’ve found this super especially useful around the house with making ‘Alexa announcements’. We have a flex in our kitchen, and another in my fathers office (which is located outside in a garage). He never has his phone on him, so whenever it’s time for dinner we no longer have to run outside to let him know, we can simply say “Alexa, announce dinner time!” and he will know! I’ve also been using a flex in my bedroom with the motion sensor attachment, and WOW does it feel otherworldly to get home from work and have my house greet me with my lights and tv coming on and a little ‘hello’. This is by FAR the cheapest option to adding motion sensors to Alexa to automate routines, all others I could find required some sore of hub (which is too expensive) or were in themselves too expensive.

The sound quality is what you would expect, for such a small device. One of the great features is that it can plug into other external speakers through a 3.5 mm jack. The best feature in my opinion, is the little devices you can plug into it. Currently, there are two, a little light and a motion sensor. Which, I am not sure why there is another one, as there is one built into it. Perhaps the external one is more sensitive. Either way, it’s a great little night light. It is also able to change colors. I have used Red, White and Blue. Not certain if it can do other colors.

We had a cheap baby monitor in the laundry room and the receiver in the living room and monitored the laundry that way, but it was fifteen years old and static-y. Audio-only baby monitors in stores had terrible ratings and were about 30 dollars. For reasons too long to enumerate, we bought an Echo Show 5, so we moved the previously-used Echo Dot in the laundry room and used it for drop-ins; the sound was so much better. But I wanted the Dot for use in another room and using it just as a ""baby monitor"" seemed silly. Then I saw this little Flex on sale! Since I won't be playing music on it, there's no need for optimum sound out of the tiny speakers, and it's still useful for dropping in, asking the time or the temperature, etc. This is a great alternative to the Dot if you're not concerned with sound fidelity; talked to my husband on it via drop in and he says the sound coming via the Flex is pretty good!",Nifty If You Don't Mind Sound Quality

I did read that the device was not ""music quality"" sound and thought that was fine as all I needed it for was mainly alarms and daily functioning, unfortunately that description was an understatement. The sound quality was awful. At volume 10 (max volume) the sound was maybe comparable to volume 3 of regular alexa devices, on top of that it was very grainy sounding. Alexa had a hard time hearing us, even though she is supposed to have long range listening. I had another device in my room next to my bed, maybe four feet from the head of the bed and she wouldn't recognize when I spoke to her from that distance. I was able to charge my phone from the USB port on the bottom but that was about the only good function.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jun-20,Chris G.,"Flex can hear you farther than the 1st Dot.  My Kitchen Flex is constantly eavesdropping while I'm talking to the LivingRoom Dot. Flex's integration is awesome, and in some instances, better than Dot. However, her voice needs an upgrade in both quality and volume.  It's almost painful to listen to her relatively squeaky voice especially when you combine it with a Max 10 Volume sounding close to a 3 Volume Dot. The only solution is to get a constant-power BT Speaker to sync with her.  Maybe that's why they gave the flex a USB charging port. Well, for the price I paid for her, the $10 cheap speaker is still a good deal.","Ears like a wolf, mouth like a mouse."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Dec-19,Alisha,"I bought the flex for a specific purpose. To use in my basement to disarm my alarm so we can enter/exit the basement door and for the Alexa guard abilities since I have windows in my basement.  We don't use the basement door often, so I didn't want to waste a dot for that use, plus there is no convenient place to put a dot. The flex is perfect here. I also purchased the light mostly to play with and have been impressed with it as well. The flex is not for listening to music, and if you get one for that you will be disappointed. It is a device whose main purpose is to control smart devices, integrate Alexa in lesser used spaces, or for very small rooms where a dot would be too much. I think the light or motion sensor should come with the flex so I deducted a star, but in all honesty, I don't need either one for my use.

I was used to speaking to a normal echo dot or the full size echo, but this one is nowhere near as sensitive as those.  Nearly every time I want to use it I have to repeat myself 2-3 times, each louder than the last.  Once you can get it to respond it operates like any other Alexa device but getting it to wake up is a miserable.  Even my Echo Auto has better voice pickup than this thing does. It is also lacking volume control buttons.  It's even harder to get it to wake up when it's playing music.  I have to yell at the thing to get it to respond. I used this to replace an Echo Dot next to my bathroom sink because I didn't like having it on the counter top and I didn't like the cord running to it.

After I received them on the 6th I plugged each one in, connected it to my software and network, then checked/changed settings and ran it through its paces to ensure they were all up to snuff. The problem was that two of them, even though they responded to ‘alexa’, had an error that it was waiting for wakeword which never updated. Not a huge problem unless I want to change the wakeword, which knowing me as I do, I probably will. I deregistered all three and oddly all of my information remained on the device, even the changes to alarms and audio, which seems wrong. So I factory reset all three and guess what?

It is then that you will have sound quality that far exceeds any stand-alone smart speaker you can find at ten times the price.  Additionally, that little internal speaker actually articulates better than the larger echos because it doesn't even try to reproduce the low frequencies, so for reproducing voices like news, audio books, Alexa-read Kindle books and phone calls it also functions better. You get all of this for only $25 and since I got it mine on sale for $10, the value I have received is tremendous. You may be asking yourselves ""If it's so great then why didn't you give it five stars?""  This is because I don't give out five stars.  I like to leave some headroom for when I'm absolutely blown away by a product and, so far, with my 58 years into this life, I haven' t felt like that about anything. My recommendation:  Buy it and love it for years.  You won't regret it.  I bet you had more buyer's remorse over that high school sweetheart you married just a few short years ago.  You know, that ""I'll love you until the end of time"" girl.  Yeah right.  You're ready to hit the escape hatch on that one, aren't ya?",The sound quality is excellent and here's why...

Seriously, other site have a lower price on the device on amazon itself! It works well enough, sound it's spectacular. Mic was responsive. I initially was confuse if it have a mic in it as it have an input for mic/speak.Yes, it does. I was not able to find similar brand light bulb with  RGB. I have bought 2 more for living room but of other brand. I realize each would need their app to start and to control the more details function. Being my tablet does not have a lot of memory, I can be an issue. The bulb app integrated with Alexa well, but it has been twice that the bulb disconnected from Alexa and have to relink. Same as other RGB brand. 1st time it occur, it was all off them off the wifi and have to reset. Alexa app itself have nice function, like add stuff to your shopping list, set alarm and to radio and certain music subscription. My only concern is that how much privacy and security it has. Unless I ""turn off"" the mic. Another con is that it does not have a wire but plug directly into the wall outlet like the other echo.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Nov-20,B,"Love these! I purchased them for the office and places that don't have a convenient place to set an Echo Dot, such as the garage. It is far more sensitive than my Echo Dots or Echo Show. It picks up the wake word from 50 ft which is amazing since I sometimes have to yell at my Echo Show from just 10 ft. The sound is a little quiet and scratchy when compared with other Echo devices. Not exactly ideal for playing music but does well enough it clear and intelligible. You can still retain access to the upper plug when this is plugged in. Very easy to setup and only takes a few minutes once you have the app. I highly recommend these. They would be great for people that are new to the smart home things. They are cheap, effective and allow you to try it out without breaking the bank. They make it easy to have Alexa in every room.

I have 3 Echo Dots [3rd Gen]. And multiple smart plugs. I added a night light to the Flex & love that it's dimmable for the bathroom. I care little that the speaker is not high quality. I'm only using it to listen to the news & check the weather. Maybe set a timer, add to my lists or ask Alexa something important while I'm brushing my teeth or doing laundry which is also in the bathroom. Very very happy with this new Echo.

THE. BEDROOM. LIGHTS,"" to our living room Echo device when my husband was staying up watching TV and I was headed to bed. Sometimes I wondered if my neighbors could hear me. Most of the time my voice wouldn't get recognized and I'd have to mute the TV or scream into the Echo an inch away from it for it to hear me. What was the point? I didn't want to buy an entirely new Echo just for the bedroom in our small one bedroom apartment. I'm glad they came up with this. Now I can quietly go into the bedroom while the TV is on and gently ask Alexa to do things. The default audio from the device is definitely not the best quality (our main Echo is hooked up to our speaker system) but it's nice enough. I like the lights on the device that mirror the regular Echo, so I know what's going on with it. I had a little trouble setting it up because I guess our internet isn't the best, but eventually got it synced. Thank you for preventing me from being that one neighbor you can hear yelling at their Echo.",Great add-on. Stop yelling at Alexa!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jan-20,Seth I Levine,"This is a pretty OK Echo device. It certainly has its good points! When used with the motion sensor (which is what I'm doing), it really could only work in a hallway type of situation. The problem, as I see it, is that it needs to be plugged directly into an outlet, and, in my house anyway, most of the outlets in rooms where I might want this to work, are below knee level and behind furniture - except in the hallway. I suppose the nightlight option would work well in the hallway situation, too, but it's too bad you can't have both the nightlight AND motion sensor. The Alexa functionality of this device is just like all other Alexa devices. It can hear from all around a room and answer questions or follow commands. The speaker is definitely not worthy of playing music with much fidelity. Right now, I'm using it in my garage to control an adjacent smart switch to turn the garage lights on in reaction to the motion sensor. That seems like a perfect fit for this combination of devices. I'm not really sure how else one might use this, because most outlets in most homes in the US are not accessible in a way that would work with this thing. If I had a very specific use case where I knew this would work, I'd buy it again. Otherwise, I wish there was a motion sensor option from Amazon that didn't require being plugged directly into a wall outlet.",It's an odd combination of brilliant and dumb
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Oct-20,Matt Seegers,"I wanted to try out the Flex right when Amazon announced the new product but only recently had a chance to purchase them. My intended use-case was for the two bathrooms in my apartment.  My wife and I almost exclusively listen to NPR while we're in the bathroom getting ready for the day and have been resorting to using one of our phones to play it.  This works pretty well but obviously can lead to some risks/issues:  the phones' speakers are *almost* loud enough to hear while in the shower.  If you place the phone in a sink it boosts the volume just enough.  As one may expect, this has resulted in many close calls with water. Initial Setup: Fantastically easy, just like any Amazon Echo device Physical Size: just small enough that it shouldn't block both outlets in a dual outlet... outlet. Experience:  Speech recognition just as good as any Echo device, but I have only used them in bathrooms, which is likely easier for the mic(s) to pick up.  Loading apps (like NPR) or pairing using bluetooth is just like any other Echo device (ie fast and relatively painless).  Audio sounds good--but, as is essentially mentioned in product description, is not designed for rich (ie music) audio and does not get very loud.  I would rate the loudness to be lower than an iPhone 7 or later. Takeaway: This is a great device to integrate voice control in a small/medium room.  However, if you want to use it for audio and there is any ambient noise in the room I would recommend either using external speakers (plugged in to the audio-out and/or USB port) or external bluetooth speakers.  If your main goal was to get audio into a room it may be more cost effective to find an all-in-one solution that can support voice control and also has solid speakers.  For me, I am hoping that there will be more Flex accessories that could potentially address this issue (ie a Flex Speaker that plugs into the USB port and fits the same form factor).",Great for adding voice control to any small/med room with low ambient noise

So I needed a device to turn them on & off. Plus I also wanted the extra features like asking Alexa what time it is, the weather, playing my Amazon Music while I'm getting ready. This Echo Flex really is helpful. Although at times it does not respond. Especially when I'm standing in total darkness asking it to turn on the light.....and nothing happens. Sometimes I have to ask many times. I do have 1 reg bulb. To get to it in the total darkness could cause injury to myself. LOL So I stand there asking Alexa numerous times in different ways to turn on the lights. My Echo Flex seems to be quirky. I have it in a clear spot so I know it can hear me.

Such is the case with the Echo Flex.  I have 2 Dots, and a fairly sprawled out house, with a basement.  I wanted a simple way to keep the family connected, and had already found out how handy (and fun) the Dots were, so I added 2 Flex. The whole set up works like a charm and is easy to use.  I can now ""drop in"" on someone in the basement while I'm in the living room, or (as the ad says) call everyone to dinner, no matter where they are just by asking Echo to do so.  I've had a ball programming each to say certain things at certain times (the Flex at the back door has the job of reminding hubby at 6 am to make sure he has everything before he leaves for work). The Flex are small enough to not take up a lot of room. As a bonus, for these two I also purchased the night lights to go along with them, so they pull double duty.

Also one worry I had was the operating temperature. It says it is rated down to 32 degrees. Well I haven't had it long and the temperature in my garage has been down near single digits and so far so good!  I figured for the price it was worth trying to see if it survived.

We added the Echo Flex  because it doesn't take up any counter space and we wanted to have an intercom because the kitchen is on the opposite end of the house from the living room and we end up doing a lot of shouting back and forth.

You can hear that the other person is saying something, but can't understand what it is.  We are now trying to figure out where we can put a Dot in the kitchen.

A socket mounted, $25 echo that fits well into a bathroom or kitchen, paired with a bluetooth speaker is amazing, and hey, when the thing actually responds to your voice, it is amazing. However, even when there is no sound whatsoever, I sometimes have to literally scream at the thing to wake it, and a good 1/10 times it doesn't understand me.  I will try to talk to it but my echo plus on the other side of the apartment will respond because of how terrible the mics on the flex are.  I have even resorted to giving them different names (which I hate, and shouldn't have to do) but even then, I can be standing in the same exact position directly in front of the flex (which sits at about chest height in my kitchen) and it will sometimes wake, but often just sit there like a useless piece of plastic and circuitry.

The speaker quality is completely fine for what it is.  I love being able to make announcements from any room, to any room. But what I don't love is that there is often a delay with the responsiveness, especially the farther you are from your wifi source (which makes sense since the voice commands are sent to the Amazon data centers that process the commands, like Siri on Apple), that is not an issue with my full sized Echos.

But for me it works just fine if I want low music in the background or sleepy time white noise. I’ve tried playing audiobooks on a louder setting and I think the sound quality was pretty crisp for a small radio, it’s definitely not like a BOSE SoundLink.

I've listened to the activity recordings, and it literally cuts off part of my question or statement before deciding to answer me. And it's about 90% of the time wrong. My husband and I are both pretty shocked that this thing passes for an Alexa brand product. Either they need to fix it, or they need to pull it and replace it.",Not worth replacing or supplementing an echo dot with. Not worth anything except an isolated room.

Bottom line is- it works and sounds as would expect a small device to. I read a lot of reviews of people who purchased the Echo Flex and didn't think the sound quality was up to par of other Echo devices (no way! really?! *gasp*) -If you're looking for Bose quality sound to come out of this thing, your expectations are way too high. If you're expecting Echo Dot sound quality to come out of this thing... AGAIN- your expectations are way too high. This thing sounds as I expected, like an intercom speaker, it is all treble and almost no bass at all. HOWEVER- you can connect an external speaker to it via the 3.5mm audio jack.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Sep-20,Marine2Soldier,"This item has minimal range as it pertains to distance from the router and the primary Alexa device.  Walls and objects like empty boxes easily disrupt it.  Not to mention, when playing music on these devices, the sound level is so low, you are better off playing your Alexa device in one room and while in another location.  The connection gets continuously lost, and you have to re-establish it by bringing it back to the primary Alexa device again.  The initial connection process leaves much to be desired.  The directions are not as straightforward as it can be.  Even the customer service told me to disregard them as they walked me through them.  My advice is if you are going to purchase one of these, purchase one at a time until you see how it works for you.  Please do not do like I did buy four of them, and be stuck all four wall plugs.

It annoyingly constantly disconnects and connects to Bluetooth for a few minutes after someone tries to drop in.

Now I don’t have to :). And, I love all the colors of the nightlight.I got the flex on sale. Now I wish I bought a few more to give to family members, who have the echo dot, as gifts. Hopefully, they go on sale soon. If you want a little extra “boost” for your echo dot or plus, it definitely will do the job. One caveat - the speaker is tinny. Def not for music....",It’s great for my needs
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Feb-20,crb42,"I had an Echo Dot in my bathroom to listen to the news when I shaved in the morning.  The problem was it took up counter space and was prone to getting splashed.  The Echo Flex plugs directly into the outlet so is off the counter and out of harm's way.  The audio quality is a bit low for music due to the size of the unit, but for my purposes, its fine.",Perfect for my purposes
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jan-20,Chris Caudill,"This is a great little Echo device and for $20 it's hard to be too critical, but I would love it if the speaker got a little louder (it's a bit hard to hear from across the room) and the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as the new echo dots. I would also love it if the device was *slightly* narrower (it almost blocks the light switch next to it) but I really like that I don't have 2 feet of extra power cable sitting on the kitchen counter and the USB port on the bottom is great as well.",Almost Perfect
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Feb-20,Trish,"I thought it would be great to add a speaker to Alexa in different parts of the house.  Unfortunately this speaker must be plugged into an outlet less than 10 feet from Alexa.  And doesn't really work if you're 6-10 feet away and there's a wall between the two items.  Also even within 10 feet of Alexa, you'd think having stereo with multiple speakers, well this little twit has terrible tinny sound, and tiny sound. So simply detracts from the sound of Alexa.  I'd return them but I bought them few months ago and put them back in the box but then forgot about them.  Trying to save you the trouble now.",This product has little to no value
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Feb-20,ZoomFROG,"I guess I should have expected less for my $20. The sound quality is horrible, the max volume is still too low to be heard from a distance. Considering this thing plugs into a wall outlet, placement location is limited. Many home outlets are located behind furniture, TVs, bookcases, desks, etc.  I like the concept but it just isn't as useful as I had expected.  Perhaps the kitchen counter outlets are the best use for this device. Forget about listening to music on the Echo Flex. The sound quality just isn't good enough.",Sound quality is disappointing.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jan-20,Penfield,"Bought this for my daughter who wanted an Alexa connected device in her downstairs area.

You can set it up to alert you via text message and you can customize the name, and what it says to alert you. You can also have it trigger a light to turn on or off via smart outlet or smart light bulb or anything else in your smart home set up.

When I am getting ready for work I can listen to the radio, get news and weather while taking my shower, or brushing my teeth.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jan-20,Kristen Forhetz,Its very convenient as it acts as a plug AND Alexa. This is good for bedrooms that don’t really need an EchoDot. Connects with smart plugs easily. Operates commands just like my EchoDot does in the living room.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Nov 2019,Ella Belle,"I just got my Echo Flex - Plug-in smart speaker with Alexa this morning and I'm already totally in LOVE with it! With it I also bought that ""Made for Amazon"" THIRDREALITY Smart Night-Light for Echo Flex, and I love it too! I had been wanting to put an Echo Dot in a very tiny bathroom, but I was trying to figure out how, since I have no counter space and didn't want to use up my last outlet. Then, along comes this Echo-Flex thingy, so I decided to give it a try. I've been super delighted with it all morning long! I love how it just plugs right into an outlet and is totally out of my way but still basically does most of what the echo Dots do. I had a regular nightlight in the room that took up an outlet socket, so this new Smart Nigh-Light was a great solution because it plugs right into the bottom of the Echo Flex, so just the Echo-Flex is using that 1 outlet now. It's so cool too because I can ask Alexa to change the lights colors! I've bought 4 of the Echo Dots for my home and I am in love with all of them. This Echo-Flex is just a smaller version that is so perfect for small bathrooms, laundry rooms and basically anywhere else where you just don't have counter or table space for an Echo Dot. I also love how easy it is to set these devices up! Just be sure the little box below the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Buy Now"" buttons is checked ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup""! It really does simplify the set-up wonderfully! Anyway, I am totally loving this new Echo-Flex so much and I already have ideas of getting some more of them for other tiny places around my home that I had not considered before. These things are just so helpful AND so fun! UPDATE 08/16/2020: I've now bought 4 of these echo Flexes with the nightlights. One for the laundry room, one for my Kitchen and 2 for my small bathrooms. I use these every day and they have become indispensable!  Sure, the sound is not super great for music, but the fact that these are not stealing any counter space is paramount for me. I have other Echo's in other rooms for music anyway. I love these things! UPDATE 10/13/2020: I am STILL in love with these cool little Echo Flex gadgets!  I use them many times daily! A great size for small rooms like Bathrooms, laundry rooms, store rooms, mud rooms, garage, even out in our woodshed! I happily got more today on Prime Day! Thank you Amazon!",Awesome Alexa Solution For Small Rooms!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,Mr Huskey,"It is very bulky robbing room from other items you might want to plug in.  The speaker quality sucks.  No where near as good as the Echo plus speaker.  Playing music on the Flex's built in speaker sounds like listening to an old transistor pocket radio.  It does pair easily to my blue tooth speakers which sound really good. Motion detection works, but is almost useless until the Amazon Alexa app matures a bit more.  Settings in the app are too cumbersome to want to use at the moment.  Controlling a light seems easy enough, but I wanted it to turn on a Wyze switched outlet.  I had to create a new group... assign the Wyze switch to it... create a routine to turn on the group.  There was no skill that let me just turn on/off the switch without creating the group first.  Seemed like way more hassle than it should have been. The night light seems nice, but I haven't spent much time playing with it yet.  I just picked the first color that was bright enough to fill the room.  Too bad you can't have motion sensing and the night light in one module.  I really only want the night light to turn on when I step out of bed in the middle of the night.",A very minimalistic  Echo device

It was barely audible plugged next to the bathroom sink standing 2 feet away... even less so in the shower. Although you can plug an external speaker to it, it defeats the purpose of it. It could work if you prefer using an external speaker (3.5mm will support drop-in, bluetooth will not) and just want to plug something in the wall and not worry about cables. But overall, I was disappointed and just swapped it for another Dot.",Barely audible
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2019,D. Coral,"I set up this cute little Echo Flex + Motion Sensor in the garage.  It was easy to add Routines in the Alexa app to turn On and Off the WeMo light switch for the garage light.  I had this automation ready to go in about 5 minutes.  It’s real nice to have the garage light come on automatically whenever I open the garage door.  I also set it to turn off the light after no motion is detected for 1 hour (choose any time period). You can also have the motion sensor activate an Echo device to speak a custom phrase, give a news flash briefing, traffic report, play music, etc. There is a setting to specify the time when the motion sensor should perform the Routine (anytime, or between a certain time period) and to suppress a repeat of the Routine for a configurable time period so it won’t keep doing the same thing every time there is motion, if you don’t want it to.  For example you can have it give you the traffic report or news briefing when you enter the bathroom in the morning but only if the motion happens between 6-8am. This is super useful — after trying out the first one, I’m going to buy a few more to play with around the house.",Motion Sensor is Handy!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2019,Spyder2014,"If you are looking for a quality speaker to listen to music while you are in the bathroom or kitchen... pay a little extra and get an echo dot. The flex is perfect if you want to add another echo device for the sake of controlling smart home devices, taking advantage of the guardian functionality or for the occasional drop in. You also get the added functionality of either a motion sensor or night light with the available accessories. We replaced our bathroom night light with the flex and it is great! The light accessory gives off more light than our old night light and my wife loves the different colors you can choose due to the built in rgb LEDs. I tested the drop in feature as well and it was loud and clear while talking to my wife in the next room. I highly recommend the flex if you want an additional echo device in a bathroom, kitchen or spare room and don't want the hassle of hiding the cables, or if you want to add motion sensor triggers or a night light to a room.",Perfect... for what it is!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,Debra T,"I am in the midst of setting up an Alexa eco-system in my home. I have a Fire TV, first generation Echo, Fire Tablet, Echo Show 5, and several smart plugs. I wanted an Alexa-enabled device in my bedroom to do the ""basics"" ... respond to my voice commands ... and to turn the smart plugs on my bedroom lamps on and off. So I got an Echo Flex. I set it up in less than a minute, and soon it was turning my lamps on and off, telling me the time, answering my silly questions and telling me jokes! People, this is how technology should work. The world would be a much techno-friendly place if all technology was this easy to set up. I didn't get this for the sound quality of an Echo or for the screen time of an Echo Show. If I had wanted those features in my bedroom, I would have spent more more money to get them. I can never figure out why people buy an entry level product here on Amazon that does ""the basics"" and then give it a bad review when it doesn't do everything the ""cadillac version"" does. Sheesh. What I love about this product: --It's a great price. --It does what it's intended to do. --It can be enhanced with a bluetooth speaker, a nightlight or a motion detector. --It's out of the way. --It only takes up one outlet. The other one is still available for use. --You can plug in a USB device to it, like a smartphone, to charge it. What I dislike about this product: --Nothing. Because it does what I bought it to do. In my book, Amazon gets big kudos for giving buyers options for different features and price points of their Alexa product line.",Works great for its intended purpose!!!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2019,Amodeus1971,"Besides the speaker being small and sounding like garbage the Flex has gotten better over time. The motion sensor I have come to like now that I have adapted to it and they have seemed to iron out some of the problems. My main problem now is they limited the use of it because they are only allowing you to own two of these with the motion sensor per Amazon account unless you have a business account. No other explanation besides they tried to get me to sign up for an Amazon business account. I have one in my bathroom and wanted to put two in my kitchen are because there are two entrances and I wanted to make my lights fully motion-controlled in my kitchen. I can do this to a point with Wyze Sense but I don't want any more cameras inside my living space than I need to have, which are the two on my rear windows as the other security cameras are all outside. This imitation severely limits the usefulness of this product.",Rewritten review

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2019,Drumlord29,"I added another echo device to my collection! I've got every single kind of echo in the market. For obvious reasons, the speaker isn't the best. It is surprisingly smaller than I thought. I use it in my garage for when I close the garage using Alexa. I have the MyQ garage opener which i can open or close with my echo auto in my car. But after I turn off my engine, so does my echo auto. So I have to pull out my phone or manually push the garage opener on the wall. So I plugged it underneath my garage door opener so I can tell Alexa to close or open the garage door from anywhere in my garage without my phone or pushing a button. I don't really intend to use this for playing music. It's really for doing simple Alexa tasks in my garage. It is an echo device that is not meant to look and sound pretty. It's Alexa at its most basic form. Small, no cables, small speaker, and works like any echo device. I believe it's meant for a garage bathroom or hallway if uppity have the night light or motion detector accessory. If you want to play music with it, a bluetooth or wired speaker is highly recommended. Although I had very little expectations with this being that I meant to use it to just open and close my garage, I did notice one negative thing on it. I tried adjusting thre volume from the Alexa app but it switches back to 70% everytime. No idea why. Perhaps there built in speaker is best heard at 70% and if connected to a better speaker, it will allow for a louder volume. I'm going yo have to try that someday. But for now, it's perfect for what I wanted to use it for. If you know what you need it for, don't expect it to be more than that. If you want a better sound, get a dot or something bigger. For simple uses, this will do fine for all your Alexa needs. I may use it for my echo microwave which is currently paired with my echo input connected to a speaker. Don't blame the equipment if you want it to do more than what the hardware can achieve. Be fair to the gadget on what it is capable of doing.","Small, not for music, great for basic Alexa"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2019,BD,"I love the idea of the echo flex! We have Sonos throughout our house, and don't need to play music on our echo devices. So the echo dot has worked very nicely. However it was bulky and unattractive plugged in to the walls. The flex seemed like the perfect solution, so I bought one... and was disappointed. The size was great! Exactly what I thought it would be. But then I tried using it... It is very quiet! I have 4 small children at home and so there's always some noise happening... This echo would not work well in any kind of main room in my house because of how quiet it is. So, I moved it to the baby's room, but was still disappointed... I can be sitting right next to it and it won't wake to Alexa... I'll have to repeat to get it to respond. I'll bet they make some improvements and the next generation will be better.",Meh... Wait for the next generation
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2020,Megan Campbell,"I’m not sure why there are so many negatives regarding sound on this thing. I feel this is a niche product that is meant to be a filler for home automation. I have a small apartment with 2 dots: one in my sons room, another in my main room. Our morning routine has me going to the Alexa app and turning off his alarm and turning on his music and lights for his wake up routine. I’ve wanted a voice activated device that wasn’t a full blown dot to help me automate our morning routine. I already have a nice Yamaha speaker in my room so I wasn’t wanting an echo. Also, I prefer some privacy in my bedroom (my other dots tend to pick up at random times). This will work perfectly for that purpose. I can update this review after I’ve had this for a bit. Yes the sound is smaller and a bit distorted but this isn’t meant to be a true speaker. I see it as an intercom to help automate my household.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2020,TexasDude,This shouldn’t be an issue but it actually is and is why I took away a star. These pick up voice and respond much faster than my normal echos and echo dots (latest generations). This is a problem because I bought these for the times when I’m not really close enough to the main echos and wanted to not have to yell (What I call “filler” echos). BUT when I’m trying to talk to a closer Regular echo these pick me up too fast and from far away so they sometimes get what I’m saying wrong or they are not the specific device I was trying to control (for like music etc) USB port is pretty sweet. I have one in my bathroom that I use for a phone charge. One in the hallway that I have the motion hooked up to. And one in another hallway with the light on it for a night light and notification light. The accessory attachments respond quite fast and consistently. People comment on music sounding bad... well duh! The product specifically says these are not meant for music. I’ve actually found them useful in hallways when I have multi room music going and then the flex has low volume for vocals while passing through hallways to the next room. It’s quite pleasant.,It’s actually a problem that these can hear and respond better than normal echos
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jul 2020,Moore Family,"I got the Echo Flex to go along with weatherproof Bluetooth speakers on our covered deck. I Love that there are no external cables, and it's easy to unplug and take inside. The Bluetooth connection has been rock-solid so far. Things stay pretty dry on the deck, but rain does come in from the side during heavy thunderstorms, so I designed and 3D-printed a simple cover for the Echo Flex to keep it dry. So far it has stayed totally dry. If you're interested, search thingiverse dot com for ""Echo Flex Splash Guard"" and you'll find it. As far as the Echo Flex itself: I'm very happy with it as a way to play music and podcasts over Bluetooth speakers. Previously, I tried using a Google Home Mini (in a zip-lock bag) and it kept disconnecting constantly. While it's great to ask for the news, weather, etc without needing a mobile device, the voice interface can be very awkward for getting certain specific content (podcasts, albums, etc). Most of the time, you end up hearing something similar to, but not quite, what you asked for. For that reason, it's nice that you can cast to the EF from the Amazon music app. Regarding voice recognition:  we do have to yell at it a bit more than the Echo Dots inside the house. This may be due to the rain cover blocking some of the sound and/or sound dispersing more outside than it does inside. Still, not a big issue. We're in a pretty secluded area, so I'm not that worried about security, but I get that this would be an issue for folks in more crowded areas. As is well documented, anyone expecting much out of the internal speaker would be very disappointed. OTOH, it's nice that Amazon chose to release a low-cost/high-function product and still make it easy to connect to external speakers with the 3.5mm or Bluetooth interfaces. Overall, given the price, size, quality and the way I'm using it with external speakers, I'm extremely happy with the Echo Flex.",Works great with external Bluetooth speakers. 3D Printed cover makes it more weather resistant.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,D. Newton,"REVISED TO 5 stars: One of the latest updates established connectivity and functionality, and it now works exactly as expected. It’s a small speaker, and thus won’t provide anything but minimal sound, nor is it designed to. Understand this beforehand and you won’t be disappointed like so many others who didn’t think through what it was designed for. If you need great sound/music quality, then other Echos are designed for that. So far, the Alexa app hasn’t been able to see/recognize/connect to the Flex, no matter what I do. I’ll box it up and wait a couple of months for an update to fix this issue. I have 14 other Alexa units in total, so this was just a purchase out of curiosity, not necessity.","Understand the niche for this, and why the speaker is small, and you will be happy."

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Nov 2019,Rafael,"UPDATE: After having it for almost a year I been having problems where it disconnects often and sometimes won't respond all the time I can tell it to turn off the light but then tell it to do something else like ask the time and it seems confused, won't answer, but then the next day it does. I lked it for the motion thing but just going to get a regular dot for the garage. I have this in my garage and works perfectly when I'm working there and want to turn on lights I have connected to a smart plug. Also if I want to know the weather or if I have a question in general works great. I can play music on it but it's not great for sound, but I don't think that was the intent for this. If your buying it for higher quality sound get a Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa. Or pair it up with a Bluetooth speaker or use the 3.5 mm audio jack and hook it to your stereo. I did the drop in with an echo dot in the house and it worked great. I could hear them clearly and they could hear me, which is nice if someone needs me they can drop in on the garage. I also have a camera in the garage so I can also see and now talk to whoever is there. Overall I'm happy with it. Oh and if the LED is flashing a yellowish color it's the way it notifies you you have a notification. Found that out when The one I have in the house was also flashing indicating I have a notification.","UPDATE:..... Nice little Device, works perfectly as intended."

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Nov 2019,Valag,"The Flex is a great option if you don't like having cords dragging across surfaces. It does everything a regular Echo or Echo Dot can do. and It's actually smaller than I expected. Only occupies the lower plug without blocking the top one. Great for kitchen and bathroom, or anywhere that has above-counter-level plugs. Produces enough sound that I can hear it while in the shower, but, the speaker quality leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't expecting top-notch, Bose-quality sound from this small of a device, but Alexa sounds like she's talking to me through a Solo cup. So I guess this won't replace any of my other Echo devices for playing music, but it's certainly good enough for listening to the news and weather while getting ready for work.",The Echo device that won't Flex your wallet.

This device is so puny that it must go back to the gym to earn it's name! Here is our loser friend to explain why such a flabby device can only lift one star.... <clears throat> Mmmm k. As avid Amazon smart product users, we purchased the Flex based on it's small design form (in that it would occupy the least amount of space and be a perfect kitchen addition to keep our counters open). On this front it is perfect. Speaking in the kitchen, the Echo Dot Second Generation in our living room was actually picking up our voices better than the Flex which was in the same room. To Echo* what other reviewers have said, the sound on this device is tinny and distracting. Considering most smart phones can generate, the small footprint of the Flex isn't a great excuse in 2020 for skimping on sound to this extent. With commands and recipes is was displeasing but with music it was downright distracting. Imagine an old building doorway intercom speaker as an upgrade to this and you get what I mean. I'm guessing the positive reviews are mainly concerned with the small footprint which again, is excellent but even at a discount we had to return this and the accompanying motion sensor in favor of mounting another Echo speaker in our kitchen. Here's hoping Amazon invests just a tiny bit more on the quality of the speaker and microphone array though for future generations of this product because this first gen Flex was an absolute miss for our household. * puns provided free of charge for this unbiased loser review",Did someone say Flex?

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Oct 2020,Deebs,"I bought the flex for my basement. I'm older and the laundry is in the basement.  I'm always afraid some day I'll fall down those steep stairs so I try to remember to take my cell with me.  While this will NOT call 911 for you, I can ask it to call my son or daughter if I'm home alone and fall.  Problem is the sound quality.  The outlet is on a far wall, so while it does recognize my voice nicely, I can't hear the response very well as the speaker is very poor for an older person or if there is any other noise.  Hence the lower rating.  I've ordered a dot to replace it and will move this one elsewhere.  Setup - because it was already linked to my Amazon account I did nothing but plug it in, pull the app up on my phone, selected the device and wow it connected!  Nothing else to do!!!!","Poor sound, easiest setup ever!"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Sep 2020,Nicholas H,"I bought the Flex for my kitchen and I'm very disappointed with it. So straight to the point... 1) Terrible microphone. Unless you're in a quiet room, the device has a lot of trouble understanding me. I have to repeat my commands slower and more loudly, but when I do that, the echo dot in my bedroom upstairs and down the hall responds to me instead. It's basically impossible to use when other people are speaking in the same room. I have to ask everyone to be quiet while I ask Alexa a question. It has come to the point where it's almost a joke if she actually hears me correctly. I don't have this problem with the echo dot. 2) Similarly, unless you're in a quiet room, you can barely hear the response--not just because of its very low max volume, but because the sound quality is terrible--something like a typical kids talking doll toy. 3) This goes for all echo's, getting a Bluetooth speaker connected is painful to say the least. The device name usually doesn't show up so you're guessing at which is the correct device when only the device code is displayed. It also does not reconnect to the Bluetooth speaker automatically and cannot reconnect to a previously connected device through voice command. The idea of telling Alexa to ""play music on my Bluetooth speaker"" is just a fantasy. You'll have to go through the Alexa app and reconnect manually each time--by which time, you might as well just stream your music from your phone to your Bluetooth speaker instead. 4) When connected to Bluetooth, the volume changes back to level 5 constantly, so you have to keep asking Alexa to go back to volume 10. At level 5, it's barely audible so you might not realize it's connected unless the room is dead silent. Overall, the Flex is virtually useless because it simply doesn't understand me or I can't understand it most of the time (and I mean really MOST of the time) whereas I have no issues with my Dot devices which can understand me in a crowded room even with music playing. In my opinion, the Echo Flex might only be a reasonable solution for a small bathroom although I'd warn you about it still getting your questions wrong if you have the faucet or shower running. Otherwise, I highly recommend getting the Dot instead.",Nearly useless unless you're in a very quiet room
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2019,Rabid Ron,"So far this has been one of the best echo products Amazon has produced.  We use in the kitchen to assist in cooking.  Controlling lights etc is a  breeze along with setting the ""Guard"" feature when leaving home. Having the add on devices is a big plus to expand it's capabilities. What should be added is a way to utilize both the motion detector and nightlight at the same time by plugging the nightlight into the motion detector. It is going to be an interesting expansion capability if more add on devices are developed. I am already considering a few more to cover the basement, among other places.  As purely a voive control device this ranks as number One in my book.",Great way to expand voice control to small spaces.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2020,🥇Customer,"I purchased an Echo Flex plus the companion smart night light to replace what I had in a small bathroom and free up a socket.  In the bathroom I had an Echo Dot 3rd gen in an outlet hanger, plus I had a nightlight plugged into an Amazon Smart Plug.  So, both electrical sockets were used and there was a lot of hardware hanging off the electrical outlet (see pics).  The Flex is perfect for my needs.  It’s much more compact even with the night light (smaller is good, Amazon!) and the second outlet is wide open. Comparison: —Sound:  The Flex sound (both quality and volume) is not as good as the Dot’s.  To me, it’s good enough in order to have a more compact dual device.  Plus my Dot’s sound quality was partially muffled by the prongs on the outlet hanger.  I have Dots in most of the bedrooms and would not replace them with a Flex.  But for the bathroom, the Flex is good. —Light:  The Flex night light is not as bright as the one I had.  Both lights allegedly have 6 LED chips, but my old one is definitely way brighter.  However, the Flex light can be dimmed and turned a few different colors.  There are people around here who like asking Alexa to change the color. —Heat:  The Flex definitely runs very warm just sitting in the socket. —Alexa:  Her pickup of your commands is slow.  You need to be facing her for her to pick you up.  If you speak to her from the side, you may have to raise your voice for her to recognize that you’re speaking to her.  I suppose the acoustics of the room play a role, but that is not an issue when using other Echo devices.  In addition, there seems to be a lag in responsiveness.  For instance, if a song is playing and you ask her to stop playing, sometimes the song continues playing a few seconds as it fades out, or it plays in the background as Alexa is answering a question.  I don’t notice that phenomenon on my other Echo devices. —Looks:  It’s not the most attractive looking device.  Though it looks a lot better than what was there. —Set-up:  Fairly easy.  In my case, I used a Fire tablet for the set-up.  Since my router has MAC filtering enabled, once the Flex showed in the Alexa app list of devices, I got the Flex MAC address and went to my PC to add it to my router settings.  Then, on my Fire tablet, I had to switch to the temporary Amazon WiFi for the set-up.  Good to go from there.",This is a great device for where being compact counts

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Oct 2020,Jamie Lee Sanders,"I got one of these to put in the outlet outside of my bathroom to activate the lights on the way in because the switch is in a very impractical place. You have to go all the way inside the bathroom and shut the door to reach it which ranges from mildly annoying in the daytime to very frustrating at night when it's too dark for that sort of nonsense. Alexa Flex could not hear us at least half the time. We'd walk into a dark bathroom, step back and tell her again, walk into dark bathroom again, then go back and lean down to yell at her to turn on the bathroom lights and she still didn't do it every time. Luckily, I already have two dots or I wouldn't have had any faith at all in alexa. I put a dot in the living room about ten feet further away from the bathroom than the flex is, and when we tell the flex to turn on the bathroom lights, the dot actually picks it up and gets the light instead. I finally moved the flex to the kitchen where I had the dot and it seems to do a little better since it's now closer to our face instead of by the floor. I bought her to get the bathroom lights but now she gets the kitchen and entrance lights. I would only recommend the flex if it's truly going to be in a small space where it will be sure to hear you. I have one by my bed as well and she doesn't respond as well as I'd like there either. I would suggest getting the dot if you're able.",Only for small spaces
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Oct 2020,avgcustomer,"This is a convenient device to have, it brings Alexa to more areas in the home. I got it with the nightlight attachment which is great because I have it set to turn on and off automatically at my bathroom sink. My issue is not with the tinny sound through the speakers because I don't really use it to listen to audio, the problem is that the lower quality seems to have carried over to the microphones as well. I frequently have issues with the Echo Flex understanding the commands I'm giving it, and I'm constantly having to tell Alexa to cancel or outright ripping it out of the socket while she's going through the incorrect script. It's especially worse at night when I'm repeatedly having to re-issue commands to turn on my bathroom lights at a dimmed setting and she's initializing burglary detection or looking for a nearby restaurant. I've resorted to carrying my smartphone with me more often so I can just issue commands through the Alexa app. This is in contrast to the Echo Dot which I rarely have issues giving commands to, it has twice as many speakers (4 vs 2 in the Flex) and it sounds better so I'm assuming the microphones must be better to. Do I recommend that you purchase an Echo Flex? Possibly if you need it to use Alexa infrequently in an odd location, but for something as frequent as controlling your bathroom lighting you might want to opt for something with better voice recognition.",Too much compromise on quality
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Apr 2020,Eric McCann,"I picked two of these up to mess around with, one with the night light attachment. These were pre-set by Amazon before delivery, so I can't speak to how easy or hard they are to set up - from experience this tends to be quick and painless, though. Brief review on the night light attachment - it's slick and integrates well, and seems to be secure. You can tweak the light color, and yes, it detects low light just fine. It does what it is supposed to and looks like part of the Echo Flex. I see reviews with people complaining about the sound from the speaker. If you're expecting awesome sound from a tiny little speaker, be realistic - this is fine for telling you what the weather's like if you ask, or if you see a notification or other basic information. Playing music... maybe if you want to recreate the early days of radio. It does not do most music justice on its own - but I'm not knocking it for that because (a) that's not what I bought it for and (b) it would be ridiculous to expect it to. If you want to put this somewhere and play music, it *can* pair with a bluetooth speaker (and does come with a speaker out.) Use those, or look into something like an Echo Dot. I am being realistic with the sound quality rating at three stars, though. Fine for notifications or voice. Awful for music. This does take up one of your plugs. It's low enough the other is free (assuming, obviously, you put it on the lower outlet.) This is one thing I'd like to see adjusted - having an outlet passthrough would be nice, though not strictly needed. Perhaps even turning it into a smartplug as well. I'd like to see more accessories for this. The only ones I can see are the night light and motion sensor. Something as simple as a clock to hang off the bottom. A speaker, for those wanting something slightly better without a second device (or someplace to mount a dot.) Maybe a small camera for helping do things like baby monitoring. I think there's potential in this device that's not being used.","Works for what it's designed for, could use a tweak or two."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2019,TnT,"Only been using it for a few days but so far it's been working great for my application, I'm extremely happy with the product!  In my house I have a central audio system that has built in speakers in the ceiling of all the rooms which is hardwired to a single Echo Dot. So adding these Flex units to rooms that are out of earshot of the main Echo Dot, for example the garage or upstairs bathroom, it's something like adding additional microphones.  I can speak a command and everything plays normal out of the central system as if I'm speaking to the main Echo Dot. People that are complaining about the internal speaker sounding lousy, it says in the description over and over these aren't intended alone for music. After set up the internal speaker is not really used. It will give acknowledgement tones from it but everything else plays to the ""preferred speaker""  which you designate within the Alexa app. Adding additional Echo dots with probably accomplish the same thing but this does it in a super compact clean simple plug in module with no loose wires. I haven't tried the motion or the night light optional devices for this but I plan to pick them up","It's like adding ""extra ears"" to Alexa 👍"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2020,thornhillatthemovies.com,"I'm not thrilled with the Echo Flex. I have an Echo and love that, I have a bunch of plugs connected to it, and control the lights throughout our small apartment with it. I have had some difficulty getting other smart plugs to communicate and connect with Alexa and our Echo. So, when I saw the Echo Flex on Amazon, I initially thought it was a smart plug with Alexa built in. It isn't. And that's my mistake. Our apartment is very small, so I plugged the Echo Flex into the wall (it really looks like a multi-plug you plug into a regular outlet) and connected it. A few days before, I got a wall clock made by Citizen and connected it to the Echo. With the Echo Flex plugged in, and connected, all of the voice recognition was going through the Flex and the Smart Clock no longer did the countdown with a timer, as it did with the Echo. I unplugged the Echo Flex. The smart clock worked fine. I think if you have a bigger house and more rooms to cover, using the Echo Flex is a good way to get more coverage. But in our small apartment, it isn't necessary. I can control the Echo in our living room, from our bedroom. When the Echo Flex was plugged in, it seemed to recognize my voice well. But the speaker on it reminds me of playing something through a small speaker on a cheap cassette player. Remember those? It is hollow and tinny and would not be a good vehicle for music or other audio.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2020,Lenny,"I have this in my garage, where it's more useful than I expected. I originally got this so that I can turn on the garage light when I come in from the side door (the light switch is at the other side of the garage, near the kitchen entrance). I set up an Alexa routine so that it will turn on the light for a minute, giving me enough time to walk to the other end of the garage to enter the house without tripping over things, before turning itself off. So far that has worked very well. The USB port also turned out to be more useful than I expected. With so many things that recharge from USB these days, such as my bicycle headlights, it's nice to have another charger in the garage. I measured the charging current at 1.6A, I'm not sure if that's the maximum current, or just how much my light draws when recharging, but it is more than I expected. Finally, having it as a plug in form factor saves me the hassle and expense of getting a separate mount for it. Downsides, the speaker is not as good. It specifically says it's not suitable for playing music, but within a few days of using this, Alexa said that I haven't asked it to play music and if I would like to do so. I guess someone didn't program it properly. Finally, the microphone isn't as good as the other Echo devices I have. Even the 1st generation Echo Dot does a better job of recognizing my commands when there's extra noise in the background.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Apr 2020,Discriminating Buyer,"I've been putting in echo dots and shows around the house, really to be used as an intercom/announcement system and for control of some smart items.

It's also proved handy for them to control lights, view some cctv cams, fans, the air conditioning, etc. I bought the flex used based on the poor reviews that it got, I figured that if they didn't work at least I wasn't out the cost of a new one.  I wanted these for areas where I don't have dots.  Setup was probably easier than any other Echo device I've had.  It apparently uses bluetooth so that has to be turned on on the phone.  I did a test speaking close into the dot and it transmitted to all the other echo devices.  The sound from it isn't that bad, I was expecting some really tinny sound but Alexa sounds much the same as on the other devices.  I haven't tried music on it to see how that sounds but I did make Alexa sing the 20 second wash your hands song and it sounded okay. UPDATE I tried music on it and while it wasn't terrific it wasn't all that bad.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2020,Clayton M.,"I bought this for my mother, who has been looking for a nightlight for her bathroom. Paired with the ThirdReality smart night-light accessory , this lovely little Alexa device gives you peace of mind in areas you can't easily place one of the larger Echo devices with a surprisingly bright adjustable LED lamp. The pictures I've attached show the night-light using the sensor mode - it's off when the lights are on, and turns on when the room gets dark. You can see also that it shows as a controllable light in the Alexa app. There are several colors to pick from and a slider to set brightness; I have it set to 2% here because the bathroom is connected to a bedroom - the light can definitely be much brighter if you want that. === PROS === - Small form factor doesn't take up space. - Plug on the bottom lets you mix and match accessories (night-light, motion sensor, etc). - If you don't want an accessory, use the bottom plug to charge your phone! - Works great with mid-wall plugs like those you find in bathrooms (near the counter) or kitchens (by the sink). - Use a 3.5mm cable or Bluetooth to connect a dedicated speaker for playing music. === CONS === - Audio quality is ok, not meant for music playback using the built-in speaker.

It's not a Bose speaker quality, but, I have to say, it's actually better than my phone sometimes is. So, I can chat on the phone when I'm getting ready, too.  Nice. I really like that it's so small and plugs right into the wall outlet.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jul 2020,"A fan from Meriden, CT","Its has been a while since I wrote an Amazon Review, but I felt I had to for this. It is a WONDERFUL Product ! I already had a 1st Gen Echo Dot that is setup in my living room. And after some early trepidations, everyone in my family uses it. I got a smart light to go along with it & that is great as well. So when I recently got a couple more smart lights to set up in my Office, I needed another echo to control that. And that's why I got the Flex. My office is in the basement so using the Echo in the living room to control the lights isn't ideal. All I needed was something small, so the flex is a perfect fit. I just tucked it into a corner by my stereo receiver and plugged it into a short extension cord. Bingo ! Now I have full Alexa capability downstairs. I use it to turn on the lights (I added a smart plug to my desk lamp as well) when I come downstairs to start my day & it can hear me easily from across the room. And while the sound of the on-board speaker isn't great, I plugged it into the Audio Input on my stereo & now it sounds FABULOUS. What else do I need, ? And at only HALF the price of a Dot (and a quarter of the price of a full size Echo) why WOULDN'T you get one ? Thanks for making this, Amazon - it's perfect ! UPDATE: Make that slightly LESS than perfect. Please be aware this may not be the Echo's fault ... BUT I have had to redo the WiFi connection on it TWICE since setting it up. I thought rthat maybe it was an issue witth My Amazon Connectivity in General, but I verified that the Dot in the Living room & my App both work fine - its just the Flex. And its not because the Flex is farther away, its MUCH Closer, The Router is literally NEXT TO where the Flex is installed. And there are no sources of interference nearby that I am aware of. The only thing I can think of is my son does have a WiFi extender set up in the living room, and MAYBE the Flex is confused about which network to use. I know that both times I( redid the WiFi I had to use the SECOND lusting for my house since the first said the Password was incorrect. Anyway, other than that, I've had no issues.

I've read the reviews others have posted, both positive and negative, and I haven't experienced the negative.  It is true that the tiny speaker is not music quality, but when you come right down to it, neither are any of Echo devices except for the largest devices.  It's a speaker about the size of my smallest fingernail, who in their right mind considers that capable of music quality? OTOH, I've found the speaker to be loud, and clear; and the microphone quite capable of picking up my voice anywhere in my kitchen (roughly 12x25 feet opening onto a semi-open great room.  Lots of space for sound to dissipate).  I suspect placement is key with this tiny device, but I've found that to be true with any of the Echo devices for premium performance. Set up was easy, and it went into setup mode as soon as it was plugged in.  In my mind, except for music, this functions as well as the Echo Dot. UPDATE:  I moved my office to a different location just off the family room.  My office is in a room with 2 open doors and is separated by about 40 feet from the first open door.  this Echo flex picks up my voice fine with the doors open.  Now it's true, I have one of those voices that 'carries', but even so, that is still surprisingly good for a tiny echo device with just 2 microphones not aimed directly at my new office.",I save 5 stars for a life changing experience.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,Amanda N.,"I have the echo flex paired with a Sengled Pulse speaker light bulb in a ceiling can light in my bathroom. As soon as I flip on the light switch where the bulb is, the echo flex automatically connects to the speaker bulb. When playing music to the speaker bulb, then turning off the light switch, the echo flex automatically kicks back over to the flex built in speaker and the music is not interrupted, and vice versa. The built in speaker is great to get weather updates, etc at the start of the day while getting ready in the bathroom.",Perfect for a bathroom
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2019,jon,"It would be a clever addition to the Echo line if the sound wasn't so terrible.  I didn't expect great sound, but I did expect to be able to hear it.  The volume is so inadequate, that I am returning it. The Echo Dot is a far better choice if small size is your driving force. Sure, you can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker, but that kind of negates the small footprint. If you just need something to control lights or other devices, I suppose it's ok.  But if you want to listen to news or the like, it's inadequate.",Low volume hurts this Echo
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,Kit Clayton,"The sound quality is far inferior to an Echo or even a Dot.  But, guess what?  This is a Flex, not an Echo or Dot!  One of these is plugged in right next to my home’s intercom, with the stereo jack right into the intercom system.  The horrible Flex speaker is moot, since it feeds directly into the home intercom and associated speakers - which all are far superior to even the echo or Bluetooth speakers.  So, even rooms ,utility/workroom, garage, porches, and decks without an Echo devices now have Alexa.  Check it out - since Flex is right next to intercom, can trigger Alexa through the intercom!  Brilliant, right?  True - not as convenient as just talking (and why there are still 4 echo devices in strategic places throughout the home) but in outdoor and other places (such as garage and work room) where it is not a good idea for an echo, a good way to smart home up everything.  And here I thought intercoms were worthless in this day and age.... I got a second Flex just to - well, flex.  Can plug it in anywhere (screened in outdoor gazebo in summer) on the property for instant voice activated Alexa for when I am too lazy to get up and push an intercom button.... Soooo, this is a great device if used for intended - and advertised clearly on product page - purpose.  You want barely passable music, then get an Echo for five bucks more when they are on sale.  you want a easy p,ug in flexible unit (er, hence the device’s name) for voice activating Alexa - or, in my case to Alexify (yes, “Alexify” is a verb in my world) my whole home intercom system, then this device is perfect.  5 stars - clearly, as I bought another one already, is recommended if used for how it was designed.",Outstanding Alexa extension!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Aug 2020,Somebody,"I received two Echo Flex devices today. I'd read all the one-star reviews before ordering, so I was prepared to send them back if they were as awful as some folks say. But when I unboxed them and plugged them into outlets, I was glad to see how quickly and automatically they connected to my wifi. Ready to use in about a minute or less. Yes, those who say the audio is tinny are right. Not at all as good as my Echo Dots, Echo Show, or the original Echo tower. But the two locations where I wanted to put the new devices aren't areas where the quality of the audio matters: living room and bathroom. So far, Alexa has had no problem hearing me, nor have I had trouble hearing her. I even tested the living room one to see if Alexa could hear me when the TV is on. I raised my voice only slightly above conversation-level. No problem. I also heard her despite the TV's audio. I noticed that the Flex in my bathroom sounded louder than the one in the living room, so I put the living room one in the bathroom to compare them. No difference. My guess is that the Flex sounds louder in the bathroom because it's a tiny room, while the living room is considerably larger. Also, I'm closer to the Flex in the bathroom (about 15"" when standing at my washbowl) than in my living room where I am across the room from it (about 9'). The one glitch my living room flex has is the volume control. The bathroom's volume is set at 100%, but the living room's volume is stuck at 70%. Now, having said that, it sounds just like the 100% volume on the other Flex. I tried repeatedly to boost the volume to 100%, following the directions in the app to do that, but no luck. I have emailed support to see what I can do to get it to 100%, but truthfully it doesn't matter. As just about everyone says, the Flex is not suitable for listening to music -- but I decided to give it a try. I told Alexa to play Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"". It was far from good, but it was also nowhere near horrible. All in all, I'm pleased that I decided to replace my clunky Dots which were hanging from the outlet in holders (to keep from having to deal with cords). The Echo Flex is *much* better aesthetically, and it meets my needs.","Didn't expect much, but happy with the purchase"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,John Silvia,"I've installed this in my garage - adds intercom capabilities and kills my old clock-radio. Overall the Echo Flexs' performance has been good.  It has limitations - but those are kind of expected given the packaging and price. Mounted at shoulder level over my toolbench, I'm rather happy with its performance so far.  The microphones aren't as sensitive as the ones in my Echo Dot's, so I have to speak a bit louder. The on-board sound output is weak - very low-fidelity. Definitely meant for low-traffic areas, sounds like a walkie-talkie due to it's tiny speaker. The 3.5mm output drives external speakers without trouble. I'm finding that volume 10 is the line-out volume - leaving you with 100% manual volume control on the external speakers.  I'll be trying it with my old Microsoft subwoofer setup later for kicks. Overall this is a great little Alexa, but I would not purchase this in lieu of it's bigger brothers in most cases. It's sound quality and microphone aren't as good as the larger units, but this can make it perfect in some remote low-traffic areas, or maybe hallways or large closets. Add the motion detector for full coverage. The casing is hard-plastic - it has a more appliance-rugged finish - looking very much more like an ultrasonic vermin repeller than an Internet thing.","Great ""Low-Fi"" Alexa"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2019,amazon_shopper,"I like that it's a simple plug-in that sits there; no adapter, no cable, no hassle.  It does everything I need it to and is functionally no different from any other Echo device when it comes to voice commands and responsiveness.  The sound is a bit lacking, but I never considered it my primary source of audio entertainment either.  It's good enough for listening to the weather, news, or anything else not requiring premium sound.  But honestly, the sound quality is no worse than the stock radio in a 1980s K-car, if you know what that is.  The Flex performs well as an additional listening sensor for glass breakage while in Alexa Guard mode and having more sensors also expands your voice control options throughout the house.",Great way to expand the Alexa presence in your house.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Oct 2020,R Mountain,"We are an Alexa household and she’s slowly taking over the place.  We bought the echo Flex like many of you I suspect to go in the bathroom. Alexa works great like it does in all of our other Amazon products and it’s nice to be able to listen to music, get the weather, and even to use it to drop in and tell a kid to get out of there we are going to be late. The only negative is the sound quality.  Yes I wasn’t expecting much for the price but I wanted it to be just a bit better.  Hopefully a future version will add a slightly better speaker. Overall it’s still a good product that we use daily.",Almost perfect.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2019,Wills944,"To start, I have a few technical grumbles about the platform itself but I do enjoy my ""Dots"" They [1 in the Living Room, 1 in each of the 2 bedrooms] have operated reasonably well, the only technical hickup with them is the occassional device dis-association from a room group..i.e. walk into a room say ""turn on the lights"" and it responds 'Can't find a device called Lights"". So far its about once a week on one of the Dots.. The Flex's haven't had this happen and they've been unplugged and reinserted a few times.. The Flex's appear to only have 2 mic pinholes. I have had a little bit of a time finding placement for the Flex that allows it to pick up audio better. Our 2BR Apartment has laminate floors with the kitchen on one end, the combined entry/dining room acting as a echo chamber, and the carpeted living room and it's Dot at the other end. The kitchen Flex would pick up from the living room and visa versa.. Others have noted the sound ""quality"" as bad, but in all fairness it is about the same as the speaker function on a cellphone. It's not bassy like the dots, but I have played music while in the bathroom and it is not a bad/horrible experience. It is great to listen to the news while shaving/cleaning up or just waiting.. Once the shower is on though, external speakers would be required. On the positive notes.. The look of the device is demure enough that it blends in without being too ""in your face"". Hopefully skins will become available. These Flex's, Dots and Shows are great, but I hope more useful devices are in the mix. Maybe a Kitchen Device that includes a barcode scanner for maintaining a real shopping/pantry inventory, with a extension that could perhaps go over the garbage bin to scan out items. It's nice to to be able to voice add items to a list, or have a fridge that questimates usage, but a easy in/out scanner would be fantastic.. I'd also like to see the Prime Video/Music apps accept Alexa commands. I get the reasons behind branded devices, but it would be just as easy to add subroutines into the apps that intergrate commands from the platform. It would be great to have a the ability to simply have apps that can be put on devices for reading news flashes, then a simple ""Alexa show me the news on the living room TV"" through my android media box... Apps are easier to get to market on devices that are already global.. So hopefully Amazon expands the line in some real useful ways..",Good step in the right direction
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2020,Branson Mom living in Chillicothe,"There are SO MANY things this little device can do.  Initially I bought them exclusively as intercoms, but because I didn't understand the correct way to use them, I rated them a 3*, now that Amazon Flex expert contacted me and spent nearly an hours educating me to the device WOW, and I mean WOW...!!!! Okay it is like an extension to your Alexa or Echo Dot, but it does things I'm not even sure they can do.  These are amazing, and now instead of 2 I'm probably going to have 2 more for downstairs. Be sure to educate yourself on the differences, they can be subtle so if like me you might miss some big pieces of info. One, you can name each differently, so when you 'drop in' (not any other way as I was doing) you can have a conversation with the persons that are at that Flex.  So yes, an intercom.  You can broadcast announcements to every device, or 'drop in' to just one. I now have so many Ring and Amazon devices my house probably should be seen from outerspace, lol.  And I am far from finished.  I want every bulb to be a smart bulb (you gotta try those, omg), I want every room to have a Flex (okay I have 16 rooms, maybe not every room), I already have a plethora of Ring cameras inside and out, but also am trying a different brand that works with Alexa too, but tons less expensive (and Ring truly is not what it use to be). Point being, its good to have security on your house, convenience in your house, and it all tied to one system - Alexa.","Buy Alexa only products, and be sure they can interact interchangably, mine ROCK"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2019,Nobody777,"What can I say?  It's an Echo device.  It does the job perfectly and I love it...  This is probably one of the easiest Echo devices to setup.  I also like its small form factor and I am currently using it in my garage to control lights and the garage door, and to drop in to chat with my wife in the house on occasion.  The device works flawlessly and I am happy with my purchase and certainly can recommend this device. My only real complaint is with the sound level...  There are no volume controls, just a default setting, which is not very loud.  It's functional and if you're standing close enough in proximity, you can hear it and it gets the job done, but I do wish it was louder.  I never expected this device to be great for anything other than basic Echo functions (which is why I bought it - to control smart devices in the garage), so I wasn't expecting great audio quality...  That having been said, a little bit more volume would have been appreciated.  For that, and that only, I have to knock off a star and give it only one star for volume control because there isn't any.  Sound quality is okay.  I can hear Alexa speaking clearly and she responds perfectly, so the two microphones work well, but since the volume is so quiet, I have to knock off a couple of stars for sound quality.  For the device to be adequately functional, it does need audio... even if it's crappy audio, it should be louder than it is. The one saving grace here is that you can plug in an external speaker (and I presume Bluetooth connections work also) so it's not a total loss here.  There are alternative options that can make the slight negatives here seem unimportant.  I have a decent Bluetooth speaker I use for music when out in the garage, so I'll just pair it up and problem solved. All-in-all, great little device that fits the budget, sets up easily, has a small form factor, and does the job.  Hard to complain about that.","Performs well, setup is easy, good price.

A small little ""Alexa"" to put in the kitchen, so that my Wife doesn't have to yell at the ""Alexa"" in the living room. I was super excited when this went on sale for $15, so I ordered one. I plugged it in, configured it and figured I was good to go. On first use, I could BARELY hear it. I though... ohhh, the volume must be all the way down. Well.... looking at the app, it was at 70%. So I turned it up to 100%. It really didn't get that much better. I mean, it's a small device, so I wasn't expecting booming sound... but the room has to be completely silent in order to hear it. My phone has a tiny little speaker and it's way louder and clearer than the Flex. In a last ditch effort, we hooked up a bluetooth speaker to it and had to power it off the USB. Having that wire and the speaker sitting next to it completely defeats the purpose of it's small form factor. I might as well just have gotten a dot.",The sound quality is horrible.

Pros - very much convenient to pull and put into any outlets. Look and shape is perfect. Cons - you will be lucky if you get it work, the first 3 months it was ok without any connection issues, at the same time the sound quality is the first Marconi Radio, so good enough for commands - Alexa turn on a light.

Finally they refunded me $20.00 but they are not in a mood to understand the root cause, I have been using Echo since the first version came in 2015 and that works perfectly. I have 6 different models of Echo including the auto. I also have request them that if they can downgrade the software so it works, but they were not willing to listen.  I'm trying to get a mesh wifi, may be that can improve the signal as they were asking me to reset all the time.

It is definitely the easiest-to-install Echo device in my network, which includes the original Echo, several Dots, and a host of Alexa-enabled devices. The only difficulty I have encountered is that the Flex's microphone seems more sensitive than the other Echo devices', and sometimes it responds to commands intended for a device in another space. Of course, this is not a serious problem, just an observation. I am very, very happy with the Flex, and I plan to obtain another. Also, I have now added the smart night light device (which plugs directly into the Flex), and it was just as easy to install and to use. Very Happy!",Easiest Echo Ever
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jan 2020,Kitchen Mouse,"We have too many Echo devices, by some folks’ standards — a Spot in two bedrooms, a Dot in another bedroom and a Dot in the garage, and a Show.  The show was originally in the kitchen. It was used to check calendars, add to shopping and to-dos etc.  I found the allrecipes skill to be useless, which is why I bought it initially. So I replaced it with the Flex. I was immediately dismayed by how frequently it did not respond and misunderstood me. None of the others have this difficulty. So I put the Show back in the kitchen and moved the Flex to my living room and plugged in a long Apple-compatible charging cable. That turned out to be a great idea because I can charge and use my iPad in the morning as I plow through email and read the e-edition of my local paper. I do use it to turn on my TV, but it doesn’t hear clearly enough to do much else, especially with background noise. I had to cover the mic on my hallway-located Ecobee because when ever I talk to any of my Echo devices, the Ecobee would butt in.

I just got this tiny echo device yesterday, and am very impressed! i was concerned about connectivity because of my previous nest experience. but so far after unplugging it several times and left off over night, it reconnects all on it's own. good start! i was able to connect it to my amazon music, pandora, and i heart music accounts with very little effort. I haven't tried to connect a bluetooth speaker yet, but it seems to not be that difficult. the device is very responsive, alexa surprised me with some lil bits of humor and side comments/conversations and politeness (spooky).  she walked me thru the music app connections, and made helpful suggestions. the google nest never did any of this. the size of this device is really small (2 decks of cards?). so keep in mind, if you plan on using it for listening to really good music, get a really good speaker to go with it. or, connect it to your stereo system. on it's own, the sound is very much like a transistor radio, and probably will not be good in a large room. which is fine if you just need basics. i've been able to listen to music fine without an additional speaker while taking a shower, and Alexa can hear me fine as well. since i can't give half stars (amazon, please fix that), i gave it 4 stars (4.5 stars) because i'd like a male voice called Alex. Also, it seems it will not connect with my google smart tv. i'll assume that's because google is competition. over all, i like it a lot. so much, i bought another the next day - 1 for the bathroom, and one for the bedroom. well worth the $9.99. buy a bunch and give them away as stocking stuffers at that price. enjoy!","Alexa, help me write this review!"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2020,Gary Fisher,"I now own two of these incredibly useful Echo / Alexa Flex devices, and will likely add more in the future. Requiring no cable, no adapter, and no hanger, the Flex simply plugs into any available AC outlet and begins to work. Setup, if you don't receive it pre-paired to your Amazon account, is accomplished just as with other Echo devices. The Privacy and Action buttons on the front panel function like those on other Echoes, and the Flex will respond to all the usual Echo commands. While the speaker is far from Hi-Fi quality, it's perfectly adequate for the spoken word and can give you the news, weather, time, notifications, etc. perfectly well, and at least AM Radio-quality music. The Flex can control lights, appliances, etc. by voice command exactly like other Echoes. On the bottom of the Flex you'll find a full-size USB socket. While handy for charging a phone, etc., this connector is particularly intended to be used with Echo Flex accessories, of which there are currently two, a ""night light"" and a motion sensor. I own neither of these at this time, but Amazon's information indicates the motion sensor could be used, for example, to initiate a ""welcome"" sequence when someone walks by, or to turn on lights or perform other functions when it senses motion, without impacting other Alexa functions. The ""night light"" can be remotely set to an of a variety of colors, perhaps for aesthetics or possibly as a color-coded warning or alert scheme. Once again, the accessories are not required, and so far I haven't justified a need for them. But I'm working on it. 😉 I own a fairly large number of Echo devices, most of which could be used interchangeably. My Flex devices are the only ones in the house which are uniquely suited to their task and could not be replaced by one of the others with no additional work (such as mounting) being required.","The Handy ""Utility"" Echo"

No volume control, you need to use your phone in the Alexa app to change volume or speak a volume number from 1 to 10.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 May 2020,Average Joe,"I purchased this product to extend Alexa function with my existing echo dots. I like the dots, but I was attracted to this one because of size, price, and the ability to attach another supporting device such as the motion sensor (which I also purchased). The sound volume is horrible. I was rather impressed with the dot's volume level and sound quality for their size and figured since the echo flex is roughly 60% the size of the dots, then I would have to accept around a 40% loss of volume and sound quality. WRONG!! Try about a 90% loss. Really, the volume from the flex is about the same quality and level as your cell phone is with the volume (of your cell phone) set to 10-15%. Seriously, the echo dot two rooms away can be heard over this echo flex in the same room. Next, the echo flex often loses wifi connection. For example, the two echo dots I have lost wifi connection about 6-8 times last year (collectively). More the half of these instances were for legitimate reasons (power outages mostly). The echo flex has lost internet connection more than twice this week alone (or so sayeth my phone notifications). The echo flex is only about 25 feet away from the router. The echo dots are 18 and 35 feet away from the same router. Why the flex loses wifi connection so often is unknown to me. The motion sensor add on does work. It's just that it stops working now and then. I actually sent the first one back after this happened and got a second one when it did the same thing. It took me a little while to figure out that it would begin working normally after the echo flex was unplugged, then plugged back in. In hindsight, I feel like the motion sensor I returned was not defective and that it is, in fact, the echo flex that is the heart of the issue. The echo flex motion sensor add on combo isn't reliable enough for security purposes. I feel like the echo flex was rushed into production before it could be fully developed. It doesn't have the refinement that the other echo products I have used does. Could a firmware push solve some of these issues? Probably, but I feel like the low volume is inherent to the design and cannot be fixed with software.","Low volume, product needs further development"

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Oct 2020,Anita,The device is really convenient. I have it in the bathroom with a nightlight attachment. The sound quality can be compared to a typical smartphone speaker. I mostly use it to listen to NPR (talk radio) or ask about the weather forecast while I'm getting ready and for that the quality is totally fine. It wouldn't be great for listening to music loud enough to hear over running water,Perfect for NPR while I get ready in the morning
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2020,MarkO,"Two issues with quality. I bought it to mount on an outlet above our kitchen counter (wide open counter area)  between two of my echo devices:  one Dot 20' away - through a open arch and around a corner and an echo plus 18' away in the opposite direction in an open room but behind a wing wall. I can be facing the Flex from 5' away and either of the other echos in the other rooms will respond before the Flex. I bought the flex because sometimes the other echos can't be heard well depending on sound level set for music, and the make mistakes if not elevating my voice when adding items to list, asking for conversions etc. I basically have to really be close to it to have it work or the music playing on the other two will cut out and respond. It's why I freaking bought it. I have to be 6' away facing it directly. Second the speaker sounds just awful. I mean, I don't play any music on it at all, just the response sounds like a toy. I realize it's cheap, but I'm disappointed. I wish I would have bought a Dot 3 or used Dot 2 with a outlet mounted holder like I did for my garage workbench. Try to save a few bucks and you get what you pay for. Lastly, I thought the add on motion sensor was a cool idea until I read how horrible the reviews are for it after I bought the Flex.  At least I saved my money by not buying it as a package. Edit: Apparently my echo flex read my review and decided to be the alpha female on my first floor. Now she will be the responding device if I talk in a normal tone anywhere now on my first floor - even 4' from my other devices when the flex is almost 20' away. Except when I am 5' away from the flex and speaking directly to it, then it ignores me. It has managed to make my wife and I hate it and my two adult children when visiting have told me to get rid of it. Ordered a wall mount for an echo dot 3 that is underutilized on another floor of the house to replace the flex. I'll buy another dot next year on prime day or black Friday. The flex will - I don't know, hide it in the mechanical room in case I want to know what time it is when I change my furnace filter a few times a year.",disappointing so far.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2019,Casey,"So, I am an Echo fanatic.  I have all of them except for the Echo Look (???this product is just weird). That said, I am deeply saddened by this product.  I could only bring myself to provide it a 5 start feedback on Volume Control.  It has the same volume control as any other Echo. Sadly, this is where the usefulness stopped. It is huge, it doesn't really save space over any other product, it just happens to hang on your wall.  What it does do, is look ugly and sound awful.  The speaker on the DOT is infinitely superior to this one.  Even at MAX volume, you can barely hear the responses from this echo even at a couple feet away. I think they halfheartedly  tried to make it NOT useless by adding a USB port to the bottom.  Yes it has an auxiliary port but then why not just get the Amazon Input? (which is about as useful as Amazon Auto (which you don't want to get me started reviewing)). Don't buy it unless you positively have no where to set an Echo Dot.  The DOT is superior in every single way.",Yuck...Just Yuck.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2020,Mike,"So initially I thought this would be a great addition to my garage as a smart speaker. I thought to my self it’s small, doesn’t need a cable or a desk to be displayed on (mounts directly to the  wall vía it’s plug), and it should fill the garage with some smart tech easily, only that wasn’t exactly the case. My main gripe is with the sound quality, it’s awful and basically ruined the product (Especially since it’s all about voice activated features and doesn’t have a screen). Alexa sounds hollow/awful and music sounds even worse. There is limited to no bass and the mids/highs aren’t anywhere (good) to be found either. That being said, there also aren’t enough redeeming qualities to make this a well rated product. Yes I did pay a decent price on it (Amazon had a 50% off sale around the end of 2019) and it has a built in USB port on the bottom. So then you’d think that’s cool it was cheap and there is a port (basically giving you an extra charge outlet for a phone or something) and yeah I’d agree with that thought process, then I noticed the two official add ons for the USB port (a night light and a motion sensor) are half the MSRP of the unit and honestly should have just been built in (with a better speaker). Then, and only then, would this have been a 4 star or better product but instead it’s barely a 3, more like a 2 star product if you paid full price. I’d say wait for gen two or another steep discount before you buy this thing.",Half baked “smart” speaker...

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2019,Ashley N Ward,"I was SUPER excited to have an echo I could easily plug into my bathroom wall. I even ordered this a month in advance. However, when they say ""mini smart speaker"" they really mean MINI smart speaker. Even when you do the ""level 11"" secret volume, these are still so quiet. I have a regular echo dot (3rd gen) and the volume is perfect. However, I have a vent fan in my bathroom that turns on when I turn on the light and I can barely hear it over the fan. I'd expect that if the volume was at a 5 or 6, but a 10 or 11? The sound quality is even a bit fuzzy despite being so quiet. I don't expect it to be as loud as a normal echo, but it's big enough they could have added better speakers. Very disappointing.",Way too quiet

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Feb 2020,capo,"I have Echo devices of one kind or another in every room and have had others that I’ve decided to let go (original Echo and Echo Auto). They’ve all performed their smarthome duties acceptably well. My biggest complaint across the board is sound quality. Alexa always sounds like she’s talking to you from underneath a pile of pillows. Bass? Sure, on the Echo Show, at least. Treble? Nada. Sure, you can use the app’s “equalizer”... but it’d take an oscilloscope to detect the minuscule difference that makes in the sound quality. I’d given up on getting any more devices... until I saw a review of the Flex on Paul Hibbert’s YouTube channel... he liked it, but said (I think) that it sounded ‘trebly’. Trebly?! That’s a magic word to my ears. I ordered one up and found that it indeed sounds ‘trebly’ (call it tinny of you like) but who cares? Who seriously listens to music on these tiny little devices anyway?! I can understand what Alexa says now - all the plosives are there. I still wonder why Amazon can’t tune the rest of the Alexa enabled devices for better higher frequency clarity.","Treble! Hooray, I can understand Alexa now!"

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2020,Jason H.,"After writing this review and rating it 2 stars, I received a call from Amazon.  They wanted to tell me that the speaker on the Echo Flex is not meant to be the main audio source.  The intent of the design is to use Bluetooth to connect to an external speaker.  This would, of course, resolve my concern with the sound quality, so I increased the rating to 3, or okay.  But in thinking about the Flex alone, I don't think I would rate it as good or great, because it has limited appeal without additional investment. I'm not particularly fond of the idea of adding a speaker just to have this device, because I could buy a Dot instead.  However, I concede that there are niches where this functionality and price savings would be useful.  For example, after thinking about it further, I realized that I could connect it to my Bluetooth enabled treadmill and have Alexa right up front for music or any other questions I might have without having to mount an Echo Dot on the wall.  The Flex plugs in securely to a wall socket and leaves the second outlet open.  It's not heavy and doesn't sag like some two-pronged, heavy transformers do. Installing this was a simple as unpacking it and plugging it in.  It had already been integrated into my account and the WiFi login was automatic. Notifications cause the LED to blink brightly.  It's much harder to ignore it, when you already know what the notification is.  You have to ask, what's my notification, in order to clear it. The sound is like a cell phone's speakerphone, and is hard to listen to.  This device would go best in a garage or out of the house, where you might want access to announcements or activating guards, but not where you want to hear it every day.  (edit:  you are expected to connect to a Bluetooth speaker by design) Giving plenty of space in front of the device helps with communication.  Putting it in a tight space can cause echoes or chirps and clicks that interfere with it.",For someplace you won't need to listen to it every day.

When I am talking on phone, the other party on line says they can hear it very plainly so it is loud.  Don't know why the comments say its bad for hearing, must have an extra large house.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Apr 2020,Jerry,"I purchased this Echo Flex for a problem area in my house.  I have a staircase leading upstairs to a hallway between the bedrooms.  I have smart bulbs throughout my house including the hallway/staircase.  The problem: If I needed to go in the hall/staircase, I would have to remember to tell Alexa to turn on the light before I entered, or it would be me yelling to Alexa to “turn on the hall light”.  Half the time, she did not hear or understand me as I don’t believe Echo Dots were designed to respond well to yelling from a distance. With the Echo Flex, I simply plugged it into an existing hall power socket after setup.  I now can control the hall/stairway lights in my normal voice.  No more yelling! Some features I like: • Flex costs less than a Dot.  Yes, Flex does not have as good of a speaker, or microphone as a Dot, but I don’t need a great speaker where I have it located and the microphone that is in the Flex works great in the hall/staircase. • Flex is built to hang from a wall socket.  I don’t need a table, nor do I need to buy a hook to hang it from the socket. • Flex does everything voice-wise that my echo Dots do, it can control my smart lights, my smart thermostat, any smart devices I have hooked to my Dots, I cam make and receive announcements, etc.  It is simply a scaled down version of the Dot. If you already own Echoes and/or Dots, Cubes, etc and need better voice coverage in a somewhat enclosed area of your home, the Echo Flex is the perfect add-on.  It appears that this situation is exactly what Flex was designed for.  I give the Echo Flex a very firm 5 stars!",Perfect for enclosed problem areas of the home.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2020,Lynn,"First I'm not sure why I bought this. I own several Alexa devices. Echo dots, firestick, firetv etc. I don't know why I thought the usb ports would work by Alexa but they don't. That's fine I misunderstood and jumped the gun. I havent bought any of the only two accessories that exist for the flex so far. I may or may wait and see if Amazon comes up with more or better accessories for the flex. I use this is my kitchen right now away from the Dots. The sound quality is mediocre at best but that doesnt bother me. My 3rd G Dot has great sound. I am actually ok with the sub par sound because late at night if I ask Alexa anything my dots volume is usually up pretty loud and startles me. I don't think to ask her to turn her vol down first and whisper mode never works right for me. The flex is quiet lacking any bass sound or EQ features. At 3 am I can appreciate the mono sound not startling me or disturbing anyone in the house. My most negative opinion is that several times Alexa failed to respond to me after multiple request repeating ALEXA ALEXA. Nada. Most of those times happened while I was listening to music through the flex. I had to unplug it each time to stop the music. A few other times while silent the flex just didn't activate at all. I have debated returning it.  But I haven't and I decided to hold off and see if any of the accessories make it worth the buy.","Not for music enthusiast.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2020,Grady Richardson,"Okay, I didn’t need this. I already had Echos in almost every room in my house. But when Amazon put this on sale for $10, I figured that for 10 bucks, I’d find a use for it. I put it in my hallway, just so in the 10 seconds or so that I’m walking from the family room (which has a Show) to the guest bedroom ( which has my original Echo) and the bathroom (which has a ceiling mounted Dot) door happens to be closed, I can still use Alexa without raising my voice. Maybe my wife is right. Maybe I do need help. Anyway, as to the merits of the device itself. It’s a really nice piece of technology. It’s ridiculously easy to set up. I plugged it in, got my iPad, opened the Alexa app and Alexa announced that my device was ready. Seriously. I didn’t have to do anything at all. I did rename it and put it in a hallway group, but that’s it. It’s an Echo. That is, it does everything any other Echo does, just smaller and cheaper. The only drawback is its tiny speaker, but no one is going to buy this to listen to music on (or they shouldn’t, anyway). I’d probably have put it in the garage for Smart Home control, except that’s where I keep my Tap.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Oct 2020,S. Johannsen,"I have a couple of these, one with a sensor module, one with a nightlight module. There are some places that don't really have a good place for an Echo, but could stand some of the convenience. I have the one with the sensor in a walk-in pantry. The sensor allows the light to be turned on when  entering with hands full, which happens frequently in a pantry. The Echo functions let you drop in somewhere to have someone add something to a grocery list, or you could add to a digital list directly, when you see something is running low. The one with the night light is in a 'guest' bathroom. (Kids have left home, so now it's a guest bathroom). The nightlight works like any other and is good for guests to find their way without flipping on bright lights. The Echo part lets you broadcast, hey, we need TP in the guest bathroom, without straining your voice. I had one in the garage for a while, announcing 'Someone's in the garage', based on the sensor. Could easily be used to trigger lights in the garage as well. So there are some use cases that can benefit from these. I'd stick to places that have outlets a bit higher than the normal ft above floor ones. The microphones on these are fine, the speakers are not to loud, and certainly not intended for music. As a cheap intercom, they are great.",Useful in some specific cases
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2020,James T.,"The new Echo Flex does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is why I bought one.  Amazon came up with this small Echo device to give people the ability to add an Alexa enabled device literally anywhere you have an electrical outlet, so that you can control all your smart devices with your voice, and make your life a bit easier. For this, I gave it 5 stars.  I wanted to have an Alexa enabled device in my kitchen so I could turn some lights on and off with my voice when I am busy cooking, or to ask for food measurement conversions, to set timers for cooking different things, and to also answer the phone when my hands are messy.  All of these things it does, and does perfectly. I also bought it to have voice activation of all my music, which I have it play over my WiFi speakers that I have in all the rooms of my house.  Again, for this, it does that function perfectly.  My kitchen is the loudest room in the house, especially at meal times!  And the very tiny speaker built into the Echo Flex gets drowned out very quickly when people are talking, exhaust fans are going, and spoons and other utensils are banging against pots and pans.  So to try to listen to music on the actual Echo Flex is never going to happen.  Not even in a quiet room. That is not the Echo Flex's intention.  People are bashing the sound that comes out of the Echo Flex as being really poor quality.  And it is, compared to larger Echo devices like the Echo Dot and regular Echo.  If you want to listen to music using the speaker in an Echo device, you have to buy a larger one!  You buy the Echo Flex to expand the areas of your house/garage/basement that you want to have voice control in! My favorite feature of the Echo Flex is that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet with the male prongs on the back of it.  It does not use a long cable like all the other Echo devices.  This puts it up and out of the way of other things you normally have on your counter tops or shelves.  By getting it up off your workspace you don't have to worry about knocking it off or damaging it by accident. Another feature the Echo Flex has is that there is a USB port on the bottom of it that you can connect USB enabled devices to.  There are night lights you can plug into it, and there is even a motion sensor you can plug into it that you can use to program WiFi enabled lights to turn on and off when you enter a dark room.  That is pretty cool. Overall, the Echo Flex is a great little Alexa enabled device that expands the areas that you want voice control of all your WiFi and smart items.  Think of it as your assistant, or helper.  You tell it what to do, and it does it.  For that, it works great.  Using it as your only means of listening to music?  No way.  It is not designed for that, and you will be disappointed in the sound quality.  You want a larger Echo device for that. But if you buy it for what it is, and what it was made to do, you will love it, and it will make your life easier and more enjoyable. Jim","Does exactly what it is supposed to do.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,P. Smith,"Like the other Alexa devices, the Flex was easy to setup and get running. It’s biggest drawback is the quality of sound from the speaker. If you’re expecting the quality of sound of the Echo Show or Dots you will be disappointed. The speaker sounds like one out of a cheesy transistor radio. However, if you are looking for just a basic Alexa device to get the weather, time, set/get reminders or alarms, but no music, then the ease of placement in a variety of nooks and crannies with a power outlet where it can be placed will be appealing. What I’ve done with it is place it in an entry hallway with the optional motion detector. I created a routine with the options set for Monday-Friday starting at around 5:30-7pm, if motion is detected, it will greet me, announce across all my Alexa devices that I’m home to alert the family, turns on the various downstairs lights (if they aren’t on already) where I have on smart plugs and bulbs. Then I set it it to wait for 60 minutes before it will trigger this routine so it won’t go off every time I pass by from that point on. You could also create another routine that every day of the week, after the time when you go to bed til you wake up, if motion is detected send a custom alert to any Alexa device in your home (such as your bedroom) and then set off a buzzer/alarm on the Flex device this serving as a poor man’s alarm system. Of course, if you have any pets wandering around this sort of alarm won’t be very useful. On the just for fun side, I have another routine that is triggered when motion is detected during a certain time period where Alexa will say a random compliment. Yeah I know, totally frivolous, but keeps the kids entertained. The routines you can build with the motion detector have some very well thought out options and actions that work flawlessly. So if you can tolerate the chintzy speaker, the Flex has some good usage possibilities.",Good if you set the right expectations

Although we aren’t an Alexa house, these were on sale during prime day so I thought, wth and bought a couple. The kids love asking Alexa random crap, having her play music (even on the crappy speaker); and hubs and I enjoy dropping in and making announcements unexpectedly.

As an aside, I set up one in their bedroom and they the kid controls I put it on do not disturb. The.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Sep 2020,Eric K.,"The Amazon Flex was on sale super cheap, so I decided to get one.  I thought it would work perfectly in our master bathroom so we could listen to music, the news, or ask Alexa questions when in the shower, bath, or getting ready for work.  Our Amazon Echo is in the living room, which is too far from the bathroom to be able to shout to, and I certainly wouldn't be able to hear it very well. The Flex was easy to set up.  I just plugged it in.  My Alexa app recognized it right away and I just had to follow the simple instructions with a couple of clicks (and inputting my Wi-Fi security code).  You then have to leave your phone within a few feet of the Flex while it's connecting everything. While not very visually appealing as the Echoes and Echo Dots have been getting, the Flex works just as well, as it connects to my main Echo via Wi-Fi.  The sound quality was pretty good, even better than my original Echo Dot from years ago. Why get a Flex instead of an Echo Dot?  For one, it was a lot cheaper at the time I bought since a great deal was going on.  Two, it doesn't need to ""sit"" anywhere.  It's plugged into an electrical outlet (which we rarely used in the bathroom anyway), so it's not taking up any counter or shelf space.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2020,Rob Howell,Based on the reviews and descriptions (and prime day price) I decided to purchase a Flex so that I could add a third party speaker to my speaker group. Unfortunately the sound does not sync up properly with the Echo and Dots that make up the rest of the multi-room group. Testing music directly on the Flex syncs up but on its own this also syncs right if using an aux cable but not when connecting via Bluetooth to a speaker. I tested with two different speakers by different manufacturers but came to the same result.  On the plus side the device itself is louder then expected and can be heard a room over clearly. I wouldn't recommend it over the dot for this purpose but for spoken audio (standup/audio books/pod casts/etc) and normal Alexa usage besides a morning alarm it works fantastically.,Good standalone micro speaker but not good for Bluetooth multi-room grouping

I just needed Alexa to answer questions, tell me the time, give me a reminder or notification, or just keep me company. The Echo Flex works perfectly for my needs in the basement. I have an Echo Show in the kitchen and a big Echo (with excellent speaker volume and sound) in the bedroom. I took it upon myself to buy the right device, for the right room, to meet my needs. I encourage everyone to do the same and remember, you get what you pay for. This works perfectly as described and at its price point!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jun 2020,Heath Thompson,"I've got a lot of Echo products integrated into my home, supporting a variety of smart products (light bulbs, thermostat, doorbell, wall plugs, door locks, etc). I bought this for my garage, which due to my new COVID19 project list/honey do's has been converted into a wood shop.  My desire was two fold: 1. I wanted to be able to hear the Ring doorbell. 2. I wanted to be able to cut all power to my tools and work bench without having to hit switches, via a smart plug that I already had. Within 10 minutes both had been accomplished.  I actually had it all working before the notification came in regarding the delivery of the flex. I was then able to get my wifi garage door opener working with it. Now I can close the garage when I'm done working in there, or turn on/off the light on the opener. Additionally, I was able to play my Spotify playlist through it, like my other Echo devices. The sound quality isn't the best as it's through a tiny speaker but it isn't nearly as bad as others have claimed.  I was actually impressed by the sound quality, given the tiny footprint. Overall, I'm impressed with the device even without any of the attachments.  It would be cool if the sold a high quality speaker attachment for it - it would be an instant purchase!",It's better than I expected and works flawlessly
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2020,J. Degada,"I love my little Echo Flex! To be fair I love my life with Alexa! I have her everywhere including in my car- she is literally the best personal assistant I’ve ever had! My Echo Flex is in my bathroom and keeps me company while I get ready in the morning- gives me my news and weather, maybe she reads me a book while I take a bath, or helps me remember a song I was thinking of.. at night while I brush my teeth she reports a little “good news” and is always around to help me remember something I need at the store, or that it’s time to rinse out my conditioner.. I can also drop in on another room, when I forgot my towel! This little gadget is loud enough.. and has no problem hearing me...AND with the addition of the night light module, she provides me with a nice red glow for late night trips- no more turning on the jarring room lights!! Love her! Always have!","A baby Alexa.. just right for your powder room! Or laundry room, or garage...."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2020,Sunny,"Unless you're in an extremely quiet room or a very small bed room, it's a little hard to hear this device. The speakers on this are minuscule, even at the maximum volume, it's a very low volume. If you have a TV, people talking, or music in the background, forget about hearing the response this device has to say. I'm glad Alexa is build into such a small and cheap device you can plug into the wall, but slightly louder speakers could make this very handy and more useful. I know you can plug an external speaker into the device, but I don't think most people buy this to use it that way. If you're thinking about using this in your bathroom while you're showering, you can forget about it. Overall, buy it when it is on sale, I don't think the full price is a good deal.

Plug it in, add it to your Alexa environment and off you go. Also con : The sound is very tinny.  Clearly the minute speaker has no Bass reproduction but then thats fine - I find I can actually 'hear' it with improved clarity over the Alexa V3 sometimes.  Sometimes less IS more!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2020,One Eyed Jack,"Far too many poor reviews from people who clearly failed to comprehend the purpose of this device. This product does what is intended to do, period. It is not a music player,  but can be, if paired with a bluetooth speaker. It wasn't designed for you to use it listen to 'talk radio' in the shower ( you should thank Amazon for that... seriously). It is best used in a small room or space,  for basic Alexa purposes. I have not tried any of the accessories,  nor do I plan to at this time. There are reviews about the poor volume, once again...designed for a small space.  I have mine about 6 feet from my bed and desk (between the two, I don't sleep on my desk...but have fallen asleep at it.). For the price, and for my needs,  I am quite satisified. Update: I havent tried a bluetooth speaker, but I did plug in a mini jack PC speaker  and the volume was still a bit low. Still suits my needs, but if you want more volume, go with a dot, or something bigger.",Dont be mislead by the reviews.

Pretty cool for the price! Definitely not great with the sound...but what do you expect with a tiny little speaker!?! Bottom line, if you want to have a little music or the news in a small space in your house or if you just want this device put in the hallway because the other echo dots or whatever you have cannot hear you, this is for you. The sound is low, but that being said it’s still does what you need to! I don’t know if I would purchase it again because I like the sound to be louder.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2020,Suzannah,"I have tons of Alexa devices, this is by far my least favorite. It seems I have to reconnect the device every other week and I’ve had it less than a year. I’ve only had to do that once to my Echo Show in the two years I’ve had it. I bought the Flex for my laundry room so I can continue to hear my audiobook as I do my chores moving from room to room while the book plays on the everywhere group. This DARN hunk of plastic is always suddenly disconnected from the group and from my network every other week while all my other devices continue working perfectly fine. I didn’t even mind the tinny/weak speaker it has because I listen to books mostly but without a connection it just sucks up my electricity until I can stop what I’m doing and reset/reconnect everything. This product is a dud in my opinion. Oh, and my laundry room is near my router and not on the other side of my house. I have Alexa devices much further away that work fine.",I’m about to chuck this piece of plastic
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2019,RoboTech,"First off, the product description SPECIFICALLY STATES that it is not made for music. It is NOT a replacement for an Echo Dot as far as sound quality goes. I am not going to due the product a disservice by giving it a 1-star rating for that reason alone, like other have. I also own several Dot's attached to wall mounts. They are in areas that are clean and dust free, whereas the Flex can be hooked up in a dusty garage or shed without worrying about the speaker cloth getting torn, dirty or moldy. The Flex can be just wiped off with a damp cloth. Even with the Dots on sale, the total cost with a good wall mount is at least $35. The Flex is replacing my Echo Inputs and a couple of my Dots. No cords or mounting worries and about the same price as the Input. I bought the Flex to use in the garage connected to a stereo system and also in a hallway with the night light plug-in. The Flex is the perfect solution and a lot cheaper than a Dot w/wall mount configuration in tight spots where you are not going to use the internal speaker anyhow. Plus, the added benefit of a USB port on the bottom to charge your phone, plug in a night light, or to power a set of USB speakers. As for the microphones, I am not sure why people are reporting that the microphones don't work well. All (3) of my Flex pick up my voice just fine from across the room. Just because the Flex has only 2 microphones, doesn't mean as much as you'd think. The DOT is usually mounted flat on a table and needs all 6 mics to pick up your voice from all angles. The FLEX on the other hand, is plugged into a wall and only has to pick up your voice from a much narrower angle. I have found that the microphones on the DOT can get ""confused"" when mounted vertically on the wall. The blue ring on the Dot that lights up when activated, has a brighter spot on the ring that corresponds with the direction of your voice. Sometimes you will see the ring on the Dot ""spinning"" as it picks up your voice bouncing all over the place. The 2 mics on the Flex are better suited for wall mounting. More is not always better. Realistically, nothing is perfect and sure, they could have put a bigger speaker in it. A larger speaker most certainly would have increased the price and made it physically larger. People would then be complaining about that. For me, I am glad is has a speaker for audible Alexa responses at least. In summary, the Flex is not perfect, but for specific purposes and for the price it can't be beat as long as you are not expecting to use it for music (or in a noisy environment) using the built in speaker.",Perfect solution for using in a tight space connected to another speaker system.

It started 2018 Black Friday echo sale I believe. Only started using it properly spring 2019. I began to realize how helpful it can be. Alarms, lists, music, orders, time, weather, news, topic look up, definitions & so much more. Then I discovered the smart bulbs which are really helpful. I don't have to stumble around to turn on my lamp anymore. Then I discovered the smart plugs which I mostly use for starting kitchen appliances. When I got an email about this being on a 50% off sale, I took the leap to get another area in my home Alexa friendly. I knew that the speaker would not be very loud after reading the introduction but we have a sound bar that can be linked to it when we need it to be louder. Setting it up was easy peasy with the Alexa App. I've also learnt how to 'intercom' between Echos so another discovery! I also love that its plug in so no wires & we save table/counter space.

Now I don’t have to go up the stairs in the dark until I get to my main Alexa port in the Living room to turn the lights on.

I also bought the motion sensor addon, but I had to choose between the nightlite or the morion sensor. I chose the nightlight. I wish I could have used both the nightlite AND the motion detector.

Two for my father-in-law's house to add on motion detectors.  They work great for that.  The other two were for my wife (in the laundry room) and my son so they could listen to music on demand.  They now hate me for doing that.  I have Alexa built into an Ecobee thermostat and my wife plays music through that all the time.  It doesn't sound as good as a 2nd gen Echo Dot, but good enough for her ears.  I figured the Flex couldn't be much worse than that.  I was wrong.  They don't use them often enough for Bluetooth.  I use an aux cable to hook my son's up to his mini hi-fi, but it doesn't push enough power even for that.  Very weak sounding.  And he looses the convenience of just asking for music, he would have to turn the stereo on to hear it.  Worse yet, we paid the same for them that we just paid for th 3rd Gen Dot on Prime Day!

The speaker is tiny so it sounds more like the old fashioned transistor radio without the static, but the sound is bold enough to hear throughout the large room that I have it in.  So I am impressed with that.  I added the night light and that is an excellent feature to have in a bedroom.  The Alexa app added the flex on immediately to my devices and it gives you the ability to fine-tune the many settings that the flex is capable of as well as the night light that I added as an accessory.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2020,J.,"No one expect any great soumd quality, in my personal view. The device is simply and specifically advertised as a mobile extension of Alexa.

On the other side of the door where Alexa Echo Flex is installed/plugged in at, were in fact able to pick up my voice as well as able to understand what I was saying to the Amazon Echo Flex. As a result of the voice detection limitation, I have ordered Amazon's white Echo input as to replace the Flex and intend to purchase bluetooth enabled outdoor speaker for mount in the the bathroom and to be linked/connected to the Amazon Echo Input that was purchased to replace the Echo Flex.","Certainly is an extension of the Alexa AI, with voice pick up limitations in my experience."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Oct 2020,Medtec M.,"I see a number of reviews where the reviewer described the sound quality as bad.  If you were planning to play music out of the internal speaker you will be disappointed BUT (and it's a big Serena Williams BUT') you shouldn't be using the internal speaker for that.  Everyone forgets to mention that it has a stereo output port.  You need to use it.  Plug that into your home stereo or high quality computer speaker.  It is then that you will have sound quality that far exceeds any stand-alone smart speaker you can find at ten times the price.  Additionally, that little internal speaker actually articulates better than the larger echos because it doesn't even try to reproduce the low frequencies, so for reproducing voices like news, audio books, Alexa-read Kindle books and phone calls it also functions better. You get all of this for only $25 and since I got it mine on sale for $10, the value I have received is tremendous. You may be asking yourselves ""If it's so great then why didn't you give it five stars?""  This is because I don't give out five stars.

Now I can quietly go into the bedroom while the TV is on and gently ask Alexa to do things.

I like the lights on the device that mirror the regular Echo, so I know what's going on with it.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,Seth I Levine,"This is a pretty OK Echo device. It certainly has its good points! When used with the motion sensor (which is what I'm doing), it really could only work in a hallway type of situation. The problem, as I see it, is that it needs to be plugged directly into an outlet, and, in my house anyway, most of the outlets in rooms where I might want this to work, are below knee level and behind furniture - except in the hallway. I suppose the nightlight option would work well in the hallway situation, too, but it's too bad you can't have both the nightlight AND motion sensor. The Alexa functionality of this device is just like all other Alexa devices. It can hear from all around a room and answer questions or follow commands. The speaker is definitely not worthy of playing music with much fidelity. Right now, I'm using it in my garage to control an adjacent smart switch to turn the garage lights on in reaction to the motion sensor. That seems like a perfect fit for this combination of devices. I'm not really sure how else one might use this, because most outlets in most homes in the US are not accessible in a way that would work with this thing. If I had a very specific use case where I knew this would work, I'd buy it again. Otherwise, I wish there was a motion sensor option from Amazon that didn't require being plugged directly into a wall outlet.",It's an odd combination of brilliant and dumb
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2020,Matt Seegers,"I wanted to try out the Flex right when Amazon announced the new product but only recently had a chance to purchase them. My intended use-case was for the two bathrooms in my apartment.  My wife and I almost exclusively listen to NPR while we're in the bathroom getting ready for the day and have been resorting to using one of our phones to play it.  This works pretty well but obviously can lead to some risks/issues:  the phones' speakers are *almost* loud enough to hear while in the shower.  If you place the phone in a sink it boosts the volume just enough.  As one may expect, this has resulted in many close calls with water. Initial Setup: Fantastically easy, just like any Amazon Echo device Physical Size: just small enough that it shouldn't block both outlets in a dual outlet... outlet. Experience:  Speech recognition just as good as any Echo device, but I have only used them in bathrooms, which is likely easier for the mic(s) to pick up.  Loading apps (like NPR) or pairing using bluetooth is just like any other Echo device (ie fast and relatively painless).  Audio sounds good--but, as is essentially mentioned in product description, is not designed for rich (ie music) audio and does not get very loud.  I would rate the loudness to be lower than an iPhone 7 or later. Takeaway: This is a great device to integrate voice control in a small/medium room.  However, if you want to use it for audio and there is any ambient noise in the room I would recommend either using external speakers (plugged in to the audio-out and/or USB port) or external bluetooth speakers.  If your main goal was to get audio into a room it may be more cost effective to find an all-in-one solution that can support voice control and also has solid speakers.  For me, I am hoping that there will be more Flex accessories that could potentially address this issue (ie a Flex Speaker that plugs into the USB port and fits the same form factor).",Great for adding voice control to any small/med room with low ambient noise
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Nov 2020,Janet Cullen,"I bought this Echo Flex for my bedroom. I have smart bulbs in my room. So I needed a device to turn them on & off. Plus I also wanted the extra features like asking Alexa what time it is, the weather, playing my Amazon Music while I'm getting ready. This Echo Flex really is helpful. Although at times it does not respond. Especially when I'm standing in total darkness asking it to turn on the light.....and nothing happens. Sometimes I have to ask many times. I do have 1 reg bulb. To get to it in the total darkness could cause injury to myself. LOL So I stand there asking Alexa numerous times in different ways to turn on the lights. My Echo Flex seems to be quirky. I have it in a clear spot so I know it can hear me. The wifi router is in the next room so I know there isnt an issue with connection. I have been told I speak to loud so I know it is not my voice. In the end The Echo Flex is worth it for my needs.",Good for my needs
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Sep 2020,Rae Danielle,"I expected these to suck based off other reviews but honestly they don’t.. I am not sure why everyone complains about the sound, it sounds fine to me. We have just about every echo device there is. The flex we have in our kids bedrooms and our basement  so they can listen to music. I would have gotten a dot like we have in the dining room but the flex are cheaper and I like that there isn’t a cord. The sound quality might not be as great as the other echo devices but honestly I don’t notice much of a difference.. for listening to music and everything else honestly I don’t see a problem. I mean we aren’t having a party or anything so the music isn’t getting blasted on these, these are just for casual listening while in bedrooms or in the basement game room. When they are on in the bedrooms I can hear them all over the house unless they close their door or I ask them to turn them down. Overall I’m pleased with these.

Such is the case with the Echo Flex.  I have 2 Dots, and a fairly sprawled out house, with a basement.  I wanted a simple way to keep the family connected, and had already found out how handy (and fun) the Dots were, so I added 2 Flex. The whole set up works like a charm and is easy to use.  I can now ""drop in"" on someone in the basement while I'm in the living room, or (as the ad says) call everyone to dinner, no matter where they are just by asking Echo to do so.  I've had a ball programming each to say certain things at certain times (the Flex at the back door has the job of reminding hubby at 6 am to make sure he has everything before he leaves for work). The Flex are small enough to not take up a lot of room. As a bonus, for these two I also purchased the night lights to go along with them, so they pull double duty.

Also one worry I had was the operating temperature. It says it is rated down to 32 degrees. Well I haven't had it long and the temperature in my garage has been down near single digits and so far so good!  I figured for the price it was worth trying to see if it survived.

We use them mostly to play the radio, podcasts, sleep sounds and as an intercom system We didn't have one in the kitchen because we didn't have the space for it and we already have a radio in there. We added the Echo Flex  because it doesn't take up any counter space and we wanted to have an intercom because the kitchen is on the opposite end of the house from the living room and we end up doing a lot of shouting back and forth. Unfortunately, the sound quality is so poor that you usually can't understand what the other person is saying - especially when there is background noise in the kitchen. You can hear that the other person is saying something, but can't understand what it is.  We are now trying to figure out where we can put a Dot in the kitchen.

Half the time it doesn't hear me at all, and when it does it often doesn't hear correctly. In the kitchen, it doesn't have enough volume to be heard over any cooking or clanking, and in the nursery we have to put it at volume 10 for white noise to be loud enough.

First of all, it doesn't take up a whole lot of room. It has Bluetooth, so if the speaker sounds tinny (and it does a little bit, but the sound quality isn't horrible) it can connect to a speaker and boom-boom just like the bigger Echo products. The microphones in this unit are very responsive so I don't feel the need to shout at the Echo Flex (like I need to with my first-gen 2014 Amazon Echo sometimes). It has everything you love about the Echo, plus some extra tricks - it has a USB port in the bottom so you can charge your phone or attach one of the THIRDREALITY dongles they have available, such as a night light or a motion sensor. I keep it in my bathroom so I can listen to my morning Flash Briefing while I get ready for work, and I charge up my phone for the day at the same time. It's a little blocky and I have to unplug it to use my blow-dryer because it takes up so much room on the electrical outlet on the wall.

It works great in there. I often have it play music or the latest news or weather when I am doing my hair and make up, cleaning the bathroom, or even taking a bath and, while it doesn't sound nearly as good as the Echo Shows, it's about on par with my Dot. If I can understand it with my funky ears, it can't be terrible! It's very responsive. Actually more responsive than the Shows and gets what I am saying right almost all the time.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2020,TOm,"I wanted to like this thing so badly, because it is theoretically a great idea.  A socket mounted, $25 echo that fits well into a bathroom or kitchen, paired with a bluetooth speaker is amazing, and hey, when the thing actually responds to your voice, it is amazing. However, even when there is no sound whatsoever, I sometimes have to literally scream at the thing to wake it, and a good 1/10 times it doesn't understand me.  I will try to talk to it but my echo plus on the other side of the apartment will respond because of how terrible the mics on the flex are.  I have even resorted to giving them different names (which I hate, and shouldn't have to do) but even then, I can be standing in the same exact position directly in front of the flex (which sits at about chest height in my kitchen) and it will sometimes wake, but often just sit there like a useless piece of plastic and circuitry. I am tempted to return this and replace it with an echo, but I'm already beyond the return window, which is frustratingly just long enough to really see these issues.  0/10, would never buy again or recommend unless they double the number of mics or make them more sensitive.",Mics are Horrible and Deaf

I think my dots have better sound quality than my old stereo, and that is  really not something I should admit.  I admit it in order to say: even for me, someone whose bargain smart TV doesn't have a soundbar, etc, the tinny sound quality of Alexa's voice on this device was distracting and well,  distressingly bad.  I mean, I cringed... and prepared  to return it.  My husband decided he didn't mind, so this went in his own study where I won't hear it as he asks for the days sports updates when he returns from work.  I can't bear to listen to it.

I can still have access to music and also tell it to add something to my shopping list which is super helpful for me since I can forget on the way to the living room. I would say on of the main benefits of having one of the Echo Show products is if you need to remove or edit something, its easy cause you can ask it show you your list and then you can touch the items to edit or swipe the item off your list. Also you can ask it to remove an item with audio. Also the Echo show lets you watch movies and the sound is awesome. I recommend all the Amazon Alexa products!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2020,Impetigo,"I really love this device except that the response is slow.  I love the simple, Apple-like design.  I love the utility of having a small Echo device that plugs directly in the wall in rooms (e.g. bathroom) where you don't want a full sized Echo (and I am not a fan of the small Echos, the Echo Dot) or it's not practical (or too costly).  The speaker quality is completely fine for what it is.  I love being able to make announcements from any room, to any room. But what I don't love is that there is often a delay with the responsiveness, especially the farther you are from your wifi source (which makes sense since the voice commands are sent to the Amazon data centers that process the commands, like Siri on Apple), that is not an issue with my full sized Echos.

When I saw this for pre-order I thought it would work great in the kitchen to replace the Dot. Set-up was simple and it looks decent enough but the audio... The sound is the equivalent to the worst AM radio. The volume can't be adjusted from the Flex, you have to go into the app, which is not at all convenient. Attempting to raise the volume is frustrating because although you may set it to 100%, when you reopen the app it is at 70%. No matter how many times you try to leave it at 100%, and boy did I try, it always turns itself back down. Needless to say, with the poor quality speaker and the inability to turn up the volume, if I am making any kind of noise in the kitchen (running water, frying food, running the microwave) it drowns out the Flex to the point I can't understand what is being said. I have no choice but to bring the Dot back to the kitchen and move the Flex to a quieter part of the house where it will see less use. The idea was good but poorly done.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2020,FYI,"I have an Echo, 3 Echo Dots, an Echo Input, and now this Echo Flex.  The Flex was given to me as a gift.  Overall, it really doesn't do anything for me.  Positive aspects may be that it plugs directly into an electrical outlet eliminating the need for a power cord, and possibly future accessories that hopefully are forthcoming.  Currently the two accessories that are available don't offer any wow factor for me.  Negative aspects:  not visually attractive; the speaker is basically useless because of low volume it generates and lack of tone.  It would probably function better pairing with a blue tooth speaker.  I would recommend spending a little more for the Echo Dot -- or maybe even the Echo Input.  The Dot has decent sound reproduction as a stand alone, and the Input looks better than the Flex but does require a power cable and some sort of extension speaker.  I think the Flex was a ""swing and a miss"" for Echo devices. Update:  spoke with an Amazon rep this morning following my posted review (great customer service Amazon!).  After elaborating on my opinion regarding the Flex, the rep provided me with some suggestions as to how to get better sound performance out of it.  I followed the advice and was able to produce better sound (volume and tone).  With that, I would change my rating on the device to 2 stars.  I am still of the opinion that this is not one of Amazon's better products, but I understand it will fit the needs of other customers.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 May 2020,Liss,"Overall, I like this Echo Flex, but it was an absolute bear to install.  It made me re-enter my wifi password so many times I nearly gave up.  A few weeks later my phone informed me there was a new Echo available to install--and sure enough, this little Echo Flex had somehow dropped out of my devices.  I fought valiantly for over an hour to reinstall it--it literally kept telling me my network password was wrong.  I got online to search for help and found nothing that worked. I thought I was going to have to return it.  I was about ready to turn off my wifi/network and endure the slow cycle of everything coming back up, but I decided--what the hell--why don't I at least try unplugging and replugging the confounded Flex. And that fixed it.  I didn't even have to reinstall.  It was suddenly back in its rightful place in my devices.  Shrug. The sound quality is minimal, but it serves its purpose in my little utility room.  I use it with a motion sensor so I don't have to say or do anything to have the lights come on when I'm toting a big load of laundry into the room.  It's a reasonable little machine.  I do think, however, that it's much harder to install (because it seems to have trouble grasping onto wifi signal) and a bit more glitchy than the other Echo devices.

Sure, but I did not expect that and it works great for what we wanted it for. What we like... It is great for those tight spaces and areas that you want the convenience of Alexa, but don't have counter/table space. The fact that it is a small plug-in device makes it great for those areas. While the sound could certainly be better, it does do great for doing routines or dropping into other rooms in our house.

The voice-recognition in the Flex works really well - sometimes better than a full-size Echo.

Issue #1 - the motion sensor attachment goes wonky every few weeks and the way I've found to fix it is to unplug the Flex from the wall, wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Issue #2 - I didn't expect the speaker to be used for music and so I have the Flex set to play music on another Echo device in an adjacent room.  That's great, but what I needs is the ability to tell the Flex to use that other Echo for music, but let the Flex handle other verbal output so that if I play music it goes to another Echo with decent sounding speaker, but if I just ask Alexa a question or give her a command, the response should come from the Flex whose speaker is sufficient for verbal responses.","Perfect form, could use a bit of help in function"

My Kitchen Flex is constantly eavesdropping while I'm talking to the LivingRoom Dot. Flex's integration is awesome, and in some instances, better than Dot. However, her voice needs an upgrade in both quality and volume.  It's almost painful to listen to her relatively squeaky voice especially when you combine it with a Max 10 Volume sounding close to a 3 Volume Dot. The only solution is to get a constant-power BT Speaker to sync with her.  Maybe that's why they gave the flex a USB charging port.

I was used to speaking to a normal echo dot or the full size echo, but this one is nowhere near as sensitive as those.  Nearly every time I want to use it I have to repeat myself 2-3 times, each louder than the last.  Once you can get it to respond it operates like any other Alexa device but getting it to wake up is a miserable.  Even my Echo Auto has better voice pickup than this thing does.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2019,Tiffany,"I have a lot of echoes and echo dots, and I often buy them for presents. I am a huge fan! However, I'm very disappointed in this flex. It was great when I got it. I plugged it in, and it booted up and immediately worked like my dots. I didn't  need to set it up with my Alexa app or anything. Great right? Well, it was until it just stopped working after one month. All my other echoes from months and months ago still fine, but this seems poorly made. The speaker produces a very tinny sound which I could live with as it was in a room I don't use too often, but conking out after only one month is unacceptable.I don't recommend the flex.","Was wonderful, but stopped working after one month"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2019,Eric C. Paulsen,"I bought these for my moms cabin up north to help control and monitor the environmentals. After I received them on the 6th I plugged each one in, connected it to my software and network, then checked/changed settings and ran it through its paces to ensure they were all up to snuff. The problem was that two of them, even though they responded to ‘alexa’, had an error that it was waiting for wakeword which never updated. Not a huge problem unless I want to change the wakeword, which knowing me as I do, I probably will. I deregistered all three and oddly all of my information remained on the device, even the changes to alarms and audio, which seems wrong. So I factory reset all three and guess what? All of my information was STILL on the device afterward! Amazon needs to address this issue right quick! Six days later now each unit is able to let me change the wakeword. I have worked in IT and work logically and methodically and I don’t understand this inexplicable change since there has been no software update.

I wanted to connect it to our Echo Show, byt Amazon does not put an audio jack on them and Bluetooth is always timing out.  I used a regular Dot I had and it worked great. I was going to buy another Dot, but now they are too fancy and expensive.  Then I stumbled upon the Echo Flex.  It does everything the Dot does except for extremely poor speaker.  The flex is very compact, very inexpensive and the audio out of its audio jack is just as good as the Dot.  I recommend the Flex if you are using alternate speakers or just want something to yell commands at for other components.  I have a Dot in the bathroom, but with the bracket I'm using, it covers both power outlets.  I'm going to replace it with a Flex and an external speaker.

This is something quite different that’s meant for another purpose. The sound is a quite a bit “tinny”. It’s meant to mainly be a receiver not a speaker. You can have an echo dot answer instead of this device if you want good sound. You can also hook up a Bluetooth or wired speaker (but that's an extra cost). So why do I have it? Guard Mode is part of my home security. I keep this in my bathroom to detect glass breaks. This is a cheaper alternative to a dot. I also pair this with my shower speaker. The USB plug is a bit handy as well. I know it’s really meant for the motion sensor or night light, but I use it as a charger. Update: After a few months, I'm happy with it.

I wanted an Alexa speaker so that I could listen to music in addition to asking Alexa about the time and weather all while getting ready for work in the morning. The reason it took me so long to purchase, was because other reviewers had stated that the sound was very low and you could hardly understand Alexa and hear music being streamed. After reading just ONE review from someone stating they had bought it for their bathroom and it was everything that they wanted it to be with sound volume and size, I decided to purchase. To my surprise, it was everything I wanted it to be. The volume emitted was perfect and I could hear the music perfectly while in the shower.

Now I have 3 total in my house! So far, both have been amazing! I have one in the bathroom to ask for the morning news, weather, and the time. This is called the “Flex” because of the flexibility to relocate it to anywhere there is WiFi access. The response tome is about the same as my 3rd gen Dot. This Alexa is small but I see room for improvement for this tiny device. I don’t get why it is so huge but the audio is sub-par. (I would guess the AC to DC conversion but how much space does it need?) They could of easily put inside a bigger speaker driver in the space. If they could do it for the Echo Auto, so can they do it for the flex. On the flip side, one thing I like about the Flex is that I can plug in my own speakers and usb device in with no problems (has 3.5mm headphone jack on the side and a USB A port on the bottom).

The sound quality isn’t the best, but for the price I wasn’t expecting it to be. Besides, it has an audio port to attach any external speaker one could want. Sometimes it has difficulties hearing me when playing music at full volume, but its just minor difficulties, I’ve never had to stand there yelling at it in order for it to hear me. I’ve found this super especially useful around the house with making ‘Alexa announcements’. We have a flex in our kitchen, and another in my fathers office (which is located outside in a garage). He never has his phone on him, so whenever it’s time for dinner we no longer have to run outside to let him know, we can simply say “Alexa, announce dinner time!” and he will know! I’ve also been using a flex in my bedroom with the motion sensor attachment, and WOW does it feel otherworldly to get home from work and have my house greet me with my lights and tv coming on and a little ‘hello’. This is by FAR the cheapest option to adding motion sensors to Alexa to automate routines, all others I could find required some sore of hub (which is too expensive) or were in themselves too expensive.

Which, I am not sure why there is another one, as there is one built into it. Perhaps the external one is more sensitive. Either way, it’s a great little night light.

The saving grace and why this didn't get knocked down any lower is that you can hook this up either to a Bluetooth speaker or via the 3.5mm audio jack to an amp or to powered speakers.

The third party nightlight is a nice touch also. I only run it on about 40% intensity because it’s quite bright. You can also change it to all sorts of colors if you like This also is compatible with Alexa Gaurd, so it’s another mic listening for fire/CO alarms or glass breakage while you’re out. Overall I’m happy with it. If you intend to use it for music or phone calls regularly you might want to stick with a gen three dot, as it has much greater output. With that and the outlet hanging mount you still wouldn’t take up any counter space, however it wouldn’t be as sleek.",Handy for several tasks. Volume somewhat limited.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Butchboy,"Update:  After a couple of months, this device started disconnecting from Wifi almost on a daily basis.  I have GB speed in my house, so that isn't the problem.  Additionally, the connection to my Bluetooth speaker is shaky at best.  I would not recommend this device anymore. I wanted an Echo for the bathroom because I like to listen to the radio while showering.  However, I didn't want a cord and didn't want to take up counter space for the dot itself.  The Echo flex helps fit that bill.  It works well in the small room, but the one thing I do not like is the tinny sound that comes out of it.  Actually, the sound is quite bad compared to the dot.... more like a transistor radio (for those who are old enough to remember those). The convenience is great though and I will continue to use it until one with better sound comes out.",Dud
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Sep 2020,Joseph,"I bought this only because I have a dedicated Bluetooth speaker in my kitchen. If I didn't have this, it would have been a waste of money. It does work like every other Alexa device, just more compact and perfect for an area where you cannot lay the Echo on a surface. ***UPDATE*** This device randomly turns on and does actions/requests no one requested. When I turn on multi room music, this device will not play any of the music even though it is included in the music group. The music from Pandora also cuts in and out a lot, making you miss a few seconds of each song multiple times during each song. No other Echo device I have does this. It also cannot hear too well; I have to push the listen button for it to receive commands, almost as if it is ignoring its activation word.",Horrible device
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2020,AmazonJunkie,"I like that it is compact and out of the way. Fits nicely behind our sofa and uses up 1 bottom outlet space leaving the top outlet open for use. Easily installed with our other alexa electronics. The only cons so far is that the audio is not good quality. When playing music you dont feel the base. The music sounds very flat. You can easily hear the difference when playing all the alexa electronics at the same time. When you walk into the room with the flex its as if you suddenly went underwater. The other drawback is that I have an echo show in my dining room, 2 rooms away.  When I speak to the flex sometimes the echo show answers. I dont notice this as much with the echo dots, which are normally very receptive and has better speakers.","Eh, wish it had the same quality as an echo dot."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Sep 2020,Robert O.,"I use the Echo Flex as a fill-in device at a good price point. It's convenient and just plugs into an available wall socket. By fill-in I mean that it fills gaps in my Alexa home coverage. I have 9 Echo devices, 2 of which are Flex.  Good for hallways etc. I have each equipped with the motion sensor. One is in my entry hall and turns on lights when we come in through the front door. of course it also turns on flights when we leave which isn't so useful. Alexa needs more conditions for Routines so for example the hall Flex shouldn't turn on lights if lights are already on.  Sound quality is poor from the Flex but this doesn't matter to me because I just use it to issue home automation voice commands. Overall a great addition and good value for money.",Great 'fill in' device at a good price point.

We hear Alexa's voice responses just fine in our bathroom.  I use a blutooth speaker to play music from this Echo Flex.  My review includes the Smart Motion Sensor kit.  I set up routines so when anyone walks into the bathroom, the lights turn on, Alexa says the time, etc.  This is neat as after there is no motion detected, the lights turn off in 5 minutes according to the routine I setup.  The sensor sensitivity is fine...as soon as anyone enters the bathroom (it is plugged into the socket by the light switch) it activates (even for the little dog)",Very Nice for Alexa in my bathroom.

There is an option to hook up a speaker, which I did making it sound a lot better. However, now there’s extra cords laying around.

This Echo Flex worked perfectly! It plugs in to the outlet on my patio (is rather unnoticeable, which is a plus so that I can leave it outside), set up immediately with my Alexa app, paired effortlessly with my bluetooth speakers; and, gave me the functions I desired (just like my Echo Dots). The price point (on sale) was also unbeatable! The only thing I notice is that you have to be within fairly close range (about 10 feet) and directly facing it for it to hear your voice commands in an outdoor setting; in an enclosed space, I am sure it would have further range.

I used to have an Echo Dot in the bathroom, but without hearing aids, the sound seemed muffled and muddy no matter how I adjusted the sound to emphasize the treble.  The sound from the Flex is much like the pocket-size transistor radios back in the '50s...sort of tinny.  But, that's what I like about the Flex because its sound is much easier for me to understand.  I guess that I have a spare Dot on my hands, but the tradeoff was well worth it for me.

It's very tinny and I wouldn't attempt to listen to music on it. But that's not why you purchase an Echo Flex. What you can do is plug in a good speaker set using the jack, connect a good speaker via Bluetooth, and save yourself some space compared to any other Echo device. Or, if you know you're not going to have music in a certain room but would like the convenience of having Alexa available, say the garage, a bathroom, or college dorm, for instance, then this is a killer option.

Down there sound Fidelity really is not an issue. There is a tool room, a drafting room, the furnace, some storage... It's not a place where people will hang out. However, one of the best things about this is it is small, inconspicuous and you still have full Alexa availability. I will use mine to listen to news, ask about traffic in Metro, make sure that I add things to list, turn lights on and off...

Yes, that's me being an idiot and not thinking, or even looking at it properly.

However the audio quality is nowhere near as good as even the Echo Dot.  I have it in the bathroom to listen to music while in the bath or shower, and it is definitely not loud enough and the quality of the audio is mediocre at best. For basic issuing of commands to tell devices what to do and asking for the weather and other simple things it's ok, but I would not recommend this for anyone wanting to listen to music.  Also, if you are buying the nightlight attachment, be sure to measure the amount of space you have under the outlet.

I liked the sleeker, inobtrusive look of the Flex, but I just couldn't stand the sound. It sounds not only like a robot, but a robot in a box. Very robotic and echoey. Also, the sound it makes when the timer goes off is higher pitched than the dot and I found it annoying.

I solved those problems by switching it with the downstairs Echo Dot. It takes up less room plugged into wall socket beside my recliner, and no problem hearing it from there.

Not a problem for a small space like a bathroom, but after using the Dot devices for some time it throws you off. I also don't like that there is no manual button(s) for volume control.

This is exactly when I need.  I already have a cheap WIFI camera with 2 way communications, but it doesn't alert me, nor it is capable of turning the light on.  Our porch gets pretty dark at night and I now have some light for unlocking the door.  If people actually came to the front porch, I would do that one too.  No need for a doorbell.

The setup was identical to the Echo Dot . Some of the critiques about sound pickup are true but I think that is because of the new location on the wall plug while the Echo was on the table. My biggest complaint is the bluetooth pickup. I continually lose bluetooth reception with my bluetooth speaker, an issue I never had with the Echo Dot. This might be due to the placement of the Echo Flex on a wall plug lower in line of sight with the speaker. The distances are identical within 2 feet, far below the 30 foot threshold bluetooth provides. The idea is great (allowing you to free up table space).

Now granted this happens to be plugged into my bathroom but I like to sing while I'm doing my hair or makeup or in the shower and you can barely hear anything over the shower so now I have to go and buy a shower speaker just to be able to get some type of volume there is no volume button so you cannot control the volume which is probably my biggest issue with this device. Honestly I'm thinking about returning the device. The only good thing is that my phone could be plugged in another room charging or something and I'm still able to make calls from the bathroom. If they are going to sell this device you should probably only be $15 which is what I paid because I believe I caught it on sale but that's about the worth of the device it should not be any higher than $15 PERIOD!,Not worth more than $15
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,JamesTN865,"This is a terrific idea for adding Echo to those areas of the home where there is nowhere to place a standard Echo, but good grief the sound is awful. I have a dozen of the various Echo devices throughout my house, for excellent coverage, but the laundry closet needed an Echo, so that while I am stuck folding clothes I can add things to my shopping or project list that come to mind,  or listen to the news or a podcast to make the chore more pleasant. I thought that this product would be a  perfect solution because it plugged neatly into the outlet above the laundry  counter, leaving the counter unobstructed for folding clothes, but I am so disappointed because I realized immediately during setup that the sound quality would make this unusable for anything but smart home command input.  It is definitely not something that would be tolerable for music or podcast streaming.  The Alexa voice itself is so tinny and distorted that I don't see myself even being able to use it.  I might try putting in a remote area where I would rarely need it but it might be handy for something like controlling a light. As one reviewer stated, with current speaker technology, there is really no excuse for such poor sound quality, even at that price point.  Amazon has had a few missteps with first generation Echo-tech, hopefully they will improve this device in subsequent generations.  It really is a great idea for any kitchen/bathroom/laundry/garage counter with a wall outlet.",Great Concept - Poor Execution
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Dec 2019,RC,"Or works as I had hoped it would. As many have said, the sound quality in not why you get a flex. You get one of these if you want to add a night light or a motion detector of which I have one of each. Was extremely easy to setup and use. One issue I had is that I had to use the voice command to change the wake word as it never allowed me to change it via the device configuration. I have also noticed that it has a harder time understand some commands. I have a Kevo lock and told it to unlock the door and it said, Ok, locking front door. I suspect this is due to the fact it only has two mics. So far I have dots, echos, Fire cubes, dash and echo auto. They all have their pros and cons. This new flex is another echo that fits in the echo line and has a place. I use several routines and look forward to the continued growth of the ecosystem.",Simple Setup and works nicely. Don’t buy it for listening to music.

I connect via Bluetooth. This is compact and offers a USB port which helps to keep the outlet useful. Physically very satisfied with it. However, it's ""hearing"" was supbar. And I'm comparing this to Echo Dots (2nd and 3rd Gen) which I have and wanted to replace with this. It seemed to need everything repeated twice, almost like the first time to wake it and the second time to execute something. I had to speak louder as well. It really was enough of a step down to be aggravating. I sent the two that I purchased back and am using the Gen 2 dot that I already had and upgraded one to a Gen 3.  Both are far superior in function It's too bad, I really liked the idea of these when I saw them.",Perfect device but poor results

I purchased the night light to go in a guest bathroom and it's a great addition!  Love that the night light can change colors by just telling Alexa to change it!  Also able to tell the unit when to turn on and off the night light.  The unit gives all the benefits of the larger Echo or big brother Dot.  The sound quality is lacking in comparison to the larger units but that just makes sense since it's a very compact unit.

This little thing is pretty good. I have every echo released thus far, starting with being a beta purchaser for the original echo, so I had to have this little guy for my collection. I placed this in my guest bathroom and it's perfect for quick responses, listening to music, news, etc while using the facilities! The sound coming from this is probably compared to the original echo Dot or less. It definitely can be heard easily but don't be expect to be blown away if you are a audiophile. The Alexa response needs some work but it eventually responds while the music is playing. I originally made this purchase during the holidays for one of the upcoming parties. We had music playing through out the house with the connected echoes and so this was available in the restroom to continue hearing the festive music. Needless to say, it was a big hit with the guest and several purchased one afterward to use likewise. I love it for what I use it for daily because it's just as convenient but out of sight.

Also if you thinking about putting an outlet and using the outlet above it, you may want to think about adding a TP link extension ac plug. The thing is is that it sets off the wall and if you’re gonna plug it into the bottom part of your plug if you wanted to plug-in perhaps a blow dryer in the bathroom you won’t be able to without the extension.. Something to think about. The cool thing is that the nightlight can be set up on the Alexa to be turned on and off. My GF does not like light at night but it is motion sensitive so it’ll turn on if you walk in the room.

Priest,"I found this device at a significantly reduced introductory price during the holidays and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm very pleased that I did... I'm using this in my bedroom to add additional voice control.  First, the device plugs directly into the wall, meaning it's out of the way with no troublesome wires or power adapters to deal with.  The device has the ability to connect to Bluetooth speakers, or can attach directly to a speaker input using an audio cable.  In addition, the device has a built-in speaker that's more than adequate for voice response.  I previously purchased a couple of the Echo Input devices, which I've been quite happy with, but actually this device is much more capable, more responsive and even easier to set up and use.  I will likely buy more of these in the future.","Perfect, unobtrusive and easy to implement Echo add-on"

They're deployed in the kitchen and garage. For use anywhere else, one has to be aware that neither the microphones not the speaker is any good. Yes you can connect via Bluetooth or 3.5mm to external speakers but the mic problem remains.

I could scream as load as I can and it doesn't respond. The echo devices in the other rooms through multiple doors do though. Had to change wake word to echo so my other devices don't respond. Turn off the shower and it works better. Still not good but, better. Also have been having problems with it dropping the wifi. I have to unplug and plug back in the get it to reconnect.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,Vance,"I bought this to supplement my echo dot in the living room that had a tough time hearing me if it was a noisy kitchen or if we were in the other rooms. Nice idea, all in one unit so it get plugged in and that's it. The speaker is underwhelming though. When you max it out, you feel like it'll blow the speaker because you get that ""buzz"" during speech or music bass. So much that thankfully I already had a bluetooth speaker wall mounted so I paired it with that, otherwise I would have returned it if I paid full price. I tried this out during the lightning deal (thank goodness). This also doesn't hear as well as the echo dots. I find it misunderstanding my command more and I again rely on the paired speaker. Maybe the placement could be better but the avg house has outlets that aren't above waist level or in a predominantly silent room so I would imagine the everyday practicality of this is not great. Biggest plus for me is the all in one plug into the outlet and that's it. No wires. Would I buy it again? Not at full price. Half price? Maybe but hesitant.",speaker quality and loudness is lacking
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jul 2020,RichandFamous,"Obviously the sound quality is low on the flex. It isn't large enough for a decent speaker. If that is important, get a regular echo. I knew that going in and expected to connect it with a bluetooth speaker. What I didn't expect is how bad the microphone is - nowhere near the sensitivity or usefulness of a dot, even. If music is playing on the external speaker (which works fine, by the way), the flex doesn't register its wakeup word, so you end up shouting Alexa over and over again. You have to be right up on it before it registers that you are calling it.  Very annoying, especially when it is the kids in the pool screaming it repeatedly. They won't even use the flex for that reason and they loved the echo that was outside before it died. I may keep it for something else, but it is a let down and I wouldn't recommend...",Alexa. Alexa!

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2020,Neil,"We have 5+ Echo devices scattered around the house. We didn't have one in the foyer and were shutting off lights on the way out the door by yelling into the kitchen. It worked, but for $12 on sale, I figured I'd give this little guy a try in a nearby outlet. It's small and relatively unobtrusive. There are two issues we are having. 1) Its tiny speaker is very tinny and not very good. Loud enough, but underwhelming it all other ways. Asking Alexa for the weather is audible but honestly grading on the ears. Compared to the Dots we have, this is inferior sounding. In one of our bathrooms we just used 3M Command Strips to attach a Dot next to an outlet. This works very well and sounds way better. 2) The mic must be way more sensitive on this unit because when we're in the kitchen where we have an Echo Show 8, half the time we ask Alexa for something, she responds from the foyer 15' away. This messes with kitchen timers, alarms and in general, just makes the setup a bit frustrating. I gave up and unplugged the unit. I'll likely put it in the garage instead where audio quality (for us) isn't a priority. Again, for the price, especially when it's not on sale, I'd recommend the Dot and a 3rd party outlet mount or some Command Strips.",Spend just a bit more and get an Echo Dot

Living in a two-story house with an office in the basement, I wanted to get Echoes on each floor to take advantage of the drop-in feature to save me from yelling up or down the stairs.  My daughter already had a Kids Echo Dot in her room, and I bought a regular Dot for when my wife is in the office, and with this in the kitchen on the main floor, they all work great together. As for music, yeah, the audio quality on the Flex is pretty crummy, but it easily paired with my JBL Flip Bluetooth speaker. I like not having to fiddle with my phone to turn on music in the kitchen now, especially with wet hands while washing dishes, and the Flex has enough range to allow me to take the speaker into the backyard.

I did not wish to buy a dot or tower within this steamy atmosphere for worry it would damage it ... but the flex is perfect.. It is not very loud and does not stream music..it does enough to please this gal..And if you wish a speaker can solve the loudness.. when it can stream music that will be a consideration.. but for 9.99 and a smart plug ..this gal got a two for one great deal..

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2020,Steve Lawrence,"I bought this to accompany my 'dot' - which sits in the living room. I had originally thought I'd put it in the bathroom and have it play radio or stuff while I was in the shower. Sadly - but in all fairness it *does* say on the description.... but slyly in the 'small print at the bottom' - this isn't a very good speaker. It's not. The speaker is awful. Tinny, lacking volume.. entirely unsuitable for plugging into and putting in the bathroom to listen to while showering. Oh well! I got it with the 'night light' attachment too. Fabulous! Now I can put it somewhere else. Maybe in the corridor? Maybe in the kitchen. Maybe in the basement? I tried all three of these. But it wasn't until I had put it in the basement and was demonstrating to the wife how the 'drop-in' function works that I discovered its true power. This thing picks up voices *exceptionally* well.

Of course, it also works great for streaming music if you pair it with an external speaker, which is what I did in my garage workshop.  I gave it a 5-star rating for sound quality because the audio matches the quality as described by Amazon (actually it sounds a little better than I expected).  Also, because of it's small plug-in module design, it makes it very convenient to add Alexa support to a location in your home where placing an Echo Dot would be difficult since all you need is access to an outlet and no table, shelf, or mounting bracket is required.

You don't buy this particular device for the sound. Yes the sound works just fine for asking questions but it doesn't sound that great for music. Still works fine for music just don't expect big deep sound. If you want something that sounds better get a dot or 2nd gen echo. I most definitely wouldn't give this a bad rating based off sound because ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO SOUND GREAT SMH. The attachments for it are great also.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Aug 2020,S PK,"I have 2 of these and use them for music and nightlights.  I bought the USP light, it is really fun, you can tell it to be any color you like.  I mostly like them because I have one in my garage and one in the den.  Whenever you turn on a Bluetooth speaker that is paired with it, it connects automatically and you have amazon music at your command.  The integrated speaker isn't qualified to play music, but it does work well for the voice commands.  The range of the Bluetooth signal is good, I can take my Bluetooth speakers quite a ways into my backyard with no loss of signal from the flex in my garage.  The night light can be programmed with a schedule but it defaults to  on at dusk off at dawn when you first plug it in.","does exactly what it is supposed to, no fuss"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jul 2020,Jake W.,"As I got more smart home products, I wanted to make sure that users could control those products from every room. Many other smart speakers really weren't good for this, as they're either too big, too expensive, or add more annoying wires to trip over. This form factor is great, since it just takes a little space around the outlet, with no wires. If you can get it at discount, it might even be cheaper than installing new smart switches in every room. My only complaint is that sometimes, the microphone is *too* sensitive. It will hear me say ""alexa"" from a few rooms down, but it's so far away, that the rest of my sentence will be too faint for it, and it will misunderstand me.","Great, inexpensive way to make your whole home smart"
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Aug 2020,DRE,"So I mainly bought these to be able to use the intercom function to be able to talk to my kids in their room. The setup was super easy and the echo flex hears me fairly well although not the best out of all echos. The problem is the volume is soo low. I can barely hear them and they can barely hear me. If it's super quiet, it's not a problem but if a tv is on or anything then it will be harder to hear. If you are buying these for anything other than intercom they are pretty good. Allows you to have Alexa anywhere in the house especially in dead areas or even out in your patio. Music is even ok on them. I have not used to night light or the sensor so I cannot comment on those. Overall they are great and inexpensive. I just wish I could turn up the volume for the intercom higher. Hope this helps",Not my favorite echo product but works

It was not intended to have great music quality, so i wont go there, I was impressed that it is loud enough to hear in our dinning room over normal voices.

I was under the impression that it would just work without smart stuff , so anyways I received product after I found out you had to have smart WiFi bulb I went and purchased one at my local hardware store and came back home and put bulb in on my lamp and I loved it , the bulb was 20.00 bucks , the echo flex had hard time hooking up to bulb it say on bulb it only supports 2.4GHz but I got to hookup to 5g so anyways the echo flex sound quality sucks , it’s really low , I’m used to echo dot , but it does work light bulb really well and that’s all we use it for is our smart WiFi stuff",Ok
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jun 2020,Bigstuff,"I was originally looking for a simple bluetooth receiver to allow me to stream to an old set of speakers that I like but aren't bluetooth.  There are options from Logitech and others, but reading the reviews there were a lot of complaints about the reliability and the ease of connecting/disconnecting when needed.  These items are $22-$25.  So I looked at a Dot which is more expensive but also more useful at $39 (but currently on sale as a 2-for).  Then I saw the Flex, which I didn't even know existed.  Only $25, and also on a 2-for deal (2 for $35 when I got them).  I read the reviews and the main complaint was that the speaker quality was poor.  Amazon clearly states (now) on the Flex item page that it is not intended as music speaker, and if that's what you want plug better speakers in via 3.5mm jack.  That's what I was going to do anyway.  And it works great!  Pairing with my iPhone took about 5 seconds, and I was streaming to the speakers immediately.  With the deal and a sale on a refurb, I got 3 of these to enable me to stream to the older receivers and powered speakers that are not wi-fi or bluetooth enabled.  It's great.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2020,bookpoodah,"I use this mainly as a news radio beside my bed. I rated the sound quality 3 stars, but, for me, it's 5 stars. For music lovers, it's not so great. But the narrow frequency range makes voices much more understandable (I can even understand BBC News now!), and it doesn't bother my wife as a more full-bodied speaker does. A minor downside is that the voice recognition is not as good as that of my Echo Dot. Occasionally I have to tell it twice what I want. I guess that's because of a smaller and less efficient microphone. I wrote a sleep timer routine for it that gradually lowers the volume before turning off. That way, there is no abrupt shut-off to wake me up. If all you want in a given area is control, the Flex is a better price than the Dot.",Perfect for the job.

My sole purpose in buying them was to extend my voice command capabilities throughout the house. Having already downloaded the Alexa app to use my other devices, the Flex units were immediately recognized. When you buy them here, there is an option to add them to your account and I did. So, when I plugged them in, my app picked them up and added them. It took less than 2minutes to be up and going.  They work well for what I need them for, voice commands to power light, cameras, etc. You can ask her questions, like ""How many quarts in a gallon"" and she will answer. However, if you plan to use it for playing music, such as on Spotify, Amazon, Pandora, etc, you may want to go ahead and purchase an echo. It almost sounds like an old portable FM radio when you play music. But, I don't think they were made for streaming music.  They are small and fit nicely in one outlet leaving the other one open to use. There is a convenient USB port on the unit to make up fo the outlet you are using.

If you want to use this for music, there is a ""line out"" plug that allows you to connect to external speakers.  For the price, this worked way better than expected.

Its pretty annoying when that happens.  It can take a while before I am able to use it again. Again the other Echo dots have no issues at all.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2020,Sam,"Works as expected. We were looking for an inexpensive way to bring Alexa functionality into the bathroom without cords or having to find a place to setup another Echo Dot. The Echo Dot achieves this goal. Alexa functionality is great and you are able to use this for all the features you’d expect from an Alexa enabled device. Sound quality isn’t great. But hey, that’s to be expected when you’re trying to fit so much into such a small package for such a great price. We have a Bluetooth enabled Bose speaker in the bathroom for listening to music. The Echo Flex pairs perfectly with the Bose speaker, making the built-in sound quality of the Flex irrelevant in my case. The built in sound quality is definitely sufficient for understanding what Alexa is saying and for using the device. It’s just lacking in sound quality when trying to play music through the built in speakers. I would definitely recommend the Echo Flex for people looking to add Alexa to a small room where an Echo dot would be less practical.","Great for small rooms, with no room for Echo Dot."

When reading the review before my purchase I saw someone said it sounds like a little radio, that would be an accurate description. But for me it works just fine if I want low music in the background or sleepy time white noise. I’ve tried playing audiobooks on a louder setting and I think the sound quality was pretty crisp for a small radio, it’s definitely not like a BOSE SoundLink.

It cuts me off when it thinks it's heard enough, and starts responding with some bulls*** that it thinks it's heard me ask for. I've listened to the activity recordings, and it literally cuts off part of my question or statement before deciding to answer me. And it's about 90% of the time wrong.

Obviously you don’t get an echo flex to listen music, but I use it to trigger a smart routine verbally with another echo device, to play music on every echos in the house when I get home from work. It’s a nice way to end the day. To make this device better, I wish they would add a temperature and humidity sensor.  Otherwise it’s a perfect addition to add to a smart home that has a lot of Alexa devices already.",Great addition to a smart home based on Alexa devices.

I tried using a USB extension cable, shortest 3ft, it would work for a few days, then you would have to disconnect the ECHO FLEX from the wall to get it going again.

It's smaller and sleeker than the mounted Dot it replaces. and I really like the fact that you can just plug it in without having to get a third-party mount. I plan on adding one of these things to my bathroom, plugging my Apple Watch charger into the USB Port. I can see this as being good for putting an Echo device in places where there is no counter space, like laundry rooms, garages, hallways, or where you want to hide an Echo-device.

I bought the flex , plugged the speaker cord into the Flex’s jack and voila, Bob’s your uncle! The speaker is fine for typical Alexa conversation, just mediocre  for music and it has no problem understanding me from anywhere in the studio.

It's important to not install Flex in a plug behind something or have items in front of it (b/c it may interfere with Alexa's listening capability). Echo Flex is small and - without an extension, like a motion detector - allows access to the other outlet. The speaker is tiny, of course, and the sound quality is rather ""tin""-ee, but that's to be expected with such a small speaker.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2020,B. J. Turk,"I own an Echo, 3 Echo Dots, a pre-release Echo Auto, and two Echo Flex devices, so I can speak from a breadth of experience with audio-only Echo devices. But for two issues, this could replace an Echo Dot: 1. Audio quality is not nearly as good. Even though it is clearly noted as not being optimized for music, the sound is a bit tinny. It also seems somewhat less clear. I have had to ask it questions more than once because the first answer was not clear enough to be readily understood. 2. It seems less likely to clearly understand commands. This may be because the outlet into which I've plugged it is close to the floor. Still, most outlets are close to the floor, so it should have been designed to be more sensitive due to the likelihood that it wouldn't sit as high as a counter or tabletop, and therefore would be more likely to be obstructed. I would not use an Echo Flex where there was much noise. Also, it will work better if placed higher than your typical wall outlet. It might be useful in a bathroom, since you wouldn't necessarily have counter space for an Echo or Dot. However, if you like music when you shower, you're better off pairing a Bluetooth speaker to an Echo device than to use a Flex.","Much less than merely ""not a Dot"""

I already owned a dot, so I use Alexa quite often (mostly for music).  The speaker on the device itself is not great, but I never use it so it's no big deal.  I leave the Flex always connected to the sound bar, but I experience a weird issue where I have to reset my speaker after a week or two because the Flex refuses to reconnect to it.  It sounds to me like a speaker problem rather than a Flex problem, but just be aware that some speakers do not like to play nice.  My only real complaint is that I have to say Alexa multiple times for it to hear me, whereas a dot can hear me whisper from across the room with no issues.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2020,Robert Drazich,"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Aug 2020,Christina,"I was so excited to see this Echo device at a $20 +/- price point.  It meant that I could extend coverage throughout my home.  Although I am normally a huge fan of Amazon and the Echo products, this is extremely disappointing.  After two weeks of struggling...I felt I owed others an honest review. The sound quality is very poor.  I was actually willing to let that go, accepting that it could be reasonable for the price I paid.  I just grabbed the good BT speakers I had sitting around and paired them to my Mini's.  When connected, the speaker sound is good because I have very good speakers...but the Mini still sends garbled audio to the speakers when Alexa is talking.  Another problem is that the Mini drops the connection a lot. Integration with Alexa is somewhat dicey.  I have Dots, Alexa on my phone and laptop and have used the Invoke for years...so I know what to reasonably expect.  With the Mini, I can say ""turn off bedroom light"" get the response, ""I can't find a device called bedroom light,"" *immediately* repeat the command verbatim (""turn off bedroom light"") and have the Mini say ""OK"" and turn off the light.  This type of burp is common. I experience inconsistent availability.  I will say ""Alexa"" and it may be a number of seconds until she ""listens"" (the listening sound is also flaky, so I've learned not only to wait for the sound but look at the LED) or she will not start listening at all.  I may have to say ""Alexa"" a few times...  A few times, I've just given up and gone on my laptop or phone. I'm experienced with these devices.  I've had the Invoke and Dot in the same location with no problems.  I also have a mesh network and routers in every room that has a Mini...my network is strong (I also have smart TVs and experience no lag in streaming...) and I have these devices identified as ""priority"" in the network configuration (so nothing else on the router will be using more bandwidth). Which brings me to the last thing that jumps to mind...  The ""listening sound"" is inconsistent.  Sometimes it bonks, sometimes it doesn't.  The the Mini is not in eyesight where you can check for the LED, you just have to guess whether or not the Mini is ready.  Really an irritation. To be honest, I would love to pack up all the Mini's and return them with the light accessory I purchased (the cost of the Mini and light are the same as one Dot).  I would immediately buy Dots to replace them.  But I was so excited when they arrived that I threw away the packaging.  DUH!  A newbie mistake by someone who should know better!  So I guess I'm sadly stuck with them.  😢",Not worth the money...Buy a Dot for $20 more.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jan 2020,Physics Girl,"The Echo Flex has been a nice addition to our household, which already included a 3rd gen Echo Dot and an Echo Input. I got it primarily to add a motion sensor to our living room, and it lives up to its promise for that application. When paired with the motion sensor, it's a cheap upgrade to the little bit of home security offered by Alexa Guard. I was able to create a routine that sends me an alert on my phone when motion is detected as well as turning on lights and blaring an alarm sound from the speakers connected to my Input. It's easy enough to enable this routine from my phone when leaving and disable it when I get home. The Flex has also been handy for night time routines that automatically turn off living room lights when no one is moving around but turn on a very dim light for a few minutes when motion is detected. Setup was effortless, and the build quality is impressive for such a cheap device. The Flex gets a fair amount of use as an intercom, allowing us to drop in on each other when on different levels of the house. The built-in speaker quality is pretty terrible, but Amazon is upfront about Flex's limitations in this regard, and it's adequate for use as an intercom, checking the weather and news, and getting responses from Alexa. The Flex paired readily with my UE Roll 2 over Bluetooth and also includes an aux out port. Indeed, I find myself grabbing it to bring to the bathroom to control podcasts and music played over my waterproof Roll while enjoying a soak in the tub. I've found so many more uses for this gizmo than I anticipated, and I'd give it a hearty five star endorsement and suggest it replace the Input for most users if it weren't for one factor: the microphones. The change to two far field microphones from the four on the Dot and Input has handicapped the Flex. It picks up the wake word and commands just fine in a quiet bathroom a few feet away from the tub, but performance suffers greatly if there is noise or in a bigger room. In sharp contrast to my experiences with the Dot and Flex, I find myself having to raise my voice and frequently repeat myself when Alexa can't understand the first time. My husband, who has some speech impediments, finds the Flex so frustrating he would like me to get a different device for the living room and relegate the Flex to motion detection only, its microphone switched off.","Makes my smart home smarter when paired with motion detector, but microphones need improvement."

It's hard to get it to understand me if there's too much ambient noise. It's still usable, just frustrating. I do like the attachment for the night light. I wish the nightlight I found had motion detection. Coincidentally, you can get a motion detector, but you have to choose. Currently it's only one or the other.

I expected there to be a tradeoff in sound quality due to the small size, but since I mostly use it with an external bluetooth speaker, this is not a problem for me.  However, one thing I did not expect is that the microphone that picks up your speaking voice also seems to be less sophisticated than the Echo Dot.

It kind of jumps around a little bit on volume on its own. But it’s a great little device that does all that Alexa is enabled to do for our household and more skills to come. I love how easy it is to just unplug it and plug it in anywhere else and within seconds she’s ready.,I love Alexa but flex has a bit of volume trouble

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2020,Jim from Boston,"I use the Flex with the optional night light, and am very happy with it.  It illuminates the upstairs hallway at night, and I like the ability to change colors by voice, or routines.  As expected, the speaker is small so I do not use it for music, but do use it for sports score updates, weather, time, voice commands to other smart home devices including an air conditioner.  The location at the top of the stairs could only be served by the Flex, the larger devices would not be feasible.  I have other Echo devices with better speakers when I want to listen to music, or streaming radio.  I have no complaints with the sound as I knew beforehand it was not designed for music.  I have purchased a second Flex, and am experimenting with the optional motion sensor.  Looking forward to additional accessories.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jun 2020,Anthony B.,"Product is easy to use if you have used experience with Echo's.  When I plugged my new Echo flex(s) in Alexa came on and said it was finding the product, it then said to go to my Alexa app and follow the on screen directions. That never happened. Having used this type of product before I just pushed the Set-up button until the orange light flashed and it did its thing. If this is your first product it might be a bit confusing. I purchased two of the units, I installed one in my garage and used the 3.5 jack to an older stereo that i have on hand. Now I have the ability to play Pandora on my 1980 garage stereo.  I used the other one in my master bathroom,  We had installed a Bluetooth exhaust fan which you had to connect every time you wanted to use it. not convenient.  The Echo Flex stays connected to the speaker and now no matter how short the visit i can play music, get traffic, time you get the idea. $25 bucks seems a bit steep for what it is but home automation is what it is and Mr. Besos is trying for that Trillionaire status.

Or internet goes out you have to reset my whole house. Including every light. Which is strange because I can turn on and off light from my echo show and from the light app but the flexs seem to have a problem with getting back on task if Interrupted even slightly.

The sound and the volume are very muted compared to my old dot (V2). The advantage of the flex is the shape, rectangle, not round and it plug right into the outlet, no USB plug and then cable, which just added clutter.

I wanted to have an echo device when I go downstairs to the basement for just having a little background music or news or perhaps to look up something.  The echo flex appears to have only two microphones as opposed to multiple microphones around the perimeter of the dot and the echo.  As a result you have to be fairly close to the flex to have it picked up your voice. The built-in speaker is very small so naturally it  does not have a lot of volume or sound quality. Fortunately it does have a USB jack and a stereo mini jack for output.  By combining the echo flex with an  external speaker by Meetue  also sold by Amazon, that makes up for the lack of volume and sound clarity coming from the device. For less  than the cost of an Echo Dot you have a pretty workable system that sounds pretty good.  The speech recognition probably works as well as the larger echoes but the lack of the additional microphones forces you to be facing the device and be closer to it which Impacts its speech recognition.",The echo flex does a very good job if it is combined with an external amplified speaker.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 May 2020,Los Angeles Windows,"My Echo 2nd gen. is hooked up to my stereo via 3.5mm to RCA connectors. I play Amazon music on the Echo and it streams through my home's stereo system. The Flex cannot be connected via RCA, unless you are ok with hearing a hum in the speakers. Amazon sent me a 2nd Flex and it had the same issue so it is most likely a flawed design with a grounding issue causing the hum. My bluetooth speaker has a 3.5 mm input and hooking up through that input works fine. Another design negative is that if Echo or Flex are hooked up to a stereo, their apps audio settings for bass, mids and treble won't alter the music tone. Only when music is playing through the Echo devices internal speaker, can the tones be adjusted using the app. I'm not sure that the app integration is the best.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Nov 2019,Ben Pflieger,"I really love this product. I got this, plus the motion sensor, for my home office. I have an old home and the room I use as an office has no light switch and the outlets are not near the door in any way, meaning you need to walk through the room to turn on any of the lamps. I already have a Feit Smart Bulb in one lamp and with the Flex and the motion sensor, I was able to easily set a routine for the light to turn on when I enter the room and then turn off after a set amount of time when no motion is detected. Additionally, I can use voice commands on the Flex to change the color, dim, turn it off, etc. At times, the motion sensor works better than others, but overall, it works wonderfully. The sound quality on the Flex is nothing great and I would personally not use it as a speaker to play music. I truly see this device as just being a great way to give voice control to areas in your home where you don't need/want a different Echo device, or to have very affordable motion sensing capabilities.",Great Addition to a Smart Home
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2020,Laura Killian,I love the mini Alexa! I bought it for my 13 year old son's room as he is alone sometimes when I work late. it is perfect for me to get him to answer when he is too busy on YouTube and he cannot hear the main Alexa in the kitchen. All I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go I have not played music on it but I have done relaxing sounds like rainfall and it sounded very clear and soothing. I just bought another one for my room as my kids sometimes likes to be in my room so I can get in touch with him when I need to and he's at the house by himself. You can never have too much technology to keep an eye on your kid.,Great way to keep in touch with teens and latchkey kids.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2020,Jim.Moor,"Pros: Excellent voice recognition No cord Able to use usb for sensor, etc Sensor unit has 2 level sensitivity Cons: Cheaper sensors available that can point, this combo is more expensive if only sensor is needed. Limited to where you have outlets Not able to prioritize 2nd Alexa in same room, since this is so sensitive it tries to take over whole room. Big & clunky Sensor not aim-able (see pic of card taped to block an area), also note that microphone is disabled. Takeaway: Dot is more versatile, better sound by far.

I just wish I could turn off the red LED, as every time I see it, I think, ""Uh oh... something is wrong!"" then I remember it's just muted.  I guess you can't have it all.

With this, Alexa can hear me all downstairs allowing me to set timers, drop in or play music from my speaker without having to yell.

Bottom line is- it works and sounds as would expect a small device to. I read a lot of reviews of people who purchased the Echo Flex and didn't think the sound quality was up to par of other Echo devices (no way! really?! *gasp*) -If you're looking for Bose quality sound to come out of this thing, your expectations are way too high. If you're expecting Echo Dot sound quality to come out of this thing... AGAIN- your expectations are way too high. This thing sounds as I expected, like an intercom speaker, it is all treble and almost no bass at all. HOWEVER- you can connect an external speaker to it via the 3.5mm audio jack.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Sep 2020,Marine2Soldier,"This item has minimal range as it pertains to distance from the router and the primary Alexa device.  Walls and objects like empty boxes easily disrupt it.  Not to mention, when playing music on these devices, the sound level is so low, you are better off playing your Alexa device in one room and while in another location.  The connection gets continuously lost, and you have to re-establish it by bringing it back to the primary Alexa device again.  The initial connection process leaves much to be desired.  The directions are not as straightforward as it can be.  Even the customer service told me to disregard them as they walked me through them.  My advice is if you are going to purchase one of these, purchase one at a time until you see how it works for you.  Please do not do like I did buy four of them, and be stuck all four wall plugs.  I would go with the Echo Dot, the connectivity range is much better, and the sound coverage and quality are much clearer, crisper and further.",Very Poor Design and Concept

I solved this by changing its wake word but it would be great to have this pick issue corrected (same problem upstairs with my other Show and Echo v2 btw).

As other reviewers have stated, the internal speaker is really bad, somewhat reminiscent of the old portable transistor radios of the 60s, but if you pair this with a good Bluetooth speaker, you'll be really happy.

Why I bot this and not the echo dot: -I bought this device because it was under $20 that was the main reason the other reason was because it plugged directly into the wall and it had the option to purchase a nightlight attachment. I like the fact that echo has the ability to drop in two different devices throughout the home if I want to announce some thing I can announce it to every device in the house I like that feature and this was a way to put one in the man cave so I can call my husband down when I need him. My husband is also horrible at keeping his phone charged so because he spends all his time in the man cave I can call him on the device if I need him. Pros: -Having an Alexa device in another room of the house at a very very affordable price all the benefits of Alexa Low price - love the night light attachment - It plugs directly into the wall -I have a ring doorbell this device let my husband know someone is at the door when he is up in his man cave Cons: Horrible sound quality I don’t know if it’s my device or the device period.

I find the phone and told Alexa to hang up the phone but Echo Flex said we aren't on a call to hang up.  I had to go back into the room where I originally said the command and ask it to hang up again.  If that's how they work then what's the point?  Might as well just get echo dots which have much better audio than the flex.,Can't finish a task using 2 different audio inputs
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Aug 2020,Shauna Miller,"I was a little worried about the reviews saying the sound is terrible, but there was a $10 off code so I figured for $15 I couldn't really go wrong. And the sound is just fine. I don't know if other people got defective ones or what, but the sound is what you'd expect from a device like this. It's not quite as rich, full, and loud as the echo dot, but if you aren't getting it primarily to play music, it's a good product. And I haven't played with it much yet, but it seems like it's responding to the wake word and my commands more quickly than my echo dots and echo shows.",Sound is good

I like that this is small and goes right in the outlet so that I don't have to have a dot sitting around taking up space. Certainly, you wouldn't want to listen to music through this, but that's not what it's for. It was SUPER easy to set up too.

I moved that hot garbage into the trash can and 1-stared it as quick as I could. Then I found this for $10 on prime day.  I plugged this into my car's 120v outlet and wired the audio into the car stereo.  With the hotspot on my phone I can now stream and use Alexa in the car!  It is game changing. My only wish is they made a version that supported bluetooth tethering. Why they didn't built the echo auto to do this in the first place is beyond me...,What the garbage Echo auto wished it could be when it grows up!  Think outside the box.

I can unplug it from my bathroom and plug it in my garage (my wifi extends there). It works AMAZINGLY WELL. Worth every freaking nickel. Grab one before they sell out. I am not kidding y'all.

However, since my lights, TV, microwave, car audio, etc etc is smart I had one so I didn't have to relay on my phone or yell to reach Alexa in the living room.  I replaced my kitchen Echo Dot with a Flex and couldn't be happier. This is perfect for Alexa based functions and simple weather, traffic, or google type information.  Plugs right into the kitchen wall counter outlet so there is no cords.  I also use mine for a cooking timer.  If you utilize Amazon/Alexa I highly recommend getting at least one.",Smart buy.

I have other echos, echo dots and Sonos for those purposes.  I intend to purchase a few more to continue to fill gaps to reduce the amount of yelling I need to do to reach echos.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2020,Brian Choi,"This is basically the Echo Dot with very very bad mic and worse speaker.  Yes you can get bluetooth speaker and pair it but at that point, it's just better to buy the dot for $10 more.  Also the bluetooth speaker keeps getting dropped and have to pair again frequently. Mic is so bad that drop-in calls are like talking into cheap radio.  Doesn't even recognize over few feet away so you have to yell... which defeats the purpose of drop-in.  And when you yell, Echo dot in other rooms actually respond before this thing does. It's really bad that there's no way to adjust mic and speaker volume separately.","Bad mic, bad speaker"

It probably has the most sensitive mics out of all of the Alexa enabled devices that I own (there's one in every room). It isn't uncommon for this device to respond from upstairs when I'm speaking in my living room a few feet away from a closer unit. The sound quality on this one isn't great, but it gets the job done for it's intended area.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2020,TheBigIke,"I have Echo's all over the house and wanted to use the Flex in the kitchen because of its nice design.  Unfortunately the Flex doesn't hear or pickup our voice when more than 4 feet away and instead the Dot in the living room responds. There's also an issue when connected to Bluetooth and someone tries to ""drop-in"" to the Flex. It annoyingly constantly disconnects and connects to Bluetooth for a few minutes after someone tries to drop in. The Flex is good to fill spots in the house that are rarely used but isn't good for areas that'll have high usage such as the kitchen - unless you're always planing to stand right in front of the device when activating it.","Great design, poor voice recognition"

I already have the Echo in the master bath for listening to music (absolutely love it). I didn't have one in the bedroom because I didn't have the space for it. This tiny little Flex serves the purpose. I specifically use it to turn on/off bedroom light and to get the weather forecast. You can still use it for music, but it doesn't compare to the Echo or the Echo Show - so I don't use it for that. It is small and doesn't take up much space on the plug - you can still access the other outlet (but only of of the two USB ports).

I use mine inside of a bathroom vanity cabinet and it's a neat solution. The only downside is that you sacrafice almost all of your audio quality.

I have two echo dots and now two echos flexes. The echo dot are good like for in my kitchen and bedroom especially playing music and asking it to do everyday things. The echo flex's strongpoint is hallways and in bathrooms. I think it is great for places that an echo dot isnt good for. It is small, and the night light attachment is wonderful. I use Alexa as the wake work for my echo dots and Echo as the wake word for both flexes. It helps with only waking one device instead of two. My echo flex can do everything my dot can just with a smaller speaker and such. When I walk to the kitchen I ask my hallway flex to turn on the kitchen smart bulbs, and when I walk out I tell her to turn them off. It is the perfect sidekick to the echo dot to me, and I highly recommend it. It beats having to buy a wallmount for an echo dot to do what the flex can do. As I said definitely recommend this for those inconvenient areas for the echo dot. My house gets smarter every day! Haha",Very useful for smaller echo dot.

If I hadn't gotten it and saved it to give for a Christmas gift it would be returned, but as it is, I am past the return window. GARBAGE!!","Wow...just, wow..."
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2020,Vitus Yuen,"If you want to have access to Alexa, but are tight on counter space then the Echo Flex is your goto item. All you need is an electric socket (suggest about 4' above the ground) and it's slim enough that it will not cover the second outlet. I have mind in our laundry room where counter space is a commodity; Echo Flex sits on the wall and out of the way. The sound quality is not great for music, but the list of available attachments from motion sensor, USB charging port, etc and everything Alexa, makes up for it. I'm very happy with the Echo Flex and would recommend it to anyone who want's access to Alexa but don't have the space for the standard Echo.",Don't have the space.. there's a Echo for that.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2020,Jay,"I also have an Echo Connect, so that I can use the Amazon Echo to call emergency services. So, I have an Amazon Echo all throughout my home, and I just recently had an incident where I needed an ambulance. It was nice to have an ambulance to my home within 5 minutes, called simply with a smart speaker. However, there was one room that did not have an echo or echo dot in it, so I figured that I should get something to help me in case I need an ambulance again and I if just happen to be in that room. I did not need a full speaker, or even an echo dot, because there is a computer in the room. I just wanted control of my smart home and the ability to make an emergency call. An Echo Flex provides a minimal use speaker in whatever room that you need so you don't have to yell across your house for one of these emergencies.

I like the idea of an echo you simply plug in, however the Echo Flex falls short, and I’m not even discussing the terrible speaker it comes with. I knew about that before I purchased it, and the primary use is in the hallway where sound quality doesn’t matter. This device is buggy. It sometimes drops WiFi where none of my other devices drop. I have 6 Echo Dots and 2 Echo Show 5s in addition to my other devices, phones, computers, TVs, etc, all on my WiFi mesh that covers the whole house. It also has issues integrating with my Alexa/Hue smart home configuration. There are specific rooms setup with lights that it will not control. For example, if I say “Alexa, turn off the basement lights” the Flex will respond with “I don’t know that device.” None of my other Echo dots have any issues with this, just the Flex does.

We opted away from the Dot/Kids Dot as we didn't want the unit within reach for even more distraction (out of sight out of mind mentality) and the Flex direct plug was able to be perfectly hidden in a corner plug behind the bed. For the most part, the voice recognition works just as well as our other devices ... besides the times our son is using his silly voice so totally his fault. As some other reviews mentioned, the speaker isn't as great as other devices, but also wouldn't expect it to be.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2020,RoxBooLu,"Seriously dissatisfied with my Echo Flex. Mine seems to be hard of hearing. I can be as close as 1 foot from it and I still have to talk louder than normal. Audible interaction...Alexa is one chapter behind. I tell her to go to chapter 65 and she goes to chapter 64. Alexa in general is no where near as useful as I had hoped but the Flex is the worst. About the only thing it's good for is to ask what the weather is, temperature, play music (very poor audio).",Echo Flex: Seriously Disappointed! I expect better quality products from Amazon.
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2019,Adam Brooks,"I wanted this to work. I'm not sure if it's this device or something about Amazon software that's buggy. Like some other people have mentioned, the timing in routines doesn't work. I have a 5 minute timer, but it turns off after 2. I haven't continued to troubleshoot, but that's a pretty basic function they should be able to get right.  I bought this to act as a microphone and a motion sensor. I have two different dots mounted in a remote space that feed speakers by where I placed the flex. As is well understood, the speaker on the flex sucks. No problem, except that I want to turn it off. Doesn't seem possible, so now I have to listen to this tinny sounding POS. The form factor seems bigger than it needs to be, this should be 50% smaller.","Good in theory, Amazon has things to work out."

Sometimes her little blue light comes on like she's listening after you say ""Alexa"" but then it immediately turns off. Over and over before she finally actually stays on and listens.

I created a series of routines for her to say ""Alexa, I need help"" for the system to announce ""____ needs assistance"" or if she asks for to contact me in my study. I created another routine for her to contact my phone but haven't really test drive that one very much. Otherwise the units are great for setting reminders, checking time, setting timers, alarms, checking the weather, playing poor sound quality music, listening to NPR. I have no need to order stuff so that feature is ignored. In addition, it alerts me on Amazon apps updates and deliveries. The ""drop in"" feature is a bit muggy but that has to do with sound levels of the units needing to be lower than usually to accommodate our home needs. I opted not use that feature for the com and instead having Alexa say the need for assistance. Most of this stuff like adjusting volume and setting routines required some research from users rather than Amazon itself. One feature I would like is for Alexa to acknowledge when I say thank you.

I also paired it with Sengled light bulb Bluetooth speakers and now they have quality sound without needing to take up limited counter space.

Wouldn't recommend for a primary music player, just because it's so small the sound gets muddled. But as for voice commands, it works just as well as my echo dot.",Super useful! I'm buying another!
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2019,Mai Mai,So I actually like the product. I don't love it. it plugged up to the wall. I didn't have to do much because I have other echo dot's. I use this in the bathroom to turn on the lights. It doesn't offer a volume button like the others. The sound quality sucks! I gave the sound one star. So I use the usb bottom for the phone cord rather than the motion light. But over all it seems to work just as good as my other products. The only thing that is off putting is the shabby speaker they put in it. They should have added a better quality speaker.,Like it not Love it

The Echo Flex is not any louder than a cell phone and is honestly hard to hear in the kitchen with more than 3 family members around. If purchasing for the assistant or as a speaker, buy a google home or an echo dot.

They contacted me after the review to help troubleshoot and then exchanged my flex for a new one. However, after setup and trying different locations in the house, including right next to the wifi router, the new flex is also non-responsive. It goes offline and doesn't come back all of the time and is basically useless. I love all my echo products, but this one just isn't worth it. It is barely responsive even when shouting ""Alexa"" at it, and I end up having to reset it several times a day, and even then it isn't always responsive.

One in the patio/three season room (connected to old PC subwoofer and speakers and synced with utility room flex for indoor/outdoor music).  Full Alexa features in a small box.

The microphones do not seem to pick up my voice nearly as well as the Dots I have around the house.  I tried talking to the Flex from 2 feet away and the Dot more than 20 feet away activated, which is kind of a testament of the mics in the Dot, but not great for the Flex.  I had to get closer to it and speak more quietly for it to work.  It continually frustrates my wife because it will not respond.  The integrated speaker is just too quiet and I have to leave it at max volume to hear it at a normal volume.  Concept is great but in reality it left me wanting more.

By the way the feedback does not exist on the echo show when plugged into the stereo.

It provides a whole new level of convenience for your Alexa/smart home experience by allowing you to extend to rooms that don't necessarily need anything as loud as even an echo dot (ie bathroom). Mine is setup in my bathroom so I can still ask alexa to do things from a room where no other device would normally be able to hear me and with the addition of the motion detector I setup a routine to turn on the bathroom lights when I walk in (not a terrible perc for those bathroom trips in the middle of the night when you wake up).,Absolutely Perfect with the Right Expectations

I bought 3 for several rooms in the house, and I only had to set up voice recognition on only one of them. The music is a little tinny. But, in all fairness, Amazon does tell you that music quality is not the best without an additional speaker plugged into the 35mm Jack, and I didn't buy them strictly to expand listening to music throughout the house. The size of the unit is non-obtrusive and it has a convenient USB port underneath for charging a phone, adding a speaker or one of the optional accessories available for the Flex.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2020,Fan,I love that you can tell Alexa something in a random spot.  (Half the time I want to walking up the stairs which is where this is).  I got the add on night light.  I wish you have it turn in and off with motion rather than just always be on when it gets dark.  Other that that it is exactly what it says it is!

We love using Amazon story time, and we were in a bind when we went to stay with family over the holidays, so I purchased one of these hoping it would work as well as our dots back home. It works alright, but it would go through cycles of repeating the same thing over and over again, or acknowledging a command and then not doing anything with it. Anyways, a little frustrating, but for $12, it still seems like a deal, just not sure if we’ll be using it unless we have to like when we’re traveling for example.",Alexa not the same on this device :(
Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Erwin,"We have echos strewn throughout the house, but one dead area is the dining room. From the dining room, we can access the Echos from the kitchen or living room, but sometimes it was hard to hear since we may forgotten we have turned down the volume. We didn't need another Echo with wires strewn about, so this works well just plugging it into an outlet. It can be included in a speaker group for multi-room music, so that's a plus, even though like many others have mentioned, the speaker is a bit thin and tinny in sound. Overall, it fits that need to have access to an Echo where you may not need it often.",Fills a dead area for us.

But when I'm in another room and trying to talk to my Fire tablet, it somehow hears me all the time. Obviously when I'm talking to my tablet, I want it to open an app. But for some unknown reason, the Flex assumes I must be talking to it even though it's about 40 feet away.

For the price and after reading so many bad reviews, I backed off. With my health, and knowning people who have died or gotten sick with this covid, I gave it more thought. I have one Dot in the front room and one in the bedroom. Paying just $9.99, I now have the Echo Flex in the bathroom. The first thing I did was play music. At its highest volume, I was able to hear he music in the bedroom. It may not have been the crispest of sounds, but I grew up dancing in the yard to the sounds of a transistor radio. The reason for purchase was to have a light above the toilet, but more importantly, to be able to make a phone call if I was to fall and couldn't get up, or in case of other medical emergencies.

I like the idea of having access to Alexa in another room.  The sound quality is just okay and on occasion Alexa doesn't know in which room to respond to me.

Now, no matter what floor I'm on doing something, I can ask Alexa a question or have her turn on a light when I'm coming into a room or add something to my shopping list instead of having to wait until I'm within range of my Echo.

Echo Flex - Plug-in mini smart speaker with Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Feb 2020,That Guy,Oh Alexa how I love thee! It’s a welcome addition to product line. It can fit into places that might not be so convenient for the bulkier Alexa models. The small size combined with that low price tag has got me putting them everywhere in my house. It has all the functionality that you’ve come to expect from Alexa devices. The only con is the small sound. It just doesn’t have the volume of the other devices. I think it’s to be expected for its size. It does have a 3mm port to plug in a auxiliary cord to connect it to other devices as well as Bluetooth support. What I think is neat is that you can purchase two add on accessories to enable this device to have a night light and a motion sensor. All in all I think it’s a great product for the price and the size. It’s a must have. Buy it today!,I love it!

However, the device hears much worse than, for example, an echo dot. Therefore, be prepared to speak louder and more distinctly.

I also observe similar problems in the echo show 5, which also has 2 microphones.

If you like to stream 70s music, like we do, it will bring back happy memories of listening to tunes on your transistor radio. :) I understand there is a Bluetooth option to stream to better quality speaker.

The sound output is very basic, sounds like a cellphone, but for what it's engineered to do it's great.  We use two of them for an audio zone, one in the bathroom to hear commands, and the other in the audio rack plugged into a signal sensing amplifier that turns itself on.  Now, we can just ask for a Pandora station, an amazon station or FM station to play  in this area and it does!

With echodot, you can be facing anywhere, and ask a question.  With flex, you have to be in the line of sight so you maximize the chance of your voice reaching the tiny mic, and if properly listened to, the response coming out won’t be loud enough (echodot is a lot better).
