Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,ZR1205,"I installed this in March 2019. The home was built in 1993 so had the older 10v 5va doorbell transformer.

The Ring Pro requires a 16v 30va transformer. Home Depot and Lowes do not carry them, nor does Ace etc, so ordered one on Amazon. 


Installed the transformer then the Ring Pro. I also have a strong internet wifi at the front door, so was ok with that part.
 I also installed the little square white box Ring Pro provides in the box, that protects the Ring circuit so it doesn't get fried, before I powered everything up. 

Great video and 2 way sound, and setting the motion zones very easy. 

So far, so good, would recommend. Have had it running a couple of weeks now.","Love it, dont forget 16v transformer."

However, as we started to order more items from Amazon Prime it became essential while we are out of the house for work.  It is amazing the items you see happening in front of your own home.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Dec 2019,mikez,"I wanted to not have to have cameras around my house and, in reality, they are probably a bit overkill most of the time. What brought this on is that I had 2 idiots walk up on my porch and try to steal Halloween decorations and a light timer. Grand total of $40 worth of stuff. They were probably neighborhood kids. The simple fact that people came onto our front porch with my family sleeping and the only reason I knew is because I was up late/really, really early spooked me. I travel a bit for work and the added peace of mind this gives both me and my family is worth the investment. Add in the fact that I get alerts when packages are dropped off wherever I am and can converse through the app on my phone and it is even better. I also added 2 ring solar spotlight cameras to the system. Would I rather have spent the money on something else? Yes. Am I happy we have the added peace of mind?

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,KTA1,"Had a few stumbling blocks on the installation.  Scheduled installation during our construction phase of the remodel - and didn't even think we needed WiFi AND electricity.  They were great on delaying the installation until cable and power restored.  Then they discovered we had terrible WiFi signal that needed to be addressed.
Best Buy came thru with some suggestions on how to improve the situation, reviewed what had to be done once signal strength improved if I wanted to finish it myself - which I did but they stopped by next time they were in the area to make sure I din't have any problems.
As for the product itself - not the instant ring and picture you see in the commercials but that maybe an issue of the signal strength and our particular door location and exposure does have its share of being triggered by traffic.  But it does save on answering the door without having the descend all 3 levels to check who is at the door.",KTA1
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Mawaz,"First off, it's so easy to install. Instructions are very easy to follow and all connectors come the box. Follow the height recommendation from the manual!!
You can wire it to an existing bell or buy te Chime to hear the bell inside.
I'd took off my existing doorbell chime and bought and AC transformer to bring power down form 120V to 16V and used the existing wiring to connect de Ring Pro. I think this is an easier installation than wiring it to the old ring bell.
I can answer from anywhere my Ring Pro and talk to the person at the door or gate.

After purchasing a nest doorbell and having lackluster results with video quality and it continually not working we opted to replace with a Ring.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Johnk,"My wife bought this for me to install at our daughters house. First installation was completed in about 15 minutes, but the doorbell never found the Ring network to connect to.. Called tech support and after going over everything determination was the Power Kit which gets installed in the existing doorbell chime was defective. Off to the store to exchange it and got lucky as there was only one left on the shelf. Second installation completed and this time the doorbell found the network and we were able to complete the initial install/setup. With everything set up on her iPhone we were impressed with the adjustable video capture area which helps prevent the doorbell from picking up cars on the street and people on the sidewalk. When she's at home you can hear the slight delay from the time she talks (living room couch isn't far from the front door) until it comes out the speaker on the doorbell, but not a big deal.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,ChicaCT,I've only had this fully installed for a couple of days but thus far I am extremely pleased it gives very good coverage in fact I've had to narrow the search range because it goes off for many things - everything from cars going by to a middle-of-the-night raccoon. The point is it's doing the job that I purchased it for and I'll get more familiar with it as time goes by - I'd rather have too much coverage then not enough! I can only recommend the more expensive hardwired doorbell not the one that goes by battery. Take note that there have been upgrades and this is what was recommended to me and I'm glad that I listened. I did have to switch to a much more expensive internet company because each camera device will take approximately 3 gigs of Upload in order to operate properly. Don't get confused when companies talk MPGs because megabytes have little to do with Gigabytes except that you need approximately 15 for every 1 Gig. It's one thing for downloading if you're a gamer but when you're talking about cameras you need Upload so plan on that. Originally after having difficulty w/my WiFi I purchased an internet booster which still was not going to be enough - when I finally talked with a true expert. I had to switch companies in order to get 150 megabytes to equal 10 gigs approximately.,"Sensitive very good coverage, very pleased!"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,bartonhen,"I frankly don't understand most of the negative reviews. This doorbell has worked great since day 1. I plugged it in and set it up and it almost immediately installed a new version of the firmware (the old version is apparently the cause of most people's issues). It connected to my 5G home network without any issues and there is practically no delay from when the button is pressed to when the app on my S7 let's me know someone is at the door or there is motion. On the first day alone it notified me of motion on my front porch (I was at work) when both the UPS and USPS drivers dropped off packages as they were still there. I had to adjust the motion zones so that it didn't pick up cars driving by but so far it has worked flawlessly. I wanted to get the original Ring but am glad I waited for the smaller, more aesthetically pleasing form factor of the pro version. I guess my only word of caution would be to those that have newer digital doorbells that don't already have a 16V transformer powering them. The doorbell is not compatible with every doorbell chime and it would be worth your while to make sure yours is or you will be returning it to the store.

So easy to install and usage of software. This time, after 3 weeks, it stopped working again. I contacted the support team from Ring (which were very prompt in their response) and after doing all their recommendations, providing photos of installation, checking voltage and WiFi signal they couldn't help me. So now I have a dead Ring Doorbell Pro, no support (they just stop answering my emails) and wasted $200 on this product. I have two other Ring cameras that work perfect. So that's why I said, the Pro doesn't live up to its standards.",The Pro doesn't live up to its standards.

The installation seemed a bit scary at first but once you read the instructions, it’s pretty straightforward. I selected this version over the previous because it is much thinner and I thought it would fit perfectly where my old doorbell was located. Unfortunately I was not that lucky and had to do a bit of modding in order to install. The package had all the tools necessary. I even got Ring to work with all my Echo devices throughout my home which now ring and announces doorbell pushes. The only things that kept this from 5 stars is that a subscription is required if you want to be able to continue recording and saving/sharing video through the app. Also, the sensitivity seems to be hit or miss at times even when you play around with the settings.",Great product

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,NYC101,"I bought the HD version which cost about $249. 

This works really well in the day time and at night. In order to make it work I have to spend about half hour to wire it in. This is not battery operated like the lower model is. 

First I had to replace my current door bell button with the RING button which contains the camera and door bell button. Not too hard at all. Two wires and then screw into the door frame. Next I had to wire a mini transiever to the chime box. Not too bad as it has wire splicers to make it easy. 

Then you use your cellphone to make the final wifi connection. You do need wifi always on to make this work in real time. 

Once that is all done, I can see when my kids get home, the mail man comes, or strangers ring the bell if my kids are home and I am not. 

I c an speak to my kids and visitors anytime they are in front of my door. It works really fast, they ring the bell and my phone rings before the house door bell rings. The. It displays the video. 

Super product. Glad I bought it. Thinking of buying another for the back door.

One more thing, I now pay about 3 dollars a month to have the Ring store all my recorded video. So on my phone I have a complete log that shows both motion and rings at my home. You can set zones for motion. So I know when my mail man comes even if he does not ring the bell.",Better than expected

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Oct 2020,Roger,"The Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a good front door monitoring system. It fit or need to have some sort of watch on our front door and driveway area, as one of our neighbors recently had their car vandalized. The picture quality is great for a device so small (in both dark and light situations) and the installation was simple. The directions were straight forward. The Ring also came packaged with a few different color options for the case that the device is housed in. In addition, the tech support for the Ring was spot on. I had to call because I was having an issue with the chime, and the customer service rep was patient, friendly and helpful . Overall great purchase for some peace of mind. 
The only issue I would say I had with the device is that there seems to be a limit to how much you can modify the area of sensitivity to set off an alert.",Great picture quality for a small doorbell camera

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Rick,"Even after doing research online, I was not prepared for the frustration of trying to get the Ring Pro up and running. 
After following the directions in the box as well the online video, my Ring Pro failed to power up. Called Ring support who were very helpful. Asked if I had a volt meter as low voltage could be the issue. My doorbell was new and was 16V. Did not have volt meter so they said they would send me a Power Cord. Three days later a Ring Chime appeared on my doorstep. Tried to hook that up. No go. Again contacted Ring support and they said I needed the Power cord which arrived about three days later. Hooked that up. This basically bypasses your existing door chime and utilize wifi to connect the Ring Pro to Ring Chime. While the Ring Pro powered up, the Chime did not work. Called support again. After review of the steps I had followed,, they said they would send me a replacement Chime. I was already to return the Ring Pro the day the second Ring Chime arrived. After a few frustrating tries, I was finally able to get the Ring Pro and Ring Chime to work. Suggest Ring just include the Power cord and Chime as part of the original kit and save everyone the hassle of contacting support and having Ring send the Chime and Power cord.. at no cost to me. 
Once its up and running it operates as advertised. Motion detection is good both day and night. Wish they would include a wedge for the device so that you could adjust the angle of the camera. Not sure about the need to have all the video saved to a Ring server at a cost of $3 per month.","Be prepared for gliches... not ""plug and play"""

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Go4themoon,"This Ring Doorbell does a good job but has limitations. Most advertisements make it look like it is a one size fits all system.   This is not the case.  First off, some new houses have doorbells wired to the side or other angles not designed to view people approaching.  Even the included plate to adjust viewing angles makes this better.  So the image may be the side of someone and not their face.  

I would recommend that if you get this, you already have a wired doorbell.  This will allow you to use the power from it to power the Ring system. Otherwise, you will need to recharge this continually.  After a while, that will get annoying.  It will also activate the internal chimes but the chimes seem to be delayed now for me.  

It easily connects to the home WiFi and I have had no issues with it staying connected.  The 2-way comm also works well.  Overall the system has it's plus and con points.  So just be sure you realize the limitations and can deal with them.",Does the Job But There Are Limitations

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Mick,"After reading all the reviews here, and on Amazon, I ordered a 16v 30va transformer, expecting voltage problems since my existing transformer was only 10v 5va. I tested in with a VOM and it was putting out 11v. I installed the Ring Pro while waiting for the new transformer to come in, and ...wait a sec...contrary to what is posted all over the net my unit worked fine. I replaced the existing transformer with the new one anyway, and there is no difference. It works. Good unit. Yes, there is a little delay between events and alerts, but that's the nature of wireless connections over the internet. I'm happy I got it.
My only complaint is the crappy biege cover instead of white, and the fact that you cannot change the sound of the Ring at the doorbell itself. I would love to have the ""Dogs Barking"" sound coming from the doorbell when someone rings it. Other than these nitpicks, I'm good.",It Works

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,MacFamily,We have had the original ring cam for about 3 years. The old cam was a 720 with no ability to control the movement zones like our other ring cameras. We recently purchased the ring alarm and wanted to see about upgrade the door bell since it was the oldest product we had. This product takes up less space than the original or the new ring 2 and is thinner so it fits on the door edge better. Wiring it up to an existing unit was not an issue. Flipped the breaker and then had to install an additional power device to the actual door bell chime. Two fillips screws and it was done. The device mounted with two screws one at the top and bottom and we chose the bronze cover from the available ones since that is our door color. We connected via 5g and the connection is very fast. We have a flag at our front door and the pro made it easy to create a zone around where it swings to reduce false activations. The video quality is also now inline with our other 1080p cameras. Great upgrade.,Great upgrade
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,upscale,"My first Ring Pro was DOA out of the box. This point is very important.

After chasing down what seemed like a 16v transformer issue, locating the transformer, swapping it out with a 24v unit and still having the same issues, it was clear that the unit was DOA.

There wasn't much help online and the various complaints and issues on this product make it very difficult to determine the problem. 

So aside from a bad product out of the box, be sure you have great wifi coverage and if you have the ability, allow the Ring to connect to it's own wireless SSID, not shared with any other devices. This will help the Ring Pro's functionality and reliability - contention free network. If the Ring Pro does not have good wifi coverage, don't expect much. There is a Ring Chime Pro you could buy to help extend your wifi and connect your Ring Pro to if a weak wifi signal is something you can't easily resolve. 

If you have all of this handled - super strong wifi and 24v transformer, but you still have issues with your Ring Pro - take it back - it's defective.

I may not have needed to swap the transformer, but for good measure and from the very convoluted reviews and research online, the 24v transformer upgrade is better any way. 

My Ring Pro works perfectly. Always catches motion. Always provides a view when I log in, no black screens, no lag, etc. If you're having any of those problems - be sure all the above is taken care of first. Still same problems? Take it back.

Something else to consider, after 30 days, you will need to sign up for a cloud subscription or else it's just a fancy doorbell, with no ability to capture and store motion when detected. It's about $30 a year, even though everyone want's to complain about it. Yes, Ring Pro is $200 (Black Friday) - but that's a one time purchase. That doesn't cover the cost for Ring to give you indefinite cloud storage.. Be realistic folks! New era of technology! But consider your situation. Maybe you're just using the Ring Pro as a deterrent - just having it up and glowing might be enough and you don't need a subscription.

I highly recommend the product, so long as you have the proper environment to support it.",Make sure you have the right setup

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,Spud,"I ordered two of the Ring Pro Doorbells from Bestbuy when they were first available. The first Doorbell that I installed worked and the second would not go into connect mode. I talked to their customer service and they sent a replacement unit. The replacement unit would no go into connect mode. They sent a third unit and it would connect and function. Please note that you will need a chime with transformer for each unit. Fortunately, I had two chimes (one for each side of the house) I just had to add a transformer to the second chime. The key to the best performance of this product is your wifi upload speed. I had AT&T, and in the rural area in which I live, I could only get 1 Mbps upload rate and that is not good enough for these unit to connect the video. This is why I believe people say that they only had video of the person walking away. I changed to a cable internet provider and purchased the plan which 10 Mbps upload rate and the Doorbell performs like a charm. My modem is approx. twenty feet from my front door and I had an access point approx. twenty feet from my back door. So, that worked out as well. The only problem that I am having is the motion detection is very sensitive and is triggered all the time with no one there. I talked to customer service and they said that they are working to make it less sensitive. This unit does not have the frequency of of motion choices as does the original Ring. Until they change it or I understand how to set it up, I have turned this feature off.",Good Product

I had my electrician check it out and I had to pay for a new transformer.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,smallmoe,"The Ring Doorbell Pro is a very good product ,but the app's response time on my iPhone is too slow. For example, when someone rings the doorbell and you open the app it spins a few times and then opens. It seems like an eternity when you are trying to respond to the door.

Other than that it is a very good product and provides security and piece of mind.

The RIng Pro comes with a decent fisheye camera that captures 1080P video. The Ring Pro does not require a battery as it utilizes the power from your existing doorbell system. The installation was well documented and easy to do. Ring provides everything that you need in the box to complete the installation. A good wifi signal is required.

The system comes with three covers: bone, satin nickel, and black. That is a nice touch by Ring because it gives you a choice of what color scheme works best for you.

It took a little trial and error to get the motion detector sensitivity adjusted. I finally settled on the least sensitive setting. Anything more sensitive picked up cars passing by on the street about 30 feet away. Overall I am very satisfied with the Ring video door bell. I can check before I answer the door and see when deliveries are made even when I'm away. One slight negative is that by the time my phone alerts (via the Ring app) that there is someone at the door and I get the app open to respond, there is a significant delay.

You need at least a 2 Mb/s upload speed for the doorbell to actually work. My WiFi has the worst 2Ghz upload speed on the planet and the doorbell wouldn’t record half the time. I switched to the Doorbell Pro because I can connect to the 5Ghz band giving me massive speeds and the doorbell works like a dream. Sometimes it picks up a few false flags (Car lights) but no biggie and it’s not all the time, only seems to happen when it had rained so it’s reflecting.

This doorbell will require you to switch out your existing doorbell, AND add a capacitor (a square thingy) to your existing doorbell.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Flewpastu,"I have multiple security cameras all around my house from the 2tb hardwired 5mp dvr system to the guardzilla in the garage none of which I'm paying a monthly cloud fee it's just not me, but I bought the ring pro cause I get a lot of deliveries n read good reviews installation and set up was a breeze worked flawlessly my router is upstairs approx 25ft from the ring pro it picked up both the 2.4ghz and the 5ghz networks great so I opted for the 5ghz naturally and I feel compelled to say I'm blown away it's great quality build the image quality is awesome but response time to notifying me of motion or ringing is almost real time. The camera is side mounted to the right side of door like you have to cross the path of the camera to enter door but my phone is notifying me of the motion/activity as I'm walking up to it....

The only advantages of having the pro in my opinion is the slim design and interchangeable face plates. It looks/fits better mounted next to my door than the other models.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,denverArea,This is one of our favorite smart home devices. It definitely gets the most regular usage. We have a home office. Sometimes we are on conference calls and unable to make it to the door. we also get lots of deliveries. This helps us to stay in contact with anyone that might be ringing the doorbell. We also have motion detector set on the front of our home. Therefore it notifies us when someone is crossing through the yard or approaching our front porch. Great device. Night vision is excellent. The audio quality is pretty good as well considering it really isn't made for audio. The app is extremely user-friendly. You also have the option to connect to the Community Network and you can submit footage for anyone on the network to look at should there be a security issue of concern for your neighbors. we weren't really aware of that feature until we got a notification from someone several blocks away that uploaded footage of suspicious activity around their vehicles.,best smart home device

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Fernie,"I have the doorbell and 2 floodlight cameras. They work exceptionally well. Of course they have their little challenges but using these devices kept me from having to spend a boatload of money running power and video cables to other units or having to run CAT6 for POE to run networked cameras. Ring has done a very good job. NOTE: If you lose power on the floodlights you will have to re-initialize them to get them connected to your network. It's a simple task but if they had only included a small battery or used non-volatile RAM then once the power came back on the units would be able to configure themselves. oh well, nothing is perfect. BTW, the doorbell will require I believe, an 18V transformer. If you already have a wired doorbell check it's voltage. Also, play with the sensor zones to tweak them so you are not constantly receiving motion alarms on your phone.",Works perfectly

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,sirocket,"The Ring Doorbell pro looks and performs MUCH better than the original Ring Doorbell. 

There are a few cons with the Pro.

- There is no Battery anymore like the original Ring Doorbell, which means the Camera isn't any good when someone cuts your power (if you have your wifi router and modem on a bettery backup for security purposes).

- The Doorbell Pro needs a certain amount of power that is above their minimum requirements or else the doorbell won't perform very well. This means that if you have an older doorbell power supply then you might need to upgrade it for the Ring Pro to work correctly. This is normally a $10 part which isn't a big deal anyways.

All in all the Ring Doorbell Pro looks great and works great! The Ring Cloud service is lightning fast too!!",Best Smart Doorbell on the Market with a few cons

Once I got the device installed(which was very easy with the video), it worked great for 2 weeks then blew my little 10v transformer(needs a 16v) for the doorbell. I'm no electrician so figuring this one out was tricky. Had to find the transformer(typically behind the chime box), strip wires, create a perfect circuit and trace wires. All in all it was a good experience for me just didn't prepare for the extra work to come. Since I've replaced the transformer the device works great I feel comfortable leaving my house knowing I can see who's near with a click of my finger.",Make sure you have the right transformer.

They suggested this since we already had a doorbell there. It works fine and gives chimes when it senses motion and then the doorbell will ring if someone actually presses the button. It captures from a long distance so it collects data when someone is approaching the front stoop. The problem I have is that we don't leave our outdoor lights on all night. It does capture some picture at night but not nearly as much as a camera with night vision. I should have done more homework before buying.","Works fine, a little pricey"

My first piece was dud (I wrongly assumed it was wiring), but after exchanging the device the new PRO unit is working properly. Just remember you need close to 24v wiring from your doorbell. Ring support is good and responsive. I like the fact it alerts motion activity too! You can set motion zones to customize your alerts. You get 30days monitoring for free (save/access video), after 30 days you have to upgrade to the Protect Plan, I just did that... It's cheap $30/year.

For example, when we leave in the morning, it will be sometimes 5-10 minutes after we leave that we get notification of activity. Not a big deal since it's recorded and archived but other times it's instant. I installed this which reminds me save your sanity if you are drilling new holes in brick and go out and buy a mortise bit. The one included is garbage.

I never could get it set up correctly on a second cell phone for my fiancée. After 5 months it stopped working altogether. I battled with customer service for about a week, going back and forth as they resisted sending me a new unit. At one point they even asked me to get a voltage reading from my ""transformer"". Huh? 

Finally they agreed to replace it under warranty. They shipped it FedEx ground, so it took 2 weeks to arrive. By this time I've been without a doorbell almost a month.

After about 1 1/2hours of being on the phone with customer service I was advised to replace it. Second unit works as advertised and I am content. I wish I would be able to connect to echo show screen when the button is pressed without having to ask Alexa to show the door and the echo dots should be able to be used as additional chimers. In any case I do like it.,No regrets

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Jdub,"This is a great camera! Picture quality is great, sound quality is good. You can digital zoom also. Installation was straight forward and super easy! A great side benefit I never thought of is my kids use it all the time to talk to me when I'm at work! Immediate contact! Also love the fact that it has motion alerts and that you can adjust the sensing field. 3 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. I feel that the fastening, and security, of this is weak. I would like to see a more secure mounting to help prevent theft if it. The speaker could be a little louder. Lastly, I wish it included angled mount plates. I did find some on amazon that are great but still think Ring should make and include in the kit.",Excellent system!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,GoBadgers,"Pros: Really like the night vision and camera angle. The cloud service option does a great job of starting the recording before the motion or ring of the doorbell to capture the entire interaction. Great product as long as you plan to pay for their cloud service.
Cons: Notification of doorbell ringing or motion does not come across quick enough to catch anyone at the door, unless they are waiting there for a response, approx 2-4 seconds. By the time you get the notification on your phone, you click answer, and the app launches on your phone, no one is ever still in view. Must use the cloud service to make the motion detection useful. If you do not plan to pay for the cloud service, the motion detection will be useless.",Does what it says

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Pontones,I had to replace one of these. I believe the old one died because I did not upgrade the transformer. Make sure your door bell transformer is 30VA or your Ring will die a slow death. Also contact a person using the phone app for the phone number. They can transfer your account so you don’t have to use time from the old unit on your annual fee. They also honored the free month for buying a new one without me asking for it.,Replaced broken one.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,RogerBear,"I've never experienced the older versions so not sure how well they worked or didn't. Figured I'd just go for the newest and hopefully it would perform the best. My doorbell is perpendicular to the door but the wide view of the camera is A-OK and I can see people approaching the door. It does work, but when Ring pushes out firmware updates it's a hit/miss occurrence of things working properly. This goes with all of their Ring products as I also have 2 wired spotlight cams. So for what it is, it does work, but hopefully Ring can hash out their software.","It works, most of the time."
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Kev40,"The product is great, but has a few small issues. It does everything it is suppose to and it meets our needs. The problems we have found is the device does not always connecting to our phone. We try and pull it up and it doesn't connect. Most of the time the connection is not a problem and the picture is good. Another issue is, when our porch light comes on the device doesn't pick up motion. It will pick up motion before the light is activated. The final problem, the device can't pick up our address. The device uses our neighbors address.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,TCH22,"Good product for the money. Sometimes doesnt pick up all motion, even after adjusting the motion sensitivity.

Be advised that you can only review videos free for the first 30 days, then you have to pay $30 a year to use the service. That's where they get you unless you just want to use the live view feature.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Jul 2020,Mtimo,I order many packages and I wanted some kind of security knowing who was at my door before I opened it. The camera was fairly easy to install and set up. This does connect to your wifi. You do have to pay to maintain your video footage which is about 40 or 50 bucks a year. If the camera detects any movement it will record for about 2 mins. The only downfall is you can view the recording until it's complete. So if you get a notification and you open it right away you must wait until the recording is complete to view it.

I had read the reviews on line and went to the ring web page to review how to install the door bell prior to purchasing. The ring pro has lived up to its expectations. With the install all you need to do is watch the on line video, read the material provided and down load the app. Take it step by step it was not hard at all to install. 

Ring has proved very handy keeping a eye on things when we are away, and it is nice to See who is at the door when you are home. The only thing I would do different with the Ring system is get it sooner if I had to do it all over again.",Excellent

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,JTMDawg,"Overall, very pleased with the performance of this product so far. It is very comforting to be able to answer the door without having to go to the door or being home. Happy I chose the model that utilizes the existing wiring; however, realize that you have to install part of the device in the actual existing doorbell mechanism and that the device may be larger than you existing doorbell. It requires that you disable the power to the doorbell device which can be an issue if this is not well labeled in your breaker box.",Excellent Product - Some instillation necessary

I don't know if its just mine, but it has about 3-5 seconds freez after the first 3-4 seconds, then it resumes.
Kinda slow to start displaying video after motion detection notice. 
And, it basically a door bell with peephole without the subscription. Am still within my 30 days so I wonder how it's going to work after the 30 days .... Live view only ?",Funny gadget

I went with the ""pro"" version as it gave me customized motion zones (I can draw boxes around the video to select my motion detection zones which was important to me).

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,MiaBella,"It’s a cool concept. But after using it for the last month, it’s just mediocre. It’s fun being able to see and be notified of movement and all of that. However, it sometimes won’t connect because of your WiFi signal. If WiFi or power goes out, so does the camera. Also it is pretty sensitive to movement. When I’m at work I’m getting constant notifications of movement and all it is, is either a semi, or my flag blowing or a fly on the cam, or the leaves blowing on my outdoor plant. Gets real annoying. For the price... I don’t know. I guess I don’t have anything to compare it to.",Meh

I like the motion detection too. Sometimes the mail man drops off a package but won't ring the bell, I get a motion alert and easy peasy. The cloud option is very fairly priced. It saves all activity for $2.50/month. The only reason for 4 stars is because the volume is not as loud as I'd like for the person hearing me at the door. Having it a little louder or the option to make it louder would be perfect. That is a minor issue.",Convenient.

The audio is crisp. I love that the motion sensor picks up motion and alerts me faster than any of the other video doorbells I've witnessed.

Ive set motion zones to avoid the street and at night car headlights still sets off the motion sensors.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Crissy,"Having the control over your own front door is been amazing. Telling your mail man to leave your packages behind a certain area or even when you finally see the kid who keeps putting down your mail box red flag. I've been reccomending the ring to everyone to get one... it's a must need if you don't want to pay the expensive alarm company.

First thing is check your lighting at your house. for me I had a porch and the back light of the sun created a unreadable image to view during the day. THe person would just look like a big shadow.

I went to the device and it had become extremely hot (check YouTube videos). It burned me. I read the troubleshooting and performed those procedures and even contacted the company.

I can ‘hear’ every word of their conversation while they stand at or yards away from my door.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Jess,"Works great, decent footage quality. We live close to the road so at first every car that drove by was setting the motion sensor off which was a bit annoying after awhile however if you take the setting down to people only it takes care of the issue. We have street parking so it’s nice to be able to look at the app when I’m on my way home to see if there is an open parking space in front of the house or not.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Kayape,"For the most part, it works very well. It is very nice to get ring and motion notifications on my phone. However, the motion detection could be improved. For instance, rain water drops from above can cause motion to be detected. Lighting changes without an actual object moving can also cause motion to be detected (e.g. front porch lights, a street light turning on or off at night or car headlights flashing across a bush). Turning the motion sensitivity down just one notch can cause some legitimate motion to be ignored.",Ring Pro good product

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,HockeyDad,Love the ring door bell. Great to be able to see who it is before you open the door. Also great to be able to speak to someone who rings your door bell if you wish to not open your door or aren't home at the time. Being able to see who has been at your front door or approaching is nice. Definitely recommend the product to others.,Great Product
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2018,Freezer1,"So far my experience has been mostly good but there are a few hiccups. Sometimes you have to clear the app's cache to make sure you get notifications on time. There were a few times where I didn't get motion notifications until a significant amount of time after the actual event. The motion detector and camera recorded the motion at the time fine but the actual notification was wayyyyyy late so I'd be looking at an event that happened 15 minutes ago. You have to stay on top of it also, meaning that it's not a set it and forget it device. Every so often you need to make sure your notifications are coming through. I really like the device when it's working properly but I feel that it's just not quite working as it should. By my comments, I'm only referring to the notifications coming through, everything else works flawlessly; the recordings, the actual motion detection, the size, ringing my mechanical doorbell, it does all of that great but my only concern would be that the notification for motion can be inconsistent. Ringing the doorbell notifications come through immediately. I would just like to see the motion detection notifications improved. I would recommend the device to others BUT I'd tell them to be cautious with it.",Good but could be better
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,netbucks,"After viewing one of my neighbors install the original Ring video doorbell, I took the plunge and bought the Ring Pro model. I did my homework and read reviews and knew that I needed to upgrade my doorbell transformer. After I did this, I faithfully followed the directions and like magic, the thing just plan works. No complaints. Sometimes, a stiff wind will make the audio recordings a bit distorted, but then what do you expect from a tiny microphone.

The camera works well and has decent resolution. My only complaint is that the backlighting makes it difficult to see faces clearly, but that may be due to the way my porch is set up. The app is easy to use, too. Moreover, it's been reliably notifying me when visitors are at the front door.

We connected it to the existing doorbell and our wifi and have had no issues with it this far. we've had it for about a month now, and the only thing we haven't gotten is the motion notifications that most reviewers have complained about.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Cobox,I wanted so badly for it to work because when it did it was great. It kept losing the connection to my network (AT&T Uverse) about 20 ft. from router and it was not as easy to soft reboot as the videos suggested. I had to take it off the wall each time and loosen and fasten the wires again. After a while this got to be too painful. In a few months I will buy a new WiFi Mesh system and may try again. The customer support from Ring was great.,wished it would have worked

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2018,HappyMe99,"This does not show video like their demo videos. It only takes pictures, not really video. It has a huge time delay between pictures. As an example, I had a package delivered by UPS. This Ring Doorbell Pro snapped a picture when she bent over to put down the package. She was facing away from the camera. Then the camera took a snapshot of her walking away from the door, another shot of her backside.. So if someone should come to pick up a package, this may not capture anything worth using. It gives you very little to go on. However, to be honest, it does often capture pictures of me going in or out that show my face.. (I have it set for motion detection.) So it works, and I like it, I just would not have bought it knowing it doesn't give you smooth video like their demo videos show. On the upside, their call-in support is wonderful. Some of the nicest people! (Note: I have called them a few times about the video issue. They sent a Ring Doorbell Wi-Fi extender at no charge. It didn't improve anything.)",OK but not great

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,Gadgeteer,"The Ring Pro provides improved daytime video quality and better control over motion sensing than the Ring, but it is essential to have a strong wifi signal where you install it, and either strong wifi or 4G/LTE signal where you want to use the App. The motion sensing will perform better if you have a large front yard with a long sidewalk that does not approach the door from the side within 5-7 feet of the door, and does not have tree limbs or other objects that move nearby - otherwise, you will either not get motion alerts in time to be effective, or you may get excessive false alerts. Because there can be delays in starting recording or receiving or responding to alerts, and the video capture resets if/when the doorbell is pressed or you respond, you may not get video of what triggered the alert, unless they very patiently wait around at the door for a response (unlikely).
For existing Ring users considering upgrading to the Pro, be aware that they say you cannot power both from the same doorbell; however, you can add the old Ring under battery power (so no Live View function), or install it on a separate transformer. The $30/year Cloud Storage is per each device.
Overall, under the right conditions, the Ring Pro is a significant improvement over a standard doorbell, but not as complete and reliable as a more elaborate security system. However, it is more aesthetic and much easier to install than a new wired security system.
Note: a second firmware update (ver. 1.0.40) was pushed last night; it remains to be seen if this resolves various performance issues, especially night time motion sensing problems.",What you need to know
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,GadgetLover,"Installation was NOT easy. Plus extra costs for Wedge ($24) for Siding Exterior which should have been included or even mentioned as an accessory option. Nope - had to find it on our own. and then an Extender ($30) for anyone who doesn't have their router next to their front door -- also had to figure that one out too as we have great signal here but found Ring needs Router no more than 30ft away -- ended up having to put extender right next to the front door so it's on the other side of the Ring. . That was ridiculous. Plus Ring Support sucked. Called when Wireless wouldn't connect. Couldn't find a way to reenter wireless password, so called. First person said they had no experience but wanted to learn. Not with my network, I thought. Then 2nd level, first had me disconnect my network which then I had to hang up as they said, my network had to be connected for Ring to work. Ring needs better support documentation. Arrrgh. after much troubleshooting ourselves, finally got it to work and it does do what it says -- but turned out to be more expensive adding the Extender and Wedge.",Neat Device But....not sure if worth the hassle.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,AquaDog,"Installation was pretty smooth. I did have to upgrade our doorbell transformer up to 24 volts which wasn't difficult other than making sure the power was off and a few screws. 

The doorbell did connect to the network pretty easily and worked great for the first day. I have a flagship router and over 150mb internet connection so the ring was well within range and has the speed to make it ""very good"" in the Ring health rating app. I will say that this product is working about 70% of the time correctly. The most common issue I have with this product is that it won't always record ""live"" video. I do receive the ""motion"" notice but no live video is being recorded, just a black screen for one minute. When it is working correctly, the video is clear and smooth and the communication piece can be somewhat choppy and delayed. If disconnected from the network the product will re-connect to the network on its own and you just have to hope it will work the next time someone enters the motion zone or actually rings the doorbell.

The app is very smooth and easy to use. You are required to purchase the ability to store videos from Ring after the 30 day trial period. 
 
My overall review of this product is that it is somewhat reasonably priced and the same for reliability. I would recommend this product as a temporary fix to installing a wired cctv solution or for those that are aware that it is going not going to work 100% of the time. You just have to hope it isn't that time you really need it to work.

My thanks to all of the previous reviews on the doorbell transformer voltage, network speed, and router wifi signal information.",A nice temporary solution
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Eema,Love this product.  You must upgrade from 12 volt transformer to a 16 volt transformer for it to work without issues. aOtherwise a greta product!,Great range from front door

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2016,Mousikos2,"Great product idea, and it's really pretty helpful overall. I would imagine this would be a tad tricky to set up for an average homeowner (it wasn't for me, but I've been in technical support for 20+ years). It works fairly well, but the wifi connection is spotty sometimes, which isn't my state of the art equipment...it's got to be something with ring itself. Different firmware revisions make this better sometimes, and worse others. Seems like this is a work in progress... I've looked at and tried many other video doorbells and similar-use items, and the ring is my favorite, but I don't know that I can say it is the best one out there. I was trying to stay in the $200 range (as opposed to some super cool looking $600 options) and I think it's a decent bang for the buck, especially as they improve it physically and with software. Ring support is SUPER responsive and has been very helpful 90% of the time with the questions I've asked them. Definitely worth at try...I would save your packing materials and unpack carefully in case you want to return it though - it may not be everyone's cup of tea.","Awesome idea, execution could still use work..."
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Apr 2020,Gerty,"This doorbell cost me $250 when I bought it plus another $250 getting the electrical required to the door, so it may be a huge investment.

I installed it easily and it had no problems from the beginning and it works as advertised. The live view is great and being able to view the recorded motions is great. People can hear you clearly through the bell and you can see and hear them clearly also. My one gripe is that Ring should give you a yard sign for free instead of trying to charge you $50 for it, you are essentially advertising their product for free.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,milman,"The Ring Door Bell Pro is an excellent video camera doorbell. It works great, the install was relatively easy, and it is kind of fun to watch who is at your door. I have had it for about a week now. The cloud option for $30 a year to access video online is also very reasonable, and I will get that. It does only keep 60 days worth, but then you always have a video with the last 60 days of who was at your door. 

Only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that at night the video turns black and white. Not sure why it does this, and I had noticed this on other reviews and is not a deal breaker for me, just kind of an annoyance as there is really no reason for this IMO. Another drawback is the outside speaker on the doorbell pro is weak and not very clear. It is audible, but not that loud. If you were planning to use this as an intercom to talk to people regularly at your door, I would not recommend it. Not an issue for me. 

For those that are considering, here are some things to keep in mind.

1) Make sure you are getting the right voltage at your door bell. Ring Door Bell Pro needs at least 16v. I had checked by simply disconnecting the existing doorbell and using a voltage meter to check. I think most house should be ok but it doesn't hurt to verify. If you don't have it, you would need an extra transformer and that will make the installation a little more complicated. I had 18V so I was fine.

2) Make sure you have a good wifi signal at your doorbell area. Ring says should have at least 2MB download which is minimum needed for 1080p video. Mine was like 10 - 20 MB as tested on speed test so I was good. I think for good video though 5MB download is needed but just my opinion.

3) Watch the installation videos from ring. I found it extremely useful and they show you exactly how to set it up. Basically, you attach a device to your existing doorbell (mine was mechanical), and then you attach the ring doorbell outside, and then run it through setup with the Ring App. I had set it up in about 1/2 hour.

I did have a minor installation issue. I called support and got through to a support person quickly (which is a big plus) and they were able to help me out. The worst things these days are trying to deal with the automated responses. 

One up and running, you have several setup options in the app.
1) You can have doorbell activity always monitored and see who is at your door. You can also talk to them, but as said earlier the outside speaker is weak, so they might not be able to hear you well. You can hear them though nicely from the phone app.

2) You can setup motion zones and sensitivity so you can always have a video if anyone was at your door, even if they did not ring it. Pretty nice. It does pick up cars on the street if you don't turn down the sensitivity all the way, but you can configure.

3) You can have a live stream option in the app so you can always just view who is at your door. It has a wide angle camera, so you can a pretty good view of anything going on in your front yard. The camera is very good, and you can zoom in and out on your app.

4) Multiple people can download the app and everyone can monitor. So in my family, there are four of us and all of have the app and we can see who is at our door before we answer.","Excellent product, easy to setup, good support"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,TomK,"At first I was a little disappointed because the video would freeze after 2 to 3 seconds. Then I e-mailed Ring support and found out I needed faster internet upload speed (min 2Mbps). I upgraded my internet and everything worked great.

Unfortunately we were unable to obtain a strong enough wi-fi connection to make it work properly. Repositioning our wi-if extender did not help, so we returned the doorbell. However, I would recommend the Ring Pro if you have a suitable wi-if signal.",Great device if it works for you
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Runner,Better than expected but sensitivity to movement a bit too much. Notifications are a bit delayed but this may be due to internet speeds. overall still a great buy,awesome doorbell and viewer

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,SumoTC,"I have a security system set up in and around my house. Adding the Ring just made a lot of sense.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,FutureP,"Overall, this has worked just as expected, except for a couple days where movement was being saved to the cloud.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,mmac,the first video doorbell was the basic model we installed on our Florida home . The Ring Pro is installed on our Indiana home .

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Ring123,"I bought the Ring on the recommendation of a friend. Looked it up online and it seemed a great idea to be able to see who is at your door at all times, even when you are away. But we have had nothing but trouble with the installation. Apparently the Ring Pro that we bought is more capricious than the original Ring. Sometimes we get notifications, sometimes not, and sometimes about 3 minutes later than the doorbell ring or motion outside. We ended up buying new routers to see if better wifi would solve the problem, and also a newer model tablet, so the whole package ended up to be a lot more expensive than we anticipated. BestBuy is good, however, at at following up on installation problems, so the Ring doorbell was replaced twice. I am not sure yet if this new one is working properly.",Great idea
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,JBrown,The video itself comes in crystal clear and the setup was a breeze using the existing doorbell wiring.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Kalps,"I installed this product about a week ago and experiencing the following issues:

1. Video feed from Ring flips to Black & White all thru the day. Need to reset / go thru the initial set-up all over again, to bring it back to color. After a day or so, the video feed goes back to Black & White, until another reset / set-up. 
2. Ring door bell hot to touch

Spoke to Ring Level 2 tech. 

For issue #1, I was told this is a known issue, Ring is working on a firmware upgrade, but an ETA is not available at this time.

For issue #2. The tech thought it might be due to a faulty Ring Pro Power kit and she ordered a replacement Pro Power Kit.

The experience with the product so far is not good. I am contemplating at returning the product back to Best Buy.",Not a great experience so far...

Currently you must pay a small fee in order to replay any recorded video, otherwise you can only watch it live when someones is actually ringing your doorbell. But when they leave and if you miss it, you can't replay it unless you pay the monthly fee.

When it works, the product is pretty good, but the alerts come through inconsistently; resulting in missed deliveries.
FYI, there is a $3/month charge to see the videos after the 30-day trial ends. Not a crazy price, but since I'm having trouble with consistently receiving notifications, I feel that I HAVE to to make the product more useful to me.
I expected that purchase of the additional extender/chime would have improved the consistency as well as the video quality which is sometimes noted as lesser due to wifi signal.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2019,kylejillm,"Before I get to my reasoning for the two-star review let me first say that I am not the most mechanically inclined person in the world. That being said I can read and follow directions very well. As for the Ring doorbell I simply could not get it to work. It worked for a short time, as in a few hours, and even then during this time it made my existing doorbell thump a very annoying sound. This is after using the included attachment that you install on the existing doorbell. Calling Tech Support they sent me something to alleviate this problem. Trouble is they sent me exactly what I already had so it did not help at all. Tossing aside using it hard-wired we decided to install it again using only the battery option. It still would not work. No amount of trying would get it sync and work in any way. So we returned it and purchased the Arlo doorbell that went along with our existing cameras and it has been nothing short of perfect. If you are looking for a doorbell and do not have any other cameras then perhaps the Ring will work for you. But if you already have Arlo cameras I highly recommend the Arlo doorbell over anything, including Ring.",Could Not Get It To Work

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,djmidway,"I bought the Pro version of the doorbell cause of the higher resolution and its smaller than Regular version. I needed a new door bell because I was missing deliveries and my doorbell button was worn out, so I did some research and found this was among the most popular of video doorbell solutions.

First the good, this does work as advertised and works with the current doorbell. If you lose power, it will remember the setting and you won't have to reset it up once its up and running. It wasn't too hard to set up, but you must open up your doorbell ringer and wire the addition piece. Its fun to watch people outside on the live view. And it does work as a regular doorbell once it has been set up. It does seem weather proof and is still working after a few rains and very hot summer weather. And besides working with Smart Phone which is easy to use, there is a program that lets it run on current MACs, so if your not by the phone you will catch the doorbell. The night video also works well on doorbell.

The bad, you must have internet to set up, otherwise your doorbell won't work as both a smart doorbell or a regular doorbell until you go through the set up steps, once it has been done it works fine. When you ring the doorbell, it only rings the chime once, so my mechanical doorbell only has one single chime which can be missed. And it takes a good 30 seconds before it will let ring the door again. While the video is generally good, its not as HD as a Hero or DSLR will produce, its more like an average smart phone at best. Also, sometimes the internet doesn't catch right for the live view so you will get a blank/black image. I have noticed this is allot less frequent than when I first got it, so this may be a non-issue for people who have quicker internet. Lastly all of the video goes through Rings servers, mostly as a part of there cloud service, but I am not sure if the live view feature would work if Ring went out of business or they weren't able to support the device, which is a concern.

One thing to note you must have a decent internet speed to use the live view or other features. I have 10mbps down and 2 mbps which it runs ok most of the time, but it does hog the bandwidth while video is running.

Also, this is more a feature request, being able to tilt the camera vertically a little bit. I am up higher up and in urban area making it so I have had to get creative with the Motion Zones.

Despite my minor complaints, I really do like the doorbell and its features.",Went with the Pro Version

Clarity of the video is excellent and I like being able to customize the motion zone as I didn't want every car driving by to set it off.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2017,RingProSucker,"This product has issues. Never has worked correctly. Now Its completely dead. The videos would freeze on & off & door bell would NOT ring sometimes when it was pushed, then I was NOT getting notifications when someone came up to the door. It's like a gamble, sometimes it would work & others it would not. It worked on and off for a few months, now its completely dead. Will not light up or anything. Called them for support & wanted to get a new one shipped to me but the lady REFUSED. She kept saying that it was our wiring or transformer or something else, but NOT the Ring doorbell. It was working, like I said on & off for 4 months, then on April 17th, it stopped recording. I checked it and it was completely black. The app on my phone says its disconnected, so I tried to connect, and nothing happened. No white light, nothing. Tried the reboot, pushed the button, and Nothing. Then the hard reboot, held the button for 15 seconds & still nothing. Did this several times during the week, but NOTHING is happening. My husband checked the transformer & it is getting Power & then checked our doorbell wiring & our Old Doorbell IS WORKING, Just NOT the Ring Doorbell Pro, So I decided to call Customer Support. She just gave us the Run around & was NO HELP WHAT SO EVER. I am very disappointed, because I thought they would send a replacement, but She Refused to Do ANYTHING. Told me to get an Electrician. So I would ADVISE YOU NOT to Buy the Ring Doorbell Pro. Look for something else. That is my next move.","Doesn't work, problems w/ this since I've had it."

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2018,bsvic,Purchased this on Black Friday after seeing the ads and checking into it a little. What I did not realize is the monthly fee to get video past more than a day or so. If I'm buying this to use for security I would appreciate knowing up front that to really have access to video content more than a day or so after an event. Couldn't find any options to send the video to my own cloud storage so I'm stuck using their service for video storage and if I can't see an event later when say I'm away on vacation it doesn't seem worth it to me to have the technology.

I had 16v and the doorbell said it was only getting 4v. I bought a new 24v (my 16v was only 3 years old, my condo, hence the wiring is only 3 years old) and it was still underpowered.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,mtbrob,"I Bought the ring Door bell Pro as it was an easy to install a Camera on my Front porch without taking away the aesthetics of the porch and the Front door its's self. On top of the great features the Ring system it's self offers, 

The Pro Version is slightly smaller than the Original ring, comes with 4 different base color base plates that can match the external of your home ( because who has a silver painted house ?) and is only able to be wired into the existing doorbell low voltage wire, which means you do not have to disconnect it from the wall and take it inside to charge it every three months or so . 

The included instructions were very simple to follow in wiring the Device to my existing doorbell ringer in doors and then the actual device on the front porch.I had it set up in minutes. 

The video quality is good but for me I think it could be better. However this relies heavily on how your house faces the Sun, how much shade through out the day your porch provides, and do you have your porch light on at night. I do wish Ring would of given the ability to fine tune the camera settings a little to account for Glare and brightness etc. 

However over all I am happy with the purchase and have used it on a number occasions to tell when a package has arrived at my house, who, who is ringing my door bell, and I have enjoyed watching the strange looks on peoples faces when I answer their ring with a Hello from my doorbell.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,RaleighNC,"First of all, the video clarity of the product is excellent. The setup is easy (in theory) but not always in reality. I installed my unit twice (after testing that I had proper voltage at the doorbell to satisfy the RING requirements)... and said ""screw it"" after too much hassle - I was going to take it back the next morning. Sometime around 8-10 hours later the unit started working. All was well until I noticed a slight hum from my doorbell. Ring customer service was good (the second time) though their solution was for me to use some sort of Pro Wiring Kit - which is essentially just a bypass of the ORIGINAL doorbell. I'll give RING credit in that they offered (and indicated they've shipped) a free add-on chime for me to plug in somewhere in the house, along with the pro wiring kit. I'm also going to buy another chime and put it downstairs.

But at the end of the day, the unit has basically taken my original doorbell chime (which we liked / is on the wall) and made it functionally obsolete (no sound) but needed for power.

Outdoor unit looks good and as long as I have decent connection (cell or wireless) I can answer the door. There is a few second delay on the unit, but nothing big. They have cameras that I might try, but only because I'm $250 in for a platform to start from.

$3/month recording fee per unit or $10/month for multiple. I'm selecting ""Yes"", but there are little fixes they need to make.","Ring Doorbell - Good, But Not Flawless"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,SH5345,"We have been thinking about a Ring doorbell since they first came out. The drawback to the original one, for us anyway, was that it was battery-operated. When the RingPro came out with hard-wired installation we finally decided to buy. We have been very pleased with this version. The installation was easy and straight-forward. We did have an issue with the doorbell not ringing with the booster pack installed but we contacted Ring and they solved the issue. Initially we felt it was a bit too sensitive, moths would set off the motion sensor at night, but that issue has corrected itself as well. A minor issue we've found is that there is a slight delay between pushing the doorbell button and the chime sounding. Not a serious issue but it would be nice if that little glitch was fixed as well. While traveling recently we were notified that someone was at our door to make a delivery. We could communicate with the delivery driver and direct him/her to a secure place to leave the package. Otherwise it would sit at our front door alerting people that no one was at home. Bottom line is we like our RingPro.",I love my RingPro doorbell

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Feb 2020,loons5150,"The Ring Pro doorbell is an awesome smart product that functions as an all-in-one doorbell, motion-sensor, two-way intercom – offering peace of mind with its security functionality. My wife and I owned the Ring 2 prior to the Pro, and loved it. The Pro has the same ‘basic’ functionality with some more sophisticated sensitivity settings within the app and motion-sensing tech. The main impetus that prompted me to ‘upgrade’ to the Pro from the Ring 2 was the Pro’s purely hardwired power supply. Now, of course, the Ring 2 is only equipped with a rechargeable battery, but it is also robust enough to be hardwired, charging the battery onboard without ever needing to recharge offline. However, in that my wife and I live in the Midwest where the winters can become exceptionally cold, the Ring 2’s lithium battery will drain as it gets colder even with passive operation, and the charging mechanism below freezing can stop working temporarily until the temperatures return to above freezing.
Like I said, the Pro does share common properties with the Ring 2, but has some sophisticated upgrades to those properties that sets it apart. The first is the motion sensing tech – The Pro senses motion by 2 distinct technologies – The first of which uses visible light to sense any changes in the environment; the second in tandem is a PIR (Passive Infrared) that is enabled when visible light becomes dimmer, double-checking the visible environmental change with a heat signature. The Ring 2 only uses PIR. This enables the Pro to have fancy camera perks like colored-night vision.
Overall, my wife and I love the device. I found the install quite easy, and the app set-up was a breeze. Make sure you have a router that outputs a strong signal to the device, as it communicates via WiFi – move router as close as possible, and maybe even use a designated 2.4 GHz signal (versus mixed). Remember, the signal needs to go through your wall to the outside.
If you have a hardwired doorbell already installed, it’s fairly simple to swap with the Ring Pro. Again, the Pro is solely hardwired. My original doorbell at our new house was in an awkward location on the doorframe that didn’t have enough real estate to accommodate the Pro body; so, I had to drill an ‘L’ path through the frame and brick to mount on brick – that wasn’t even that difficult. One more thing I will say is in response to the reams of online posts with individuals confused as to what transformer power supply should be used for optimal performance. Of course, this will depend on the length of wire you’re running…18 gauge bell wire – the longer runs due to resistance can reduce amperage and endpoint voltage. However, I’m running mine roughly 10-15 feet from a basement light junction box through upstairs wall to the door with no issue. I originally had a 16V/16V/A transformer, and it actually showed ‘good’ (>3700mV) rating in the Pro’s device health. However, I did upgrade to a 24V/40V/A variety transformer…it yields the exact same voltage at the Ring Pro. This is most likely due to the Pro’s power kit and its power regulation to the device. I would say the stock doorbell transformer supply should work just fine. If you need more power, the transformer is a $19 purchase and a simple install (if you can find it)…typically in basement, near out-of-reach areas (furnace/utility room) to keep out-of-reach from curious hands. 
Now, some very small nuanced cons…
As a preface, because these are more subtle, they are by no means show-stoppers.
1)	Advanced motion sensing. The Pro is more hypersensitive to motion, as it primarily detects motion by visible light changes in the environment. Small animals, light sources (bright car lights) and reflective surfaces (heavy snow storms, white snowy grounds) can all trip the motion sensing. Now, the Pro app does come equipped with more sophisticated range and sensitivity adjustments as well as a ‘People Only’ mode which, I’m assuming, uses more PIR than visible to detect larger heat signatures; however, I’ve read that the tech uses visible light to actually recognize head/neck/shoulder forms to distinguish human versus non-human. So, this being said, if you live in a heavier traffic section with more inorganic activity, you may need to be a bit more diligent in adjusting the sensitivity settings. However, it’s wired; so, it’s not like you’ll run out of juice.
2)	Slight delay to mechanical chimes if owned. The Pro comes with a Power kit that is essentially a resistive circuit board that jumpers the transformer and doorbell terminals of your mechanical chime…this is to ensure that the Ring Pro device always receives enough power to maintain a consistent network connection. Because of this, when doorbell is depressed, there is a 2(ish) second delay of the mechanical chime. This is honestly so moot…if you own Alexa or other hub devices, said devices can prompt chime announcements. My wife and I have several Alexa devices strewn about the house, and the doorbell is announced throughout all of them.
3)	Ring app may be too streamlined…hahaha. So, this may be the least important of these; hence it being last. But, it did frustrate me until I discovered a workaround once I understood what was happening. So, like I said, we have Alexa. She acts as hub to communicate with the Ring Pro device via its enabled app. I had routines (2 respective) programmed in Alexa for her to turn porch light on upon sensing motion (fine), and subsequently turn said light off from a second routine if motion was not detected for 5 minutes (fine…sometimes). The ‘sometimes’ was the frustrating part. So, I ultimately found that the light going on after motion detected was very reliable; the light turning off wasn’t. The light failed to turn off if the motion detected was immediately followed by a doorbell press. The reason (I think): The motion was sensed quickly enough by Alexa to enable the porch light on. The Ring app, most likely to conserve storage, compresses the motion and doorbell ring into one action – doorbell ring. So, when Alexa tries to determine when the light should go off, it references the Ring app history…the motion is not technically there; so, the light stays on because of the programmed confusion. My workaround…scheduled another routine in Alexa to turn off the porch light after waiting 5 minutes after doorbell is pressed. Anyway, that’s a super-techy-geeky, trivial con.
In closing, I love the darned thing! Long-winded, I know; but, this is a must-buy for those who want a smarter home with an easy-install security feature.",Great all-in-one security doorbell!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,BBCustomer,"After much research we decided to purchase the Ring Doorbell Pro. Our decision was based on the slim profile, hard wire capability and security features of the Pro. We have an existing hard wired doorbell outside the front door and a transformer mounted in the garage. The door chime is mounted towards the ceiling on a hallway wall to give you an idea of our existing setup. One thing we did not check in advance was to remove the existing doorbell plate to see if there would be any install issues. Our existing doorbell is not mounted on a slim doorbell plate, it's a full size electrical box with a plate, and the doorbell button is in the center of the plate. This means we had to drill the holes off to the side of the box which was the best location during install. Besides that, the install was really quick, and simple. Setup, connecting to WIFI, and creating a Ring account was a breeze. The product works flawlessly, images are clear and the audio is loud enough for someone to hear and have a two way conversation without delays. Internet service is through the cable company and WIFI router is an Apple Airport. Notifications for motion or when someone is at the door are great, they work as it should and can easily be controlled or minimized if you want in the app on the smartphone or online from your computer. It works so well that we are looking into expanding our security monitoring with additional Ring products. Would highly recommend this product to anyone.",Best Doorbell Ever!

The installation video and  made installing the Ring doorbell incredibly easy and we were up and running flawlessly in about 15 minutes! The app works seamlessly and provides great HD video and real-time intercom function. We snagged a sale and we couldn’t beat the price point.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,GeneInSouthFlorida,"I'm reviewing the Ring Video Doorbell Pro. I get no compensation for this review.
Pros
Only $3 per month for cloud recording of your ring pro recordings.
Ability to shrink and shape the area sensed by the motion detector which can reduce alerts of irrelevant motion like shrubs or traffic movement. Some cheaper doorbells don't offer this level of control.
Wired to your existing doorbell system. No batteries to charge or replace.
Clear 1080p video on a good wifi network.
Recordings only occur when movement is detected, the doorbell is pushed or live view is chosen. That means less demand on your wifi network. Some competitors record 24 by 7 creating more traffic on your wifi network.
Amazon bought Ring.com for a billion dollars. I believe with that kind of backing Ring will continue to improve and thrive.
There are enough positive features with this doorbell that I plan to keep it and I plan to add a couple Ring Floodlight Cams and a Ring Chime Pro for the back of the house.
I give Ring customer support an A plus! They solved my audio issue with a replacement doorbell and free return shipping of the defective doorbell.

The good news. Many of the cons listed at the bottom of my review can be resolved given knowlege, internet searching, time or money. In my case, the pros of this doorbell outweigh the cons.

Tips:
When looking at customer reviews sort them by most recent first. Ring products are changing and improving. Old reviews may no longer apply.

If your house is decades old save yourself a hassle and just buy the ring chime pro instead of using your old mechanical doorbell chime. Details of my doorbell transformer 'hassle' are listed lower in this review.

If you have problems getting the doorbell to work, buy yourself a low voltage tester (say..5 to 50 volts) from a local hardware store. They are inexpensive. Then google how to debug wired doorbell issues.

If you are replacing an old doorbell and the holes in the wall from the old doorbell don't line up with the new doorbell mount, don't start drilling just yet. Temporarily mount the new doorbell with just one of the old screw holes. Get everything setup and working with the Ring Pro. Once you are satisfied with the performance then work on a permanent mount by drilling new holes if needed. On the other hand, if you give up from frustration and decide to stick with your old doorbell you'll be glad you kept the drill in the garage. 

If you must drill into your house go just far enough to seat the plastic anchors. If you drill too far you might run the risk of hitting the doorbell wires inside the wall.

If you decide to use the angle mount supplied with the doorbell, place the flat surface side of the mount against the wall. The indented surface faces away from the wall. You will eventually mount the back of the ring pro doorbell into the indented surface of the mount.

If you live in hurricane country and want to insure the doorbell stays water resistant, get some outlet sealer (rubber sheet material) for a few bucks from a local hardware store and place a piece between the doorbell and the wall. If using the angle mount you can glue a piece of the sealer to the inside of the angle mount over the large hole in the mount but first cut a small slit in the sealer with an exacto knife so you can feed the doorbell wires through it later on. After attaching the wires to the back of the doorbell place a small piece of electrical tape over each terminal before attaching the doorbell to the mount/wall.

If you get poor video and you have fast internet have ring support bump you from 720p to 1080p. They did it for me and the video improved. The audio - not so much.

If your cell service is with t-mobile and you use one of their cellspot devices you might experience poor, choppy audio spoken from the person at the door. I re-seated the weird GPS plug in the back of the t-mobile cellspot and powered off/on the cellspot. It seemed to help a little.
I created an APN - Access Point Name on my phone and called it 'T-mobile for Doorbell' 
as described here step by step:
https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005739366-Improving-Ring-Performance-on-your-T-Mobile-Phone-by-Changing-the-Access-Point-Name
If you can't save your APN, leave off the 'dun' for APN type.

After I did all of this, the person speaking at the door was still barely audible - low volume and choppy. But Ring customer support solved the problem by shipping me a new replacement doorbell which solved the problem. Plus a return shipping label for the defective device.
I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with Ring's support staff. Their feedback, expertise and follow through were A plus!

Cons
Delays - There are times when you won't see the face of a fast moving UPS man because the camera doesn't start recording fast enough. The first thing you will see is him walking away from the door. But at least you get an alert that he was there. Most of the time the cloud recording of the event shows more of the event than a doorbell alert or live event. So give it a few minutes then go check the cloud recording.

If you have a house that is decades old, installation can require time, knowledge and handy work if you decide 'not' to buy the ring chime pro. If I had to do it again, I would buy the ring chime pro and save myself a lot of time and hassle. 
You might 'not' be happy with this doorbell if you have any of these situations:
A doorbell transformer that is weaker than 16V 30VA and you insist on keeping your mechanical doorbell chime instead of buying the ring chime pro. I think 16V 20VA is the minimum recommended transformer even without a mechanical chime.
A slow internet connection.
A router that is located a great distance from the doorbell.
Lots of movement outside you wish to exclude and no way to create a motion zone that avoids them.
You have no idea where the builder installed your old doorbell transformer. Mine was located behind the doorbell chime in my foyer inside the electrical junction box.
You bought a larger doorbell transformer $30 and discover it won't fit where the old one did. (Me).
For $50, you might be able to skip the transformer torture and just get by with a ring chime pro.
In my case I built a spacer out of wood (3/4"" thick) for mounting the doorbell chime out from the wall in order to make room for the larger transformer that stuck out past the wall opening. Time consuming.

My home configuration:
Circa 1975 Emerson Ruttenhouse clunky mechanical doorbell chime.
Purchased a Lee 78208 Doorbell Transformer 16V30VA $29 on Amazon to replace an ancient Emerson Ruttenhouse 16V10VA transformer.
Comcast download speed: 120 Mbps. Upload 10 Mbps.
Speedtest over wifi from my phone when standing near doorbell: 73 Mpbs Download, 9 Mpbs Upload. Ping 37 ms
Ring app. Device Health: 4205 mV RSSI - 53 Firmware: Up to date.
Doorbell located about 30 feet from the router with only one wall (exterior) in between.
70 feet from the doorbell to the road which I keep out of my motion zone.
Samsung Galaxy S6 phone (switched from ATT to T-mobile last year) running the Ring app.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IszONtm9Kos
With less than $9 of fiber optic strands and some scotch tape he tricks the motion detector at night into thinking its daytime so a decent color image is seen instead of the fuzzy infrared image (when the floodlights turn on due to motion). He says Ring took his suggestion and is planning to upgrade their cameras to show a color image at night when the floodlights turn on. The color image is much sharper than the b/w infrared image.",Pros - Cons - Tips

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,mb2323,"I did some research before purchasing my new doorbell and here is why I chose Ring. The installation was a piece of cake however the instructions in the box are lacking. Like most things now days, they point you to a website to watch a video for instructions. The videos are very detailed however. Also note, one thing that I learned after installing is that you may need to upgrade your doorbell transforming in order for the doorbell to get enough voltage to work correctly. There wasn't a lot on this during my research to my surprise. I could see how this could be an issue in an older home. The doorbell needs at least 16 volts to work correctly. Make sure your transformer can support that. The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars is due to the monthly fee you have to pay if you want to keep the video recordings. However, I found that you could set it up for a year instead of monthly and you can save a few bucks. Other then that, great product and I am happy with my purchase. Camera is very detailed, integrated seamlessly with my current wiring and hardware, and it is nice to know that I have security on my front door.",Great product that covers multiple areas

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2016,jhu8,"Nice item but just did not work. First, setting it up was very easy. From there though, issues began. It failed to properly work with my indoor mechanical doorbell. It just made it vibrate and hum and only would properly ring the doorbell a couple times. Next, connection times were awful. I have very good wifi in my house(no issues every with gaming, streaming movies, etc) yet it would take forever to connect. What's the point of seeing whose at my door if I have to sit there for a minute before seeing them. Also, wouldn't always get the notification even though the button was pressed. It's a great concept but just failed miserably. I was even willing to pay monthly for it. Will keep searching .","Great concept, but failed to work"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,Hank,"I purchased the Ring - Video Doorbell Pro at Best Buy. I had read the reviews on line prior to purchasing. The basic installation was easy. However, I had trouble getting it to communicate with my cell phone. I called the tech support number and they tried to correct the problem. I found out from them, the router does not penetrate drywall very well. It bounces off objects, Therefore the advertised signal travel distance of 30 feet between the router and the doorbell is restricted based on the number of walls and objects it hits prior to the signal reaching the doorbell. My cable/router/wifi, etc, are located in the rear corner of the house and my front doorbell is in the center front, I could not get a good signal strength. The signal from my router to the doorbell was very weak. Tech support did not tell me to replace the router but since it was several years old I replaced it.. This still did not solve my problem. Tech support told me to return the router to the store if I wanted, but I needed to add an ""extender"". I added an ""extender"" to the router and placed it an equal distance between the router and the doorbell. This solved the problem. But then the existing hardwired door bell chime no longer worked. Tech support sent me the wires to bypass the existing hardwired doorbell and a new remote doorbell chime. After a two week period of phone calls to tech support, my system works great. One lesson I learned from the installation experience, was that RING is a new company and has growing problems.. The tech support individuals that first answer the phone are very limited in their knowledge. If you need help with issues other than the instructions included with the product, there are only about 10 associates that can help you. You will have to make a date/time appointment for them to call back and assist you. These more advanced associates have a very good knowledge of the Ring equipment, are very patient, and great while helping you. They do e-mail you with a reference number so if you have further problems the same person will assist you. I have no complaint with tech support. The RING system works better than I expected. The camera is good. I am very satisfied with it. One thing to remember, it is an internet and WIFI system. It can only notify you when you are connected to the internet or WIFI. As long as I am connected to WIFI. it performs as advertised. I am very limited in my technical knowledge of all the new equipment that use the routers, internet and WIFI. A more tech savvy individual may have been better understood how routers connect to other items and have a better installation experience.","Met my needs, Better than expected"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Reviewer,"I really like this doorbell camera. It was extremely easy to install, but it failed every time I tried to connect it to WiFi using the app on Android. I borrowed my daughter's iOS device & it connected quickly & easily from there. The alerts are instantaneous. The doorbell rings & the app notifies me at the same time. No delay at all. When you click the notification, the picture comes up within seconds, again, almost no delay there. Multiple people can view the live video & talk through the speaker from multiple devices simultaneously, which is really nice. Meaning, if I am at work & my wife is at work & our kids come home, they can ring the doorbell & we can both see & talk to them at the same time. The only complaint is that the video will lag or freeze every few seconds. Voltage going to the camera is what it should be & the wifi signal is strong there so I'm not sure what the issue is, but overall I still love the camera.",Great for home safety

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2016,LynnL,"In theory this is a great product. If reality, the support stinks. We have a chime that is on the supported chime list, but the product does not work at night. Ring support kept saying the doorbell was not getting enough power and kept telling us to upgrade our transformer to 24v, although we kept telling them that the vendor said not to. After weeks of nothing else from them, we tried the 24v transformer and it burned out our chime. We've been waiting for over 2 weeks to get resolution from Ring and after countless more call, we have not.....

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Citibori,I like the product very much. The only problem I have is that sometimes the sensors don't set off so it doesn't record anything at all. Or sometimes they set off too late.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,sdlynx,"Having tested a number of video doorbell solutions, (Doorbird, Skybell, Skybell HD, Ring, and Ring Pro) I have found Ring Pro to be one of the better ones on the market. 

While Pro does require wiring and is not capable of being run without wiring like the original Ring, it is not extremely difficult to set up. 

Definitely be certain to check your doorbell transformer capabilities before committing to this one though. You need to have the proper voltage in order for it to work right.

Pros: Very sharp images from the camera (similar to Doorbird). Superior sound quality over many other video doorbells. More sensitivity and motion configurations available.

Cons: There is a delay between the doorbell button being pressed and the mechanical chime going off. If using a Ring Chime, it overcomes the issue. Also, it does need specific voltage to work and may not be an option for some folks.",Great system when working properly...

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Deacon,"installation and setup probably took less than 20 minutes. It has a wide view field. Video is actually pretty good. I like having the live view, being able to talk through the doorbell, and like the option to review previous activity.

Now the CONs. There is a several second delay on chimes and live view.
Also, it has detections for both doorbell presses and ""motion"". While the doorbell works well, other than the delay, the motion is highly unreliable. Most of the time it reports motion there was actually nothing on the video, and there are plenty of times where it SHOULD have showed motion but did not. If I find a package from UPS or FEDEX under the doorbell but it did not detect motion, that feels like a problem. There are also a few times where it picked up cars driving by, like 100 feet away from the camera, and reported is as motion.","easy install, easy setup, works well, but..."

I tried for 2 days going through all of the troubleshooting problems that Ring suggests trying and still didn't work. I got the Ring app to download on the phone, but that was where it ended.

I contacted support and was able to get It working again the next day after messing around for hours. Unfortunately, same thing, a couple hours later it disconnected itself from the internet. I had to completely take the doorbell off the power to reset it and get it working. I Already stripped the security screw taking the face plate on and off and sent a request for some extra from customer service. I can not return the product anymore otherwise I would, instead I may be stuck with a expensive paper weight. All other devices connected to my WiFi on different floors are staying connected. I will wait to see what customer service has me do next. Customer service is easy to work with, just hope we can get it working.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2016,Ki16,I previously owned the ring at a different home. Upgraded by buying pro and adding to account as a new device not deleting old device from old address. The setup replaced my existing ring model and deleted all my video from other device. Contacted customer service just for them to confirm that video is not recoverable and permanently deleted with new device install. I did not think this was the case because the old video titles were still in the log. Click on log and it says you must upgrade or buy cloud storage. Do not install until you download all your video. Software is poorly done so you can't bulk download your video and option not present when upgrading to keep video or move to new device. Will not support again in future. Not happy about losing some moments captured that were necessary to keep.,Caution!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Xergxies,"I helped a buddy of mine install one of these last year. It was a nightmare, they had to send me a part, then I had to buy a new power supply (instead of using my doorbell power), etc. Turns out it was a defective unit. Once up and running, it worked great. I bought one for my home and it was setup within 20 minutes. The main reason I went with Ring was because 1) could use a new doorbell, 2) $3/month subscription seems reasonable. I set the area to monitor for motion (so I don't get false positives as cars drive by) and I tell it when to give me an audible alert (although it records every time there is motion, it only alerts me now between 8 pm and 9 am). Picture is very clear, wide angle, two-way audio works, and you can answer your doorbell from anywhere in the world. I hope they get the problems sorted out with their floodlight cams, because I really like the way this doorbell works and I'd rather install floodlights with a cam in my backyard, than just a stick up cam.",Exactly what we needed.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,ringrangrungdud,"I'm an EE and BME, i.e. not my first rodeo. Ring's first device failed out of the box but not until their tech group insisted this issues were on my end. First it was a new transformer to boost the power. Not the problem, then it was a new wireless router, a new wireless access point and a wireless booster. They gave me the booster, whoopee!. (I already had enough range to link to my house from my neighbor's house 300 ft away before changing out any of it!.) Then it was that I needed to dump my interior electro-mechanical door bell for a digital one. Then they said it must be their Ring-pro and to send it back for a new one. In the end it turned out to be one of the diodes ($0.25) they originally supplied for use with the interior doorbell. Ahh but the end is not the end. The ring-pro worked for a few months and then began to require regular re-boots and then just stopped. No interior doorbell sound, no video no nothing. I'm probably out $400 not counting the $195 for the Ring-pro and my time! This all took the better part of a year.",Technology not ready for market

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2017,Disappointed,"I would guess that no reviewers have tested the Ring Pro doorbell after the 30 day free cloud storage service? The paperwork says it works without cloud access, but believe me, it is a terrible experience. With no cloud service, you still get alerts on your phone, but the only way to view whatever caused the alert is to each time manually activate the live view function. That is a ridiculous hassle, besides the fact that by the time you do that, then whatever caused the alert is very often already gone. All of those alerts build up in your phone and it doesn't take long to have hundreds of alerts, because you cannot delete them, because each time you try to delete them, all you get is a blue nag screen with them trying to sell you the cloud service. I do not need the cloud service, and without the cloud, this doorbell is a horrible experience. I also believe that with the cost of this doorbell being relatively high, there is no excuse for the cloud service to even be a requirement to begin with. I believe that Ring has misrepresented the usage of this doorbell. Lastly, after a few days of use, I gave Ring a fantastic review. After 30 days, after the free cloud service ended, I sent in a second review saying that I was revising my original review to say that I was disgusted with their product.",Disappointed

At the end the doorbell no longer showed any video at all and I was told to pay $100 for a new warranty or buy a new one. $250 is expensive for a doorbell that only lasts 1.5 years and then has to have a $100 a year plan to replace it.,Nice while it lasted

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,Pirate,The basic idea behind the Ring video doorbell pro is that you can have video access to your doorbell while away from home. This product fails at its basic design. I have had nothing but problems with it since purchase and have even had a warranty exchange from Ring. Being away from home for long periods of time I thought I was buying piece of mind but instead purchased headache. If the doorbell goes offline for any of the many reasons then the only way to reset it is to be at home where the doorbell is. It is not possible to reset it remotely. Customer service is easy to contact and very friendly but not helpful at all in actually fixing the issues.,Dont waste your money

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2017,Earlyadaptor,"Ring Video Doorbell Pro. The old saying the 3rd time is the charm explains perfectly the experience of the newest ring pro video doorbell. First one connected to my system but then in one day it stopped working. Tech support from Ring was very helpful and despite trouble shooting the final assessment was faulty product. Returned to Best Buy for exchange. The 2nd attempt failed right out of the box, the new installed unit could not make a connection to my wifi. Ring support again helpful in trouble shooting and determined once again faulty unit. Instead of heading back to Best Buy for a third unit Ring.com offered to exchange my unit for a factor fresh unit which took 2 days to receive. They not only sent me a replacement but also the packaging material to return the faulty one. The 3rd unit connected immediately and worked as advertised. 
Pro's. Impressive camera and sound clarity, easy to install (once you get a unit that works) and easy to set up. Tech support from Ring was very responsive.
Con's. Price seems on the high side, 2 faulty units. Alert delays when someone is at the door sometimes seem long as compared to what is expected with people who are standing at the door . Time frame breaks out in the following pattern. Some arrives at the door 10 or 20 seconds before an alert is triggered. Then after the alert the time spent to activate and open the ring app. to respond can take another 10 to 20 seconds thus leaving the person at the doors experience (now at minute +/- wondering if anyone is home. May not seem like much but you stand at a door after ring the bell for 40 seconds or more and see how you feel about delays.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2016,deano,Had a number of problems with installation and troubleshooting. The problem with the Pro unit is that it requires a faster uplink internet speed (at least 2Mbps) as compared with the original (1Mbps). Also the minimum voltage requirements are 16V ac where the original is 8V ac. I only bought the Pro as it would fit my home siding where the original would not.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,Galette,"I read a lot of reviews regarding this product and decided to take go for the pro version for different reason.

1)The size. It still bigger as my previous doorbell but it blended well on my porch
2)4 Plate colors. The regular version has only 1 and the fact you can choose between 4 it is nice. I was going to use the nickel color but finally decided to use the bronze one. 
3)Live view : From the Ring App, you have access to a live view
4)Zone setup : Pro version is able to tweak the zone and it will help you not to have to many notification

The installation probably took me less than 30min. The video installation is well done and it easy to pause and go to the next steps.
When you are all done with te physical installation and connect it to your wireless, the ring pro will probably update for 5 min and you should be good to go.

Before buying this product, I will make sure you have an enough strong wireless signal.
I did an internet speed test with my phone and it was perfect.

So far I did not experience any long delays (but I believe it has to do with the wireless connection). The time somebody is pressing the doorbell, you received the notification 1/2 sec later and it is ringing inside your house too.
The video quality is really good during the day or at night.",This is working great

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,Rhostam,"I've built out a decent home automation system. One of the few things I was missing was more pro-active presence sensors at points of entry and sensitive spots around my home. After reading review upon review upon review, I decided to take the plunge and opt for the Ring Pro Doorbell. There are a few reasons for my choice:

1. Compatible for use with nearly every platform: iPhone, Android, Windows 10 PC and Mobile*(!!)
2. It is hardwired. Though I am confident a nice set of batteries will deliver the experience of some other units, you can't beat hardwired for reliability in most things.
3. Expandable system. Though I have cameras from other vendors, I don't like how they work after living with them for a while. Ring provides a host of solutions that all work together and that are managed by the same app. I may not be able to interact with Ring directly with my home automation system**, but that is actually something I can live with given the flexibility and functionality this portfolio offers.
4. Cloud hosted recordings. The device takes ""short"" video clips and stores them in the cloud. This means that as alerts are triggered you can see what is approaching/moving as the movement occurs (usually instantly, occasionally with slight few second delay) or well after it occurs. You can also easily share a clip with others. Great for sending to neighbors (nextdoor.com, for ex) or local law enforcement should something happen.
5. Acclaimed ease-of-use and support. After my purchase, I did encounter an issue***, but it quickly became a non-issue due to the fact that support was fast and awesome. You can't beat great customer service.
6. Peace of mind. I have mine presently configured to notify me when a particular zone is triggered. I know when people (or animals) approach before they even get close enough to my home (or press the doorbell). If there is movement at night, I just open the app and see. Usually it's a neighborhood stray, but it's nice knowing I have visibility to what is going on immediately surrounding my home.

* I use a Windows 10 PC and my family uses Windows 10 Mobile phones. The UWP app is both fast and flawless. Great work!
** I use SmartThings Home Automation system. It is remarkably extensible and provides an enormous amount of flexibility at the cost of setup effort. Getting products not explicitly designed to work with this platform can usually be done, but not without some effort. Thankfully, the community is SMART and they are awesome at coming up with ingenious ways to make things work and do things. Ring, for instance, doesn't directly integrate, but we are able to use IFTTT to tie them together in useful ways.
*** I was mistaken when I thought my existing home doorbell was hard-wired. It wasn't and the thing in place was just wireless. The house was wired at some point. I saw the transformer, wires, and even former mount, but the wires were call clipped and the transformer was old (providing 10V). So, I installed a new transformer from Home Depot (16V) and bought some new doorbell wire and ran a new connection to the front of my home. Before connecting things up, I wanted to confirm with support a wiring configuration. Two different documents seemed to say different things and, though they were for different models, I just wanted to be sure. Well, they set me straight and confirmed that both documents apply only to their specific models. They did say that in my config (no existing active hardwired doorbell), that I'd need a special part instead of the stuff that came with the unit. They sent me that part (which is just a F1AL250V fuse enclosure) AND a free Ring Chime. The Chime was provided because I didn't have an existing active doorbell. It provides a doorbell function (in addition to the mobile device and app notification). I'm glad I called and it really was nice that they helped me out so quickly.

Final note. It is a well worth it buy. I love it. It is my favorite device in my entire setup. I know when people come and go. I am not paranoid, but stuff happens.",Sleek and functional security device that provides

The enclosed directions were exactly what was needed. The hardest part was taking off the indoor chime cover to add the little attachment in there. Installation was done in less than 30 min and the video quality is amazing. The ability to set a motion area is also very helpful. The included wedges to angle the doorbell to the exact angle you require is also very useful. I had to do some tuning to the sensitivity of the motion but that was the only adjustment needed.

Install is a breeze and i had it installed in literally 5 minutes. 
Instructions and App are very intuitive would give the app a 9 out of 10 because there were some things that were a little misleading but they were quick to figure out.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,MJS28,"I had read a lot of reviews and narrowed it down to the Ring Pro or the Nest and decided to go with the Ring for 3 main reasons. 
1) The cloud service is $3.00 or $30/year compared to the Nest $10/month
2) It can handle lower temperatures which is nice for Midwest living
3) Setting up motion zones is included in the app and you don’t have to subscribe to the cloud service

I will say the first doorbell I bought was defective, but support answered right away and was extremely friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I had to return the first one, but the 2nd one worked perfectly.

It was easy to setup and the video quality works great. The Pro model is quicker than earlier versions of Ring so you will be able to turn on the camera while the visitor is standing there. You may see other reviews complaining about latency, but that is for older models of the Ring doorbell. The Pro addresses all those issues.

The neighborhood watch feature is a nice bonus, but was not the main reason for getting this. Luckily the only video alert I have received for this feature is someone who found a lost cat. 

So far this has been a great purchase.",Great video doorbell

Motion activity zones, and recording options are easy to setup and work as designed. The picture quality in daytime is excellent. The one item keeping this from 5 stars is the night vision. I had a SkyBell HD prior to this Ring Pro, and with its integrated LED, it had full color night recording. The Ring has standard infrared nightvision that, in my application, is subpar to the Skybell, but the Skybell application and motion detection were not as good.",Works as advertised

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,BJWIllinois,"I bought this after researching companies like ADT, etc. This was so easy to install with the existing wiring for the doorbell that was on my front door, and I don't need to worry about battery replacement or charging. The Ring app works great on my phone and tablet, and I get really good images, even at night. Comes with 30 days free cloud storage and after that, it is $30/year per camera. I also installed the floodlight camera in my back yard, so for $60/year, I have peace of mind that I can control with my phone, even when not at home. I can talk to the person at the door, warn them away or even sound a siren on the floodlight cam. I would highly recommend this product.",Home security that you control
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2016,RingVideoDoorbellPro,"After a friend showed me her Ring doorbell, I began researching a few video doorbell solutions before choosing Ring. Holding out a few more days made me lucky enough to earn time to find the Ring Doorbell Pro.

A few differences between the Ring doorbell Pro and the standard Ring doorbell. The pro REQUIRES a preexisiting, wired doorbell. The standard doorbell can be charged by USB and mounted anywhere. An advantage the pro offers is that it can tap in to the existing chime and ring your already installed door bell. It also includes in infrared booster kit, and higher quality camera and motion sensing.

The Ring Doorbell Pro came with everything I needed to install it, including a screwdriver and drill bit. Instructions were very clear. On first installation I was unable to see any video. I contacted customer service and was very surprised at the high quality of service I received. I have also been contacted multiple times by the company and been included in the insider's program.

The doorbell functions very well. Motion and rings notifications are almost immediate to my phone, on Wifi at home or on cell outside of my home. Video and audio has been clear every time.

I have had a few instances where the doorbell lost connectivity. I would receive not notification. A simple hard reset corrected the problems. There is very little home automation integration, but representatives from Ring say that it is coming. Video recordings can be browsed through your device or the Internet, but after the first 30 days require a subscription. $30 a year for cloud recording storage is acceptable to me, but be aware without it you won't be able to view your saved recordings.","Great Customer Support, Unexpected Fun for Guests"

Only con is that there is a little lag time and by the time I open my app I have to wait for it to load in review mode to see who was at my door if they already left.

It is very easy to install and the instructions and video are very very helpful for the regular/non-handy person. With that being said, there is room for improvement. My biggest complain is the lag in having the video available for review. If the mailman leaves a package, rings the doorbell and leaves, by the time I answer the doorbell on my phone he already left, but if I want to see who rang, it takes a little while for the video to be available for review.

The infrared sensor that detects motion can be programmed to variable sensitivity levels and to only pick up motion in certain spots.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2018,sparkyj,"This is my 1st go at any type of outdoor camera system. The install was pretty straight forward, as was setting it up with the app. The image quality is very good and the microphone allows for clear communication. That is where the good stops! The notifications are very slow, the time from when someone rings the doorbell and you get the notification is too long, sometimes the person is halfway down the driveway by the time the app opens. If you want to review any of your recordings you must subscribe to Ring's Cloud service for $3/$10 per month. There is no way to record to your computer or a different cloud. Even if you dabble in coding, there is no API to access the product. It integrates with some Home Security Systems like ADT, but not Xfiniity. Bottomline - it is a very high dollar device without a lot of features that come standard on some lower priced competitors. Would I buy it again? Probably not. Would I recommend Ring? It would be a highly qualified recommendation, but probably not.",Easy to install and setup. But that is about it!

Some things to note:
1. It did auto update for about 20 minutes after initial setup and the video features were not available during that period. Just wait until the ring is no longer flashing white. 
2. At one point I had logged in to my iphone and iPad using the same account login. The bell acted very weird at this time. It would only perform a half ring and seemed to not want to alert on either device. I would recommend having a separate account for every mobile device. You have one master and can add guest accounts that can do everything except change camera settings.",Great doorbell camera. Easy to set up
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Dec 2019,FLfromLJ,"The Rring Pro is hard-wired, so I don’t have to worry about battery life.  The ability to see who is at the door and speak to the person on my Echo Show in order to decide it this is someone for whom I will leave what I am doing to open the door are security and convenience factors that I value highly.  If I am not at home, I can go the the Ring app and re-play the video of what triggered the motion sensor.  I do have the sensor programmed for people, but my neighbor’s dogs, who often wander over, trigger the video feed as well.

At $30 per year for the cloud maintenance of video recordings, it is a bargain.  I regularly delete recordings of myself coming and going to save space and so that I don’t have to weed through many recordings if I want to find a particular one to re-play.

Also, although the product description reads “satin nickel,” the Ring Pro came with other covers and I chose the black to blend in with my decor.

I would have given the product 5 stars if the image did not have a “fishbowl” distortion and if I could have set the parallel distance more precisely so that my next-door neighbors did not set off the motion sensor when they leave their house.  The length-wise parameters are fine: I do like to see the approach on the sidewalk leading to my front door.  Once, a suspicious stranger stopped a few feet from my door, looked around and then left.  I am keeping that video in case he returns.",Security and Convenience
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Jun 2020,rkvanarsdel,"Works great! 

Install was fairy easy once I drilled through the brick for the mounting screws. I tried using the masonry drill bit that Ring provided, and it was not working well. After struggling with that for a bit I switched over to one of my personal drill bits and it only took about 10 seconds to finish drilling the holes. So that is on me for trusting the tools that were provided.

After install, setting up the device is super easy. Took maybe 2-3 minutes. There are lots of settings that you can customize. The motion zones is great because you block out certain areas that are ""high traffic"" like sidewalks and the street. 

This works well with my amazon devices as well. It took longer for me to setup the doorbell with Amazon, than it did to setup the actual device.",Great Purchase!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Fazio,"Was super excited about getting this installed, but really disappointed me afterwards. Unit was simple to get installed and configured, just as all the videos and other reviews stated. Where this fell short was...Someone comes to my door, yes I get notified via ring app ""sometimes"" there's a 5-10 second delay between them pressing the doorbell and my actual doorbell going off. When we were playing with it, the speaker quality was not all up to snuff. We having to bend over to listen to what is said. I think I may have a bunk system. The same issues were said to Ring Customer Service, but all they could come up with was my wireless strength was a little weak, and I didn't have enough power going to the doorbell.

Don't misunderstand me...This Ring doorbell is a GREAT thing to have. Camera quality is amazing, the microphone picks everything up, one really neat feature is I could pan and zoom and see what those neighbors are up to. Night time visibility is great.

Picture is shockingly clear in any light conditions. Little over sensitive to movement but I’d rather have it that way. One draw back is you pretty much have to install it to know if you like the location or if you need to use the tilting blocks.

 Second is plan on spending 30 bucks a year on the subscription. Glorified front door intercom if you don’t have the ability to store the footage from the camera.  If you don’t pay there is 0 video accept when you go live.",Easy to install

At first we had some issues with the door bell ringing and notifying us, but when we went to view the it only showed an all black image. It still does it from time to time, but it has gotten better. When the image does come through it is crystal clear. The audio needs some improvement, but it isn't terrible. I know that the Ring Pro has some bad reviews, I am sure that as they release more firmware updates the performance will become more consistent.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,robreed,"Love the ring. Best part is the ability to see videos of past ""rings."" Our internet tends to be a little iffy. When we try and answer a ring or motion, it may not work right away. Without the saved video option, we can miss the motion trigger.

In order to see saved video of the Ring (if you missed the call, or weren't able to respond right away), you have to pay a monthly fee for such access.

Device should be far less expensive if they seek to make more annual money off the purchasers.

Otherwise, easy install. Good installation instructions. Just disappointing add on money requirements.",The concept is great -- the addon sales disappoint

One major con for me and only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
At my door the doorbell setting was on a mini side wall which mean the ring faces the other mini wall on the other side of the door. That means The camera is not pointing to the front of the house, I cannot use the motion feature (no point) and a bit harder to see who rang the bell.

Simple solution allow to redirect the camera module or make the entire body movable!! I was hoping to fins some 3rd party developing some sort of a case that will allow me to change the camera angle but with no luck.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Frank404,"I own an August lock and was originally going to buy the August doorbell in order to have everything within one ecosystem.

Unfortunately, my August bell did not work and had to be returned, but I was determined to have a smart bell that day when I was setting everything up with my door.

During the Black Friday sales, Best Buy had the first model Ring on sale for $99. I started comparing the 3 different models and how they compared to the August bell as well.

The smaller footprint of the Ring Pro was a nice draw since it's not as apparent and looks a bit more like a traditional doorbell.

The higher quality camera was a bonus, and the fact that it did infrared vision at night rather than the spotlight LED of the August bell was also a nice feature.

Living on the curve of my block, my doorbell faces the street. The fact that the Ring Pro allows me to designate alert zones is a tremendous help since I've been able to create zones for my lawn and my door for triggers without getting alerted for every car that drives down the street or person that walks their dog on the sidewalk.

Lastly, our door does not have a peephole, so being able to get the alerts and get a live view of my door when it's rung is unbelievably handy. Working from home, there's been a noticeable increase in the number of solicitors I notice knocking on my door, so being able to screen the door and know whether it's worth walking downstairs to answer the door is worthwhile or not.

An absolute recommendation if you're looking to upgrade to a smart doorbell :)",Great addition to my home!
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,SLOzuke,"We purchased the Ring Pro after hearing news stories of local residents catching prowlers and would-be burglars on video camera footage. The instructions were pretty clear and setup was not too complicated, though we had a contractor do the install because he had to drill into an old stucco wall which we were afraid may crumble. The unit has a clean look, the 1080p video is very clear, and the sound is surprisingly decent. Being able to watch live views and get notifications of movement with mobile phone notifications is a great feature, as is the cloud storage of past video events. The only issue we have had is the unit occasionally goes offline by itself and won't come back online until it is manually reset by poking an included tool into a hole in the unit. This problem would render the unit worthless if we were out of town when this actually happened. We've had the Ring Pro about 4 months and it's only had this error like 3-4 times so far. Also, when you use your phone to voice the speaker in the doorbell, visitors can hardly hear you unless they stick their ear right up to the unit or it is absolutely silent in your front yard with zero traffic. Hopefully they can fix that with some kind of software update in the future. With the exception of these issues, we are happy overall with the unit and it does bring us some piece of mind.",Slick video doorbell with a few issues

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Rotorhead2,"The Ring doorbell has exceeded our expectations so far.  It had by far the best installation instructions and documentation of any gadget, gizmo, or device that I've purchased.  Installation was very straight forward, taking less than 30 minutes. Once installed, the app is very configurable, as is the area monitored by the camera. This is very useful in our situation, and makes possible the minimization of nuisance alerts from a nearby parking area.  Excellent product and support.",The Ring doorbell does many things well!
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,wolfen68,"Yes, they do work and help you keep an eye on what's going on around your house. Even with great WIFI coverage, this can be a little bit of a pain in the butt to get connected and running. Even then, sometimes we have a hard time seeing what's going on when we get alerts, but it is mostly because of low cell signal. When we have good cell signal, it works pretty much most of the time and the video comes right up. Great addition to any security system.",Excellent security device!
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Rcas,Installation and setup was easy. Video quality is great. The only issue is it will pick up cars and people going by even though they are outside the motion zones.,Sleep and painless
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Mike550,"I found it very easy to install. There is a module that has to be installed to your indoor chime. Pretty simple, it took me more time to figure out how to position it inside the chime cover than hook it up. The main module then replaces the doorbell chime. After downloading the app to my iPhone, setting up an account and connecting to my Wi-Fi was painless
After adjusting motion the detection area it works great.. Pushing the button operates the indoor chimes as well as sending a notification to your phone. Seeing who is at the door triggering the motion detector or answering a doorbell ring when away from home is really awesome. The video is HD and recorded to your account for replay.

I have since had one problem, absolutely nothing to do with BEST BUY or the product. My ring.com doorbell is in a porch. To get the camera to span the best view I needed a wedge piece to angle the camera a few degrees. RING.COM offer a ""Corner Kit"" on their website for such adjustment, so I ordered it directly from them online. They notified me it was shipped over a month ago and sent a FedEx tracking # that said shipment info has been sent to FedEx. Later contacting ring.com they advised it was temporarily out of stock. After about two weeks waiting I asked them to cancel the order, which they agreed to do the next day. Nothing since, no refund or product shipped. I finally made my own wedge and fixed the camera position.
Bottom line, the product works great, but their customer service is terrible.",Superb Product (if you have high speed wi-fi)

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,bethesdalover28,"We recently moved across town and joined an app to get to know our new neighbors. One of the first things we noticed was how often people complained about someone breaking into their car and rifling though papers. We decided security was pretty important here, and set out to find a camera. The Ring appealed to us because we heard about potential Home Kit integration, and it looked slick and easy to install and use. For the most part we've been very happy with it. After joining a couple owner groups, it's been pretty obvious that the company is making some changes to the firmware and it's had an impact on the performance. Videos do come up, but they take a while. In addition, sometimes they're fairly jumpy. I'm confident the company will iron out the kinks, but do keep in mind this might have some minor teething problems. 

I will say it was super easy to install, even on my brick wall, using the included tools and masonry bit. And it looks slick. If it ever gets HomeKit integration and the videos are a bit snappier it's an easy 5-star.",Awesome! Could use a little more work.
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Jaclyn9095,"I have 4 Ring products. I have the slim doorbell wired in in place of my regular doorbell. I have this wireless doorbell on my ""friends and family"" entrance by my driveway and two wireless cameras for the backyard/door and for the driveway. The problem for this doorbell (because of the way my door is set back, not flush with the front of the house). It took a while playing with the setting to get it where we don't have a lot of false alarms, while still detecting motion before it gets to the door. Cars / people walking dogs will set it off if set out too far, but I won't get notified that my son is at the door until after he is already in the house, if not set out that far. 
The other issue I have with the Ring system is that if you don't answer when the motion is detected and you want to see what set it off, if you don't have the cloud storage for the additional fee (there are several options, I chose $100 / yr for unlimited cameras), you can't see what set it off. 
The part of the app where you can talk to someone at the door works well for my husband's IPhone and from my desktop PC. It does not work well with my older Galaxy in a lifeproof case (can barely be heard).
I do like the simplicity of the system. The set up was easy. The app is fairly easy to use. I would recommend this, just be aware of its limitations.",Understand its limitations

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,SPontiac,"I've had the Ring Video Door Bell for a month. Overall, I'm happy with the functionality, the camera and ease of use. 

It was easy to install and set-up and it connected to the WiFi easy enough. It's works well during the day and at night, but the day-time view is much better. The camera view is really good, as I can see and pick-up motion at least 200 feet away. The App on my smart phone works well, and accessing the App and viewing activity is easy to do.

My issues are, it doesn't always (rarely happens) pick up motion. I haven't figured out if it's my WiFi and the WiFi connection to the Doorbell or the Ring Unit itself. And there is a little lag-time between the motion and the time my smartphone will ring, acknowledging the motion. 

However, overall I'd say I'm happy with the Ring Video Pro, as it gives me visibility to my home, front door and street which i never had before. The $30 annual cost for the cloud storage of your motion activity is not significant. 

I'd recommend it.",Ring - Video Doorbell Pro Works Well

The video doorbell (and the Pro model specifically) is a quality product.
Installation was straightforward. The only issue I had was with the power box that attaches to my existing mechanical doorbell - for some reason that isn't triggering (I have a fiber internet connection, so I know it's not bandwidth). What I did to ""fix"" this problem was get the $29 Ring Chime, plug that in and that is the perfect companion for everyone buying the doorbell, in my opinion since you can customize the doorbell ring at any time (we've got Christmas carols playing now...)
I definitely recommend Ring, the only thing that I dislike is the high fee they charge for monthly live video and cloud storage - their top competitor includes 7 days for free and I wish Ring would do something similar.",Works As Advertised - which is a good thing!

i will admit there are delays approx 5-15 seconds depending on the day but good enough Considering we are using wi-fi. 

If you temper your expectations and realize that this is Not a full blown security system that costs at least 1-2K to install, you'll love this product. 

I think the best feature of this product is the live view. You can click DL your app and view live anytime to see what's going on in front of your house just for the heck of it if you're passing time or just plain paranoid about your security.

She loves to be able to talk to the person through the two way intercom and it makes the person think someone is home when there is not. Definitely a great way to support a greater sense of security for someone that lives alone. 

One note. Where her doorbell was installed it doesn’t face toward the walk up. So, we found a kit that will angle the doorbell so with the fisheye lense it provides a great observation angle.

I read about people running into connectivity issues but I've encountered none so far. I have a fairly new modem/router combo (not from the cable company) so that may be what's making it work better. That and its setup in the living room in close proximity to both the unit and the chime.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,nmagz3,"I finally narrowed my security camera search to this. There are so many options but when Ring came out wih the second version I highly considered it. It's great for when you're out of town, expecting a package, or just want to see who's at the door without getting up from the couch. It was a pretty easy install for an average DIYer as myself. Compared to other doorbells it's very slim and minimal. It has several faceplates that you can choose from to match your home color. There is a slight lag when there is motion or if the doorbell rings. I can't pinpoint if hats from my internet or if I is from the Ring itself. The first month of cloud storage is free and then $3 a month or $30 a year which is much cheaper. There are a lot more comprehensive monitoring systems out there. But this one fits my needs.

It is actually picks up motion better than the Arlo Pro 2 in my experience as I have both. Daytime video is crisp. Nighttime video isn't as crisp but it is decent. I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed. Just make sure your current doorbell system is compatible with this version of the Ring or you will need to upgrade your current system. Also the $3 dollar a month service for your video library is very cheap and worth it.

I am very pleased with the Ring Pro doorbell. Great gift idea, especially for those turn in their home into a “smart home “.

It can begin recording even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell; it just depends on your settings. I had to buy another transformer which is easy to install as my original doorbell worked off 9 volts. The Ring Pro requires more volts to work without interruption.

Making sure you have access to your doorbell chime, and shutting off power to it, is probably the hardest part. Instructions, including what might need to be retrofitted, are all laid out for you, for both the chime and doorbell. Both were super simple and able to be installed in the existing locations of each. 

SETUP
After turning the power back on and downloading the app to my mobile phone, I was stepped through setting up an account and configuring my doorbell. From opening the box to completely setup was less than an hour! 

USAGE
I installed this the day before Halloween, knowing it would get crazy usage. Sure enough, it held up! The video quality is really clear. 

You will not be disappointed by this doorbell!","Easy To Install, Well Designed, Great To Use"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2019,KjMo,"My wife and I first upgraded our cell phones to Galaxy S10s so that we would both have more modern phones and would be able to utilize more apps than our old S4s would hold.  A week later we bought a Ring Pro doorbell.  I installed it per the instructions and downloaded the app to my phone.  Live View on WiFi produced beautiful, clear hi-def 1080 views.  The recordings of the events were also beautiful and clear.  When I tried it on my Sprint data, we would sometimes not be able to see the person in front of the doorbell in Live View, or the picture would pixelate and slowly turn into a blob that was unrecognizable.  In all cases the person at the door would hear their own voice echoing back out at them, and had a very hard time hearing us talking to them.  It made conversation between us and the guest at the door impossible.  In effect, the doorbell would  not do what you see on all of the TV commercials where you could talk to the person at the door and also see them.  I uninstalled the Ring Pro as well as the app, then reinstalled everything.  At this point I had about 4 hours into trying to make this work.  I went back to Best Buy where we bought the Ring Pro and they suggested that the issue was with my Sprint data plan - basically it was too slow and would not show 1080 in real time.  It was basically for downloading 480 content online such as Netflix.  We went to Sprint.  Sprint ran speed tests and said it should work, but it we upgraded our unlimited plan to higher speed on our two phones (for $10/month/phone) this should alleviate the problem.  We bit the bullet and upgraded at the additional monthly cost.  It didn't fix the problem.  I called the Ring help number (the first of four calls to them).  The Ring technical support people were very nice and tried very hard to fix my problem.  They even sent me a replacement doorbell, which involved again shutting off power, removing the first doorbell, installing the second doorbell, and retesting.  I now had another 4 hours into getting the doorbell to work as advertised.  During my third call to Ring tech support it was suggested that I get a WiFi extender for in-between the router and the doorbell, which are only 12 feet apart.  Back at Best Buy they recommended the Ring Chimes Pro rather than just a WiFi Extender, for compatibility.  They KNEW this would fix the issues.  Came home, set up the Chimes Pro which went very quickly, and still had the same issues.  I was now up to 16 hours spent on this.  My 4th call to RIng tech support got the freezing problem to stop on data, but the echoing still occurred.  I am now waiting to hear back from Ring as they sent the issue ""up"" to a special group who would troubleshoot my issue utilizing three or four video I had to send them so they could hear the echo.  Again, everything worked fine (except the echoing) on WiFi, but when you are away from home and someone is at your door, when will you be on WiFi.  You won't, you'll be on your cell phone data to use the Ring Pro.  My wife and I have since rebooted the router, uninstalled the app, rebooted our phones, reinstalled the app, rebooted our phones, and still have the same issues.  Sometimes I don't even see the person through the doorbell while I am talking to them and they are hearing their own voice echoing back at them through the doorbell.  Sometimes part of the view will freeze and then unfreeze.  After 17 hours of troubleshooting and four hours on the phone with Ring tech support, I am waiting to hear back.  Throughout all of this, the recorded videos from each event show up perfectly, it's just the live view that is not working correctly.  I am trying to decide whether to keep the Ring Pro and just ask the guest or burglar to wait about 2 minutes so I can view the recorded video to see who was at my door.  So as my Summary says, I'm not sure what to say about the Ring Pro.  If the problems get resolved I would probably give this 5 stars.  The motion detection works VERY well and notifies us all day long as we have construction going on in our area and there is a lot of traffic going by.  The videos of these events are very good.  I just have to wait about 1 to 2 minutes to view the events.  If I keep it I am just going to use it for what went on in the past and not worry about what is going on real-time.  It's just a very expensive doorbell for just that purpose, especially since I also bought the Chimes Pro to go with it.",Not sure what to say about the Ring Pro

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,seatown,After an attempted burglary I felt the need for some sort of camera solution for my home. I chose Ring Doorbell Pro specifically because of the wireless solution. The camera works great and the 2 way communication is a bonus. Now i know who comes to my door regardless if they ring the doorbell or not. I did have an issue initially after install but come to find out it was a firmware problem that was corrected within days. Customer service was helpful. Having a solid fast internet connection is a must or the video is sometimes choppy. I added the Ring Chime that has a wifi extender built in and quickly solved my problem. $30 for a year of cloud recording is a bit steep however. Overall i am happy with this product.

Much smaller than the original and I was able to locate this on my door frame.The original Ring gave me too many false alerts. This one has the zones that cut down on false alerts by 90%. Very impressed with the video quality and how quick the live view is. I also really like the 5GHz that the Pro has. My wifi router is centrally located so the 5GHz signal at the front door is really good.

My only con is my mechanical doorbell chime doesn't ring with the same sound. It only does the ""ding"" and not the ""ding-dong"". I'll be contacting Ring about this.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,AmyGee,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase decision. What led me to Ring was; high customer satisfaction, detailed installation instructions (both written and video) and favorable cloud storage fee. 

Once installed, my husband and I are now able to see (and interact (converse) if we so choose) with whomever visits our front door regardless if they ring the doorbell or not. 

Video is nicely detailed (daytime or nighttime) and stored on the Ring Cloud. You can review, save or delete as you so choose. Ring Cloud usage is no-cost for the 1st month, then you pay a reasonable fee monthly or by the year. You choose the plan that best fits your finances.

It works! Great picture clarity and about a 1.5 sec delay from the time it notifies you someone is at the door, to when it connects on your screen, but that varies with my phones signal strength and the amount of programs running in the background. I love that I can customize the zones in an odd pattern, instead of the half circle zone we used to have in our first gen Ring. However, sometimes it's a little touchy with the cars going by, but my street is about 8 feet from my doorstep and we anticipated this, regardless of the zone we assign AND with the ""people only"" detection on. We simply changed the frequency of alerts, or silence them when we need no interruptions. We like that we can connect it with Alexa, too. Super cool, since we can't hear the doorbell ring upstairs and don't always have our phones on us when the app alerts come on; Alexa just tells me someone is at my door, on the Alexa's I assign, and it works!",Great product

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,DblR,Been wanting to get a doorbell camera for some time now. Finally took the leap and bought a ring. Like the different color cover options. The install was quick and painless. Picture quality is good. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone.,Doorbell Camera
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Clam,So far so good. Instructions are sort of Ikea inspired. Lots of photos and diagrams for stuff like putting in screws. But generally good info. The power supply is primarily important to make sure you have from existing door bell wiring.,Easy to set up
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,secure4home23,"I was told that installing the Ring would be simple and setting up the app simple as well. I was talking to an iPhone user and figured my Android phone would have some kinks.
I was greatly surprised that I was not difficult at all. I replaced my existing doorbell ringer and all is amazingly well.",Easy to install and set up!
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,LSUEngineer,Great camera and app. Easy install. Only reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is the slow response. It seems like most people are walking away by the time I answer the alert even though I answer it as soon as it alerts me. Otherwise love the ability to adjust the motion detection so that it doesn’t pickup passing cars.,Easy install works well

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,okbuyer,"Overall installation wasn't that bad, except took a bit of time to review the installation video, and the instruction to get it working.

I like the motion zones alert setting which can reduce getting false alert when cars passing thru on the road. 

I have yet to sign up the Ring Protect Plan. However it is a bit unclear on the lifetime purchase protection if that requires subscription to the ring protect plan?",Like the motion zone

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,CaptBakerUSMC,Love the Ring Doorbell.  A lot of peace of mind when your phone alerts you to the fact that someone is at your front door. Provides very clear video. Would recommend that you have Geek Squad install the product. Well worth the money to have an assist from these highly trained technicians.,Great Security Device
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Reviewer42,"The quality of the video is good enough to identify someone that comes to the door. Unfortunately, they need to get pretty close to really make out any defining facial features. Being able to set zones was key to preventing too many false alarms but I’ve found that the light from headlights shining on your yard will Trigger an alert if the yard is in the set zone.",Meets Expectations

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,foxymom,"We had quite a bit of trouble getting it to work properly, but the folks at Ring were so helpful. Their customer service is wonderful--very patient and willing to help. There are videos to help you get it set up and normally it isn't supposed to be hard to do (my sisters had no problems), but for some reason, we had trouble getting it online. Now that it's working properly I have to say that it works wonderfully! You can set it to pick up all motion or just when someone rings your doorbell or both. Video quality is superb. I recommend buying this product just for added security. It's been helpful in letting us know when a package has been left on the porch.",Excellent video quality
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Elobo,"This is the second time buying  a ring doorbell, I highly recommend anybody who hasn’t bought one get one. The camera on the doorbell works great and it’s very clear. Great to see who’s at the door and for security.",Great Doorbell.
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,RobH,"This is a great doorbell has a video infrared speaker microphone and Wi-Fi built-in along with the ability to manage multiple user accounts.

The downside of this doorbell is that the tiny speaker on the bottom of it is hard to hear and often is not loud enough to have a conversation without a lot of work by both parties. For the premium price, Ring should have a better speaker option.

I have purchased two Ring Doorbell Pro and two additional Chime speakers not appropriate for outdoor use (chime) but great for indoor use.

The Pro does a better job by far than the original, has color options but DOES require 16v ac power. It is much recommended over the original mostly due to better video quality.",Great doorbell subpar speaker
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Dec 2019,HandyMan,Bought this one to replace our older one which no longer functioned. Impressed by the better quality and so far it working quite well.,Good Camera - Good video quality
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Lordmag,Have several friends who have this doorbell. The set up instructions were good and the only real trouble was where my doorbell ringer was placed in my house and which fuse the doorbell was located on. Your best bet is to wire directly to existing doorbell power supply to use all the features. You also will probably need to get a mount for the actual doorbell as you want to direct the camera to the entry way for best motion capturing. We installed it xmas and went on vacation and while driving had someone come to the door. Was able to communicate with the neighbor in real time. If you have had package theives or just want to be able to see whos at the door while your at work or play this does the trick.,Does what my wife wants it to do
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,PBens,"This is a 6-month review; my Doorbell Pro's motion sensor, camera and recording always worked great, despite the maddening delay between the time someone pushes the doorbell button and when my original mechanical ('ding-dong') chime rings inside of the house. The delay started getting worse over time, and now the house chime simply won't sound, or will make a very faint, muffled noise. After contacting Ring support, I purchased a brand-new 16V transformer and mechanical chime yesterday at Home Depot. During installation I tested both my old setup and the new one, completely bypassing the Ring Doorbell Pro. They both work fine, loud and clear. Reconnecting the Doorbell Pro impairs the chime again. Ring tech support is clueless; all they tell you is to reset the device, check your Wi-Fi signal, yada yada yada... Unfortunately it is too late to return, so I am stuck with a doorbell that does everything except alert me when someone is at the door! This problem is abundantly reported on the web, but Ring won't fix it. Be warned. I own another 5 Ring cameras and very satisfied by the way. The Doorbell Pro is a lemon.",Great camera; door chime stops working;bad support
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Aug 2020,Bunz,"Bought this for my parents for safety/security.  I love that they can see who is at the door without having to be seen by the person who is at the door.  They can also get alerted to anyone approaching the yard/house when away from the home.  At first it drove them crazy with excessive alerts, but if you go into the app the alert sensitivity and alert zones Are highly customizable.  Video quality impressed me.",Exceeded my expectations

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,JABARAOUSK,This essay with the good camera. It has very clear video the only thing that I do not like is that sometimes it cuts off. I don’t like when someone is a doorbell or there’s more to me try to going to live with you and your phone doesn’t connect to it right away it says connecting connecting connecting and so by that time probably the person has already have left and by the way I have an iPhone x with 256 of memory So I know it’s not my phone but overall I would really have to say it’s the best camera out there a little things to work on but overall very happy with the product,I love it

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,SCAnthony,"I call this product easy because everything about it is simple. Upon removing your existing doorbell and connecting the Ring, a tutorial begins to you to walk you through the installation process in the app. After connecting through my internal doorbell, I was set up and using it in minutes.

I love the idea of setting different zones for motion detection as it eliminates things falsely turning it on (like passing cars). All videos are uploaded to the cloud which they give you free for 30 days. After the 30 days it is very affordable to keep.

We love the upgrade and security this now provides for the family.",One word - Easy
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,HillbillyEgg,First off depending on where your doorbell is located you may have to reroute the wires and such to get a good view with this camera. Make sure you have strong Wi-Fi as well where the doorbell will be going. I do not and it does drop from time to time but I am going to remedy it with a wifi extender/repeater. Other than that this thing has been great...I do wish it had a snapshot camera picture feature but the quality is good and down the road that could possibly be programmed into it.,Good security doorbell camera

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2016,gadgetty,"I am very pleased with this purchase. Since it takes me a while to get downstairs and answer the doorbell, i got this doorbell because it allows me to talk to the person at the door and tell them to wait a moment. I also like that it has a camera which allows me to see who has been in my front courtyard area (motion sensor) whether they ring the doorbell or not. This doorbell provides both convenience and security. I did have to purchase a WiFi extender so I could hear the doorbell chime in addition to hearing my cellphone ring when someone rings the bell.

Within minutes, I started getting motion alerts. It took a few days of adjusting the strength and setting up a schedule that worked well for my family. 

The one thing I would like to see improved is the lag between when the doorbell is pushed and the alert comes through my phone. It's long enough that sometimes its just easier to answer the door than it is to unlock my phone, launch the app and see whose at the door.",Great product when not at home.
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2019,eileen,My phone rings 2 to 3 minutes after there is motion. Also when someone rings the bell it is slow and the voice contact is even slower.

Relatively easy set up and the instructions make it that much easier. Do check your doorbell voltage prior to purchasing this model - you may need to change your transformer to work properly.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Omegat,"I was able to install the product in about 20min. If you have an existing door bell, half the work is done for you. IF NOT, this product may not be for you. Once power converter was installed @ doorbell point, the outer doorbell assembly is pretty painless to install. Setting up the RING with the app is also pretty quick and painless. Keep in mind that this unit uses WIFI so if your signal is not that great where the doorbell will be installed you may need to install a repeater or relocate your wifi access point. Other point worth noting is that the video is a bit grainy and I wouldn't expect it to be because this is their ""high end"" version. Second, I'm expected to pay for them to record my video with no option for me to record video myself. Even ARLO by netgear gives you some recording time. I may return the product....

Connection to the unit via the app seems to take forever, resolution of video is average for stationary objects. When a person is moving fast toward or away from your door the update rate yields a video that makes it difficult to recognize who the person was. It false detects motion at the front door on windy days, due to plants/leaves moving, even with setting on least sensitive. It seems ridiculous to charge $3 per month so you can watch the video that happened minutes earlier.",Not Ready for Prime Time

Cons - do not expect this to work as advertised on TV - the delay from the notice to live view is long enough that you will miss any activity.  7-10 seconds.  The best that you can hope for is view a captured event in the history.  Which is after the fact.

In order to get smooth video, you need 2 MBPS upload speed but slower speed will get you by.

Had to reconnect to wifi multiple times which is a pain because you have to remove the cover and press a button every time.

I have a double door and the camera angle isn't wide enough for a reasonably & aesthetically / ergonomically placed ringer when the tendency is to stand near the center. 

Noticeable lag both for the house ringer and especially the app notification.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,checkoutnow,"My first Ring Pro was DOA out of the box. This point is very important.

After chasing down what seemed like a 16v transformer issue, locating the transformer, swapping it out with a 24v unit and still having the same issues, it was clear that the unit was DOA.

There wasn't much help online and the various complaints and issues on this product make it very difficult to determine the problem. 

So aside from a bad product out of the box, be sure you have great wifi coverage and if you have the ability, allow the Ring to connect to it's own wireless SSID, not shared with any other devices. This will help the Ring Pro's functionality and reliability - contention free network. If the Ring Pro does not have good wifi coverage, don't expect much. There is a Ring Chime Pro you could buy to help extend your wifi and connect your Ring Pro to if a weak wifi signal is something you can't easily resolve. 

If you have all of this handled - super strong wifi and 24v transformer, but you still have issues with your Ring Pro - take it back - it's defective.

I may not have needed to swap the transformer, but for good measure and from the very convoluted reviews and research online, the 24v transformer upgrade is better any way. 

My Ring Pro works perfectly. Always catches motion. Always provides a view when I log in, no black screens, no lag, etc. If you're having any of those problems - be sure all the above is taken care of first. Still same problems? Take it back.

Something else to consider, after 30 days, you will need to sign up for a cloud subscription or else it's just a fancy doorbell, with no ability to capture and store motion when detected. It's about $30 a year, even though everyone want's to complain about it. Yes, Ring Pro is $200 (Black Friday) - but that's a one time purchase. That doesn't cover the cost for Ring to give you indefinite cloud storage.. Be realistic folks! New era of technology! But consider your situation. Maybe you're just using the Ring Pro as a deterrent - just having it up and glowing might be enough and you don't need a subscription.

I highly recommend the product, so long as you have the proper environment to support it.",Works great - but must have the right setup

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2017,matthew345,"Wanted to purchase a ring doorbell. Went online to the BestBuy website. Said the regular unit was available at my local BestBuy. Once I was there, discovered they didn't have any of the regular ring doorbells (which are battery powered and don't require a transformer). They had a TON of the ring PRO, so without wanting to order it online and wait for shipping, etc. I decided to buy the Ring PRO. 

It APPEARED to be an easy installation (and I'm tech savvy). Hooked it up per the instructions. The white light on the doorbells was spinning, but it didn't work. FIRST TECH CALL: Was told I needed to get a more powerful transformer. Purchased a 16v transformer and installed it in the attic. White light spinning, doorbell still didn't work. SECOND TECH CALL: Was told that even though the previous tech told me 16v was sufficient, that I needed a 24v transformer as maybe I wasn't getting a full 16v to the doorbell. OK, couldn't find any 24v transformers locally, had to order one online. It arrived and installed it. White light spinning, doorbell STILL DIDN'T WORK! Now I'm frustrated as I spent $250 on the initial unit (with tax), plus TWO transformers (another $50). THIRD TECH CALL: Now I'm being told the unit is defective and that the previous technician gave me the WRONG INFORMATION! They said they would FedEx overnight a new replacement. TWO days later, it arrived. Uninstalled previous one, installed new one. FINALLY, after almost a MONTH, I heard the welcome greeting and it finally worked.

I think overall it's a good device, but I would NOT buy the Ring PRO! Go for the less expensive model as it runs off of batteries and doesn't need the transformer. It has a lot of features to minimize sensitivity of things in front of the camera, but still tends to go off occasionally without anything in front of it. 

The way they make their money is they give you 30 days of FREE cloud storage, after which you have to pay a monthly fee if you want to keep your videos stored.

OVERALL: I'm tech savvy and this was difficult to install and troubleshoot. If you're not very tech savvy, do not buy this! You will get frustrated! Opt for the lesser expensive model.","Ring Pro - Difficult setup, defective unit"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2019,APOh,"I purchased the original, lower end Ring and as it doesn't really have custom motion zones I was getting a lot of false alarms so I upgraded to this model.  This thing is not worth the money.  If I wasn't past my return date, I'd probably just get some motion sensitive cameras instead.  I get more false alarms than actual results. I can walk up to my front porch and it won't detect me.  If I move quickly it won't detect me.  So if you have someone leisurely stealing packages off your porch, or you want false alarms of cars driving by, this is the product for you.  If you actually want it to detect people literally walking up to your front door, every time, this is not the product for you.  It also sets itself off when the night/infrared lights turn off...It's a toy, not a real security product.","Not worth the money, get a regular camera"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,JamexRZ,"I finally found the doorbell I wanted. After having a cheap one (laview) and a Nest one, this is the one to go. To start with, motion and ring notifications are almost instant. There is no forced cool down period (you can snooze motion alerts to your liking), this is great, not like the Nest one. The nest one forces large cool down periods on you and you can miss a delivery or motion. Also, the Nest one has sever problems with the lag on notifications and is constantly uploading videos eating your precious internet bandwidth (and your quota, some ISP's are capping internet, like xfinity and if you pass it, you get charged). Nothing like that with the ring, it will only record and upload whenever there is a motion alert and/or a ring on your bell, great!

Quality and installation was great, just make sure you have a good doorbell transformer, must be 16v minimum, if not, there are cheap ones on Home depot.

Only complain, is for the price of the cam, you should get the angle mounts included (if your cam isn't facing forward, like mine it will not give a good image, like washed out whenever night vision is enabled). I had to shell out $20 more to buy their mounts (Nest includes these with their doorbell).",Great door bell!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2016,neo8820,"I've had my Ring Pro and Ring Chime for almost a month and have decided to return it. I purchased the product right after launch so a few hiccups are to be expected. However, over the past month problems have increased. Ring would issue a firmware update a few times a week to fix one problem but two more would appear leading me to seriously doubt the competence of the development team and their ability to properly squash the large amount of bugs.

Most of the bugs manifest in one of the following ways these were all confirmed by Ring who said there was not a problem with my installation or WiFi signal strength and the problems were all on their end and to “give us time because this is a beta product”. Funny because I don’t remember reading anything about a Beta on the box or user agreement.

Alerts not sent to mobile device/Ring Chime
Button presses sent to the mobile/Ring Chime device as motion instead of a button press
False motion alerts exactly every 10 minutes. I had to uninstall the app from my phone to get some sleep a few nights.
Live view works maybe 50% of the time
Answering a motion or button press works maybe 25% of the time.
Night Vision would turn on/off throughout the day/night and the software registered this as a false motion alert

There are many more problems but the bottom line is the product does not work reliably as advertised. To make matters worse phone support is subpar. Expect lots of promises for call backs, etc. that never happen. Chat support is even worse. One chat took over an hour where there were periods of 15 minutes where I was waiting for the chat agent to respond to a message I sent. 

My advice is to stay away from this company at least for the next year to see if they survive. They are a new company and with this many problems with their core product my guess is they won't be around for long. Even if your Ring works fine it won't once they discontinue their service and turn off their servers when they go belly up.",Lots of bugs

I found that the higher quality video in the Pro made a big difference. The 1st gen video would always start with pixilation that would eventually clear. Not so with the Pro - nice clear video from the start. The biggest complaint I had with the 1st gen was that it was always delayed in capturing motion. For instance, I had an Amazon package delivered. I got an alert from the 1st gen doorbell, looked at the video and simply saw the package on my doorstep. It didn't capture the delivery person coming or going! Not good. That does not happen with the Pro. Yes, the Pro costs more but it works.",Big Improvement Over the 1st Gen Doorbell

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,Sandjam,"Pretty good video doorbell. But the first one I got was defective out of box.
After second one installed works pretty good, but another company that wants monthly fees for video. Unlike Nest who still stores clips of motions even without the plan, this company cuts off all video clips once the free trial ends. So you can only view live video and that's it. Night vision is kind of of grainy so needs improvement for a 250.00 item. Also when someone rings the doorbell there is a delay of a few seconds when the inside bell actually rings.",Not Bad but needs some improvement

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,McSmartyPants,"First off, the doorbell works great. Yes, occasionally it takes a few seconds too long to connect but overall the video quality and features work as they should.
Installation was an entirely different matter. I suppose if your current doorbell is the type they assume you have installation would be a breeze. Watch out if you do not and if you’re not an electrician because you’re in for some fun. First off, this device runs on 24 volts. Most doorbell transformers will output a maximum of 16 volts. They have a resister that you can install that essentially does the trick but if you have 10 or 12, you will need a new transformer. Not to mention that the instructions show one wire coming from the transformer whereas I had two, and one wire going to the doorbell, again i had two. I can install ceiling fans, light switches, etc, so this confused me. Also, my existing indoor doorbell had a battery backup which used DC power to the doorbell button. Long story short I had to replace the transformer, bypass the internal doorbell entirely, and but a chime pro to make it all work.",Works as Advertised. Setup a Pain

I did need to upgrade my doorbell transformer, however it was inexpensive (only about $15) and easy to replace.  Subscription service is either $3 or $10 per month so it is very inexpensive is well and has great features (in app.)  I only purchased the doorbell to get started and try it out, but since doing so, I am now looking into adding on to it and purchasing other cameras.

Then when I deleted some stored history it kept showing up. Someone in my neighborhood has one on her door and it keeps showing up on my App and I can't get rid of her front door view. I do not want to see someone else's front door or them to see mine. I just don't use the App...My wife uses it once in a while when Fed Ex comes to the door.

Loading on mobile data is choppy depending on your carrier and signal strength. Wife has ATT and I have Sprint. The loading on the wifi is very smooth.

Now with the Ring doorbell I never have to second guess, it notifies me immediately.

Other pluses:
- You have the option to share/view your neighborhood’s Ring videos. I have seen my other neighbors robbed of shoes, packages, porch furniture, and their encounters with suspicious characters.

- I got the Ring Pro which allows me to cut out from view areas in which not to monitor motion. My neighbors door is only 3 steps from my own so our driveways are only get closer since I live in a culdesac. If the Ring Pro didn’t have this feature I would have been getting notifications non-stop.

- You have the ability to add more cameras and it’s easy to name each with the app. You can easily select the camera you want and see Live Feed. 

If you don’t have great WiFi signal near the Ring, get a WiFi extension. That fixed the occasional lag time.",Necessity nowadays
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,itguy99,"Overall, I am happy with this product. I will be keeping it. There are a few things that could be better. For some reason, this device never seems to have a consistent good connection via Wi-Fi. Other devices I have in the same area do not have that problem. If for some reason it loses connection with Wi-Fi for an extended period of time, it actually has to be reprogrammed. Which means taking it apart in order to press the reset button. Physical security also needs to be improved. Anyone can walk up to this device, take out a screw, and press the reset button. Your device is now effectively disabled. This needs to be made much more difficult for someone to do. It is surprising to me that the online storage is something you have to pay for. It isn't too expensive, so not a huge complaint. 
 Even with all of that, it works well enough for me to give it four stars. The video quality is decent. Don't think of it as something that will get you a license plate for more than 5 feet away though.","Happy, except...."
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2018,TROUBLESOME0,"I've had unit for about 6mos. The radio is weak and most likely will require user to move their router closer. Installation was extremely easy, I thought. The issue is the quality/function of the product. What is advertised IS NOT what you will receive. I don't know where the ad/online videos come from, but they aren't from this device. Image is pixelated and not clear. As others have mentioned, it works ~ 8-10 times. Seems more often than not you get a frozen screen of someone walking away, or just a black screen. Subscribers can attest that almost every other day they have an issue with software that needs correcting. I bought into the hype of a startup, GoFundMe company that had an innovative idea years ago, but hasn't seemed to evolve. My neighbor has the flood lights and likes them - I may just have higher expectations. Regret not buying Sky Bell's now.",OVER-HYPED

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2017,CamB,"I had purchased the Ring security kit that included the Ring doorbell, and two stick up cams. The installation was super easy with the original doorbell. I ended up returning the security kit after about a week due to wanting more security cameras on my house. I bought a different camera kit, and also bought the Ring Doorbell Pro. To me, the installation of the pro was a little more difficult due to having to add the battery booster to the doorbell since I didn't purchased the Ring Chime. After installing the Ring Pro, I honestly couldn't tell the difference in the picture quality with it being day or night compared to the 720p regular doorbell. I ended up returning the pro and purchasing the original Ring doorbell. Maybe I just got a bad pro version? I don't know. Overall, save the extra cash and go with the regular doorbell. It is easier to install, and to me, has the same picture quality. 

I guess the only positive to the Pro versus the regular Ring is that you have multiple face plate options and is slightly smaller.","Save money, buy the cheaper version."

The Ring Pro has better reviews, is smaller, and was a better fit as I did not have to drill any extra holes... The Ring Standard requires 4 holes for installation and the Pro version only 2. So far this thing works great, I took away one star only because I get motion alerts constantly for around 1 hour every day when the sun hits just right and sets off the motion sensor. I also did not like the fact that I am forced to pay for cloud storage when I have my own cloud already. It's $3 a month (for now) but it was a hidden cost that I didn't appreciate.","Very nice product, simple to install, & it works."

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,MikeF,"Works as expected, I have monitoring installed on both Windows and Android with good results. Overall I'm happy, but here's some cons:

* My install was non-standard, and while Ring was quick to respond they really weren't interesting in helping me to adapt to the system. In the end I did what I thought would work, and it did.

* The resolution is high, but the video sometimes breaks up if there's a lot of motion. Not sure if this is an encoding problem or weak WiFi coverage, but the router is not far from the door and should be ok.

* The Windows app only works on Win 10, which sucks. Also, for some reason the time log is in the wrong time zone on Win 10, but correct on Android and the web site.

* I'd prefer if I could record the video locally, rather than in Ring's cloud. If Ring ever drops the product or goes out of business, the utility of this product will die with it. I'd be happier if it worked independantly since it's a security related product.",Does what it says

Delivery carriers better be more careful because I can now prove how an unnamed carrier just throws my packages up on the porch with no cares often breaking fragile items inside.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,btorbey,I really am satisfied with the purchase of my Ring Pro video-enhanced doorbell. I feel secure when packages arrive and I am not there to receive them. The two way talking is useful when pesky solicitors come to my door; they aren’t able to tell if you’re inside talking to them or on the go. The motion zones that are customizable are actually very accurate once you play around with them; I had some annoying issues with constant motion from cars driving by that was fixed once I did some troubleshooting. I would recommend getting a professional to install this if you do not have a standard doorbell with mechanical chimes due to the electrical part being a little tricky if you do not have sufficient power off of your existing doorbell.,Great “doorbell” for every home
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Titan5178,"I bought this mainly so that I wouldn't have to come to the door just to realize it's an annoying salesperson. With the motion detection, I've noticed that some people are ""afraid"" to push the doorbell, as if they don't want to be recorded. I think this actually deters sales people because I honestly haven't had one come to the door since installing it. 

Overall, it is very good, as others have said, if you want this to work outside your home, you need good reliable internet. I'm only docking a star because I've noticed while the video quality is very good, sometimes it skips several frames.

In addition, it doesn't always catch the beginning of a motion trigger. For example, if a delivery man runs up the door, drops a package, I'll only see him hopping in his truck and driving away. It needs to be quicker at detecting the motion and recording it.",Doesn't always catch every motion

It solved the issue and my false positives went away. Another bonus of this model over the cheaper ones is that once motion is detected it records a few seconds before the motion is detected in the footage that is savd so it's a complete picture of what triggered the motion. it's useful when looking for the cause of a motion.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Jforonda,"I was originally planning to buy the original Ring, but luckily this came out in time. Installation was easy, just pulled out the old doorbell (wired), installed the Ring Pro, connected to my network, and voila the entrance of my house is monitored. I can see when deliveries, solicitors, bugs, and when my neighbor turns on their outside lights. I can probably lower the sensitivity, but there are times when it picks up movements too late and all I see in the recording is a person already at the front door or leaving, so I increased the sensitivity and now I know when lights turn on and people at the front door. 
I definitely recommend this product to everyone.",Worth the added security and convenience
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Nirmal,"This is the second ring I purchased, great product",Great security camera
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Mtgsfbay,"Very easy to install and setup.
We have it hard wired.",Works
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2017,WallyFC,"First: some background. I bought this to replace a standard Ring Doorbell because of the motion zone capability. If Ring had added this software capability to the original Ring, I would not have bought a Ring Pro. If you are replacing an older Ring, know that you will have to drill new holes in your wall for it, and putty in the old holes. There are other issues too (more below).

The motion zones definitely do help cut down on false alerts. With the old Ring, I had issues with false alerts from trucks driving down the street or from plants moving under high wind. The motion zones stop a lot of this, if they are set up properly. It does take some tweaking to set them up properly, and they won't suppress all false alerts, like bugs flying in front of the camera.

So why did I give it only 3 stars? I think it still needs to work better. My first complaint is the bandwidth requirements, which are not easy to find. The original Ring has a 720p camera; if you dig deep enough, Ring says you need 1 Mbps broadband for both upload and download. The Ring Pro has a 1080p camera, but it needs 2 Mbps broadband for both upload and download. The download was no problem, but initially I didn't have 2 Mbps download, and didn't know I needed it until I contacted Ring support. What happens if you don't have it? You get dropped frames or temporary freeze-ups in the video. I think they would have been better off trying to improve the camera's performance than just increasing its resolution and eating more bandwidth: a doorbell camera is challenged because the subject (the person at the door) is almost always backlit, making them harder to see.

The basic concept works, but still has some of the flaws that it had before. I haven't had much chance to actually try to answer the door, but there can be a significant delay (like 10 to 15 seconds) between the time that someone rings the doorbell and you get an alert on your smartphone or tablet. That can make sense since the signal is going up to the cloud and back, even if you are in the house. Also the video doesn't always effectively capture a person at your door if they move in very quickly, like a delivery person might do if just dropping off a package. Since the Ring Pro is hardwired to always get power, it could theoretically be capturing video continuously (and throwing most of it out) to catch this on video, but it doesn't. The sound quality also seems not very good, which doesn't match up with the idea of having improved the camera to 1080p. The sound especially tinny when you hear the recording of the doorbell itself. Perhaps that's less than fair since the doorbell speaker is probably right next to the microphone.

There are some aspects of the software which could be improved. The app will sometimes destabilize if you are working with it extensively for a period of time, although I haven't done this in a while so this may have improved. Also the app and the web interface have slightly different capabilities. For example, at one time, if you wanted to change the email associated with your account, you could do it from one (I think the app) but not the other.

I would probably still recommend this to a friend who was interested in having a doorbell of this type, but I would tell them about all of the above to make sure they understood what they were getting.","Works, but could be better"

I could not find an actual number for them, so I had to use their Chat about a problem I thought I had. Although this was a little cumbersome when you are trying to use the phone for the Ring app, their support was super helpful and they even emailed twice to make sure everything was working properly.

My parents don't have a computer, so I have the app set up on their iPad and it also gives me instant alerts so I can make sure they are safe.

One thing to note: Best Buy advertises the Ring Pro as having the satin/nickel in stock and even in store, the sales people will tell you that you have to order other colors online. They really should read the box. The Ring Pro comes with 4 different faceplate colors.",Got it for my parents!

I will now only buy ring products thanks to this and the Floodlight camera that I also have. Both integrate nicely and connect quickly.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,ALSF,"I bought this video doorbell to use in my townhouse in Palm Springs. I hired an electrician to install it, since my doorbell was not compatible, and he updated the transformer to get the correct voltage for it to work. Also, the previous doorbell location seemed like it was too close to the door to work, but once installed, the doorbell camera was able to capture the whole courtyard, and anyone standing in front of the door. The video is really high quality, and the motion detection picks up any movements in the zones that I set up. It also give me peace of mind that I can just open the app in my iPhone from anywhere, and see that the place is still there... :)",Perfect for 2nd property
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,5,13 Nov 2017,guyLucky,"First time having a camera/doorbell system and I think I made a great choice. I chose the Pro over the non-pro edition because of its ease of use. The non-pro requires disabling the unit in order to charge it. The pro is hard-wired so no requirement to recharge. I like the fact that I can set the motion zones. I live in a brand new community where houses are still under construction, so its great that I can disregard workers or moving vehicles that are in the camera's view. I set the motion zones to right in front of my door and on my grass, outside of the house going up right next to mine. I get the alerts, voice communication when someone rings the doorbell, and two-way talk capability. Great Product!",Great product
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2017,EsCee999,"I like it. Easy to install and use. The app is nice, allowing user to set sensitivity zone to prevent unwanted motions from being picked up. The recorded video, thought, is rather choppy. I hardly get a video where all the motions are smooth. My wifi signal is strong there. I have an Arlo Pro just a few feet from it an the video from that is never choppy. So, issue must be the Ring not the wifi. 

Aside from choppy video, it's pretty quick in picking up motion and alerting you. I can be at work and be alerted quickly. Very convenient. I can now see who is at my door without having to open it. Cool.",Convenient but video is choppy

I had some issues setting up, but a quick chat with support we identified that I didn't need a diode despite the first rep telling me I did. There is a setting to adjust it based on doorbell.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Jeremy,"So far I really like this device. Video quality is good, Playback of video is good. The only issue I've had is that it has gone offline / lost wifi several times. Once happened to be when someone walked up and rang the doorbell, so we were unable to see who it was via the doorbell since we couldn't connect to it. After a few minutes it came back online by itself. The router is only 25-30 feet away and the diagnostics shows a good signal, but it still has gone offline a few times. That has been the only negative so far.","Good product, has lost wifi a few times"
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2017,HORRIBLE,"We installed the Pro because the review were much better than the original. The resolution is horrible, you cannot zoom in or out therefore what you see is what you get. We had to also purchase the swivel plate adapter as it didn't mount to the existing doorbell spot well ($20 more). We used it for a few weeks and returned it as it was more annoying than good. We had people walk up to the doorbell and it didn't even notify us. When cars pulled into the driveway, they were out of the cameras view and unable to tell who was even there till they rang the doorbell. We ended up buying a home security system that cost $250, but has a DVR & 4 wireless cameras that protect the front door, garage, mailbox, & the back door.

No issues with the Doorbell Pro and it can use the 5Ghz band. Motion detection works great, not even requiring a button push. Quality is decent. Connection is usually fast enough to catch whoever is at your door, but the cloud recording whilst $3 a month is well worth it as it's so easy to check at any time what's been going on at your door, keeping a history of events.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2017,Jaymacbraun,"Email sent to Jamie Simioff, Inventor of the Ring Video Doorbell:

Greetings,

I tried really hard to be a customer. I think this product is a great idea, but if you cannot count on it to work reliably, it fails to deliver on the promise of Always Home. Your Customer Service Team has been great, but there is little they can do when the product itself is so unreliable.

I purchased a Video Doorbell Pro and a Chime on 12/13/2016 after one of my colleagues was raving about it and showing our Team how it worked. It is a lot of money to spend on a doorbell, but we were excited to give it a go. I attempted to install it on 12/17/2016. The physical install was straightforward and I was pleased that it covered up the unsightly area where the old doorbell had been. The next several hours were the beginning of the nightmare. I could not get the doorbell to complete the setup process. After nearly an hour on hold, the support representative agreed that the unit was likely faulty and suggested I try a new one. I went back to Best Buy and exchanged old for new. Physical reinstall took less than 15 minutes. I was able to complete the setup process for the second unit, but shortly after I got it up and running, it lost its connection. While it was working, the video was choppy and stilted. 

I spent the next couple of days emailing back and forth with the Customer Service Team (again, as helpful as they could be and very pleasant). I reached the conclusion that a wifi extender was likely needed. I ordered one of the ones recommended on your support page and had it delivered the next day. I installed it on 12/20/2016 and this seemed to do the trick, but we observed lengthy delays initiating interaction with a visitor and poor audio quality/volume... more or less negating the Always Home promise. We also noted the doorbell wasn't ringing the existing chime, so it wasn't really even being a doorbell very well. The support representative sent a Chime Pro and said that would make everything work really well. In the meantime I purchased a new wireless router in the hopes that could help provide a stronger signal. The new router was no faster on the 2.4GHz band and too far away to use the 5GHz signal, which my range extender would not recognize anyway.

The Chime Pro arrived on Christmas Eve and I installed it right away. Despite being 4-5 feet away and broadcasting a strong signal, the doorbell could not connect to the Chime Pro. Another support representative suggested the voltage could be an issue. I went to Lowes and purchased a multi-meter voltage tester and confirmed 16.3 at the doorbell. I was able to get the Chime Pro to connect by putting it on an extension cord and placing it right next to the doorbell. The support representative confirmed the unit had very good power and very good wifi connection.

We had a family member come visit Christmas Eve and we observed the video was choppy and stilted. Later that evening, the setup lost its connection and has been offline ever since. Good news is the existing doorbell chime was now working... but unfortunately nothing else. Adding up the cost of the Video Doorbell Pro ($200 on sale), the Chime ($30), the range extender ($37), the router ($135) and the multi-meter ($30), I am into this whole thing for well over $400 and all I have is a doorbell that does nothing more than the old one did... and I don't trust your product to even do that reliably.

Needless to say, everything that can be returned will be returned, but I won't get back the countless hours of frustration that your product has caused me and my family. The only thing I can count on coming out of this horrible product experience is the reminder of all these shenanigans every time I come home and see the hole in my vinyl siding where the Ring Video Doorbell resided briefly.

I wish you the best and genuinely want the product to be a success... it just didn't work in my application apparently. A shame. Thanks for letting me vent to the owner/inventor... I don't normally complain about a product, but it is nice to know that you will actually see this.",I tried really hard to be a Ring customer

This device didn't even play the recorded voice prompts. The Ring's LEDs would light up and then flash in a circular pattern, but even after a few hard resets, the unit remained unresponsive.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2017,tobias,"I got this because I wanted 1080p and the ability to get a live view whenever I want. It is also compatible with the Wink hub I use. The older (and cheaper model) is 720p and can only be viewed when a ring or motion event is triggered. 

This requires hard wiring, no battery option. It also requires more power, so wiring can be a headache. My fist one had a faulty accessory (the Pro power kit). It somehow made it so the mechanical chime wouldn't work. I even bought a new chime to prove to Ring it was their product, not my chime. I got a replacement Pro Power kit, but it didn't make the problem go away. Luckily, I could use the Ring without the Pro Power Kit (was told that by a ring rep on the phone). Then a couple months later my doorbell kept powering off on its own randomly. Ring had my buy a new transformer, which I did, before they agreed that their doorbell was faulty. 

I got the replacement and it works better, but there are still issues. More than half the time, when I try to view the camera from my tablet or phone I can hear but not see the doorbell. The camera rarely loads. Ring says it is my upload speed. They used to say you need at least 1mb up, but recommend 2mb up. They later changed their story and said you need at least 2mb up minimum. I upgraded my internet and now have 2mb up. I still don't see the image most of the time. 

So, I had to upgrade my internet plan, buy a new mechanical chime and transformer and still have a doorbell that doesn't work right. 

To be fair, Ring does try to fix their issues, but I can't help but feel there is no way to make this right any more. Now that the chime is not shutting off randomly, all I need is the video to load reliably (basically the primary reason to get this). There are two ways this could be fixed. Either 1) let the resolution dumb down to 720p when needed or 2) let the picture stream though the internal network instead of only through the internet. I've asked Ring about this and they say neither of those features are likely to happen any time soon.

Others appear to have more luck with Ring than I do, but I wish I'd gotten a different brand at this point.","Conceptually great, not perfect."

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,3,13 Nov 2016,JimboK48,Great idea but needs tweaking. Couldn't install it using our wired doorbell so had to purchase the Ring doorbells. Those work okay. Can't use the motion detector -- if that works then the doorbell won't work so we kept the doorbell function. Our front door is partially covered so there is a lot of backlight which makes it difficult to see who is at the door on occasion. Just love the idea but the software needs more work. Got the Video Pro so we feel we paid a lot of money for a product that does not fully function. Maybe in another year or so the doorbell will be better updated.,Good but needs some work

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2018,feebdaed,"Once installed the basic doorbell works well. The ring is quite delayed from the actual push of the button, both the chime and the app. The saving of the video of a missed ""ring"" is an extra cost.

The installation is very intimidating, much more involved than say an outlet. The ""pro power"" pack that gets installed inside the existing chime causes the transformer to hum loudly enough that you need to raise your voice to talk over the noise. It also causes the chime to stop working. I tried removing the power pack and the chime returned for about a week. I replaced the chime, the new one only lasted an hour before: 1) the chime stopped and 2) the hum returned.

I'd love to take it out and return it, but others in the house want to buy the Ring braned chime and hope that it rings without delay.","works, with caveats"

This requires you to go outside remove the security screw, remove the cover, press the reset button, confirm that it now has a connection and then close it up. Since it's winter this is not something I want to keep doing outside! The funny thing is that I can get all of the stored video anytime there is motion in front of the camera even when the door bell tells me it is not connected to the internet. Based on internet searches this is a recurring problem with many of the systems. When the door bell is working it works really well.

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,SGUfan,"The video quality is good, but no where near as good as the samples on the web site. I have an excellent connection to my router on 5GHz, so that is not an issue.
Motion detection is very picky. Sometimes it will trigger when I turn on my porch light. Other times it will go off for no obvious reason even when the setting is at the lowest sensitivity. Another issue with the motion is that most of the time it takes so long to trigger that I just see the back of the person as they're leaving. It needs to constantly record the last few seconds to itself, then send it if it sees motion. That way it wouldn't miss whatever is triggering it.
The doorbell part works well, but it's slow to open on the iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10.1.1. It would also be a lot better if it worked with HomeKit. It would really be helpful and make sense if the app worked with the Apple Watch as well. The audio volume is very low on the doorbell itself. The person at the door sometimes has a hard time hearing me.
Overall I like the Ring Pro, I just hope that software updates can fix these issues.

Edit March 31 2017
The motion detection has been improved significantly. It hardly senses motion when there isn't any. It also now records video before, during, and after the doorbell is pressed, so no more videos of the back of the person leaving. I'm hopeful that my other issues will be solved soon with more updates.

*** Edit July 16 2018
The Ring Pro has started to get cloudy on the lens. After contacting support and following their troubleshooting suggestions (which were to clean the device with a microfiber cloth and distilled water, then to use rubbing alcohol) it appears that the plastic lens cover is already degrading from the weather. In fact here's a quote from their customer service. ""Your assumption about decomposition might be correct, but, unfortunately, your device is not covered with warranty service anymore, so the only possible solution for you is to buy a new device.""
So they expect me to buy a new device because they couldn't be bothered to use something that would stand up to weather for a device that's supposed to be designed for outdoor use. Needless to say I would not recommend this product any longer. The fact that the most important part of the device can't handle being in the sun and weather is not only disappointing, it's pathetic design.","Was good but not perfect, now TOTAL FAIL"

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2016,Bean,"I was so excited to get my new video door bell. It did not live up to expectations. The door bell decides to switch between day and night mode, often giving us false ring/motions. It happens every 10 minutes sometimes. The door bell also tends to get a glitch, a red or green pixel and that messes up the whole video and doesn't even record. We signed up for a year storage service to the cloud and half of the time, the video is not clear. There is a major lag between present time and video.",It could be better

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,mwjulia,"After buying the Ring Pro, I have a certified electrician install it to make sure it's correctly installed with adequate voltage and wiring is correctly done. After installation, was not able to connect to wifi router located less than 5 feet from front door. The light on the doorbell goes round and round, but no wifi connectivity. So, I hire an additional electrician to come and again check to make sure wiring and transformer, etc are good. 2nd electrician says all electrical components are good and says it must be a faulty doorbell. I call Ring and talk to the CS rep for 1.25 hours to try and get the doorbell connected. After 4-5 attempts to connect (and I was even instructed to turn my master electrical panel off then back on still no connection to wifi.. she then says I need to order a transformer which might help get it working (oh and I would need an electrician to install). I asked what to do if I order a transformer, have an electrician come back out and it still won't connect and she says that then I would need to just try the Ring 2 as it doesn't require as much power...REALLY??? So, long story short, I've spent over $400 for this RING doorbell and still not working!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!",Never worked from day 1!

Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,2,13 Nov 2018,Traveler,Not compatible with some doorbells. Power regulator for inside doorbell didn’t work. Waiting on new part from company. On phone assistance was helpful with step by step instructions. Monthly access fee for video is ridiculous. They should allow storage on your own computer.,Expensive
Ring - Video Doorbell Pro - Satin Nickel,1,1,13 Nov 2018,shawn,"Installed the camera everything seemed to be working alright, but as soon as I try to talk to someone through my phone or any device for that matter I get a loud screeching sound through the doorbell. I looked online and noticed others with the same problem with no solutions. I called Ring customer support and spoke to a gentlemen for about an hour, and after he told me my network speeds were more then capable he recommended I buy their chime product. I have 150 down and 12 up at the doorbell, more then enough to run this camera. So after spending 250 dollars on a camera customer supports answer is to spend another 50 on another ring product, and this is after telling me my numbers are more then enough. Thanks, but no thanks.",Bad Experience.... Bad Support
