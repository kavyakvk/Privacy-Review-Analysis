"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2018,customer,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. i hear stranger(s) talking through mic since last Monday. i contacted wyze, sent the log file and video. we were told to change the password.  so we did.  on saturday after password is changed i was testing the mic and heard a chinese? lady and early sunday morning, there was alert with some strangers conversation recorded.  i can only upload 1 video so i’m posting one from yesterday.  i cannot tell what language is this.... and nobody was near also no one around here can speak this language. this is what wyze customer support reply from the first incident from last week.: First, if you are concerned about security the first thing you should do is change your account password to make sure you are the only one with access to the camera. If the camera is shared with any accounts I would suggest the shared account holder also resets their passwords. Next, to talk a little about our security. Our cameras utilize a point to point encrypted connection, this means that when you attempt to connect to a camera (specifically connection step 2/3) the camera and the app will perform a handshake with our servers, confirming that both have the correct encryption key that is unique to the device. This means that currently, the only options for getting access to your live feed is to have the log in information of an account with control over the camera (either the account it is setup to, or a shared account) or an Alexa device that you have allowed access to your live feeds (again, this requires the log in information for the account). anyway we changed the password and this just happened yesterday. i hope they can explain this....",security issue
"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Aug 2018,Nicholas Parker,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This little camera is VERY impressive. I currently own a Nest IQ indoor camera and have owned a couple Foscam indoor cameras in the past. This Wyze camera produces excellent picture quality and has a very easy to use app. The fact that you get 14 days of clips storage for free just blows the Nest cam out of the water. This camera does so much that the 10x more expensive Nest Cam IQ at a fraction of the price. So how does this stack up against the much more expensive Nest Cam IQ indoor camera? * You don't get continuous recording stored online, you only get clips stored online. However, you can pop a $10 32GB microSD card into this Wyze camera and get continuous local recording (meaning it's being recorded on the card in the device). You can view your recordings in the app. At HD quality, you get a couple days storage on a 32GB card, more if you go SD quality. *You don't get the ability to turn the camera on/off based on whether or not you are home. Personally, I really like this feature so it isn't recording us when we're home. Just feels weird. Wyze support says they may add this via IFTTT in the future. You can control whether or not motion recording is on when you are home using IFTTT. However, I""ve found it a little buggy. *You don't get the Nest IQ facial recognition which is very high tech. I'm not sure how important this is for an indoor camera. It's amazing for the Nest Hello doorbell. *You don't get a monthly fee with the Wyze cam. You pay a fee for the Nest Cam IQ. I can't believe this thing is so cheap and works so well. It has so many features like the big guys. Even the two-way audio is decent. If I had one complaint, it's that the motor that rotates the camera is a little loud. I'm still giving this 5 stars. I guess its sensitivity to sound is a little high too. It seems like it's too good to be true. If you are looking for an indoor security camera, you found it. TIP: I am using this SD card in the camera and it's working fine. Inexpensive and does the job if you want local recording - . Silicon Power-32GB High Speed MicroSD Card with Adapter - New Edition NOTE: In the video, I have the camera attached to a mini-tripod. The camera has a standard screw mount for a tripod. You can get a little tripod for around $10. I like it because it raises the camera a bit and provides some extra stability, decreasing the chance it can be knocked over. ----- 07/2019 HERE ARE SOME ANSWERS TO COMMENTS PEOPLE HAVE LEFT BELOW ---- - Yes, it will continue to do its cloud recording when you have an SD card installed. There is an ""events"" tab on the main page of the app for the clips. You can also open a specific camera and tap ""view playback"" to see the continuous recording. When viewing on the SD card, there is a delay as it loads up the video. For example, you scroll the time line back 8 hours then there is a 3-4 second delay as it loads the chunk of video around that time. Once it loads, you can move back and forth in it instantly. - I am going to say my 32GB card is getting a little over 3 days recording in a room with only light activity. I can't speak to how that time grows as you increase the size of the card. I'm not sure if 64GB would get you 6 days. Seems like it would though. - To the person that thinks the app is useless, I'm sorry to hear you are having such troubles. I think the app works well on my Android phone (I don't know about iOS). However, I do believe that those kinds of things can happen. It's not a perfect app and they are adding features which can introduce bugs. Considering the cost of this camera, the app is phenomenal but some people are going to have problems. Hard to predict. - The other app question about it being efficient - yes, it works much better than those other cheap camera app. There is about a 2-3 second delay before it brings up live video. I'm not experiencing freezing. However, that is heavily dependent on the network in your home and the network you are using on your phone when you access it (e.g. mobile, slow WiFi, etc.). - I'm not sure about the comment about not auto-rebooting when you lose WiFi? I'll say that the cameras survive power failures perfectly. We just had a three hour one last night. Booted right back up. I have reset my network periodically which causes my WiFi to go down for about a minute and the cameras come right back online. I'm still using this one and the regular Wyze cam. I still think these are SHOCKINGLY good values. I feel like I wasted so much money on my Nest cam. I should sell it and buy 5-6 Wyze cams.","Amazing picture, features, ease of use at this low price! How does it stack up against Nest?"

Since the camera is not responding to either WiFi or LTE your only option is to manually unplug it then plug it in again This would solve the issue but what happens when you are a 1000 miles away ? Until Wyze ( like Nest does ) codes the software so that the camera reboots itself when attempting to re- connect these cameras are just a gimmick to watch your cat . I am not the only one having same issue as I got numerous emails from forum You can try to fix by having WiFi AC plugs turning on Pandora off but not reliable,Does not auto reboot when losing WiFi connection

I have hardwired (fixed) cameras that are hooked up to a DVR, and I have 4 Nest cams as well. But we have a lot of pets, and I wanted to have some PTZ cams to be able to look around and check on them when we are away.  I heard several tech podcasts (TWiT, Stacey on IoT) ranting and raving over this Wyze cam, so I took the plunge on one. WOW, how amazing to get all this, for $30 (plus shipping)!  The image is super-clear, and I LOVE the ability to scan around a room via my phone.  I even installed the Wyze app onto my Pixelbook, and when I enlarge the image on my big screen, it looks incredible.  I have only had the camera hooked up for a day, and I am still learning the ropes, but I am SO pleased, I am going to order another two, if not three cameras right away! The motion detection feature is pretty slick.  I set up the camera in our spare bedroom, where some of our cats hang out, and when Barbie came in, the camera detected her and began following her movements.  She was intrigued at the noise (noticeable, but not loud, btw) of the camera whirring, turning.  I have attached a screenshot I grabbed via the app, where she is examining the Wyze cam!  Highly recommended.",SO much functionality for 30 bucks! WOW.

Both motion tagging and motion tracking doesn’t work even after firmware update.  The cam for no reason sometimes just freezes up. I have to power off and on by removing the micro usb cable in order to get it working again. I tried to return it but the return time was over. I am so disappointed and I will never advise others to buy this model base in my experience. How I wish it works as advertised. The bug or whatever it is should be fixed and if it is this unit that is defective I feel I deserve a replacement unit from Wyze. The other units (3) of wyzecam v2 i have is much better in performance.  They work great even in my echoshow. UPDATES! Wyze reached out to me and changed the unit. It was on the second attempt that I got a perfectly functioning wyze cam pan. Despite better functionalities than the wyze cam, I feel the wyze cam pan MUST be tested before shipping.  To avoid the pains I went through. If you get a fully functional wyze cam pan then you will love it. I have given a 4 star now.",Don’t buy Wyzecam Pan!-UPDATED REVIEW

I am in the security camera business and I was asked by some to evaluate this for them so I bought a couple. I am not trying to compare this to a tier one camera system. I was evaluating it based on its price point. It has some pretty good features. The interface is a little clunky but overall reasonable. Set up was easy and went smoothly. Day one was fine. After that the image was nearly unusable. There was a green pixelization on all shaded areas. I realize this is a budget camera but this issue was a bad component. I believe is is a bad CCD. The issue I had is I tried to contact their support group. The phone never gets answered. The support link in their web page never gets answered. Emails to support never get answered. Are they still a company open for business. My evaluation was to look elsewhere for a budget home camera.,Non existent customer service

And now I can see why.  This really is a game changer in terms of security cameras.  The value is mind boggling, and I have to admit, was a source of concern before I bought these cameras.  I like to feel I understand the business model of a company from which I'm buying a product, especially one I hook into my personal network.  This feels like I'm buying an iPhone for $50.  In fact, I have to say that I felt like I had bought an apple product when I was unwrapping the cameras.  They come beautifully packaged, and the workmanship and operation is just apple gorgeous, and apple smooth. However, while I my first three set up flawlessly, the last three I just bought were problematic.  The setup was smooth, like before, but at the end it has you update to the latest and greatest firmware.  Last time that worked fine.  This time it did not.  The first camera gave me a failure message.  So deleted the camera from the app and ran it again.  It once again setup easily, but this time it had the latest firmware.  So apparently the update worked, but something went wrong with the reboot at the end.  All 3 did the same thing.  However,  that said, all 3 have been working well for 8 months now, with 2 or 3 firmware updates that have been flawless. The firmware and app have both added cool new features.","As someone already noted, these are a game changer, but I did have some setup issues with my last 3."

DO NOT BUY THIS! UPADATE: in less than two months, Wyze Cam Pan is dead. Disposable camera for 35 bucks, anyone?! I can't believe posts complaining about short life span, until mine died. What a waste! I got my one Wyze Pan three days ago. It was operational in minutes tracking movements and noise like a mad dog with amazingly sharp colors. I spent hours trying to find faults but I couldn't other than the loud hum of the motion tracking motor, the choppy sound and more integration with smart home products. The free cloud was not a myth either and it captured most of the significant motion. The micro sd card captured all movements without a miss with a comfortable before and after event buffer time. So I bought 6 more and bragged about it to friends and relatives. One Month Update: The cameras just shut down regularly and give error code 90 - requiring physical power cycle. They shutdown more often progressively and you have to inspect them regularly, reboot, power cycle and make sure they are connected. I am downgrading to one star. What if you are out-of-town? These are not install and forget devices - they add to things to worry about when you are traveling - pets, houseplants, lights and then, these cameras. I'd return them if I could.",Died - DO NOT BUY !!!

Possible disadvantages are that it works only with the Wyze app as of now.  The Wyze Pan and its fixed counterpart are game changers.  If you don't need a cloud Cam or an outside security cameras these cameras set the bar.  They aren't the best cameras but they are incredible values are as close to zero setup as possible.  Frankly floored by these things.  Buy one to try the worse case is you loose less than $50 and 10 minutes to setup.  If you already have another Wyze camera it will take longer to get out of the box than to get it working.  Great thing for many users. I'm not throwing my other cameras away,  but the other camera makers need to be paying attention.",Floored. These are game changers.

Dave is from Utah, which is where I live and I was exited to try out this awesome looking product! Set up was EXTREMELY easy, and its picture quality is great! The motion tracking is really cool and night vision isreally clear! However, at the end of the day, none of this matters if you cannot connect to the camera. The camera CONSTANTLY loses connection to the internet (like every 3-5 minutes). The router and camera are in the same room, no less than 10ft apart. Even when I am home and ON the same Wifi, I get the connection issue. Tried all the steps, re-setting camera up, resetting my home Wifi, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and still the same issue happens. After trying to connect a few times, the camera will prompt you to do a power cycle. And sometimes, the camera will just completely just shut off, and it wont turn back on until someone actually unplugs the power from the camera. What is the point of having a camera to use while your away if you have to be home to constantly reset it? So disappointing.. *Update! After using it for a couple weeks, we had moved the camera from our living room, into our spare bedroom. This bedroom is farther away from our internet router, so I was sure it wouldn't even connect. But to my surprise, it has connected and not ONCE has it lost connection.. Odd that I went farther away and it has a better connection. Updated my review to 4 stars, as it still does suck that the camera cannot go in the room I'd like it to go in.",Constant connection issues UPDATED*

The problem is 90% of the time it won't sync with the app. I constantly get an error code 90 saying that I need to re-cycle the camera to get it to work again. Or for no reason at all i will have to launch the app over 10 times to get it to work. It's very frustrating. I bought this to use as a baby monitor. We have an audio only monitor, and I was hoping to use this for the video. I was planning on buying more for the rest of the house if I liked it enough. Oh and forget using the pan/tilt! Every single time it freezes up, and takes 20 minutes to start working again. My husband is pretty good with electronics and he has checked our internet connection and made sure nothing is interfering with the camera, and we can't find any reason on our end why it works so poorly. I'm crossing my fingers for some sort of software update to fix these issues, because like I said the camera is really neat when it works.

I was hoping to use it as a baby monitor but so far in the past month the sound on the app goes in and out or just completely goes silent. I have a sound machine on in my kids room so I can tell when the sound goes out. Also the app randomly shuts itself down. I thought it might have been my device (iPhones) so I tried 2 other devices with no luck. I am very sad since the idea is great. The camera is good. The alerts are on point.

I have several brands of camera around my house inside and out now. But all fixed, none pan. Camera itself works great, as intended. Nice to pan around and check out the house if you're curious, picture quality is excellent. SD card storage has major issues. Wyze knows about it, but hasnt been able to fix it just yet. Your SD card will fill up, and when it does, the card becomes junk. Wyze forums have some tips some folks have had luck with, some say a GoPro camera recognizes the card, my GoPro does not. I purchased a Wyze branded 32GB card, and it's in the garbage now. So overall, I'd stay away. There are similar cameras that work just as well on Amazon, similar price, and dont cost you an SD card every few days.

I LOVE it. Now it's NOT a doorbell but heck I don't answer my doorbell anyways (my giant mastiff alerts the entire neighborhood when some tries to get close to the front of the house and he looks mean) I just want to replay the coming and going activities as needed or watch live feed if I see fit so this Wyze device was perfect!!! It detects motion and/or sound and sends alerts, it motion tracks, motion tags, pan tracks, it offers continuous recording that can play back days of time in addition to sending you motion clips based on motion or person detection settings, you can watch the live feed with sound (what you hear is based on distance) AND it has two way selections to listen and talk through it decently, you can create shortcuts to do quick temp activities such as one click to pause notifications to override your schedule settings  (exp: I stayed home sick and have it set to normally send alerts during work hours so I press my pause shortcut so my hub's doesn't get alerts while I move around the house AND without having to mess with my weekday settings), you can add multiple cameras easily, play back entire periods YOU select in time lapse speed, you can take pics of what you are seeing, take videos from live view or from the playback (use to black mail your kids when you catch them singing or picking a nose), the app is easy to use, you can buy inexpensive accessories to mount it on an outlet or mount it to a wall, even hang it upside down bcz you can flip the view,  and the best.... NO PAID SUBSCRIPTION required.

This morning my one year-old was near the charge port for my Wyze cam pan. I’ve had this camera for about a month and has not sustain any damage of any type. We were in the same area playing with a ball and he was simply trying to stand up, he wasn’t “playing” with it or anything, he just kind of backed into it. To my surprise the charging brick came apart quite easily, and it was obvious upon inspection that this was poorly made. The worst part of this all is that once apart, it leaves two metal probes sticking out of your wall, Which could easily electrocute anyone.  We do not leave our children unattended, but this still frightens me to think that something could happen where negligence on the part of Wyzecam Due to saving money and cutting corners could lead to the death of one of my children Upon seeing this I called Wyze cam and was put on hold for it I was told to be two minutes, after waiting 20 minutes, I messaged them on Facebook with no response. I called back later on in the morning and after 15 minutes I spoke to representative who told me “I need to remind you to keep these out of the reach of small children“. I explained to him that these were built very cheaply and you can see very clearly that this is a friction fit peace, there are no screws, no solder joints, and it’s very obvious that they are of poor quality. After him telling me that the answer to my problem was to keep my 1 year old away from this, I told him I would record the conversation and that is when he hung up on me. I have attached pictures to show what happens when the front of the charge port comes off. This is a shame that the company would not stand behind they product, as they told me “oh I’m sorry that happened but just to let you know this ain’t common” but it is even sadder to see that their response to a poorly made product was to keep children away from it because it is obviously harmful. I know that, I’m sure who is reading knows that, it doesn’t make this problem any better. It is difficult in any house to keep kids away from plugs and in every open plug of my house I have protectors. I can’t use these plugs in good faith knowing that a company would be so unwilling to stand behind something they make, even when it is shown to them that it could kill people. The camera itself is good, and I am going to replace the plugs on my own with ones that won’t potentially Kill my children.

I got high capacity GB SD cards that literally save a month's worth of activity and is immediately accessible remotely. You don't really need them tho as you also get 14 days of Cloud storage free. Those photos/videos you save there can then be easily shared thru a variety of ways (text, email, print, etc). The complaints below are a combination of user errors (like not adjusting the pan/tilt speeds) and/or poor WiFi connectivity (or just a bum unit that should be replaced). My system connected flawlessly and I only have 100Mbps service in a rather large home. There is little, if any lag, and the high definition picture blows others away. While this is an indoor camera I shoot mine through internal windows for the same effect.  The image shown is thru my living room window to the front door.

The picture quality is good, in both day and night mode, but only when the camera is not panning or tilting. Motion causes the video to break up until the camera stops again. This happens even on the low resolution setting. The camera doesn't have enough  horsepower to do a quality job of motion detecting or motion tracking, and since both features seem to make the video less stable I've turned them off. Pan and tilt commands sent to the camera from the app seem to lag quite a bit. The general sound alarm is much too sensitive. Even with the sensitivity set to 1 / 100 it still false alarms with normal conversation or a phone ringing in the next room so I've turned that feature off. The ""CO Alarm"" alarm doesn't work at all when I trigger my CO sensor. However, it did think a violin playing on a TV show was a CO alarm and reported it. I haven't tried the ""Smoke Alarm"" alarm feature yet. The camera only supports 2.4G WiFi connections. The app is nice looking and laid out well. All the controls and features are easily accessible. Talking through the camera seems to work sometimes and not at other times. I haven't found any zoom controls yet and I thought it had 8x digital zoom. I can pinch zoom the live feed but that's not a digital zoom because the entire field of view is still visible. Having a bright source such as a window in the camera field of view makes the picture useless because the camera doesn't compensate for the increased brightness. The wide angle lens, 14 day rolling cloud storage, and microSD card support are all nice features. Mine came with a 6' power cord. Some of the reviews said the cord was only 2'.  In summary, for $30 you can do worse, but don't expect the quality, features, reliability, or functionality you'd find in a camera costing 2x or 3x the price.",Don't Expect Too Much - It's a $30 Camera

It is cheap and works pretty well. My current setup is having this sit in a window sill looking out at my grill and my back yard. This is not the best setup but it works for what I require. I have it elevated sitting on top of a glass candle covered with a lid. I am able to easily control the camera position from the android app. The camera barely makes any noise when moving and it moves very fast. It stays put and won't fall over. A few issues about the motion detection... It comes installed with 50 out of 100 on the detection sensitivity. With my setup in daylight it was not able to track me if I walked in front of the camera. I had to look directly at it for it to track me. I am guessing the Artificial Intelligence understands what a human face looks like. If I was to hold something like my grill cover and move it around it will track me. Once it ""locks on"" it will follow me as I walk around my yard. After a few moments it will go back to the original position. There is an option to setup the camera's motion detection area. Also you can setup multiple points to go in order in a panning mode. It will look at point a for 10 seconds, move to point b, etc. I didn't use this option. I did change the tracking sensitivity higher around 70 and it was able to follow me without having my grill cover in hand. It is great at instantly sending a push notification with a short clip of what was detected. Only issue with this is sometimes it detects the trees blowing in the wind and will give you false alerts. The speaker option works okay. I had to be pretty loud on my phone for it to sound decent coming from the camera. But yes you could use this to talk to someone if they are in front of the camera. Your results may vary. At night this thing is decent. I have multiple outside lights so the area is bright enough at night to detect myself moving or anyone else. There is no issues with trees at night. And yes you can disable the night vision LEDs and the Blue ""recording"" LED. I did both of these options and it can probably show you details someone's face if they are a few feet from the window. You must remember there will be some glare in the video since it is recording through glass and  to keep the area it is watching bright with extra light. Also it helps to clean the inside and outside of your window! It has been running for 8 days on Standard Definition mode continuous record with no sound recording and it has filled up almost all of my 32GB SD card. Currently 0.56GB of free space available. So you should get at least 8 days of recording to your card before it starts to override the video with newer video. HD video mode I am not sure probably less than a week of recording. Overall for the price this is a great buy. It works very well and I might buy a 2nd one to monitor my front door.",Great deal on a camera

Motion detection and sound detection are solid. If you want discreet, this is it. Infrared on the Wyze is not externally visible (my Arlo cameras turn on red lights). Obviously, panning the camera has motor noise, so you don't want to do that. But if you want to stealth in on how well your caregiver responds at night to your bedbound senior parent, it's really good. Want to monitor two locations but don't want to pan? They're cheap as dirt, get another one. The place where the Wyzecam is weak is the app.  Initial setup was pretty easy, but once you set the WiFi network name and password, there is no way to change it (i.e. there's no edit mode) except by going through setup again. (Fortunately, other settings are saved so you're not really starting from ground zero.) There are icons that you can toggle but it's unclear what they mean. There is a help section that seems to be drawing from the online forum, but it doesn't seem to be optimized for mobile -- there are illustrations to go with the text, but I can't see them.  There's a sense of disorganization/incompleteness to the app, e.g. there's a button to turn off push notifications for everything, and a button to turn off push for individual cameras, but these buttons are in completely different places and there's no link to take you to the other option. Scheduling recordings is pretty simple, it can be triggered by motion or sound, and you can set a time range for the triggers to be active. However, there is only one 24-hour schedule, so if you want to record let's say only on weekends, you're s out of luck. Recording to the cloud is in 12 second increments. You cannot configure this length. If you want longer segments you must install an SD card, and it will record in 1 minute increments. You cannot configure this length either. You cannot access the cloud recordings from a PC web browser and they DO NOT plan to make it accessible. You cannot bulk download cloud recordings, you can only save one at a time with the ""share"" button, which is far too tedious because there will be *a lot* of recordings. I put in an 8GB SD card which I was able to format, but have not yet been able to get it to work as the Wyzecam suddenly stopped recognizing it. Will update in a few days when I'm able to get back to the camera. So overall, the app will do the basics for you, but it is not so easy to do other things that are just a pinch beyond basic. In my ideal world they would put the app on GitHub so people can improve on it, because it needs a lot of that. This camera deserves a better app.","Camera quality great, software not so much"

Coming in, I was really really pumped to get based off of all the noise and rave reviews. I waited for at least 4 months of use before coming here to give my candid opinion. HARDWARE: The built quality is really good. Does not feel like cheap plastic. The design is plain, no bells and whistles. SOFTWARE: This is the real reason why I bought it. Keeping real time video of my surroundings. And this is where it all nosedived. This is advertised as a 1080p HD camera. With options of 720p and lower. When the setting is at the highest resolution I experienced an irritating time lag of almost 15 seconds between the actual motion and when its captured on the cam. I said let me bring it down to 720p and there was a noticeable improvement. The lag was about 3 seconds. Now, just to give the device the full benefit of the doubt, I said maybe the problem is from my network. And so I tried a different security camera brand -- Tenvis. The Tenvis also is advertised as 1080p HD. On set up, there was almost no lag in the recording. So, it was obvious the culprit wasn't my network but rather the Wyze cam itself. Got in touch with their service team and we kept going back and forth on all the possible problems. In the end, they said I should keep it at 720p. Like really? To make matters worse, they announced a security breach that exposed peoples personal information. They claimed no threat was posed. Yeah, right. I have not logged in since the security problem. And I intend to junk this (and the other 3 I have )since they're not accepting returns. I cannot in good conscience recommend this security cam. Look elsewhere.

I am extremely pleased with these cameras. Like all the reviews I've seen say, these cameras have the quality and features of the much more expensive cameras. I love the fact that I can have onboard 24/7 recording and I do not have to pay any subscription fees for cloud storage. They are constantly updating the app with more features and functionality and are coming out with new add-on products. So far these appear to be a great product from a great company! EXPERT TIP: I learned this through some testing and previous experience with reported maximum MicroSD card size in Tesla Model 3 cars. The 32GB size limitation appears to be incorrect and only specified due to the fact that Windows computers can only format USB drives and MicroSD cards using the FAT32 file system to a maximum size of 32GB via the GUI interface. It is entirely possible to format any of the external USB drives, SD cards, or MicroSD cards of a much larger size with the FAT32 file system. If you Google ""windows format fat32 command line"" you will find numerous articles showing you how to do it either via the built in command line tools or using third party utilities. Mac computers can also format these larger storage devices to FAT32 via the GUI or the command line. In the MacOS GUI the file system format is just called MS-DOS (FAT). I am successfully using Samsung 128GB MicroSD cards in all of my Wyze cameras. With the 128GB cards I am able to store approximately 21 days of rolling 24/7 camera footage. I have not tested, but suspect that 256GB MicroSD cards will also work (this is based on the fact that I am using 256GB USB stick to store music on and plug into my Tesla which says that the maximum size for the required FAT32 format is 32GB).

I had 2 of these and 2 of the regular cameras set up on my doors and garage.  They are super simple to set up.  One note on set up- you must use 2.4Ghz wifi so when it pulls up wifi, I just had to erase the 5G from the network setting.  They set up quickly and the app works fine.  I set them up for motion recording and HD- it's a bit too grainy to identify things in standard def.  I also installed 32GB SD cards so they would record on the device.  The app allows you to view and store motion and/or sound events. So for a fraction of the cost, I was able to set up my entire house with quality security cameras versus something like the Nest cams.  Genius right?  I thought so until I was getting ready to leave for a vacation and decided I should go ahead and update all of the firmware on my devices so I was up-to-date before I left. If you are using these, DO NOT DO THE FIRMWARE UPDATES!!!!!  When it was done, all of the cameras completely locked up.  It wouldn't connect to wifi rendering all of them completely useless.  I tried to do a factory reset and also even tried to use the SD card to install an old version of the firmware from the Wayze website.  Nothing worked.  I worked for hours trying to get them to work but nothing. I would have given these 5 stars for great value, simple app, decent build quality and good video.

It is taller than I expected and I was disappointed to find out that the IR lighting is mounted below the camera.  This meant that I had to prop it up higher above the cabinet to get it to work correctly in night mode.  The night mode is ok, but compared to the Blink night mode, it isn't as clear and sharp. The panning motor is loud and it is noticeable when it is moving.  I also found that it kept trying to point to the wall when on the motion activated setting.  I could have saved $10 by buying the stationary camera if I had known that.  I have motion turned off and it sits high above the cabinet because of these issues. However, I will give it credit that the HD quality is very clear.  I like that you can zoom in with the video feed and that it doesn't cut you off quickly when watching live video like my outdoor Blink cameras do.  The software is decent and I like that it has the ability to capture video during the day (I work from home and have kids that are home during the day, mostly wanted to capture things at night or early morning) and not notify me constantly.  I have it schedule to only notify me during certain hours but it is capturing all day long.  I didn't opt for the SD card yet.  The free cloud storage will probably be all I need.  I like that it can do time lapse and has a panning pattern that can be customized.  For now I will leave it at a stationary position but if I need to pan and see the other side of the room I can do that or have it motion activated. If you are looking for a stealth panning camera, this isn't for you.  Be sure you need panning or motion before getting this versus their cheaper version.  But if you need a camera to capture clear motion this is a great deal for the price.","A very inexpensive, clear, motion camera that is a little noisy"

"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Feb 2019,William J Beard,"I am writing this review after about a year of owning the WyzeCam Pan. I was initially very impressed by this product but I will now go into detail about all the things that they got wrong when designing this device 1. NO web interface of any kind is available, even though all the traffic for the camera's live view goes over LAN if you are on the same network, and not over the internet like Amazon's own Cloudcam does for example. This fact alone should make a web interface very easy to deploy. Per their forums they say that it is the number one feature request but that they have no plans to implement it. Seems like they really don't care about their customers that much. 2. If you email them for any type of support or question, you will get a canned response 100% of the time and trying to follow up to the generic email is impossible. So if customer service is important to you, get another camera from a reputable brand. 3. The hardware that this thing uses is not even capable of capturing, rendering, and streaming HD video. Just switching back and forth between SD and HD, one can clearly see that the image quality of the SD image is better and the frame rate is very stable in SD. But I did not buy an SD camera, I bought and HD 1080p camera and really wanted to use it as such, it's impossible though. Much more detail is captured in standard definition mode so that's what I'm stuck using. 4. The app randomly kick you out of the live feed and returns to the main menu with a white screen. This forces you to kill the app and relaunch every time that this happens. This cam become very tedious if you want to watch one of your cameras 24/7. I say one because you would need a separate device to view another camera. 5. The camera itself randomly crashes or freezes and the app tells you to go power cycle the thing, which is impossible if you're not home. (without specialized equipment). I find myself power cycling this and other Wyze cameras daily and if I can go 48 hours without resetting one, then that's a good run for this camera before it get's glitched out by poor firmware programming and the cheap SoC that they use. In conclusion, I would like to say that I really wish this camera worked properly because it is a really amazing price point. However, the old idioms stand ""if it's too good to be true, it's probably not"" and ""You get what you pay for"" come to mind. The less you pay for something, the lower quality it will inevitably be, especially when there are pricier options on the market. Well Wyze has to undercut everyone, including you yo have a prayer of making any profit (which they really don't). Which brings me to my final thought; this company cannot not last. It is an unsustainable business model. They will either go out of business completely and my cams will be worthless or they will end up forcing everyone to purchase a subscription plan. Either way, I have no confidence on this product or brand and it's future. ***As a point aside from the review: did you know that the Wyze team used to work at Amazon and developed the Cloudcam? It's true, then they just cut and run and probably either stole intellectual property from Amazon or changed it just enough not to get sued. I personally find people like this morally bankrupt and after finding this out I wish I had not supported them monetarily by purchasing this garbage from them.",Detailed Review From Owner of Many Cameras

Firstly, if you lose power or it accidentally gets unplugged, the camera resets and needs to be set up again. If you are away and trying to monitor your home this makes the cameras inoperable. If you are home and need to reset it's more of an annoyance. Secondly, when I bought the camera person detection was included. Now it's a ""subscription"" that you need to pay for. I purposely did not buy a camera that needed a subscription so it feels like I was duped. Presently my camera only detects motion and not people so it's nearly useless as a security  camera. I walked right by it today twice and the camera detected nothing. Thirdly, I forgot my password for my Wyze.com account and it has been very difficult to recover it. Tried chatting with customer service and it wasn't helpful. This is a company based in the U.S. (Seattle) so I really wanted to like this product because picture quality, motion and person detection is very good. Unfortunately I wish I could get my money back.",Wish I could return this

The only thing that kills it is the software integration. If you want to review footage, you have to ""scrub"" through the footage, and it takes like 3 second per movement to show just a thumbnail of the footage. I held off on filing a review to see if they would release an update to allow 2x, 5x, 10x, or even 20x scrubbing to footage, but they have not. It is EXHAUSTING trying to find specific clips in this camera, since you have to watch in real time. Motion detection is good but it can only send you like a minute clip. If this camera had wonderful software, it would be 5/5 stars, but unfortunately it is dreadful software lacking even basic features such as fast forward.","Good quality, software is what kills it"

Unbelievable deal.  So here are my experiences: I noticed how intelligently packaged the product was.  Great sign.  Only Apple products impress me more on packaging. Download the Wyze app to your phone. Plug the USB into the outlet adaptor, then plug it into the base unit. Make sure to REMOVE THE LENS COVER before attempting to connect your device to your WiFi. Scanning the QR code can be rather tricky.  It took me several attempts.  I watched their video and they noted that you should bring your phone about 5 inches in front of the camera lens.  Because my phone's screen is large, I had to bring it back to about 6 or 7 inches, and because there was glare, I had to tip the phone at a better angle so the camera could read the QR code.  This is the only frustrating part about the setup process as it took about ten tries. Once you connect, go to your settings (the sprocket) and build your Pan settings. After you do this, it's possible that you might end up just moving the entire device to a different part of your room. Here's something I thought would snag me.  If the WiFi router goes out, will the camera reconnect once router signaling is back?  Yes, it will.  I tested this by unplugging and replugging my WiFi router and it reconnected automagically.  (Side note:  I have a UPS on my cable modem and router for power failure purposes, so you may equally want to explore that option.) Anyway, it appears you can buy other devices to pair with this system so I'm looking forward to plunging into the IoT world, now! Thanks, Wyze!!",Absolute Wonderful Product

I attached one picture from one of my cameras over our register. Most of the lights are off and there is enough sunlight coming in that night mode is currently disabled. What I like: * The microphone is fairly sensitive and you can hear the conversations if the background doesn't drown it out. * You can speak over the camera and the people can actually hear you! WAY better than the Amazon Cloud Cam. * Monitor the video feed from anywhere you have internet access. * Motion and/or sound events can be pushed as notifications. * Images are very clear. * Easy to setup * Low network usage * Cameras have stayed online across router reboots. (My Amazon Cloud Cams keep losing connection. Things I don't like: * Field of view is fairly wide angle. Not bad in itself but I wish they had another option that wasn't quite so wide view and worked better for distance. * Alert sensitivity... It would be nice to get alerts if there is movement detected during the night when our business is closed. And this camera COULD do it. The issue is that because of the wide field of view, I get a partial view of the street so passing cars set this off ALL NIGHT LONG. If they could mask off a part to ignore, it would be AWESOME. For the price point, this camera is awesome. You get constant recording onto the memory chip (IF you bought and installed it) or 12sec events uploaded to cloud. If you are being robbed and they steal the cameras or remove the memory chip you have lost most of your recordings. So businesses that are at high risk of robbery may want something else. For the rest of us normal people, this little thing packs a lot of value into a very affordable device. This is my own review. I did NOT get comped anything to write this.",Cheap and works great so far.

No WIFI selection. Have to manually enter SSID and PW. - motion detection resets the camera position every 5 seconds (that's a bug and should be solved !!!) - relatively low dynamic range - footage overprocessed - uses way too much space on storage card for the limited quality - doesn't like backlight - no alert markers in timeline when recording 'continuios' recording - no live or real-time view when playing re-recorded sd card video - some functions difficult to find / different places for setting (why?) - hard to find good instructions (they are everywhere, but no REAL manual !!!!) - length of recording not adjustable - requires new Android version to install app (old devices won't work, you can use TinyCam but will have same issue with Wyze Cam :-() - once lost 2 way audio, but came back after reboot of device - uses lots of space (low compression) - for several functions (e.g. time-lapse) phone(app) needs to be connected to same wifi - no online viewer, but there are options to work around, but lots of work and may not work - no camera position presets - voice/micro very low volume - time-lapse difficult to set - zooming NOT on video !!! - no reocurring time-lapse scheduler (like every day) - tracking slow and probably won't work in real - no time-lapse based on recordings on SD card BTW - The footage is a 8 Hours Time-Lapse in 15 Seconds",Above average but still way from being perfect

I have had 5 of these for 6 months. Pros: Cheap price and well made Excellent video quality when streaming and recorded videos. Easy set up Free 12 seconds max per notification recording in the cloud. (Only can see last 14 days and then they are deleted). Huge Cons: There is usually a delay of 2-5 minutes between motion in front of the camera and a notification on your phone. More than enough time for someone to get in your house in one room and get the drop on you in a different room before you get the notification of motion. This delay occurs even when I am home and even though I have high speed internet in my home. The notification recordings, which are stored in the cloud, are extremely short (Only 12 seconds in length) The camera will only give you a notification and cloud recording only once per five minutes. So if you trigger the camera when you leave your door and someone walk in your door 3 minutes later, there is no notification or cloud recording. There is a 5 min cool down period. So you get a maximum of 12 seconds per 5 minutes stored in the cloud. To get longer recordings requires inserting an SD card in the camera. This can give you continuous all day recording and playback. However that recording is not stored in the cloud and if someone takes the camera you will not be able to retrieve any recordings other than the very very short notification recordings, which will have 5 minute gaps between them. The SD card cost should be considered when buying this camera. You can only live stream one camera at a time. If someone is walking around your house, you cannot get a view from all cameras at once. You can only access live streaming and notification recordings through app on your phone and not through desktop/laptop or directly. Pan cam motion tracking does not return camera to original position after moving object goes out of frame. For example if the pan cam is aimed towards the right side of your room, and someone moves across the room and out a door on the left, the pan cam will stay positioned to the left and not automatically return to the original right sided position. Summary: Overall excellent quality for live streaming or playing back SD card to see what your kids, nanny, dog do during the day when you are not home. Terrible for security cameras. If they were any more expensive, I'd give them 2 stars.","Terrible for security cameras. OK for recording kids, dog, nanny."

So, I had it working for 30 minutes. The app was easy enough to set up but I never got a chance to check out the operation. I paid more for it on Amazon rather than buying it directly from their website in case I ran into problems as the reviews with this camera seemed mix. I know I can count on Amazon for easy returns and replacements without going through any hassle (read their return policy on their website) and it’s well worth the extra couple dollars, and it appears I made the right choice.

Buyers should beware that only 12 seconds of motion detected will be recorded for play back... that is it! And then there is a 5 minute delay before the next motion is recorded for 12 seconds.  If you want to review the rest of what has been recorded they advise you to input a micro sd card to continuously record to which requires you to manually review all of the footage to review those times that movement was recorded.  I have now gone back to mounting my old iPhones with the Manything app and reviewing motion detection through them instead.,Beware only 12 seconds of motion recorded with a 5 minute cool down before the next recording!

I was in love with the camera at first. Setting it up is very easy. Picture quality is amazing, but the camera loses signal daily. I’d walk by it and notice the blue light flashing and not stable which means it lost connection. It’s within 8ft of my modem/router. I have xfinity blast 150mbps download speed which is more than enough for practically anything. Everything always stays connected wirelessly except this darn camera. I’ve been at work, and wanted to check on my dogs and it never has signal. Pretty useless if it’s not holding connection in my opinion.

Almost a year later and no complaints! This product is fantastic! I set it up last night (super easy process - 5/10 min tops) and I’ve been thrilled so far. The motion and sound detections are quick and accurate. You can pan the camera, move it side to side, up and down, and zoom, all from your phone app. Notification come immediately and the live stream is INCREDIBLE. Beautiful picture and video quality. The two way audio works like a charm (although it does slightly distort your voice) and the sound quality was completely unexpected. I am also loving the night vision. Without it, the room was pitch black last night, I flipped it on and I could clearly see every single nook and cranny. This is an amazing product, and it’s a steal at this price.

Audio could be louder both ways - when you speak and when you listen. My major issue is the Android app. For whatever reason it downloaded 85 MB while in foreground (me watching live stream, I believe) and whopping 350 MB in the background in half a day on cellular network! I have quality set to SD and watched it for like 3 minutes overall, so this data consumption is just crazy. Even 85 MB on foreground doesn't sound right to me, given the streaming time I had. I don't know what it was downloading in the background, but as soon as I discovered that it's eating through my limited mobile data like it's nobody's business - I restricted background data for the app. At this point I'm not sure, if it has any pros over any other cheap camera that can do live stream and recording - if I understand correctly, with background data disabled I won't get any notifications for fire/CO2 alarm, which was supposed to be a neat feature. The problem is made worse by the fact that this app is the only way to access the camera - there is no website where you can go and watch the stream, while you are stationary on ethernet.","Okay camera, bad software"

At the BEST conditions, there was a 15-25 second delay in the so-called ""live"" feed. This is enough time for anyone to walk in, grab something, and walk out of an establishment. By the time you see what's going on, it's done and over. There is a lag in communication time between Echo show and the cameras before you get a ""lagged"" live feed. So, communicating with someone is aggravating and could cause real confusion. Understand, i tested this (within 10 feet) of a 2.5ghz router so i was getting ""full"" strength signal. I wished to be fair about this so i moved this camera around to multiple location....it got worse from there. I am forced to agree with other negative reviews....this camera is no better than an augmented ""toy"". Also i bought the outdoor protection for this camera....it's a silicon joke. I could spit on the camera and short it out, it wouldn't survive any amount of rain (even with the protection jacket that can be bought (extra). This camera only works (nominally) under near-perfect conditions and with the signal lag, it's just a joke. The night vision camera did not impress me (unless i look at this camera as a ""toy"", it would be an impressive toy). With there being no, true, control command system (other than the cell phone) it's just a toy and shouldn't be taken seriously for ANY situation where security is involved. I am also a tech repair individual and i had it's signal feed under near-perfect conditions. I would not take this camera too seriously.",Many issues with this camera.

I am a ""beta tester,"" which is to say I am among a large group of Wyzecam consumers that get firmware updates before the other buyers do.  I expect their to be bugs.  That being said, at this point I found the motion tracking to be imperfect.  There are times when the camera catches the initial movement but doesn't stay with it, as in the case with my dogs.  Or the Wyzecam Pan will stay with the moving subject, but jump to another position then back to the subject repeatedly.  Lastly, while you can adjust sensitivity, things like moving tree branches and flying insects will be recorded so you get dozens of alerts of movement, most of which are just a waste of time to review. Pros:  1) Relatively inexpensive 2) You get a 12 second preview and then can download the longer video from their cloud 3) No monthly charges 4) Using your wi-fi system you can view what your cameras see via their cell phone app from anywhere you can access the internet.  5) If you install Bluestacks on your computer, you can monitor all of your cameras on your computer.  6) You can take still photos or make videos of the live stream to save or share on your cell phone.  7) You can set up the Wyzecam and/or Wyzecam Pan in your bedroom to see if aliens are abducting you while you sleep. Cons: 1) Customer service may take several days to a week to get back to you  2) Device is imperfect  3) You never know with each update if some of the functioning will work and sometimes you have to go back to a previous version in order to have a system you can rely on.  4) With their latest update there is no longer an easy return to a previous software version - you have to follow a multiple step process that ends in flashing the firmware to return to the previous version 5) They're currently trying to perfect their AI for discerning if there's a person in the video or not 6) Most people install this product and the Wyzecam V1 and V2 outside.  That invalidates the warranty and you get no customer support if you do, even if like me, you install the Wyzecam Pan under a roof eave, and put the Wyzecam in housing designed to protect it outside. 7) The Wyzecam Pan, like the Wyzecam, has a built in speaker that transmits and picks up audio, but it's not very loud.  8) This device is known to corrupt SD memory cards.  I've had better luck with the stationary Wyzecams.  I'm on my 3rd card with this one. Wyzecam is working on an ""outdoor"" model.  Right now, their products are buggy so you have to decide, is it worth saving money for a ""work in progress.""  I'm trying a high usage memory card this time in the hopes that it will last longer than a few months.  I hope at some point Wyzecam can work out all of the bugs because I think if they do they will have a great product at a great price.",Still a work in progress

I bought two of the pan/tilt cameras and one V2 after seeing a review on YouTube by LifeHackster.  I needed to set up some cameras fast and cheap at a new vacation home I bought that's in a rural area of New Hampshire. In a word, all three work very well.  They connected to WIFI without any problems, the APP works well, and the motion detection/motion tracking is pretty good...not great, but good.

Pretty cool. If you want to start out with a wifi security camera that's cheap, easy to use, I would strongly suggest buying one of these.  You can always upgrade, but these will work pretty well.  The cloud service is free (although only 15 seconds of motion sent to the cloud) and with a 32 gb card you can easily check out the whole event. Only downside I see is the motion detection is a little spotty, and the audio doesn't sink up with the video, there is a one second delay.

Everything looked great until I tried to use the SD card that I purchased (SanDisk). I started researching why the device would not recognize the SD card and found out that their new firmware update has caused SD cards that are NOT Wyze brand to not work. So basically if you want to use the SD card feature you have to get their brand SD card. I do not like to support a company that forces you to use only their brand.

I don't record anything directly to the SD card and don't use the built-in motion detection etc. I use rtsp: to connect to my NAS and other security monitoring software on my PC, and use their settings. One very disturbing issue just 20 minutes ago: I use the YouTube app on my smart TV, and after watching an episode of Antiques Roadshow, instead of going to the next video, I had 5 minutes of what I assume is some Chinese woman and her cam feeds. Reference the video. Not a joke. This didn't come thru the app, but across my network to my TV. My TV isn't connected to my phone, so I can't see where changing the password would or could have any effect. It appears that they (whom ever ""they"" are) have access to my internal network. Not impressed at all. I'm going to change the sub net on the wireless router I use for these cams, change the password and see if it happens again. If it does, in the trash they go! Original review: ____________________ These cams are a snap to setup. Install the app and follow really simple instructions. At one point it will have you will need to have the camera read a QR code on your phone. Don't forget to remove the protective plastic film that's over the lens. I have (2) Pan cams mounted outside with black silicone covers, and (3) V2 cams inside the house. All have been updated to ""demo"" firmware, that allows them to be accessed from my PC desktop, laptop, NAS etc. using rtsp:// protocol. Search ""Wyze WiFi cam desktop viewing"" to locate the ""demo"" firmware. There's a version for both V2 and Pan cams. Both work great. I don't use SD cards in any of them (except to upgrade the firmware). I use free software to connect to the cameras and record with no time limit. The motion detection is cool. If you enable it, it will follow a car going by, as the car moves, so the camera rotates to keep it in frame. The color reproduction in good light is excellent. To get the best resolution from your cam, after initial setup, go to the live stream view. You'll see an ""SD"" in a light blue outlined box just to the left of the words, ""Live Stream"". Select this, and you'll get a drop down list with: SD, 360P, and HD. SD is the default. Keep in mind that higher resolution will require more bandwidth on your WiFi, and affect how responsive the cam is from the app when viewing the live stream. I'v read many questions on here about whether or not the Wyze cameras are wireless. Some have answered erroneously that they aren't, that they need to be connected to power. Huh? They are wireless indeed. Wireless is how they communicate, but are powered by a USB cable connected to a power supply that plugs into the wall (both supplied). Think about what happens when your phone's battery runs out. You plug it into a charging cable. It still communicates wirelessly, but is plugged into the wall for power. It doesn't stop being wireless when you plug it in. Overall for the money, you really can't go wrong. My only uncertainty is how these ""indoor"" cams will work outside in weather. It can get to -20 here in the winter. Only the Pan cams are outside under the eaves. out of the lion's share of the weather. I wouldn't have tried putting them outside had I not read about others doing it with good results. Search YouTube as well. As I learn more, I'll update this review. Hope it's helped someone. :)","At this price point, how can you possibly go wrong. I couldn't be happier :) : Update"

Setting up alerts was super easy and worked great. I did purchase two Micro-SD chips so I could record to that, instead of the cloud because accessing video from the cloud seemed a little too complicated for someone not-tech smart like myself. That being said, having no skills in tech whatsoever, these were SO EASY to install and setup. I did make the mistake of connecting to the wrong internet (need 2.5 instead of 5 ghz) but once I realized that, it was smooth sailing! I bought one for multiple rooms in my house and even purchased one as a gift because I thought they were SO cool! The gift purchase went to a family member and I helped them with the setup, as well as helped them program the app onto two user's phones, so they can both access the camera/settings. I love these so much! The only downside (if this is important to you, it's not to me), is they don't really blend into your settings (meaning they stand out quite a bit). They also have to be plugged in 24/7 to stay on but they do come with a chord, they don't however come with a block to plug the USB into the wall so you may need to purchase that. All-in-all, I LOVE these cameras and think the picture quality is great, and the alert notifications are very reliable.",Best In-Class for Home Video Monitoring

They arrived and I followed the steps for installation which are simple and it didn’t work. I emailed customer service and 4days later they still haven’t contacted me back. Now I know why they are so cheap, it’s a volume product but not quality oriented. If you are one of the lucky that buys this product and it works then great. But if it doesn’t work or breaks somehow, good luck with getting support to fix the issue. Just glad mine didn’t work out of the box rather than dealing with no customer support in the future.

Seriously, this should work right out of the box! Motion tracking and all functions should work as advertised but does not. old review: tried firmware 4.10.3.108 (latest) 4.10.3.60 4.10.3.50 4.10.3.40 re-installed the app and the device in the app several times. Does not work: all automated stuff: event recording auto-tracking motion detection (no green boxes, unresponsive, sensitivity set to 5, 7 & 10 max) motion tagging motion detection zone on or off notifications - enabled in ios - bell icon not crossed out in app - all wyze app notification settings enabled under every section i could find enabled ""free"" person detection & disabled it. still not working. Worked: manual intervention stuff like: pressing record to actually record panning / tilting around night vision connectivity firmware updates either via sd card or via wifi sd card slot In case it was a defective unit, I may update this with my experience on a replacement unit to confirm the issues. The Wyze forums show these issues existed as far back as last year up to present day. I'm skeptical the replacement will be better but taking a chance due to the price & awesomeness if it would actually work right out of the box. This product is not frustration-free.","The automated features, especially motion tracking, do not work!"

Great feature-packed security cameras that are inexpensive. After receiving the Pan, however, things changed. Setup was just as easy as the v2, and the only extra setup step (at least that I recommend) is setting your waypoints, so the camera knows where to track. I didn't, and its default position was facing the wall. The camera quality appears to have a slight improvement over the v2, and the audio isn't muffled, you can make out a whole lot more than before. With any Wyze Cam, I highly advise purchasing a MicroSD card for internal recording. This allows for constant recording with smart events and motion being stored in the cloud for a limited time. Still great in the event a camera gets destroyed or breaks. Wyze has stepped it up with the Wyze Cam Pan, and they have now a phenominal product with a great platform to access it from.",Big improvement over Wyze Cam v2

And you can't beat the price. The picture quality is excellent.  I also have an Arlo Cam Q, and the picture quality is inferior on the Arlo.  My only complaint is the app is a bit confusing to operate, as the different options for the camera are not clearly explained. I also love that you can put your own micro SD card in it, and do continuous or motion/sound activated recording locally.  Very few cameras have that, as they want you to pay for their cloud service.","Good Price, Great Camera"

Installed it and had it running.  The cam then recommended to install a firm ware upgrade.  The new firm ware fried the cam.  When to the forum and there were many people having the same issue.  The instructions to correct it didn't work.  Two days later, I figured out on my own how to revert to the original firm ware. Put in a support ticket and it took weeks to get an answer but by then I had already it sort of working.  Wyze has the attitude that you need to fix problems by visiting their forum.  The forum is difficult to navigate.  Customers shouldn't have to spent time fixing a brand new product. The motion tracking on this camera does not work.  It over shoots what it is tracking.  Eventually it picks a bright or dark spot and locks on it.  The whole point of this camera is the ability to pan and track motion.  It doesn't work very well at all. Due to the price point Wyze is growing very rapidly but they are putting out product that is not fully tested and they push out firm ware fixes that are not stable.

Night vision is excellent indoors (others have said it doesn't work well outdoors or through glass). The camera does not topple over even if not anchored, although to be sure, I slid some masking tape between the base and the rotating top to tape it down in case of earthquake. If you want to mount it you will need to buy a mount kit or a tripod. What I did not like about this camera is that there is no way to physically switch off the microphone or the speaker. This means you cannot use this camera in locations where you security is important... if a hacker should access your camera, they would be able to listen in. Furthermore, there have been reports of hackers breaking into all kinds of IP cameras and playing music or making noise. As my apartment has think walls, I cannot risk that someone would break into the camera and play obnoxious noises like airhorns or sirens, disturbing my neighbors. I taped up the back of the camera to try to block the speaker, but it only reduced the sound by about half. Since the speaker can be pretty loud, that is not good enough. A physical kill switch on for the mic and the speaker on the camera itself would solve that problem.",Great camera for the price. Wish it had a physical kill switch for mic and speaker on camera

However, it isn't suitable for any locations where you want to safeguard the privacy of the people who walk by it, e.g. at a medical facility, educational institution, places with minors, or anywhere that people don't want their presence tracked. After corresponding with Wyze, I can confirm that the 12-second event clips are stored in Wyze's cloud, where they CAN BE VIEWED by Wyze's staff, and also possibly subjected to face-recognition algorithms.  Even though the event clips may be deleted after 14 days, that is plenty of time for much privacy violation to occur.  There is nothing that prevents Wyze from storing face-recognition images indefinitely, and sharing them with anybody.  Anyone who has been keeping up with the news of what the Chinese government is doing in Xinjiang should recognize the possibility of abuse. It turns out that you can disable the cloud storage by turning off Notifications.  Event recordings can then be stored on the local SD card.  But then you lose the ability to receive Event notifications!  This negates much of the benefit of this camera.  This is a design flaw, and can be fixed easily, but Wyze doesn't seem to consider this a priority. The local SD card recording is also buggy.  Sometimes, I can find video clips; sometimes, they haven't been created. As consumers, we need to take a stand to have these products clearly and honestly conform to what we expect for our privacy.",Not suitable for privacy-sensitive locations or persons

My phone just said that “WYZE is actively tracking your location for several days”!!! This product line is becoming a worst privacy invader!! They can see my videos, they now track where I go. And because of the technology they used, the cameras record 24x7 even if you turn them off. When detection is on they compare images and if they detect changes it means motion so they record that clip. So Wyze is “smart enough” to know how we look like, how our place looks like and that is not enough for them, now they want to know where we go and where we are at any time!!! -my recent review-: After being a loyal customer for years I am looking elsewhere. With the latest firmware updates, since April 2020, videos freeze, motion is not recorded, detection is not triggered and then it works. And then it does not record. And then it works.

I like it because I run an aquarium store and I can keep an eye on my store when I'm off or out of town. Too many times I've returned to a busted tank and a soaked floor or a return pump that ran dry and quit working. With this camera I have a decent idea of what's going on in my store when I'm not there. I like the pan and tilt feature thats really nice and the ""zoom"" is more or less viewing the picture larger or smaller but overall it does a fair job at getting close enough to what I need to see. The audio is a bit lacking it lags really badly even at high speed internet and there's an echo or digital scrambled noise sometimes. Also it's very soft you cannot hear a conversation more than a couple feet away nor can the other party hear you. I wish it was more of a dvr type setup and I'm sure it can be configured that way even if some extra apps or something were used but I haven't played with it much. Would be a decent nanny cam or to view your aquarium when away. Note that the size of the unity is rather large and it's kind of clunky. There are nano cams in the world this isn't one of them. It isn't for you if you need the camera hidden. Also the base is a little weird the plugin for the cord is in the base which seems small compared to the top heavy unit but I haven't had it tip over or anything (yet.) Note that this runs off a common mini usb charger cord and you'll need a brick for that unless you use it on the usb drive of a computer or something. I don't really care for the power cord I think it could have been handled differently. Overall for the price it's pretty neat and I'd buy it again for my purposes.",It's a really neat camera and for the price I'm impressed. Just know what you're buying.

Unfortunately, the downstairs of my house only has windows facing the west inside the master bedroom (directly behind the living room wall). Living in the main house we only had a view from our kitchen and living room to the backyard.  The day we moved in I said I would find a way to get this problem resolved by using a WiFi cam that tied into the TV.  After arbitrarily researching over the past 1+ years, I came across this little Cam and figured, ""why not give it a go..."".  Reading some reviews, I kind of got the impression it would work with my Fire TV Stick.  But first I investigated what App came on the Fire TV Stick and I saw 3 apps available.  So I went ahead and purchased it hoping one of them might work. The day arrived, I got it - yea!!  Now on to hooking it up, which was ridiculously easy.  That is plugging it in anyway.  Of course I downloaded the Android APP and did everything needed and I was up and running in no time.  Now for the TV.  Of course none of the APPS on the FIRE TV Stick worked.  Well, that's not to say they won't but I wasn't ready to spend hours or days or weeks trying to figure out all the techno guru stuff required to make it work. After a couple of hours of researching I found someone indicate that it would work by going to and downloading the Wyze App at apkmirror.com.  After searching ""Wyze"" I found the suggested download of 2.0.26, downloaded it to my USB thumb drive, mounted the thumb drive and my wireless keyboard to the Fire TV Stick, opened ES Explorer and installed the APP.  Woohoo!  It worked - But NO IT DIDN'T!!  I mean it did work, but my picture was squeezed at the top of the screen - UGH!!!  The APP was thinking  Portrait mode, not landscape mode.  So off to do more research on how to turn the image 90 degrees.  After researching and researching, I came up with nothing.  But then I thought, ""I cannot be the first one to have this issue..."".  I went back to APKMirror.com and downloaded the latest APK 2.3.69 after reading through all the versions.  I can't recall which version fixed this but one of them I read a blurp indicating they gave it the ability to rotate the image.  So I went for it and downloaded the latest version hoping that the option flowed into the newer versions. SUCCESS!! After installing, I notice those 4 little ""crop"" marks in the upper right hand corner of my screen.  Clicked on it and WALLAH! My screen rotated and I got my landscaped Full Screen of my Window.  Now we can stair at the TV while cooking dinner and see the storms approaching from the west. Most people would have rated this between 1 and 4 stars.  However, I went into this expecting not to get what I wanted.  What I got however, was a great camera at a great cost.  I am fortunate that I had been in IT for the past 40+ years so troubleshooting isn't a stranger to me.  For those feint of heart, well - that's why you hire, Computer Techs,  CPI or other technology firms to do this for you. Oh - one last note.  For those who do not know how to work ""inside"" the operations of the Amazon Fire TV Stick, please take the time to research and understand how to use your TV stick ""outside the box"" so-to-speak... Good luck. Now on to getting more Wyze devices pointed all over the place. I found buying many of these devices on the Wyze website might turn out to be less costly.  However they do charge shipping so I need to do a bit more research for promo codes, etc...",Excellent Bang for the Buck!!

Fairly easy set up and the app is decent. OK now the not so good. 1. Only see's up to 32GB memory card. Way to small for any good amount of recording time. Should have been set for much more. Some people (on forums) are stating that they are using larger cards with no issue while others say anything over 32 doesn't work for them. 2. The Pan/Tilt is not very smooth (but this is nitpicking on a $37 camera) 3. Not for outdoor use (from Wyze) without 3rd party accessories and I'm still not sure how well it's going to handle the weather because the power port cannot be covered. 4. After 3 weeks of reading forums and testing, I cannot keep the camera from constantly resenting itself when the memory card is used. If I pull the card out it works fine. Yes I formatted the card correctly,  yes the card I used is rated correctly for the application (fast enough for video recording). Lots of people report having this same issue.

In fact, I was sharing my find with friends even before it arrived. Out of the box, I was impressed with how easy it was to set up. Just plug and play it seemed .... then I tried to actually use it.... and it’s pathetic.... for some reason it doesn’t record reliably. I have a SIM card installed but it doesn’t recognize it even though I bought them together as it was the recommended one. But I don’t even see cloud recordings a lot of the time. Some times I do and then other times - like when it matters - then there are no recordings. Seriously. Ugh! Once I finally sort of got it working and after I’m done troubleshooting it and I try to move it to a different outlet that’s only a few feet away - it stops working AGAIN... ugh...plug it back in to the original outlet and voila ... it doesn’t work there again either! And yes, like another person noted, the motion sensor doesn’t work long enough. It should keep working ‘as long as the subject is still present and as long as there is motion.’ Doesn’t help much to see the first few seconds of someone entering a room and then nothing. And when I complained that the SIM card wasn’t recognized they wanted me to troubleshoot that and make sure it wasn’t the SIM card.

It then detects what it just panned right past on the opposite end of its visual range, and overpans back right past it. What results is an endless, over-rigorous bouncing back and forth which makes the video basically impossible to watch (see my uploaded video). This is not an isolated issue; dozens of people have reported it between their forums, Reddit, and here. What’s the point in having the ability to track someone if it is done in a way which makes identification and observation nearly impossible? The only solution is to flash the firmware with an old version from around November 2018. I have reached out to technical support at Wyze, they replaced the camera, but the same issue is present in every camera because it’s a software issue. Rather than providing an update to allow for reduced or variable motion detection pan speeds to resolve this obvious bug, they instructed me to submit a feature request. Suffice to say, this company is not particularly interested in excellence and fixing severe functionality destroying bugs. This camera is perfectly fine if you don’t use the motion detection panning, but then why buy it over a static model? I’ve also noticed that the night vision brightness appears to differ between the first one I have and the replacement they sent (which is much darker).",Motion Detection Does Not Function Properly

I have another out under the deck to observe the back yard and patio entry door.  The unit is powered by an included micro USB cord and the plug-in adapter.  The cord plugs into the base and this would be the rear of the camera. The cord is about 6 ft. long.  Any micro USB cord will work.  In daylight, the picture is very good as this is 1080p.  However, if this is looking towards a window or light source, the light will really obscure part of the view.  The night time vision is not great but you can still see reasonably well.  Needs more infrared lighting to see a bit better. This has both motion and sound detection tracking and the unit can rotate in almost a full 360 deg but it doesn't spin around and around, though. When you first set it up, have the base and cord at the back with lens facing forward.  That is your front and back reference.  Once powered up, the unit will take a minute to calibrate by turning 180 deg to the right and then all the way back to the left so it scans 350 deg.  Once that happens, it automatically turns to point forward. It does a good job in motion detection and motion tracking.  The unit can scan almost a 360 deg circle but I have each one set up to scan only 180 deg.  In the software, you can change the amount of time it takes for the camera to do a full pan of the room.  I have min set to the fastest time and I found that it will track motion pretty well. At a slower speed, it can't keep up with the moving object. My wife complains that when she is working in the kitchen she can hear the motor of the unit whirring when it is tracking her and it is annoying. Therefore, I shut off the motion detection when we are home.  I have a 32 Gb micro SD card in each one and the unit will record what it picks up each time.  If you don't want to use an SD card, the unit will record to the cloud for free for a few days.  The downside is that it only records each event for 12 seconds with no option to change time +/- and, it takes several minutes for a ""cool down"" (not sure what the correct term is) before it can record another episode.  I have turned off the sound detection part of this as it seems that even the slightest sound will start it tracking, including just footsteps. I found this out when I initially went to review the past few days of recordings and there were literally hundreds of sound detection recordings with nothing happening in the video.  This level of sensitivity may be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on your needs. This has 2-way voice communication but the speaker part is really weak and not really of practical, functional use.  The software is really pretty good.  I have 3 Wyze Cams set up.  The down side is that you can only view one camera at a time on your iOS or Android phone or tablet.  There is no software provision for a computer.  Overall, for the price, the picture quality, motion tracking, free cloud storage, and the software, I would recommend this for home use. UPDATE:  I take back what I said about how well this Cam Pan tracks.  It is terrible.  When set to motion tracking and it detects motion, it will constantly hunt back and forth to track the object moving across its path.  It will lock on for a moment and then scan back about 30 degrees, then forward to track, then back again.  Very hard to get a clear visual of the object when it jerks back and forth so much.  Many owners have complained about this issue on the forums for at least a year now and Wyze has yet to address this.  I am downgrading my review to 3 stars because when stationary, it takes pretty good video clips, even at night for up to around 15 feet distance.  IMO, right now, the only benefit of the Pan over the regular camera is that you can still manually pan the camera with the software program and set it to look in a different direction rather than having to physically go to the camera to change the view.  Save your money and buy just the Wyze Cam.",Good value - not anymore

I tried other cameras but this one had sound alerts which I thought would be perfect for seeing if my dogs are barking and hopefully talk to them to get them to stop. It works from the ""letting me manually spy on them"" but the alert system needs tweaks. The Good: - Setup was super easy - Panning works really well although the motor is pretty loud - Picture quality is nice and crisp - 2 way audio works (not very loud speaker however) The Bad: - The microphone is so sensitive it makes the ""alert"" system pretty useless. It goes off when the dogs walk around and when they drink water. Tried tape over the microphone and still picks up everything. - Call support is lacking. They have a number but after 30 minutes and no estimated wait time I gave up - Email support is laughable. I got a response to my ticket saying their US based support takes 5 - 7 days to respond. For the price it is a good product, it could be a great product if they can get that microphone to be less sensitive or answer their emails in a normal amount of time. Who knows in a week when I hear back from them they may have a solution to the microphone!","Works well for motion, not for sound alerts"

Sorry to say you get a lot for the price they are still just TOYS. I could never set these to watch anything important to me. Original Review: Just purchased 3 of these (Pan Cams and 1 Wyze Non Pan cam) and while they seem to work great (picture wise and Panning) BUT they keep getting dropped from Alexa. When I call them trough Alexa some work fine and others say the camera is not responding. A few hours a different camera may lose contact and the bad one is now working With Alexa. I have the Wyze add on or ""skill"" for Alexa. The cameras work better with the Wyze phone APP but still have one that will not connect then later it does. Small house new Router High speed Internet all work fine. When the camera finally does decide to show on Echo Show or Echo Dot it only stay on for about 10 - 15 min and drops out never to return. I think this is a Wyze issue and not Amazon. I use them on 360p resolution to reduce lag. Not happy with the quirkiness but the cost was fine.","I'm disappointed, they keep getting disabled from Alexa and won't show longer than 10min."

Installed last August 2019. We live at another location several miles away and the cameras watch the 4 entries into the house. Camera 1 watches the basement entry and the pellet stove. Camera 2 watches the main entry Camera 3 watches the side door and deck door Because we have lousy internet where we're staying I had to set all 3 to 360P. This allows a more reliable connection. Both places use Wifi however communication is also good through phone data with 3 bars. The cameras need Wifi at their location. So far we have picked up noise from things falling especially one windy night when stuff hit the deck. I can pan a camera to check the inside thermometer and can pan to see the deck and check outside conditions especially rain and snow. We tested regular motion, person detection and voice and all work great. The voice is a little tinny but when I whispered ""geeet ouuuut"" to an unsuspecting person the result would have made funniest home videos if I would have recorded. The latest is that you can store events such as a break in on the Wyze server that will allow video evidence to be had if the camera is stolen or destroyed for a very reasonable small fee. These are the best you can buy for under $40 and I highly recommend",Best camera for security at affordable price

However, bought a new iPhone 11 Pro and it works fine and sees all 7 pan cams and 6 plugs while I’m on same network at home but doesn’t pull up the cams when on LTE or another WiFi. It might pull up one or two cams but not the others on LTE. Then later might pull up one other cam but not the earlier one. Contacted Wyze and they sent me a link to a useless site on how to connect. I emailed them several times and no response. I paid over $300 for cameras and someone needs to fix this problem!!!! Useless cams/app unless I’m at home where I really don’t need them. Went to daughters house and checked how it connects while on her WiFi and got the same results. Interestingly enough at night I am able to pull up all cameras immediately whether on WiFi or LTE around midnight. However, soon as daylight comes I’m getting same problems. Contacted Apple and Verizon who both suspect it’s a app issue. App was updated about same time I received the new phones. Update. I got my old iPhone se which still has all my apps intact. Connected to my daughters WiFi and tried to pull up my cameras. It’s having same issues whereas weeks ago pulled up the cameras almost instantly.

I read the reviews, I watched the videos, I was even referred to this by my best friend, but is still feel like I got scammed? Sure, it's a cheap camera! Got what I paid for, I guess? This just feels like a Chinese Amazon toy. Pros: Clear video: Even when streaming in HD still get a pretty decent video. Streaming away from home is still pretty decent. Night vision is good too; however, auto mode in low light could give you a seizure. Pan. Definitely a plus. Don't use with motion tracking if you've got a fan! Cons: Panned Predictive Motion Tracking: Simply put NO! The Wyze Pan Cam acts like it's doing the dance move ""The Twist"". It over shoots the Target by feet even when it's only 15 feet away. Even worse the further out. Slowed the motors down in the app with very little help to stability. Pray you don't use this with a ceiling fan in the room. Even with the detection zone setup, as soon as something moves into the ""fan zone"" you're done... It's like an ADD child. And you can't use Detection zones in Pan mode! Noisy: Motors are LOUD! You definitely know this thing is in the room. One could almost use this as an alarm system. When capturing video, the motors are extremely distracting. 2 way Comms: Even at home, the lag to the speakers could be measured in seconds. Away from home... NO! Even with a gigabyte network, the audio is unrecognizable from the built in Wyze Cam speakers. Alexa: unless you have an Amazon Fire device or Echo Show, Alexa is useless. Lack of API or Web interface: I've been in the forums and the only answer I could get was, ""We don't have one"". Bulky: Didn't realize how big this thing is. Undecided: Noise detection: It works... Don't use if you've got dogs in a kennel. It's not directional. It just starts recording where ever it's currently pointed. (Turned it off). Conclusion: I guess I got caught up in the hype. Watched so many reviews and felt really confident on the purchase that real life left me disappointed. Before I actually took this for a ""spin"", I referred it to a fortune 500 Executive. Not my greatest achievement... I said it once, I'll say it again, I got what I paid for. A one night stand, and herpes.",Don't believe the hype

But at least you can get an idea :) We had a diff. cam & it just stopped working, it had most of the features this cam does but the night vision def. sucked on the other cam we had, & it didn't rotate or do motion detection. But anyway, this cam is really nice, I love that it has 2 way audio (because when I'm watching my fur babies on it & if one of them gets into something they shouldn't I can yell at them). The pic and video quality is great, & I love how it automatically adjusts for the lighting, & the night vision you can actually see but its kinda creepy also lol. The ONLY thing I would say kinda stinks (but its NOT the end of the world) is the sound quality. For example when I'm listening in on my dogs we have a radio going & the sound quality goes in and out and I can't even hear the music. Same as when you talk into it its clear, but it does go in an out so that's kinda disappointing (& I know for the price of this cam its not that big of a deal but you would think it would be a little better). Other than that, my fiance & I love this cam & I would def. recommend to a friend (because my coworker has the same one & she recommended to me). Oh, and its really handy that you can turn the cam off and on using the phone app, & you can rotate the cam w/the phone app using the button/wheel thing or you can do it w/your hand and just drag up or down, left or right on your phone screen. You can also add people so they can have access to the cam if you wanted. We don't turn the motion detection or pan scan on because we just have it in the one room and the dogs stay in view most of the time. And I just found it annoying when its scanning because its constantly moving & scanning & it makes a little noise & we don't really need the whole room to be scanned. I don't really know what the face recognition does, so I can't say anything about that. But for the price of the cam & all the features it has and all it can do, its def. worth paying for!",LOVE THIS CAM!!

Needless to say, RIP Nest Cam. I needed a new one to keep an eye on my furry friends (dog + kitten), so I was going to replace it. As a grad student with essentially no money, paying almost $200 for a new Nest cam was not ideal. I decided to take a chance on this camera, and I'm definitely NOT disappointed with my decision. So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? Details below. Pros: -Wyze cam swivels around. You can move it! It's a slightly narrower field of view than the Nest cam in a stable position, but because this one moves in all 4 directions, you can see pretty much anything. Greater field of view than Nest, for sure. -You can throw in your own memory card! This is dope and means you don't have to pay for a monthly membership to record like you do with nest. -COST! SO MUCH CHEAPER!! -Has a special function to detect the sounds of fire and CO alarms, then notify you. -Can easily take photos and video recordings from the camera using your phone app. On Nest, you're stuck with screenshots. Same as Nest: -Can speak and listen through the camera. -Similar image quality, but Wyze may actually be slightly better. Honestly, neither one is amazing. It does the job but certainly isn't fancy high quality. -Night vision, similar quality to Nest. Cons: -Activating the home/away feature for motion detection is harder on Wyze. It's a simple click on the Nest app, but you need to go through the menus to get to it with this Wyze cam. Not a huge deal, but worth noting. -Unlike Nest, Wyze doesn't have other products to use a massive home control app. With Nest, you can use thermostats, tons of different cameras, security devices, safety alarms like fire, etc. With Wyze, it's just the cameras.",Thinking about Nest? You should definitely consider getting this instead. SAVE MONEY!

There are so many options today from super cheap to super expensive, and I was almost going to bite the bullet and get the Nest indoor cams (I already use their smoke detectors and I'm a Google Android user so figured keeping it 'in the family' would be best) but then found these and figured why not since the reviews were very good. SO HAPPY I DID! The camera itself is very well designed and super minimal which I love. The size is ideal, not too big/not too small, and the spin feature is awesome! I've placed one on top of my coffee grinder in my kitchen and the other on a bookshelf that looks down my hallway to my main door. Setup was super easy since it's literally just the camera, AC plug, and Micro-USB cable. It doesn't come with a MicroSD card, so I bought two 128GB cards for both cameras thinking that would be enough space. From the time I unboxed to downloading the app and setting up my account both cameras were working in under 10-15 minutes! I did hit a sang when updating the firmware, the app gave me the option to update mulitple devices at the same time but that didn't work, but worked perfectly when I did one at a time. The app interface is super easy to use and works great on my Samsung Galaxy s10 phone. Again simple/not cluttered design making it super easy and intuitive to do and get to exactly what you want. I love that I can easily schedule when in the day they need to be on, such as the hours I'm not there and at work, and that they turn off around the time before I return home. Accessing and using remotely via cell, not Wifi, also works great. Tested this morning while walking to a nearby breakfast spot and leaving Espen (my baby girl) out so I could see what she does when I'm gone. Both cameras pulled up in seconds and I was immediately able to see Espen sitting by my front door waiting for me to return, then walking around a bit. These cameras literally provide everything I wanted in an indoor security camera. Great video quality, easy to use, can access anytime from my mobile, and do much more all for ridiculously less than 'major brands' who are charging almost x5's the amount per unit. The only negative thing, and it's not really a negative as I haven't spent time to figure it out, is how the storage of video footage works or how to quickly see how much space remains on the 128GB MicroSD cards I added to both cameras. If you're in the market for indoor security cameras and don't want to spend a fortune on equipment and hosting services I can't recommend Wyze enough.",Literally THE BEST!

Looking back I could have come up with something with a raspberry pi that would meet my needs (im an engineer, but i was very busy at the time). These are the problems with this camera: 1- No desktop app 2- video/audio sync problems 3- video recording is patchy and sometimes chunks of video are missing 4- it takes a bit of time to see the stream and sometimes the app has to attempt a few times before it gets the stream 5- the app is fairly limited in my opinion. I like to have the option to stream all the cameras in the same window rather than having to click them one by one. I know you can do this if you create a group but what if the cameras are not in a group? 6- the alerts are pretty unreliable. Often it misses my cat jumping but catches the changing of light coming through my window or something that is noise. A computer science student with a few internship could implement a better motion detection algorithm than these guys. 7- the sharing option is poorly done.

I raved how great this camera was being inexpensive and working well. After two weeks, the camera fell and split apart and broke off the mini USB in the port on the camera. While I tweeted Wyze directly, I was advised to email support and a week later no response and one and the few cameras I purchased is down. When the camera pans instead of the eye of the camera panning, the entire camera pans so the camera is constantly moving when it pans. The camera wiggles itself enough to fall off of a 5” flat stand. The camera was located inside the home to detect who comes in the front yard and around the vehicles. Needless to say, I was out of town and couldn’t understand why my camera was offline until I returned home. If you decide to purchase this, then buy the warranty as customer support won’t respond back. For such an inexpensive camera, I wasn’t expecting it to need to be replaced two weeks later.

I bought the camera AND the SD card. I think the software needs work. It would tell me there was no SD card when there was, One time the image was upside down even though the ""invert image 180 degrees"" was set to ""OFF"" and NEVER turned to ""ON"". I had to turn it on and off a few times to make the picture the right way. At first, I could not get the SD card to stay in. Of course, there were no manuals nor diagrams that I could find to look at so I used online chat. The Wyze guy shocked me by telling me to use a key or a pen to shove the card in but, nevertheless, I did. There was no ""click"" nor was there a bell sound that the agent said I would hear. Nevertheless, it was in and I was able to record to it. So now I decide to format. Each time I tried, I got ""format failed"". So I removed the card and put it back in using my pencil like the Wyze agent told me to. This time, whenever I tried to record it said ""no SD card"". I wanted to remove the card and put it back in but when I tried to remove the card it would not come out! At that point I got totally disgusted.

Simple setup (ANYONE can do it!) and the cameras are working right out of the box. Picture resolution is astounding and rivals still cameras. I bought the mounts to go with these cameras and I have actually mounted them outside, under the eaves and well-protected from any weather. I covered the openings on the back of the cameras with clear packing tape to keep any small bugs or moisture out, and they work GREAT, since they're well protected. Even if one is damaged somehow, the replacement cost is low. Excellent value! Quality is great and I totally admire the dedication of the new company that's making these cameras. The only thing to deal with is their sensitivity, which simply takes time on your part. They pick up motion very, very well - like shadows from clouds moving, a flapping flag in the distance, etc. You can set the detection area and that helps somewhat. Notification of camera activation on your cell phone works well also, although I turn that off at night, as the cameras record moths, bees, bugs, spiders, whatever, moving around at night!

I am so happy with this purchase. I was planning to buy the DLink 720p so that I could monitor smoke detector/CO detector/intruder alarms while away from home. I wanted wireless, battery operation. After reading reviews on this site, I was skeptical and began looking for an alternative. I stumbled on the Wyze Pan - an inexpensive, well featured camera, and bought 2. I figured that if it didn’t work I’d return it. Not gonna happen though. Setup was super easy. I placed it in my living room and then figured out the panning and noise monitoring features. I talked to my cat thru it while I was at work and it freaked him out so bad he ran out of the room. I have 3 active cats. So far it hasn’t been bothered. The night vision is fantastic. The smoke detector sensor works as promised. I burnt a pizza and when the alarms went off, the camera immediately sent me a text about it. Negatives: - It’s corded for power but connects to WiFi wirelessly. I’d prefer battery but it’s ok for $35. - The noise alert settings are not customizable. I set a start and end time that works well Monday-Friday, but it notifies me of noise when I’m home during those times on weekends. I’d prefer a weekend setting option. - One is black and white.

She's not there right now but all of her belongings are. In early July, while I was on vacation over 1000 miles from Mom's home, I got a notification from the Wyze cam that it had detected sound and motion. I checked the video from the camera with my phone and saw a burglar in the house. I was able to call the Sheriff in that area and report a burglary in progress. Deputies arrived quickly and using copies of the video that I emailed and texted to the deputies on scene, 2 suspects were caught and identified immediately. All property was recovered. The Wyze Cam Pan did exactly what it was purchased to do and I am extremely happy with the product. I now have one in my home and had to buy another for Mom because the burglars realized what it was and stole it, so now it's locked up as evidence against them. What they didn't realize was that it was too late. The video showing them was sent to the cloud immediately after they were detected in the home. Five stars for Wyze Cam Pan!!!",Awesome Security Camera and it's very inexpensive too!

I noticed occasionally there is an alert that was recording during the time I was live viewing. Those recordings have sound during playback but live viewing has no sound. 2 way audio still doesn't work though. The really terrible software junks this camera. *Update* If you're having issues connecting to your Wifi, open your router settings. Go into where you would edit your password and wifi name. If you see a space AFTER the username or password, DELETE IT. Not ignoring a space after your login info seems to be a flaw unique to the Wyze Cam. Unfortunately, even AFTER connecting, we realized the two way audio is completely unusable. I bought this for my daughter's homebased classroom. She attends Highschool online and we needed a cam so we could communicate if she needed help and I could still do check-ins and see what she's working on while away. If you had high hopes for the 2 way audio, motion tracking or the smoke/co2 alarm detection, look elsewhere. It doesn't function as described. The first thing the app does is run updates after the initial connection. So its unlikely that all the bad reviews are discrepancies in software. Its just poorly made. ===Old Review=== This is the ONLY device I've bought that will not connect to my router. My ring and older FujiKam had no problems.",Audio doesnt work. Bad software.

Would be better if it continues to record as long as motion is detected for cloud upload. -Does not reset position if no motion is detected. My cam is mounted behind a window. It regularly tracks motion until it faces “nothing” (wall or blinds) then stays there for hours at a time. I have to manually change the position using the app. Very annoying. Wyze need to add an option to reset the position if no motion is detected after a configurable amount of time. -Sound quality is not the best. It sounds muffled. Ugly: -Current issue with microSD formatting. Formatting your card in the camera will corrupt it. Wyze acknoledged this is a known issue.  They recommend to use a PC to format the card to FAT32 but that solution did not work for me. I had to use my Roav Dash cam to format the SD card for the Wyze Pan. -5 minute cool down sucks. Cool down time should be configurable. Lowers the usablity of the camera. You have to rely on falling back on reviewing footage from microSD (If the card is not corrupted). -Camera stops detecting and recording motion. The user will have to reboot the camera to function normally again. -Certain settings are reset to default sometimes. An obvious bug with the firmware/software Wyze has to fix with the other defects.,Has potential - Works as deterrent

We have 3 outdoor and 4 indoor nest cams.  We also pay for the annual subscription to all.  As you can you can imagine a lot of expense has gone into the security.  Greater than 1k and climbing every year. My daughter in New York who has fios purchased 1.  $36 and that is it.  She has shared the viewing with me.  Works like a charm. I had to set up my own wyze account.  The camera faces her chinchilla which is a nocturnal creature.  The night vision is incredible.  I can zoom in without it disrupting her view mode.  I can pan and tilt remotely.  I like it so much I bought us one.  At $35 compared to what I have put into nest, it could be disposable. My first camera came in.  Our router is dual 5/2.4.  All items are connected to 5 and the router distributes accordingly.  Nest can use 5.  Wyze is 2.4.  We had to connect to 2.4 manually.  Inputting the network name had to be precise  to include case sensitive.  We were accustomed to using our phones to scan Q codes.  A blonde moment  - the cam scans the Q code.  That took us an extra 5 minutes for set up.  All in all it took at the most 10 minutes to set up. Our internet gets 100 down and if we're lucky 5 up.  So far it was  able to handle the load of all nest, 3 echo shows and one wyze.  So I decided to push it to the limit and bought 2 more wyze. After going the first set up, the 2nd took less than 3 minutes.  However it did put a strain on our upload speed.  I decided not to hook up the 3rd until I test all of their functionality. I set up tinycam pro on my firesticks, show and fire 10 tablet.  (Pro was free) I am in awe. the set up was very easy.  Just remember you MUST assign different channels for each camera in the advanced area of the program to get them to work.  Amazon sells a 24 inch insignia fireTV for $99.  I purchased that for viewing in tile mode. You can put in a SD card which loops.  No need to delete old video.  No need for nest subscription.  That is a $450 a year savings.  RV camping  - no need for internet for security.  All can be recorded to the SD card for viewing later, but you do need electricity. Nest offers one feature that really outshines wyze and that is zoned for motion detection.  Wyze is all or nothing,  nest I can create zones for motion and notification.  Nest also has color coding for these zones.  Nest does not have pan/tilt, wyze does.  Nest has outdoor cameras,  wyze does not.  There are 3rd party vendors who have protective covers.  Nest viewing area is almost twice the size of wyze.  Nest cameras $149 - $199,  wyze $25 - $35.  Nest 10 day subscription annual cost $100 for 1st camera $50 for each additional camera,  wyze $0 with a 14 day a few seconds motion detection alerts.  A memory card for continuous recording.  Wyze & Alexa,  Nest & Google. For me, I'm going to keep both nest and wyze.  I'll take down 2 nest and put up 2 wyze.",Nest vs Wyze - Amazing what you get at this price
"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Zachare S.,"Quick: Following the WyzeCam v2, this movable WyzeCam Pan seems like a giant step backwards. Pros: + Its got a nice 1080p 30fps(ish) camera with a 110 Lens + It moves + The system recognizes the difference between a person and a squirrel, so you're not getting notified when say, a spider crawls across the lens. + This one actually has a mount screwhole, unlike the WyzeCam v2. Cons: - You'll end up throwing away everything else in the box besides the charger (you'll need a longer cord) - You'll also want to buy a 128gb SD Card (per cam) for continuous record. If you don't pony up for an SD Card, you'll miss anything that happens. The 12s record function does not work under any situation. - Sometimes the cameras just don't sync to the servers. They still record continuously, but you'll need to reboot them manually. It doesn't usually happen often, and you usually can access the camera by still tapping on it (for some reason), but the system doesn't notify you of issues, and those 12s clips don't get recorded. - The motor control lags out when you're moving it. - When you have it set for Following motion detection, the camera keeps on moving back and forth very rapidly, because it doesn't give itself a moment to reset motion detection after moving. - The Wyze Sense Bridge can't be plugged into this, even despite it having a slot for the bridge. I saw this camera on sale during the Christmas sales, and went for it. I bought two, one for my garage, one for my main room. Both areas of which can't be covered completely by one single stationary camera. However, I found that the WyzeCam Pan has some serious issues, all of which could be addressed by a future patch. I'm not going to go over the WyzeCam issues in general, I covered that in my other review, but a short summary is: You'll need to buy a cable because the one in the box is super short, the 12s record functionality isn't enough [option A: Buy the $2/mo/cam service, option B: Get a 128gb SD Card to record everything], and the app has some flaws that need to be addressed. As for the Pan, the fact you can turn it is nice, except for the fact that when you just tap the ""turn"" button for even a split second, it can send it to the absolute opposite side of the spectrum on that axis. It makes calibrating its normal position incredibly difficult. There is a setting for Rotate Speed in the app, but it is does absolutely nothing. If you set to ""Follow"" the motion, it will shake back and forth, and if the entire room lights up (because a light turned on), it will get confused and almost rotate 180 degrees in random directions, missing everything. The WyzeCam Pan also can't deal with Fans. It gets mezmerized by them and never wants to let go. It has a ""Pan Mode"", but its a mode where it goes between 2-4 points that you create for 10 seconds at a time. So, rather than allowing you to, I don't know, create a slow scan from one side of the room to the other, it has this rigid, hard-to-configure pan mode which makes you never use the mode ever. What's worse is that it treats the panning as motion itself, so if you have it elected to record on motion plus pan scan, get prepared for constant events. Lastly, there's the Sense bridge. I bought two WyzeCam Pans. Both suck at maintaining connectivity with the Bridge. It has a slot for the bridge, but it definitely does not work with the bridge. If you end up getting the Sense package, make sure you buy a stationary WyzeCam to house the bridge. I think this Camera can be great, it just needs some serious patches in order to fix itself. Perhaps future firmware updates and app updates?",It moves...too fast.

Setup was very straightforward. The camera was working within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box. I find the video quality to be very good without any zoom but not go great zooming. But that's probably true of most cameras. Note that I have been using it exclusively to view through a window, so some reduction in picture quality is expected. The camera does an excellent job of detecting motion, and I like the beta version of person detection, which I think works pretty well. The video playback is also very reliable. The one flaw and complaint I have about this camera is that it only comes in white. I point the camera through a window, and the problem with a white camera is that it always shows a reflection in the window. I solved this problem by taking a permanent marker and changing the color to black, which solved the problem.",Good inexpensive pan camera with only one flaw

But I need something that works, not something that looks nice. This is by far the worst camera ever. We bought two - one for our sons nursery and another for our other kids room. The quality of the video is horrible, it’s blurry. The camera is constantly dropping off internet connection. I’m having to reconnect both camera’s multiple times through out the day. I know it’s not our internet because my husband works from home and has zero issues with our internet all day long. We have ring camera’s outside of our home and they work just fine. But I can not get these cameras to stay connected. I am constantly being kicked out of the app as well, it will freeze and then shoot me back to my home page. And when the camera does finally work it is so far behind I can walk across my whole house before it even shows I left the room. I do NOT recommend buying this camera.

The Wyze cameras are my favorite, and the software to set up monitoring / controlling them keeps getting better by adding needed functionality (like a global monitoring off / on key).  The only clearly superior software is in my high end wired  POE camera system with a central NVR - but the pictures are not better with these cameras (but the POE cameras are weather proof). Third parties are also coming out with some great (and some not so great) mounts and accessories for the Wyze cameras.  The non-panning Wyze camera can be mounted to it's plug in power supply and effectively be attached to an outlet (you can home brew this or buy a third party mount).  This pan and scan camera is also easily mounted in various ways (but too big to attach to its plug in power supply).  They can be used outside in a protected environment (under an awning) - but they are not water proof, and the third party cases I have found to date are not up to the quality of a real all weather camera. You might be able to save some money by purchasing multiple cameras directly from Wyze, and can also save money by purchasing 3rd party memory cards from Amazon such as the 32GB Samsung (versus the Wyze brand). I am really impressed by Wyze, their commitment to design, simplicity and value.  The cameras are a great value and I recommend them to anyone who asks me about a camera solution in their home, be it for indoor security, baby monitoring, pet monitoring, kid monitoring, and alike.  I have a conditional recommendation for use outdoors - and the few Wyze cameras I have place outdoors are well protected and I still would not be surprised if they fail eventually from exposure to the elements. P.s. - I did get one malfunctioning camera from Wyze - it was clearly banged up in shipping, and they sent a replacement.",One of the best deals in home cameras

I own 3 (monitoring basement, garage, and living room) and have ordered 2 more.  Certainly not the same as a Ring (I have the Ring Spot, Floodlight (x 2), Doorbell and yes, a doorbell in the mail box so I can tell when the mail is there), but the Ring doesn't have Pan or Tilt. Pan / Tilt works well, perhaps a little slow to respond ( 1- 2 secs) so it is a little jerky, but remember it isnt' a $200 camera either. Zoom is probably no different than the Ring.  It is a digital zoom, so depending upon how far you are away, the zoom quality is not necessarily clear.  But then, that is no different than the $200 Ring digital zoom. I ordered the 32 GB ScanDisk Micro SD card, so I have done both continuous and event only recording.  Continuing works good and allows you to go back in time to look at the continuous recording.  Albiet, again, not perfect somewhat clunky, but it works.  Event recording works good too and so I have opted to just do event recording rather than continuous. Easy to setup and takes no technical expertise to connect to the network. Downside is that there is no web app and the vendor has said they are not interested in developing one.  So you can only monitor the cameras off your phone or rather off any Android device.  I tried using the app on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 but the app is not configured for a tablet but it will work. I  wish like the Ring, it had a light, even a small 500 lumen would be perfect.  Although the image is clear and sharp in the darkness, would be nice just to turn a light on to see additional details.  I've compensated for this by installing WEMO light switches so I can turn on the lights if I need to. Of course the Ring has a siren, the Wyze does not. The speaker that Wzye has is probably not a whole lot better than what you'd find on the Ring but you can talk and listen.  However, if the individual is not within I'd say 8 feet of the Wyze camera, you won't hear them and they won't hear you.  But then, that is no different than what I have experienced with the Ring. In summary, but $37.98 + $9 for the SD card, a lot cheaper than Ring, Nest or others.  I will use Ring for the outside, but for the inside, I'm ok with this camera.  You can't beat the price for the functionality that you get.",Review of the Wyze camera (own 5) compared to Ring (own 5)

My wife and I are the only users with the app and neither or us had the app running.  The camera was following us backing & forth accross the room,  stopped and started again.

Also, it seems that the Panning function is ALWAYS on;  I might like to use it in the future, but not at present, it's unneeded & unwanted.  Stop moving!...: Strike Two.  & lastly the controls are just wonky & needs a reorganization - one iPod-style rotary dial for panning & tilting, both??  Strike Three.  It's feature-packed, just not with the features I need & simple control modifications that seem like 'no brainers' (& plenty of folks have commented & complained about them before me) - hopefully a firmware & app update can solve most or all.

The price seemed to make it one of the best values. But things aren't really as they seem, at least on my end. I noticed there was no information in the box or manual related to the free 14-day recording. So I went on their website where I encountered how to sign up for their PAID services. The ONLY option is to sign up and pay for the $1.99 a month or the annual subscription. The product page says this is a free service with ""no subscription plan or monthly fees required."" Now, on their website, you definitely have to do EXACTLY that. So that clearly irritated me. I bought this camera exactly because I did NOT want to have to pay a monthly subscription. Thats cool though, I thought. I will just set it up to record locally on my network-attached storage server at home. Yeah... thats not even a potential option. There is no way to record locally on my server. There was absolutely no information available on their website about this, nor is their information on the app. I tried the general/standard ports based on the camera IP. Nothing worked. So basically, I have a live camera. I could do this with my eyeballs. I needed a camera that has a recording function. Otherwise, its literally useless. So I feel like I'm being held hostage to pay for their subscription service or not use the camera. I left the best for last. There is a function on the camera for motion tracking. It is supposed to follow movement, paring with the object being tracked. Afterwards, it is supposed to return to the original position from where it started tracking. Sounds perfect. As expected, it was FULL of false positives, following every single car that drives in front of my drive way -- day or night. Thats fine though. Except... the camera doesn't go back to where you left it. Every time I check the camera, it is pointed in a different direction. Not ok AT ALL! This camera has an extremely wide range of motion, which is why I decided to purchase it. I just checked it 10 minutes before writing this review, and it was pointed up towards the roof of my house - not down the driveway like it is supposed to. An issue related to this but not exactly the same is related to the location of the camera whenever it turns on or restarts. It returns to the same location every time, which is the ""start point"" if you will. It would be great if that was somewhere helpful. Its not. It is located the opposite side of the camera lens. If you want the camera facing away from the wall, you need to have the USB right behind it. Thats a problem because is it an extremely tight fit with a wall mount. Furthermore, because of the wide range of motion in the pan function, it will pull the usb cable around and over the wall mount. When it needs to return, it can get stick on the usb cable, which will either prevent the camera from moving or unplug the camera every once in a while. A security camera needs to have an incredibly high level of reliability. Unplugging even once or pointing the wrong direction a single time is unacceptable. So if you don't want this to happen, you need to point the camera's default restart position towards the wall so the usb cable never crosses the wall mount and has full range of motion on the front side of the camera when panning. So a power outage, any updates, or anything that would resulting the camera turning off or restarting will result in the camera pointing directly at the wall. Guess what it doesn't do - go back to the location you intentionally angled the camera. And honestly, even if this function was available, my experience suggests it could end up almost anywhere - roof, grass, front door, across the street, wall, or wherever. Just dot even waste your time and energy on dealing with this product. Just keep looking for similar products. Almost any will be better.","NO FREE RECORDING. Horrible reliability. Honestly, just a horrible product with false advertising."

I set it up, installed the app, and thought about buying another 5-6 for the rest of the home based on the first day's performance.  Glad I waited until the first time I tried to use it while out of town (the primary reason for having it).  ""Please try to power cycle the camera"" it tells me - which I can't do when I'm not there.  I tried to self-serve on support, and read that some folks found moving this closer to their router addressed the issue.  Not ideal by any stretch (and certainly limited the applicability for me), but I gave that a shot.  Again, upon initial relocation, worked like a champ!  Next day I checked on the app - same error. This is the major flaw for me, and is insurmountable.  I have other wireless cameras (like Arlo) that have lower resolution and less functionality (and are more expensive), but they work - reliably.  From the best I can tell, this issue crops up if the camera loses internet connectivity - which happens from time to time.  And that makes this nothing more than a novelty camera at this point. Other issues I've had (such as it not accepting an SD card that I've used in other cameras, formatted prior to inserting, etc) are irritants, but non-issues when the camera can't be reliable.  I'm glad it seems to be working for many folks, but I would beware and test scenarios like your internet dropping before leaving town and relying on it to be yours eyes & ears.",Unfortunately unreliable

Pros: Anywhere anytime you can view and you get nothing even if a leaf moves. You can control the sensitivity of your camera. Love that you can talk to someone without opening your door and best of an you see them before they see you. Lol. You can record from your phone or tablet and take photos of what you see. Cons: I wish it did automatic photo capture like every 5 seconds after registering a movement. But you can't beat the features for this price camera.. I love that it goes back to the present location/view after detecting movement.. Ok my biggest Con with this is the ability to have like a split screen view for all cameras at the same time. I want to be able to have all four displayed on my tablet at the same time.. Hopefully that's too be considered in future software development. But get it your love it all.

Two not so great things- the motion detection is based on pixel change and as such will trigger for absolutely any apparent movement from car headlights driving buy to the shadows of trees blowing in the breeze. There are sensitivity settings in the wyze app but they don't seem to work well at all. I will definitely be buying the Wyze motion detectors for each camera soon. The second issue is the software itself. It's functional but not necessarily intuitive and it's a somewhat annoying process to delete groups of captures. On my Note 10+ oftentimes the feed will not display across the entire space in both portrait and full landscape view. Sometimes a force quit will resolve the issue and sometimes it resolves on its own. Are any of the issues mentioned enough to not recommend these cams? Absolutely not! Wyze seems to be a fantastic company that is customer focused and striving to deliver very high quality hardware at incredible prices.,Absolutely Great!

After install (finally ) I tried to move the camera around and it kept getting stuck and wouldn’t move back . I spend 2 hours talking to support (May was the representative) they were extremely helpful but the message app was not . Every time I had to go change a setting or leave the chat it would close out the chat which was so frustrating because I had to start another chat hoping to get the same rep. We ended up tweaking the setting but it was only temporary and would go back to not moving after a few uses . I would rate this a 2 , because the quality of camera was there but with the glitches and Product taking over an hour to connect to my WiFi its just not worth it .

"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jul 2020,all320,"I bought three of these cameras a year ago and they've been plagued with issue after issue since getting them. First it was certain settings randomly resetting themselves. I set the night vision to auto and it would randomly reset to off. I'd only find out after I tried to view recorded footage, only to see nothing but black, because the night vision had turned off again. Then it was the resetting of the position I set them to. I turned off the pan feature, because I could set it to view the area I want recorded without needing it to pan. Randomly the cameras would start spinning around and go back to their default position. I can't tell you how many times they did this in the overnight hours and I went back to view footage, only to find I recorded nothing but a wall, because it had changed position while we slept. I finally contacted Wyze support and was told that they believed the cameras were defective, all of them. They said they'd NEVER heard of their cameras doing any of the things I was describing. To their credit they replaced the cameras. Too bad the new ones did the EXACT same thing. Finally one day I caught one the buggers spinning and it gave me a clue as to the issue. I thought the cameras were dropping their internet connections and that's why they were going back to their default position. Less than 30 seconds of Googling confirmed I was right. Another 30 seconds and I found that this was actually a fairly common occurrence. I don't know if Wyze was being dishonest, or honestly wasn't aware, though I have difficulty believing they didn't know. I should mention that I have two different internet connections coming into my home and I've tried both and the problem exists on both. These are also the ONLY TWO DEVICES out of MANY that have this type of issue. Our phones are on wifi at all times when we're home and have never once dropped their connection. Our laptops, tablets, AppleTVs, smart TVs, game systems and printer have NEVER ONCE dropped their connection to the internet. ONLY THE CAMERAS. I decided living with the issue was easier than trying to contact support again. We'd recently rescued a stray cat, who was FIV+, and I NEEDED to be able to check in on him and our other cat when I wasn't home. We had to make sure there was no fighting that we'd need to address to make sure our other cat wasn't infected. Then about five months ago I started finding my spice jars on the floor in the morning. I was pretty sure I knew who the culprit was, but didn't want to discipline a cat without knowing for sure. No corporal punishment here folks, only withholding treats. I changed the position of the camera and started recording, or so I thought. I woke up one morning to see the nutmeg on the floor and thought, ""Ah ha! NOW I have proof."" Except I didn't. All I had was a message that said, ""No video at the selected time."" I looked and looked and there was no video at ANY time. Further investigation showed that the camera was saying there was no SD card installed. Except there was, and it was the same one that had been in there. I checked the other cameras and one other one was like that too. We tried everything and nothing we did fixed the issue. We reformatted the card using both the Wyze app and Sandisk's formatting utility. Nothing. We tried putting the card from the still working camera in one of the non working ones to see if the card went bad somehow. Nothing. We bought NEW SD cards. Still nothing. Finally as a last ditch effort I deleted the whole camera and reinstalled. BINGO! We were up and running, for a week or so, and then ALL the cameras stopped recording. Did the same thing and it fixed it again, until it stopped, again and again and again. Over and over we fixed it only to have the same thing happen. A quick Google search again found that I'm not alone in this issue either. I can't take it anymore! I was a real fan of these cameras and recommended them to a lot of people. Now I wish I hadn't. I don't know what my next camera will be, but it won't ever be another Wyze cam of any kind. These things are buggy beyond belief. There's really no hope for them. Six cameras all with the same issue of randomly disconnecting from the internet is not a coincidence. Three cameras all continually claiming there is no SD in them is not a coincidence. What is it they say about getting what you paid for? Well in this case I didn't get what I paid for, I got A WHOLE LOT LESS.",Save your money!

They work as a basic IP camera with an OK image quality. The motion detection features are as useless as most IP cameras  - constantly fooled by a twig or dappled sunlight or wind. ""Person detection"" (offered at extra cost) is maybe 10% accurate, so not worth a penny. The PanCams have a design flaw - when you use the motion detection, they swivel around all the time with false alerts and can literally ""walk"" off a windowsill if trained outdoors. They don't deal well with falls. So beware - either turn off motion detection (doesn't work very well anyway) or screw the camera down (which is tricky, because it has about 1/8"" of thread in the base). As with most of these cameras, if you put them on a windowsill looking out, the IR night vision is useless as it just shows glare off the window. The ""Outdoor"" models work better just because of the no-glass location, but the IR is good for about five feet. And if you activate motion detection on them the battery life will be measured in days. For the most part, Wyze products work as described but they have essentially zero customer support (you end up in a mindless AI chatbot loop) so you should consider them disposable. Remember you can return stuff that doesn''t work properly directly to Amazon",Good camera. Good value. Zero support

I initially contacted Wyze and they sent me a replacement camera, but the sound was equally bad.

Really, we should have all seen it coming since the founders are offspring of corporate digital America.  They changed the functionality of the camera so it TURNS OFF all recordings and TURNS OFF all notifications for 5 full minutes after you receive a notification.  What does that mean?  Effectively, it means that your camera which once gave you around the clock notifications of movement and/or sound now secures your property a maximum of only 9 seconds every 5 minutes or 3% of the time it used to secure it for.  Not only did they take from us 97% of its usage, but it is given on a schedule of 5 minutes after the previous notification so you have zero control of when it is working. I don't care about the cloud storage because I use the sd card, but I do care about notifications which I don't get anymore.  They are no linked to event records so I can get a notification only every 5 minutes.  In other words, it is useless unless you subscribe to their new pay per camera cloud storage which gives you back what you once had for free.  It doesn't give you anytime more.  It doesn't keep the events in the cloud a year or even a month.  They save it 2 weeks, just like they did yesterday for free before they hijacked the system.  My hands aren't tied.  I already ordered a different brand and these cameras are going in the garbage.",From hero to big fat ZERO!

The Android Software is extremely buggy, very slow and constantly crashes on my low end Motorola e5 Cruise. When it works its great; but its very hit and miss. Lots of crashes before you can get a ""usable"" instance. Wyze the company has also shown really poor data security/data management. Their unprotected Elasticsearch instance leaked several pieces of customer information (Emails / WiFi SSID's / Alexa Tokens) during December 2019. Why was customer production data ported into a test environment? Their excuse was they were attempting to ""improve the product"", but why would you need anything other than anonymized customer data? Completely inexcusable in 2019, insecure Elasticsearch instances have been known since at least 2017, this was reckless. My recommendation is if you pick up one of these use as much burner information as possible. We personally only have it plugged in while we are away and NEVER while we're home.

I don't normally have much brand loyalty but I'm a Wyze convert and will be looking for this brand when buying smart home products.  Here is why: Unfortunately, I have a bit more experience trying (and failing) to install budget security cameras than I would like.  The Wyze pan cam is the 5th camera I have purchased.  There are already plenty of gushing reviews you can read so I won't bother with expressing my absolute delight and surprise to find such a great little camera with a user interface that is actually useful and with the easiest installation I've encountered for a long time.  Install the app on your smart phone and turn it on.  Everything is so easy and the instructions are in english that I can understand. Last week I spent a full day trying to install a more expensive security camera and never did get it to work or be recognized Alexa or anything else.  I bought four of these Wyze ones and had them up and running in an hour, with another hour to fine-tune the many useful settings available.  The pan and tilt feature is great and the camera can be set to follow movement and/or pan across a pre-set range, pausing longer at critical points that  you can set to suit your situation. Video can be uploaded to a free cloud server or recorded on an SD card which is not included but can be bought for $5-10.  I mounted them using the very useful and inexpensive ($20-ish) mounts also on Amazon (search for ""2 Pack 16.4FT Power Extension Charging Cable with Wall Mount for Wyze Cam Pan Camera"".  They are worth the money just for the long USB cables which you are going to need.  The mounts let you install these pretty much anywhere you damn well please.",These are a delight to install!

These are facts as far as my experience, not a raving opinion. I bought four of these cameras, having two Arlo cameras to begin with. I bought them earlier this summer and up until about two weeks ago everything worked fine, and they all detected a person. I paid for the subscription on one camera; the one in my elderly mothers house, in order to have longer than 12 second recordings. All the sudden, the other 3 cameras stop detecting humans, after they updated their software. After going back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth with their “tech“ support they finally just now told me that I don’t pay for a subscription so they’re not gonna detect humans anymore. What the H3L! is the purpose of having a security camera that can’t detect a person? Complete bait and switch. I’ve had the cameras long enough that now I can’t return them so the best I can do is warn other people: yes everything is fine and dandy, they’re easy to use, easy to install but they won’t work worth a d4mn for any applicable security purpose. Footnote: since the time that I posted this on their site and they “moderated,“ it, now NONE of my cameras detect ANYTHING; including the one that I pay for. They detect nothing. Not sound, not motion, not anything. Tell me that there is not some person in their “Tech Support,“ who is messing with the cameras because of my post or because they can’t seem to make them work. Update as of 072020: Got the 4th camera I ordered; amazon apparently has a limit of 3, which is stupid imo, so I ordered the 4th from another seller, “ Petiteadeline.” Avoid this person if you can. I haven’t even gotten to unpacking the camera yet but I almost afraid to. Packed in the cheapest, crappiest flimsy box, crushed all to heck, and taped so little that I presume the roll of tape they have must need to last the rest of their life. And that was after I finally got it. It sat for SIX DAYS before I wondered why it was taking so long to put it in the box, and I emailed them through the amazon app. No reply, but suddenly my camera finally shipped. To be clear, all the ones that came from AMAZON got here promptly and well packaged. I don’t know what was going on with this seller but I won’t order from them again. ********** Preliminary as of set up on 071320 Good stuff: loads quickly, EXTREMELY simple to set up (especially if you have the app installed, account made, and alexa skill enabled before you start), great resolution. Added 4 days after setup: the app features motion tagging, motion follow, pan scan, time lapse (requires SD card for storage) and some other handy features. The motion follow takes more getting used to than I am willing to give it currently. Our security cams have been stationary, so having something that “turns its head” to look at you feels a little too SkyNet. The impossible to believe something so high/simple tech overlooked: clunky. Why in the WORLD would you include an AC/USB adapter that sticks SO FAR out from the wall? Seriously. You couldn’t put it behind a piece of furniture if you had to. #2: WHY would you put the power input on the base, right up against the wall? The base obviously makes sense since the unit pans, but it would have been simple enough to offset the default stop/front position so the input is off to the side so you could get the unit closer to the wall. It does its pan/exorcist dance at power up so it isn’t prudent to put it any closer to an object in its current configuration. I’m pretty mind blown at the power adapter. There is nothing low profile or sleek about it. Yes, one could seek out another that doesn’t fry the unit, but the point and principle is: you should’t have to. Also, a little noisy when it movies. Not “loud,” but definitely noticeable in a quite room with all the clicks and whirring, and the sound is noticeable in the app. Overall, having been through 5 various camera manufacturers in the past few years and the latest and longest surviving being Arlo, I am pretty impressed with the compactness of the units and their simplicity, but with quite the powerhouse of resolution, night vision, and pan range. Very little lag time between event and showing on the app. As opposed to Arlo, who I still love, but with Arlo, you could leave a room, close the door, go to another room, and then watch yourself leave the room and close the door in the app several seconds later. Improvements I’d like to see: real time SMS notifications, and better low light definition. The lamp in one room seems to befuddle the camera in there, to the point that it’s bright enough to see, but the camera is constantly jumping between B/W night vision and a very grainy color/daylight mode. Also noted since set up 4 days ago: Arlo permits live monitoring of all cameras on one screen. I have 4 WYZE cameras and it’s like playing the kettle drums having to switch back and forth among them, waiting for each to load. The app on ipad is moderately annoying, as it does not flip in landscape mode. There IS landscape, but if you need to put down your tablet, the display remains upside down. Also, on the camera selection screen, the app on a tablet is just a larger version of the iPhone app: the list of cameras remains vertical when you turn the tablet sideways for landscape mode.",BAIT AND SWITCH.

Moving the camera on the app was like trying to get a prize at the drop claw game.  You could really only get it *close* to facing the right way.

Pros: excellent tracking and motion detection, pan, tile, and Zoom, recording to micro SD and to your device, simple set up, clear night vision, ability to use a slider to movie though recorded timeline. Cons: two-way communication? Forget about it! The slightest background noise drowns out the already speaker challenged device. The sound DOES come out clear on the recording when playing back the SD card on another device, but talking through the camera remotely is going to be a challenge. Also the image quality is limited to a few feet. If you have the camera positioned close to what you want to record is excellent. But covering someone at the front door from a far corner of the room will produce an image slightly above a sillouette in terms of clarity of detail. Zoom in and the image blurs.

Picture quality is great remember you are only paying 37 dollars for this camera. I have it set up on patrol and it can follow movement inside the determine area creating an alarm for me. The only thing that I don't like is the lack of quality in the two way communication, much lag and noise ( I know that the lag could be because of my network). Also the sound detection is very sensitive so it had to be disable.  The only issue that I have encounter is that lately (as of two weeks) I have been resetting the camera for loss of connection, which again it could be because of my network since I own two more of these camera having the same issue, but for them not to be able to automatically reconnect is kind of a problem, specially if you are not in the house. And no, the turn on and off function on the app does not work for this issue. Also the lack of 5GHz is a problem when you have so many systems in the house using the 2.4GHz (and I'm aware about the difference on range).  Another low is not been able to be set up outside the house, the camera is obviously not made to deal with the weather specially a wet one. For this reason the IR is not a good choice to use behind a windows since it reflex and image quality is bad.

Both cameras are inside, one faces outside towards the condenser and the other faces either inside my living room or outside facing my truck. I have a fence with a ten foot gate that opens in, and the security light is right between the gate and my truck. I don't really have too many complaints about the camera on the condenser, but the camera on the driveway is just not worth the money. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed open the massive gate, completely expecting to be caught on camera, and yet nothing. Not even at night when the motion sensor blares its bright LEDs. I'd say the camera picks up about 40% of actual large movement (ie, a person, the gate moving, or my truck driving in, not a cat), which is disappointing considering these are supposed to be for security. Also, when they do pick up sound or motion, they record something for 14 seconds and then basically stop monitoring for some amount of time that I haven't figured out yet. So say it catches me opening my gate (I walk it open and latch it)... it records that, but does not record me walking back through the gate to get to my truck, nor my driving through the gate to park, nor my walking back through the gate and shutting it. That's upwards of two minutes that are completely ignored and not recorded. If I'm getting groceries out and take multiple trips, it ignores that as well, and that's at least another five minutes. I get trying to save space on their cloud, but this doesn't really amount to much security. The other issue I have is that they some times just stop. You don't notice it when you pull up the live feed because that's still going, but every once in a while you notice that there is nothing in the events page, when you know there should be something. If you're not home, some times restarting the device in the app makes it start working again. But sometimes it screws everything up and you're left with no cameras. So you have to unplug them when you get home... which could be in a couple of hours... or days. Sometimes restarting your phone helps. But still, sometimes it doesn't. I get that they're $40 cameras, but I spent $120 on a set of 6 from Belkin and never had an issue. The only reason I removed those was because I wanted something a little more attractive and less ""security camera"" looking while trying to sell my house. The picture quality is good. I would say the sound quality is good but I do have hearing issues and the house is 100 years old with original hardwood floors and minimal furnishings, so I can't distinguish much, but that's probably not the cameras fault.",Misses way too much...

The motion and sound alerts are great.... Get almost immediate alerts and recording when he starts screaming but not any from the tv I leave on for him.... And the occasional me walking in when I forget to turn them off ...So the adjustable settings are great! I love that I can hear what's going on and even talk back to him if I need too Have had no issues pulling up live feed on the go and the photo recording capabilities when he's doing something cute are great The night vision is perfect at night and because you can switch to it anytime remotely it helps when the lighting in his room isn't great very clear picture on  night vision I got the pan so it could also double as a security can fire the living room or could follow him if he makes it where he's not suppose to and the control/quality are excellent for the price.... To be able to have full control of the camera including powering  it on and off when away is incredible I also have a door contact sensor attached to this cam and that works perfectly as  well giving me notifications everytime door is opened closed or left open Don't have the video when door opens function turned on now but tried it and it does work well We had a power surge recently and the camera after a little time was able to reconnect itself which was also Great,PrefectForPetWhenGoneAlertsAndCanTalkBack

The set-up process is simple but I could not get the cam to connect. I tried for over an hour and followed all the directions to the letter. I set the camera aside to return and decided to try the connection process one last time and BOOM it finally made the connection. Now it works perfectly. So expect some possible frustration up front during the set up process, but it will be worth the effort. USING THE CAMERA All I can say is wow is what an impressive piece of tech this is for $30. A pan and scan remote live stream camera with two-way voice would have been $150 purchase not too long ago. Now with just a few quick clicks I can check in and make sure the dogs are OK when I am at work or on the go. The clarity when it switches to black and white night vision in low light conditions is amazing, it can see better than I can in the dark. The pan and scan works great. One feature the description doesn't make clear is the cam comes with a USB wall-outlet adapter so all you need is any power outlet and you are in business once the set up is completed. Would definitely recommend.",Impressive technology for the price... love being able to check on the dogs when I'm on the go!

I bought Wyze out of curiosity.  The camera is feature rich and that is also the problem.  Using all the features creates a busy view of an area, however If you need the room to be scanned and its not high traffic or you need 360 vision, this is a great option at an unbeatable price.  I found having too many of the features on renders the camera almost useless because it becomes confused by all the rules and starts to ignore some of the enable features in order to satisfy another. The on board storage is a great option and cheaper than paying NEST a monthly or yearly fee.  It is a huge plus The app is easy to navigate and does what is needed. Set up was easy and straight forward. I'm not too impressed with the picture quality, the Blink Mini won that in a comparison.  Also the night vision is lacking, it picks up too much reflection from white surfaces especially white surfaces, which cause the picture to wash out.","Great features, excellent for the price, still not for everyone"

The person detection doesn't work and it's not even a free option like it used to be when I got the camera.  They ran a beta trial and not once did person detection work. Constantly sending me notifications for blowing leaves. No way I'd pay for an option that doesn't function. These were great a year ago. Now all they are is live cameras I can look through my phone.

Both work pretty well. Bought another Pan cam, installed it under the eave in the front of the house, signed up for their monthly paid ""complete motion capture"" that records to the cloud. Camera would NOT detect motion, nor would it record to the cloud (because, I assume, it wasn't detecting any motion to record). Contacted Wyze support via chat. Spent about two hours following her instructions to manually flash the firmware back to a July 19 version. Wouldn't work, despite trying it three or four times. Meantime, we're emailing back and forth about my progress. She stopped replying to me late in the day, presumably because her shift (in the Phillipines) ended. I had a case number, so contacted Wyze again the next day. Different support agent. Went through the whole story again, tried something else, emailed back and forth with me finally saying ""you need to replace this camera, it is of no use to me if it can't detect a thief pulling up in my driveway"".

You get you pay for here. The noise from the camera rotation is loud. So loud that you can hear it across the room, thus drawing attention to the camera. I got it hoping to be fairly out of sight out of mind. So now I don't use that feature because I don't need the nanny looking up at the camera all the time wondering why it's following her around. The microphone sound quality is horrible. I can barely understand a conversation 5 feet from the camera. Lastly and what irritates me the most, I got this because of the addition of the SD card for continuous recording. I've had this camera a month now and twice the camera just happened to disconnect itself from the SD card. When this happens you have you manually eject the card, re insert it and format it.

The issue that I really have with it is the motion detection window that you can refine in the app to alert you on your phone when something crosses into that zone. The app only allows you to create a rectangle hot zone area for detecting things. I have the camera installed at my apartment front door which overlooks the community front gate. So it picks up motion for every single car and person that walks into the. community. Now it also catches my front door perfectly. However, the window that I have set near my door picks up every bit of motion by the cars. I wish the window (hot zone) tool was more intuitive so that you could draw with your finger the zones you want to be ignored and the spots you really want to keep an eye on. It watches my door which is great but the constant motion is an issue because I believe the camera to avoid recording too much will detect motion and notify you on your cell. After this motion is detected the camera will go into a cooldown mode and I from what I grasped not record or notify you for 5 min. I could be wrong about the record part but notifications will stop so you don’t get spammed. However, that worries me because if a car drives past and triggers the motion and someone decides to try to rob my place 2 min later will it even catch it due to the cooldown? I’ve activated night vision mode twice to test and its honestly not that great looking in my opinion. Maybe it will preform well in low light environments. Not that the area is overly bright. But I’ll be sticking to standard vision. Getting an SD card is a must if you want to record more than the 20 seconds of video that is offered with the cloud storage Wyze offers. However, I’ve looked all through the app and I don’t see the option to set your camera to record the minute of video it should capture with an SD card. I did find the setting to record only motion rather than record nonstop. But if its not there in the app it should be added. While the Camera pan is nice and you can turn the camera from your phone. I don’t think it has a zoom feature. You can only turn the camera up, down, left or right but no zoom. So if you need to take a photo through the lens you’ll have to zoom in using a 3rd party tool. So in the event you need to take a photo of a license plate that was a distance away you may be out of luck. I also heard from another review that the device may not reboot if you lose internet connection. Currently as of writing this I’m not at home but my camera is down and It hasn’t come back up likely due to internet being out but I won’t know if its back online until I’m home and can reset it myself. Now for the things I do like: I like that you can watch from your camera from your phone via the live stream. It has sounds detection and an intercom feature. Granted I don’t see myself using those features. Quality is pretty good and surprised me although like I said above about the lack of zoom. A small zoom feature would have been nice. Doesn’t need to be Hubble Telescope levels of zoom but a basic zoom in. You can change the detection hot zone sensitivity. However, I wish you could set the setting higher for person detention and lower for motion in my situation. Which the app only lets you set the sensitivity for motion. So I wish you could toggle one detection to be higher than another. For the price point not bad.",Nice little cam

White,"I so want to give this a 5 star rating but cant even justify the 1 star. The cameras are great small great quality easy to setup and use. now they have an outdoors one and sensors all of which are great. The biggest problem is you cant use any of them. The app that is required to use these cameras and sensors is the biggest steaming pile of S>>> you could ever think of using. First it only plays back a 12 second video even if you have an SD card. OK so they want you to use their pay service. The pay service still does not fix that it will only notify you of events every 5 MIN. If someone walks past your property doing nothing  and 4 MIN later your door is kicked in it wont notify you as its not been 5 MIN.  The APP will lock you phone and just give a black screen. If you try to pan the camera you had better have a half an hour as just the lightest  tap will cause it to do a full 180 so you can record you drapes for a min. I have 2 of these cameras both connected to the same WiFi and they are ALWAYS 3-5 min out of sync of each other. The App when connected to the same network will sync the time for all of 3 seconds and then one will just stop wont record,move, or display anything for 2-4 min then start again at the wrong time with the wrong video. The App will also just hang when doing playback again on the same network. The fact that you can not use ANY other software with these cameras is also a major fail. The best I can say is that if you want to order these cameras is don't use them for anything other then looking at a static image like a painting or poster do not use them for anything important",App is total GARBAGE

Initially, I really liked the Wyze cam and ordered a total of three pan cams.  The camera was never anything near perfect, but it was a great alternative for home security.  After the most recent firmware update, the cameras are now terrible.  I get constant alerts of motion despite motion sensitivity being set to the lowest threshold setting...and this is from static items in my room that are being picked up as moving when the camera pans.  Manual control of the camera using the app is really frustrating, the camera ""fights"" you the entire time.  Let's say you want to pan to the left using the manual control, the camera will keep sensing movement and move to the right.  It's as simple as them programming a disabling timer so that the user isn't overridden while tying to use the camera manually.  I've tried working with the company to give them cues as to what is problematic with their product...they don't care.  The app often times won't connect to cameras and requires numerous attempts despite being connected to 150 mbps Xfinity internet and I have full bars with my iPhone on the verizon network. I switched to Simplysafe and it's a vastly superior product/service.  It costs more, but for something this critical, price shouldn't be the primary concern.",Getting worse with firmware updates

I’ll start by saying we have two $25 Geeni cameras that are 100% reliable although the picture nor sound quality as good as Wyze. The Wyze support is stated as 5-7 day turnaround?! People online saying it’s running closer to two weeks. No bueno. “We have been experiencing an issue with Wyze Cams not displaying or having a display delay on all Alexa devices (Echo, Spot, Fire TV's, etc). We have a temporary fix that will allow users to have a better connection rate. Customers may still experience the longer connection times, but it should succeed after a few seconds. We are actively working with AWS on this issue. It has not yet been finalized if the issue is on the Wyze or AWS side. If your Alexa device fails to display your Wyze Cam the first time, please try again and it should succeed within the 2nd or 3rd try. If that is not the case, please contact our support team.” Okay so I’ve tried like dozens of times and it never connects. Alexa says “hmm...camera isn’t responding” but all the other cameras show up even the Wyze cam v2 (not the pan) we got last week which has had connection issue one time. This has been going on since November?! I’m super bummed because overall I love the camera. I’ve attached photo of picture quality in Wyze app and a photo of it not responding on my Echo Show (which I love so much by the way! Except now I’m afraid of zombie deer...tip don’t ask alexa to show you that story) I’m glad I didn’t get the skin yet though because I suspect it’s going back :( Update 3/7/2018 I’m updating my rating to five stars.

Wish I'd tried one before purchasing the second one. Pros: It was really quick and easy to set up. Motion Tracking works well. Colors are vibrant when the camera is in color mode, and the night vision capability seems good. Cons: Even though the camera detects motion (which it tracks...so I know it's detecting it) it won't reliably turn on the camera and record it. It will do so if a LARGE area of its monitoring field is in motion (such as my garage door going up), but smaller events (like people walking by the camera) don't reliably turn on the camera, and that's primarily why I bought it, to pick up the movement of people entering my garage. And even when the camera does start recording, it will only do so for 12 seconds. Which isn't long enough to do much good. Additionally, there is no way to adjust the image for contrast or brightness, two very important issue for a security camera that is used in widely varying lighting conditions.

Why would a camera that pans face backwards to a wall after resetting position!? Why does it have the cool down period!? Why does it record for only 12 seconds!? Using SD card doesn’t make much difference even with continuous recording setting. Suggestion- allow me to opt out of cloud storage to increase video length and maybe cool down period. Provide software update the lets user define max panning range (not panscan limits). Update 2- two side by side cameras react differently to motion and sound inputs.

Motion tracking spazzes out so bad that the camera goes crazy and never recovers. Even at low sensitivity. Pan and scan seems to change its mind about where the waypoints are set at random. If you set a motion tagging zone the camera will randomly set itself to some unexplained spot.

However I was left so disappointed and frustrated and without Internet for 1.5hrs yesterday after having final connection problems and having to resort to asking for Amazon support.

I emailed WYZE twice NO response.  So I contacted Amazon support on chatline -the agent took my cell number incase we got disconnected.  Good plan, or so I thought!

The Amazon agent stated I needed to disable the 5g Wifi and then connect the camera and then Iwhen working I could re-enable the 5g Wifi afterwards.  Sounded like a good, reasonable plan.  He talked me through the process of disabling the 5g.  Entering the Gateway, when I disconnected the 5g, I lost internet AND the Amazon chatline!!  The agent DID NOT call me back!  I had no internet at all.  I did not disconnect the 2.4.

Why did he ask for my cell number in case we did get disconnected.  As for WYZE support- well REALLY disappointing, I needed them to guide me through the connection process as having problems.

Flash forward a few years later when I finally get around to writing a review and this is only a good deal if you want to also pay a monthly fee,if you're putting it in an extremely low traffic area, or if you need to stick your camera in a window at night with outside (IR or otherwise) illumination.  I say this as someone who gets free person detection because I've used these for so long. Unfortunately they have introduced a 5-minute ""cooling down"" timeout on alerts (motion, person, and sound.) It will of course continue to record (ONLY) to your local SD card but no cloud backup.  (If your dog barks at the cat you don't get a motion detected clip at your package (or treat) spy cam for 5minutes in other words.) I very much like the company but the monthly/yearly fee (per camera) definitely reduces the usefulness of this compared to offerings from eufy (love their 2k stationary one with detection on camera) and the like 😿 however once again the big selling point for this camera (without a subscription) if you can tolerate the 5 minute cut off is because the customers asked, the night vision illuminators can be turned off so this is excellent for use as a nighttime camera through a window. But even here there are cheap battery-powered cameras with better optics for mounting outside without having to do hardcore installation...  I will say I quite like the app and the ability to group multiple cameras together to view simultaneously on Android, hence the modern day pair of stars.

The features and functionality were super, and the overall quality of both hardware and image was excellent - and at a price point that was compelling! Unfortunately, it only works for as long as you subscribe; otherwise, it becomes a paperweight.  The moment my trial subscription expired, the camera would no longer connect and was unusable.  This is misleading: the impression given by the ""trial"" software is that it provides cloud storage and the ability to access recordings and other extended functionality.

What I do not accept is the requirement for a never-ending subscription fee for this product to work - and that this fact is not made abundantly clear in the description.

Wilson,"I wanted something cheap and easy to view my kids/dogs when I'm not home. This does the job. It doesn't have some of the fancy features like my more expensive outdoor cameras have (Geolocation activation, multiple schedules...) but it covers what I need. It was super easy to set up and get it running. The app is super easy to use- I've had it for about 4-6 months and have had no ""buggy"" program issues with it (whereas I've had MANY issues with my expensive Arlo Pro app.) I bought a second one to put in my spare bedroom/cat foster room so I can check in on my foster cat throughout the day. A few cons: Motion detection isn't great on small things, it tends to activate for my cat but not for any of my dogs- even though my dogs are bigger. It sometimes drops in and out of night vision, not a huge issue for me but could be for someone else. It makes a continuous weird clicking noise when it turns on for it's "" Event Recording Schedule"".  The biggest issue I have with it is the voice feature does not work. When my son is home and not answering his phone  and I can SEE him sitting in front of the TV (:eye roll:), I would like to use the ""Voice"" feature to speak with him, but it's so glitchy that he can't understand me at all.

Right now I'm waiting for its app to return control of my Samsung S-7 back to me--it has locked that phone TOTALLY.  It did no better on a newer Samsung phone of another family member.  Camera repeatedly displays unable to connect, or similar, despite being next to 2.4 ghz router and logged in as instructed.  And it showed signal strength as good, so that was inconsistent.  Tried it via cellphone network and via the same home network.  Multiple phones.  Its app directed us to force close this and that.  No good results no matter what we tried and I've managed some 15 camera setups through the last 5 years or so, including the Blink, which seems much more reliable, but is more limited in what it boasts. When Wyze Pan Cam  did work it did not track motion well -- kept indicating fixed objects were moving.  The sound was very, very low as some reported.  In both directions.  Not useable for most unless you get very close.  And apparently it will not work with a browser or desktop or Blue Iris or similar third party software unless you change its firmware, at which point it apparently will no longer function as originally intended with its own app, which COULD have been its strong point.  For the low money, I was going to just have it monitor the food / candy pantry from raiding children, or the puppy, but it won't even serve those limited purposes.  Some report it is not really the American success story but is just foreign hardware repackaged.  For the money, it boasts too much and doesn't perform basic function, much less the frills.

I had previously purchased another brand with which I was familiar, and installed in my father's room.  I connected to a cable company internet modem/router, which 'seemed' to be more reliable than the free WiFi at the nursing home.  That setup required a wired connection to initially set up and then WiFi.  COVID-19 hit, and the nursing home allows no visitors.  Around the same time, the cable company internet connection died, and power cycling did not resolve the issue.  Neither I nor a cable company technician can enter to troubleshoot the problem, and nobody can enter to configure those cameras for the nursing home WiFi.  This Wyze Cam Pan was purchased as a 'pandemic solution', since we were able to configure it wirelessly for the nursing home WiFi without entering the building (we just needed to be outside the building and in range of their WiFi).  We then gave it to a nursing home staff member who placed it my father's room.  It works great, and any motion/sound recordings go to the cloud.  For some reason, it would not initially remember the WiFi settings when unplugged in one location and plugged into another, but that somehow resolved itself. I took off one star in the overall rating for the following reasons: 1) if not placed properly, or not properly secured, panning can result in the camera falling over.  My father is blind and cannot help in this situation, so we have just stopped panning. 2) the previous cameras we used had a web-based interface, whereas this only has a phone app.  I prefer having both viewing solutions. It is very affordable and has allowed the family to monitor my father, and I would purchase again.",Helped me out in a pinch

I got this camera because it was cheap, and it's doing exactly what I need: I want to see when someone comes to my door, and have recordings to review when they do. I have it pointed out through the window next to my front door. They've added a switch to turn the IR LEDs off, which improves night vision through a window (when I was researching this camera I found pictures where people had put electrical tape over the LEDs, so I was prepared to do that, but now there's a switch to turn the LEDs off so I don't have to! Auto recording and notifications work great so far. The phone app is serviceable; there's no web app or PC app so you have to have a smart phone or tablet to use this camera effectively. I was hoping for a web or PC app so we could check the camera from our computers, but for the price the phone app is perfectly fine. It lets you schedule time-lapses, take manual recordings, set auto-capture for motion or sound detection, and review past notifications. Note that you need a microSD card to be able to do anything other than look through the camera and take manual real-time photos and recordings.

I bought this to replace an old Dlink camera I had been using for a few years. Setup is pretty easy with no hurdles to jump through. I was impressed the very first night. It’s field of vision was greater than my old camera and the picture was sharp and clear. This camera also has great range and motion. I use this camera to view the outside of my home through glass. At first when night came, lights came on the camera and caused a glare against the window, but there’s a feature to turn the light off and it worked like a charm.  I love the fact that with a micro SD card (sold separately) it will record whatever it sees so you can playback at any time. Motion and sound detection records 12 seconds and gives you a message and you can view these clips in “events”. It’s pretty accurate. I set my camera to only detect a certain portion of the screen because it was detection a tarp flapping in the breeze and the notifications were off the chart. You can do that.. have motion detection only focus on a portion of the screen. This helps,  it I found it to be a bit of a pain. With that feature set, if I moved the camera to see another area, it would reset itself in a few seconds back to the start area you had it set to. I thought my camera was broken until I figured out that it was because of how I set it. It’s really a minor issue. The sound quality or 2 way audio isn’t the best. It’s “ok” and works which is all that really matters, but if you need to have a long conversation you’ll be disappointed. I don’t need or use this feature so it’s not a problem to me. Again though it does work and you can hear and speak. Very minor issue. I love my Wyze camera. It’s jam packed with features and I bought it for under 38.00. I have no real complaints and I’ve since purchased 2 more for other windows.",You Can’t Go Wrong For The Price

Night vision is ok, i can see stuff, but sometimes it clicks and turns entirely black, and would be back to normal after a few seconds, but it was annoying and i don't think it should happen.

I set it up in a corner that had a good view of the entire downstairs but at night when the camera is on and motion tagging and panning is enabled, the camera gets attracted to the infrared light on the wall and pans close to the wall and this continues until its pointed straight at the wall where it stays all night.

First it fills up the memory with continuous recording (event-driven is too unreliable, see below) and stops recording, when it really oughta overwrite old data and start anew automatically. Then it'll say either ""SD card not available"" or ""0 MB/0 MB memory available,"" and trying to Format Card (again, and again) doesn't work - you have to pull the card out and put it back in to start fresh. Way too high maintenance. The motion detection for event recording is barely useful -- it's either so sensitive that the moving shadow of a tree branch in the wind triggers it constantly, or it doesn't even notice people walking by. You can try setting a tiny detection zone, but that doesn't seem to matter. And the free version of Events only allows 1 event every 12 minutes, so you get a 30 second event of shadows moving and 11:30 of dead time where you won't get any recording. My camera also is stuck in a single home position that I can't reset, so if I try to pan to a different location and leave it there, it automatically recenters after maybe 10 seconds, no matter what I do to the Pan settings. 2 stars because you can at least look out the window in real time.

D. Manley,"I've had two of these cameras for a few years.  Initially, I was impressed with the low cost and packed features.  Overtime though, I've discovered that they cost more than they're worth.  Here's a quick peek why. The picture quality for a 1080p camera is pretty good.  It doesn't record at 30fps if I recall so you'll end up missing some details so you'll need to consider why you're getting the camera and the use case. The night vision works, but it's not heavily powered.  So you're going to be limited in overall distance.  Indoors the night vision will works well a few meters is all I'd really get though.  So depending on mounting and placement this may be a non-starter for some. Most of the bugs were worked out and restarts of the device now take you back to the last known position of the camera.  Which for the first year or two, that was literally the most frustrating thing in the world.  Placing your camera in the right spot, get everything just the way you want it.  Only to come back the next day and it was facing the wrong direction because of a random restart. Here's the major cause for concern.  If you look at the forums, Wyze cameras seemed to be eating SD Cards.  Don't know about you, but I tend to use good quality SD cards.  Continuous recording, in varying conditions, and for extended periods of time.  You'll want an SD card that can handle that many rewrites (yes - SD cards have a life span measured in total number of complete writes).  The cameras have eaten 2 of these cards already.  Now I don't bother to record anything.  Which defeats their purpose. The motion tracking, and event triggering has been spotty at best, and the application doesn't have any fine grain video controls.  That in my book costs the units almost 2 stars right there.  Having to take the cards out, pull the files, and fast forward gets old really fast. Pros: - Decent picture quality. - Good feature set for little cost - Excellent panning and motor controls for a small unit - Night vision included Cons - Stop eating my SD Cards (they cost as much as you do)! - Video reliability is an issue - Night vision is underpowered - App is terrible If you're looking for a security camera.  This is not it.  You'll want to look at something more refined, and with dedicated storage.  If you're looking for something to monitor indoor activity (3D printing - which is what I use it for, baby room, entry way events, etc.) then it's a great camera and a great value.  But, until they fix the units eating my SD cards and the app.  It won't be doing any video recording...which is kind of the primary purpose right?",Not Quite Ready For Primetime

A single camera placed in a corner just about covers the entire room, so two cameras used indoors and placed in opposite corners will probably give you more coverage than a single pan cam in that same room. The reason I returned my pan cam is because there was a loud mechanical click when moving the lens up and down, which means it was either cheaply made, broken, or simply didn't have much life expectancy.

Have not tried manually downgrading firmware (again) yet. I believe No MicroSD means no local storage which means can't record footage locally. So as a PSA - buyer beware.

Makes my life so much easier.  Speaker sucks on this one too (4 stars) but I use WITH my Alexa Devices and the pic quality is AMAZING.  Since it works together so well.... I wanted to keep them even with faulty speaker systems.  Previous cameras of other brands had same issues AND no where NEAR the same quality of picture or Camera Quality. Review on original wyze cameras: (i purchased 1 Panning Camera and 2 of the Stationary Cameras as well). I bought these to replace some other cameras I had that we're not very good quality. The picture quality on these is amazing!!!! The fact that I can have multiple cameras and see different rooms on one screen at the same time, is phenomenal!! This makes having multiple children, and a dog on the second floor of an apartment much more manageable. The other thing that makes these amazing is that they work with my echo devices. I can talk to my kids through my echo in each room, while watching them on the camera if I am outside with the dog.  This puts me at peace of mind immensely.  I can have stationary cameras in rooms or a panning camera in the large open areas. This also makes it so that I do not need to pay astronomical amounts of money for a security system as I have these cameras. I can sign in to check on the baby sitter or even just to make sure the dog isn't barking.  These really do have benefits.  I also love that i can Group them.  I can also turn them on and off. With the touch of a button.  Or by telling Alexa. ****They are only on when needed.  ****",Love LOVE LOVE this thing!!!!

For the last couple of weeks. The camera will randomly blare a loud buzzing noise out of its speaker, like the horn of an ambulance or firetruck.  It won't stop until you unplug it.  I has been happening with increasing frequency.  I had to give up on this junk. Viewing the useless 12 seconds of motion is the only thing that's reliable.  Connecting to view ""livestream"" works 80% of the time.  20% of the time, connecting to the cameras fail.  Connecting to view recorded video from the SD card is horribly unreliable. (I have 2 cameras at one location, 3 cameras at another.  I get the same results whether I'm accessing remotely or locally, on the same WiFi as the cameras.) Let's start with the useless 12 seconds of video.  That's 12 seconds EVERY 5 MINUTES.  So, a car approaches.  Recording starts as soon as it sees the headlights beaming on the ground.  By the time the car enters view of camera, 12 seconds is up.  The thief now has 5 minutes to have their way with your property without being recorded.  I've had at least 6 instances of theft and vandalism where I have 0 seconds of footage of the act.  In most cases the person isn't even seen because that precious 12 seconds is squandered away by some stray beam of light or a bug flying past the camera.  Someone once borrowed one of my trucks.  In the video, one second the truck is there.  The next second, poof it vanishes.  It didn't even catch the truck leaving the parking lot. So, I though the solution would be to install SD cards because the cameras will record as much video as you want, up to the capacity of the card (32GB max).  The problem is you can't watch the video because trying to connect to load video from the SD card (they call it ""playback"") is horribly unreliable.  Even when it's able to quickly connect to view live video, as soon as you click ""Playback"" to view recorded video, it fails to connect.  If you're lucky enough to get it to connect, it takes forever to load video or doesn't load at all. The software is buggy and poorly designed.  It crashes frequently if you click too many things.  Unfortunately, you tend to click around a lot when you can't tell if the software is working because it's not doing what you've asked it to do.","Poor connection, unreliable, glitchy software and now, random loud buzz from the speaker!"

Aside from that, the camera is fantastic!  The pan, zoom, and quality of the image are excellent.  I installed the additional micro SD card, plugged the camera in, ran the setup, got it hooked up to my WiFi without any problems.  Downloaded the app for my phone, did what was necessary, and it worked!  Awesome!  What the instructions don't say is that once hooked up to the internet through your router, you have access from anywhere you have a phone signal.  I was at a loss initially because nothing about this was said, but when I read a post about somebody having two cameras set up in another country, It dawned on me... why not try to connect from a mile away.  I opened the app and turned the camera on, and was able to remotely control all the functions and monitor what my 3D printer was doing (I had aimed it at the printer before I left but did not turn it on).  If you are looking for something to remotely monitor whatever it is, this can't be beat, not only for the price, but for the functionality.  I highly recommend this camera.

As far as setup, connection, night vision, and firmware updates, I had zero qualms. But I bought it to track my cat's usage of the litter box to make sure that they weren't relieving themselves elsewhere after I had an issue with one of them deciding the new litter wasn't to her liking. The motion detection seems to work ok, but tracking is nothing like they advertise. Once a target is detected, the adventure begins. When the target moves, the camera follows it by frequently overshooting the target when rotating to keep it in picture. It then overshoots back the opposite direction and eventually completely overshoots the target and you end up staring at a wall. Even if you stand right in front of the camera, it will perform a little mating ritual by dancing back and forth as it hunts for you. Trying to watch the recorded events was a squeamish nightmare. I don't normally get motion sickness, but this was nearly enough to induce such a reaction.","If you want a motion tracking camera, look elsewhere"

It's really tall, and definitely you know it's there. If you want a camera to keep hidden or out of the way, this isn't it. It's easy to tip over, it's loud when it pans around. I had to secure it with double sided tape to keep it upright and in place. You are able to move the camera up and down and side to side within the app which is neat. I did notice it kept moving in circles back and forth constantly though. Without me instructing it to do so. I did finally figure out in settings how to make it not move and stay stationary. I didn't think the use instructions were informative. I had to figure some things out myself. It is an affordable camera though and there are some accessories for it that can be bought separately. Would I but it again, no. I would want a camera that isn't so visible and big, something that isn't as noticeable and loud when it pans around and you move the lens around.It's an ok camera.

Stable app, good quality build and image. Love the motion area setting, good audio, good motion and sound detect. Panning gives whole room visibility. Night vision works fine to 20 feet. Using it for a dog monitor. Bought three of the Wyse Outdoor cameras. Color image is good. Field of view is a bit too wide, want more face and less yard. Night image loses facial contrast (blooming) if the object is over illuminated by IR from incandescent house lights or object is too close to the camera IR LEDs. The mounting arrangement is insufficient, easy for perp to knock camera off wall with a stick, wind may blow it out of alignment. The motion detect area is not adjustable and this is a Huge problem as we get triggers from areas we do not care about and that fills up our cloud storage with reflected car headlights and  irrelevant activity in the neighbors yards. Battery lasts about two months before re-charge and it is a pain to get on a ladder to get them down for charging, but better than drilling holes all over the house for power cables.

To be called a ""security camera"" and store your videos on their servers (probably not encrypted) without the option to decline cloud storage, is an a contradiction in terms with function. Unfortunately, it seems like most of the cheap ""security"" cameras work that way. What are they doing with the videos recorded to the cloud? And when delete them, are they really deleted? Overall , I would not buy multiple PAN CAM because if 1 is difficult to operate, what happens the work increase to manage 3, 4, 5, or 10 cameras would be burdensome. I've purchased 3 different brands of camera. Yi, Wyze, and Wansview. Of the three, I'd put Wyze as second for usability and configuration. The pan feature isn't really every a effective because the camera pans too fast. When setting pan speed in the app, I cannot discern the difference between slow and fast. The video quality seems truly 1080p. Very good. Mic quality is very poor. Seems compressed to a very low bit rate and audio constantly cuts out. The timelapse feature seems nice, but try downloading the timelapse video and it can take hours. If the download fails, then the process restarts. Some frequently accessed configurations in the app are buried 3 to 5 levels deep and are difficult to find and to navigate. Deleting videos saved to the SD card is not possible and requires the SD card to be formatted (wiped completely). Deleting video ""events"" (motion detection), is a 4 step process. If 5 videos exist you want to delete, 5x4=20 clicks. Deleting events is very difficult, time consuming, and not worth the effort of owning the camera.  Seems it's intentionally difficult to delete. How about the option for a 1 or 2 click delete and delete all? There is no way to DELETE ALL EVENTS (10-12 second video recordings stored in Wyze's cloud server whether or not you want them stored in cloud). Even to delete videos for 1 day requires minutes of scrolling to load all videos for that day, then press select, select all, delete, confirm. And if a mistake is made, start over. The camera hardware is nice. But the app make is impractical I soul","deleting videos difficult, mic quality poor"

It has a wide field of vision that covers almost the entirety of my studio.  I have it turned on any time I'm not in the studio and I have alerts set up to ping my phone anytime it detects something. The quality is fantastic and the night vision mode is remarkable.  I have some Christmas lights strung along the top of two walls in my studio, and with those small led christmas lights it makes the night vision look almost like daylight!  It's really good. I recently just subscribed to their monthly service that allows you to record more than the 15 seconds or whatever it is that the free version offers.  For $1.49/mo it keeps recording past the cutoff.  I've walked into my studio numerous times and the video follows me for at least two minutes.  I'll pay $1.49 for that extra recording time.  Though if you don't opt for that, the shorter recording time is still good.  Since I'm using this for my business, I'll pay for the extra time, just in case something happens. I don't use the pan feature on this, so if I had to go back and buy one again, I might just get the little cube, since the wide FOV covers almost the whole studio (It doesn't cover the window area that is directly below the camera - I am on a 3rd floor building, so it's impossible to get in my window) I'd definitely check these Wyze cams out if you haven't yet.  They are great. The only thing I'd like to see that they don't have yet is some kind of auto-detect feature where the camera could shut off if I get within a certain distance of the studio.  That way I could arrive and leave and it would turn on/off automatically.  Currently you have to disable/enable it every time. Great camera.",A fantastic home camera with great night vision!

In fact, without it, the camera is completely useless. So, imagine my frustration when that seems to be the one feature that isn't working on my camera. No big deal, sometimes there's software bugs or issues with my network configuration that prevent these kinds of features from working correctly. If this were some PC software or something where I had access to logs, I bet I could have diagnosed and fixed the issue myself-- it's my day job. But, Wyze decides to hide their logs inside of an encrypted zip file, meaning I don't have access to them at all. But support has to, right? Surely, if they have a feature to send the logs to their team, they have to be able to look at them. This isn't the case. Support only uses templated replies and makes no effort to troubleshoot. Instead, all I get is the standard ""did you restart the camera? Remove and re-add it from the app"".

This is a ridiculous workaround and does not happen with the SimpliSafe camera setup FYI.

Bought six of these. After 2 weeks of use here are the cons - the cloud footage is too short to capture meaningfully activity. Biggest flaw however, is the motion detection is disappointly unrealable. Lots of motion captures but misses lots of important captures even when passing directly in front of the camera. Notice this flaw in all the cameras. If this improves I'll adjust my review. I am rooting for this camera to be a five star. Update giving it 5stars. Motion detection vastly proved. Added SD cards and did didn't realize how well they work with the motion capture. To top it off Waze today offered full motion capture and I immediately signed up. They have also gotten rid of that 5 minute delay between capture. Awesome package.",Great deal but...update

The picture quality was poor at best, and setup was so difficult I eventually gave up on it - and I’m an IT Professional. I discovered the WyzeCam, and I’m well beyond impressed. As another reviewer commented, it takes longer to open the box and unpack the WyzeCam than it does to set it up. Literally, you can have it working in minutes.  The camera is compact, nice looking, has surprisingly good picture quality, and the two way talk/listen works great. If you’re looking for a camera to monitor your home while you’re away, don’t hesitate.  I feel like I got much more than I paid for. WyzeCam, your iPhone app is quite good. I would like to see you add the ability to view the camera feed from a web site or at least a Windows 10 app. I would also like to see you add the ability to turn all cameras off/on at the same time with a single button. Ideally, you would also have the option to use location services on the iPhone to detect when people are home and turn the cameras off. Would also be nice to have them on for certain times whether I’m home or not, such as at night.  These are just requests, I can say the app (at least for iPhone) works much better than expected and has excellent features; firmware updates occurred without a hitch and the app is very stable. Well done.","Great value webcam - Don’t hesitate, just order it!"

Didn't matter to me but pay attention if it does to you. It's about as tall as my hand. Wouldn't connect to my network the first four times I tried. I tried three times the day I got it, and one a few days later. Then immediately after that fail it magically worked without actually adjusting anything. You can't set a default home position for the camera. Not naturally. When you turn the camera on it either uses whatever it's currently looking at as default or picks a default on its own. You can use controls in the app to pan and zoom to what you want it to record but the camera resets position 15 seconds later. No option to make it stay. A lot of times the camera reset within a few seconds of me using the app controls to just look around. Didn't wait the 15 seconds. Some users reported having success with adding multiple waypoints at the same position but what if you wanted to use those waypoints for what they were meant for? To monitor different spots with the same camera? I set up a ""detection zone"" inside of the monitored area. Some users said it would make the camera stay on that spot. It didn't for me. If I selected a smaller area within the bigger picture to be monitored, the camera would then reset to its original position, taking the detection area with it. Not sure how to explain that. I guess imagine I selected a rectangle within a larger rectangle. Even after the camera reset itself the rectangle that I selected remained in the same spot. So in my case it meant that the detection zone was a square of floor now instead of the area I wanted monitored. Even still, I got notifications for every motion detected in the whole screen, not just in the detection zone. In fact, I was only ever notified about motion I didn't care about (people walking through the hall) and never about motion I did care about (motion in one area of a room). I had to turn the sensitivity up to max to get what I wanted which just meant I got a lot more if what I didn't also. So very frustrating. ""Works with Alexa"" needs some clarification. Yes I can ask Alexa to see the camera feed on my echo show but it will only stream for 10 minutes and then stop. Worse, it spends most of that time buffering. Unusable for monitoring purposes which is what I bought it for. Camera pans fast as described. But there are a few issues with camera movement. One is that right now the lens is stuck facing all the way down so I had to tilt the camera up for it to be looking at what I want it to. I can use the app controls to look up but as stated earlier any adjustments I make get reverted a few seconds later. Also, when I tried to use the reset camera position option in the app the default position shifted about an inch each time. So if the original position was center, after a couple resets it was facing at least 45 degrees away from that. ""HD"" didn't seem very HD to me. In a brightly lit room a face 30 feet from the camera wasn't much more than indistinct shadows on skin. Not much to go on if you needed to identify a suspect. I do feel like I might be missing some important part of how to operate the camera but having read all the included documentation and spent a couple hours scouring their forums and searching the internet I feel like I should have been able to locate better instructions, explanations, or help. It seemed like an item anyone with basic network and device experience could set up. I have more than basic experience, though, and I'm still stuck. All I could find in my searches was that these problems have been commonly reported since at least the fall of last year. Apparently there have been a lot of firmware updates since then. I saw one person on the forums say he updated his firmware a couple days ago and he no longer has issues with the buffering. I've updated the firmware twice in the past two weeks and none of the problems I have are improved at all. There seems to be a ton of potential here for this affordable camera but it just doesn't do what I want it to. It's not even false advertising either because the only thing it said it would do and didn't is monitor within selected detection zones. (You can only have one detection zone as far as I can tell by the way.) The rest of the issues are things you can't really accuse them of. Like yeah I thought I could center the camera without changing it's physical position but that wasn't explicitly guaranteed. Just feels messy. Like I got it through a GoFundMe project. It's not at all what need or expected.",Messy

When using out a window the instructions even say turn off night vision , well we live in an apartment complex with outdoor lighting and the picture quality is much better with night vision off and i do run it on full 1080 . I also set the recording to only record captions meaning motion detection or people defections instead of record all the time . I had a 64GB sd card a nice class 10 Samsung evo sitting at home so that worked out it . It can take up to 128GB though . The reason i chose NOT to do record all the time was 2 reasons is in about 4 days or less the card was full and you just need to reformat it if you have nothing important on it . BUT MAINLY was due to when i took out the SD card and put it into my laptop testing as if i was showing the police an indecent well recording all the time is not just like using the phone where you can just roll along the blue bar at the bottom and see images instead it shows up as j pegs all individual  pictures so it took me over 3 hours to find 1 pic of the person i was testing on then i would have to run it like a picture flip book and keep running j peg or pic after pic for the police to see what happened and if it was a 10 minute break in OMG that would take a week to do . S So my rec. when you get it set up are to go down the list but mainly advanced options (recording events only ) camera light status on timestamp watermark show wyze logo and record sound that actually helped as my neighbors have smaller cameras with no sound recording and had a break in and said it was a hate crime and the police said there is no sound to prove well i hooked it up to my laptop and connected my Bluetooth speaker and it they could hear it from the 2nd story on the ground floor . Plus if someone accuses you of something you have it all video and audio. now with all the hate and idiots out there ! All lives matter not just Black ones or Chinese, and what chapped me is when the police did ask me what race the person was i did not give a response . MY ANSWER WHICH I  THINK IS THE BEST ANSWER IS WELL SIR HE HAD A COMPLEXION CLOSER TO OFFICER # 2  .Instead of guessing or saying Black , Mexican and then being seen as a racist which is stupid but that's what today's times have come to . ok the bad Pan Scanning this was happening on its own with it being OFF and when i would leave my home I would come home to a camera facing black out curtains . So i turned it on temp. and set the 4 settings to my front porch a little low to check for packages , a little to the rt and lft. and last right in the middle . then i tested it it worked well but i just need it statutory so i turned it off and since i set those settings it has not moved . Motion tagging i do rec. turning on it puts a green box around heads of people or if they move quickly to show whats in their hands etc. and works well . I also love the fact u can use it as an intercom if you have a small place . The manual record and picture work great and store on you phone's sd card as well as the device so even if you format accidentally on the camera it will still be on you phone and much easier to find. Last even if on live stream where you can just look outside and you turn sound off that does not mean it is not recording that is in a different location . That just turns it on so you can hear everything being recorded also when anyone holds the mic. button down the sound button comes on so you can hear . Like i said earlier it makes a good indoor intercom but outside the sound output is not enough to detour a criminal like shown on Amazon clips . in a completely quiet living room no tv on at about 10 ft away it was difficult to clearly hear what was being said . Well hope this helps and i highly rec. getting this over the base model even though they did come out with a base model in 1080 finally . The cord is longer the camera is much bigger with a better aperture  and overall much better visuals i can see all the way down to our covered parking which is almost 100 yards away","Pretty easy setup , Has some quirks , Took us about 1 week to figure it out"

So I spent an afternoon researching on youtube to find the best camera within a budget of $100.00 delivered.  There are a lot of different devices and systems to sift through but eventually all paths lead to the Wyze Cam Pan at less than half of what I budgeted. I like the app - it does take a little time to get familiar with the settings and controls but the learning curve is short and sweet - one of the neat features is being able to turn the cam on and off from your phone wherever you are.  Within minutes I had set up various alerts and notifications and was getting alerts whenever motion was detected.  I also had my son setup the app on his phone and he too can control the Pan Cam at the same time - for an experiment we turned off the cam before he ran an errand - while out he turned the cam on without us knowing and started speaking to us!  HOW COOL IS THAT?!?!  You can also manage multiple Wyze devices from your phone with just the one app from wherever you are. Pros/Cons -Pros; app works great, 1080P is crystal clear, takes great snaps and video, plenty of alert options, setup is really easy, night vision is awesome, manual control from the app works great.  Cons; the microphone on the cam is a little weak but the speaker works great, there is a short cool down period when motion is detected for the cam to reset, and notifications can have about a 30 second lag but considering the cloud storage is free it's a pretty fair trade-off. I'll be adding at least one more Wyze Cam Pan and two additional Wyze Cams which will cover most of my property in and out including my garage. I highly recommend this cam - built well, setup is a snap, works as it should, very cost efficient.","SURPRISE!  You're on Candid Camera!!  Works as it should, very pleased."

I have 8 ring cams and 2 petcubes... Ring is nice, but it can be expensive, Petcube gives very little support - half my devices cannot load the app and it doesn't have web based access... not only that but the cloud sub fee is UNREAL - ring is a little deal when you look at what most pro alarms cost)  Petcube gen 1 had semi-decent plans, but the second gen did away with that and discounting for multiple cameras.  I just can't get over the idea of having to pay individually a high dollar fee and not even getting a month or so of cloud access. I love that Wyze supports local storage, the picture is as good as my petcube, with great night vision... interestingly enough, the room I have it in (our sunroom) has both a pet cube for the dogs and a Ring Stickup cam for security.  On the other two cameras, you can see the IR light from each other.  I don't see any IR light coming out of the Wyze, but the picture is just as good. I was really excited for the pan and scan...  but in practical use, especially compared to Ring's detection options, I find it kind of lacking.  You can set waypoints for the camera to auto check every 10-15 seconds and yes, if it detects motion it will follow things around, however I found it kept detecting motion from non-organic sources - I wanted to catch pets and people, it kept looking up at the ceiling fan...  when it did catch the pets, it would focus on the first one in the room, often following it so closely as to lose site of the other.  also the waypoints get ... well in the way when you're manually operating it - you'll focus on something only to have it suddenly jump to the next point. So I've turned off movement detection and have it fixed at the dog kennel, as I wanted something with a longer cloud ability (without paying money) than the petcube (but keep the pet cube because the motion activated laser toy the dogs and cat love) I'm hoping with future updates it will get smarter about detection etc, for now it's a camera with a freebie multi-day cloud account (Petcam free cloud is like 8 to 12 hours)  - with the added bonus of being able to pan and scan when I remote in.",doesn't work as well as I hoped.

For the money, it has some great features you won't find anywhere else even for a lot more.  The motion tracking is the primary feature I'm referring to.  Even my $350 exterior security cameras don't have that capability.  The daytime (non-night vision) picture quality is excellent. Motion tracking works for the most part, although it is pretty easy for the camera to lose the object it's tracking.  The Wyze app isn't bad, but I wish there was better support in other viewing software (Blue Iris, Tinycam, etc).  Yes, it will work in Tinycam, but not all features are supported.  It does not appear to support 2-way audio.  Maybe that will change in an upcoming release of Tinycam, but for now it is not supported. This leads me to my two biggest complaints.  2-way audio does not work for me.  I bought three cameras and all have the same problem....no audio from the camera speaker.  I know the camera audio speakers work because it's loud and clear when the camera tells me it's ready for setup.  I've made sure my devices allow microphone permissions to Wyze app.  I get either no audio at all or audio so quiet I need to literally put the camera up to my ear to hear it.  This happens with my phone (Galaxy s9+) or my tablet.  I've opened a support ticket to Wyze on this issue. The final major issue is the night vision.  It is absolutely worthless.  I am not able to see more than 5 feet away from the camera.  The rest of the room is completely black.  Even my cheap baby monitor type cameras (Foscam) have vastly superior night vision. Given these two major flaws, I'm not really sure what I will do with these cameras since my two main uses rely on either of these features.",Very good and Very bad

I have two of the regular ones and one of the pan cam's plus I purchased a dozen of the Wyze bulbs. They all work great. The regular Wyze camera's have slightly better picture quality vs the pan cam for some reason. Hard to nitpick too much based on the price. My only major complaint with the Pan Cam is I have it set up in a part of my house and default aim it in a certain direction. If there is a power outage or if the camera does an update/reset when it reboots it always spins around and is aiming at the wall. At first I thought that was just the center point so after a couple of times I moved it in the direction it was aiming... unplugged and plugged it back up and during reboot it spins around and is again aiming at the wall behind it. this happens all the time and I have to go into the app and turn it around. The motion sensing and being able to identify people is great. except while I was out of town I pulled up the cameras and again.. aiming at the wall.. spin it around and we get home a few days later.. aiming at the wall again. I am about to just replace it with a stationary regular Wyze camera because I don't know what else to do. this happens at least once a week or every other week. it gets an update or reboots and spins around backwards.,Pretty good for a $30 camera with one minor issue.

I wanted some cameras for inside our vacation home and didn't want to upgrade my existing system. Saw the reviews on these and decided to give them a try for the price. Ordered three stationary and one Pan/Zoom. Set up was super easy after getting a good internet connection and the quality of the pictures is more than expected at this price point. Had them up for 2 weeks now and everything is working fine. Night vision is reasonable as long as you're not looking too far away. Motion sensing seems to be OK, with only a few false alarms. Images are generally good, sharp at 1080 and with good color balance with natural light. Pan/Zoom camera works well and can be set up to automatically pan or you can do it manually. They are quick and quiet too. Wyze offers unlimited cloud storage at $1.49/month per camera. Certainly can add up with a lot of cameras, but offers protection should someone break in an steal the cameras along with their SD cards. At least you'll have the motion capture images of the thieves in the cloud. Overall, very pleased with these cameras so far. For the price, it's hard to beat the value. Will be buying more soon.

(1) The camera has a feature (person detect) which works well. I’ve gotten notice from the company that if I want to continue getting person detect it will cost me $3.99 a month. WHAT?  They are taking away a feature that came with the camera. 2nd problem is I’ve had 3-4 firmware upgrades and until this last one the camera was extremely erratic. Really bad. And of course you can’t get ahold of anyone for support. So, I’ll be researching other inexpensive cameras that has support you can get ahold of and features they won’t be taking away from you.

The image is crisp and beautiful, and the camera pans and tilts so that I can follow her movements. I can also set it for motion detection alerts so that, rather than watching all the time - I can just be alerted when she’s on the move in the house. The best part is the 2 way microphone!! So when I see that she’s doing something sketchy, I can just call through the microphone, “Mom, don’t do that! You’re gonna fall!” And she can respond back to me in a 2 way conversation. It’s given me wonderful peace of mind. Best purchase I could have made, and I plan to get more for other areas of the house.",OMG - I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!!

For the price it's pretty good. Now just gotta find a use for it. I basically just have it in my den for now. Not sure if I'll mount it outside or inside, and I may buy another to keep in the crawlspace with night vision. Picture quality is surprisingly good. Once you set up the app it's fairly simple to use. When the camera pans over sense sees the TV screen, it senses the moving picture on the screen and tags it, and sometimes stops for a while and records as an event. Even at the lowest setting it would do this. So I turned off Motion Tracking for now. I could see where this would be both useful and fun, especially if one had pets that are left home during the day. The status light is a bit hard to see, not very prominent. Some may like that, some may not, I haven't decided. In a quiet room you can also hear the motor as it pans. Again not obnoxious, it hasn't disturbed my naps, but some might find that a deal breaker. For $38 I think it's a steal compared to others.",So far pretty decent. Motion Tracking is a bit too sensitive.

It does some good things in regards to security. (I.E. - Motion detection, event recording on motion & sound, alerts & notifications to name a few) Two stars is simply because of the alexa integration. (I BOUGHT FOR THIS REASON ONLY) It only works with the show or spot and it will... It only actually connect about 40%, and when it decides to actually connect, it takes upwards of 10 - 15 seconds and longer. These are security cameras and alot can happen in 15 seconds of time. So if it detects motion, and you say, ""Alexa, show me the front door."" You don't have 15 seconds or longer. To prove the point further... When the camera detects motion, it only records for 12 seconds. So Wyze expects most of an event to happen in a 12 second time span, but will not connect to alexa in those same 12 seconds to show me the door or driveway. My phone with the wyze app will connect in under five seconds and connects fine through my wifi so it's not a connectivity issue. If you're not wanting to connect to a smart home system, then these are great. If you are, unfortunately, these are not the cameras you want. For a smart home with alexa, etc - I wouldn't recommend. For a non smart home security use - I would recommend.",Unreliable with alexa / takes way to long to connect to Alexa.

It serves the need as a basic home camera but unfortunately fails in the integration with a larger smart home ecosystem. I use google home products, and this camera is supposed to integrate via IFTTT. When it decides to work, it's relatively easy to use (although not as intuitive as other products - you'll need a pretty decent understanding of technology to download all the necessary apps and download the functionality). However, most of the time, there are issues with the automated features. Importantly, I don't want/need the camera to be on while I am home. I have it set up so that it automatically turns on when it detects that I leave home, and turns back off when it detects that I return home. The problem is that the automation does not regularly work - in fact, I would say it only sporadically works.  I haven't been able to isolate why this is. My other products (such as Nest thermostat) is able to detect when I am home or away, so I am not sure why the camera can't. I'll keep using the cameras, but it's a pain to remember to manually turn on and off the cameras every time I step out of my home. I hope this is addressed in any future updates. In the meantime, if you are looking for an easy to use, automated camera that plays nicely with Google home, I would try one of the Nest products instead.",Lots of issues syncing with Google smart home

If your not familiar with the app and settings, it can take a little getting used to. But I promise once you get one... u will buy more. Buy SD cards as well so you can save locally and plan on extended power cables or extension cords. Also this will use up WiFi bandwidth but not to the point we have noticed, just be cognizant of that. Overall I am very pleased. I have had this device outside for several weeks with only this silicone (sold separately) wrap on the device. Mine is mounted on a fence post and in direct contact everything: Sun,Rain,Wind,Polin etc. still not one issue. I have wiped the lense with a microfiber one time haha. Be patient with fine tuning the detections settings. Do not add other users until you have the detection notifications dialed in. Or they eventually just disable them. Use the Rules in the app and make timers for different setting to be enabled or disabled. You can set them based on each individual camera>enabled/disabled>AllDay/Set Time>Settings> and beyond.

I don't like how the cameras motion system makes it randomly move around but you can just take your finger and move the focus back where you want it. It did scare our 3 year old at first because it sounds like a Transformer when it randomly moves but now she's over it and doesn't seem to notice.

I would suggest you look at other options if this is what you want to do with it. Here are the issues: * Night vision - This works by shining an IR light, this light gets reflected off glass. So if you keep it behind a window, all you'll see at night is the glare of the IR light. This makes it absolutely useless. Inside a room, without glass in the way however, it works. * Software and app - This is the worst part of the product. The app refuses to connect to the camera all the time. Firmware updates never complete correctly. requiring a reboot of the phone/app/camera etc. Livestream is a chore to connect as well many times. It blames my wireless network and I don't buy it, every other device at home works flawlessly. I am attaching a screenshot of the issue at it does not connect to the camera.

Then I tried to access the camera from my Amazon Show 2nd generation. The setup went fine in the Alexa app, it recognized the camera, but it could never connect to the camera. I followed all the troubleshooting support info to no avail. With all these issues, I had to give up and return the unit. I also saw that folks were having issues with accessing the camera remotely (where you were not on the local WiFi). Apparently, they were having some server infrastructure issues. I’m sure that will be fixed, but i just can’t spend any more time on the device to make all things work when other technologies just work out of the box.

I have purchased several products over the years and have been very impressed for the tremendous value they offer.  A couple of thing to keep in mind... 1) Wyze is a young company.  Their operating philosophy is to take off the shelf hardware and use their own proprietary software to achieve better results and features. 2) This Pan Cam (and all their cameras at the time I am writing) are designed & intended for indoor use.  Yes, they can be used outdoors but always keep in mind what the intended use is. I purchased this camera to replace a Yi model that would not connect to my wifi. This camera is indoors, I have two other two other Wyze cams (V2 model) outdoors. The IR lights are great for a room.  They can give you night vision for even a large room.  They will not be suitable for outside.  Outdoors the IR emitters will only illuminate the area in the immediate area.  Indoors , they will provide enough light to view the room. The PanCam has motion tracking... if it sees something moving the camera will stay focused on it and track it. Any motion detected will be recorded to Wyze for 12 seconds.  There is a slot for a SD card if you want to record for longer. Wyze offers Complete Motion Capture.  This is an additional service ($1.49/month) that will record all motion to the cloud service.

First off they look nice and seem to be made with good materials. Let me start by saying that I have a very strong 2.4/5 in my one BR apartment and a fast fiber optic connection and stream HDTV and game on internet with no issues so network is not the issue. App was loaded on Samsung Note 9 if you are wondering. It took many tries to get Pan to connect and I did the exact same thing every time using the 2.4 network and after the 9th try it finally connected...this took me an hour and there is really only one way to do it.  Once connected it took me another hour to get the push notifications to work. After that was done I installed the 32 Micro SD (Sandisk Extreme Pro) and started to explore the rest of the settings. HD picture / video quality was better than I expected. record and playback worked well. One thing I wanted to do was check the cameras ability to reconnect automatically after a power failure. I could not get this to work....the only thing that would make the camera work again was to delete it from the app and start over. The main reason I got this camera was to monitor my apartment while I am gone so this was am epic failure. I need a system that is reliable and smart enough to ""restart"" and these failed the test.

Pan/tilt works, but it's clunky. Motion tracking mostly works, but it's clunky (I'll admit, computer vision is such a small package is awesome). However, those latter 2 features felt so unpolished and while cool to say you have them, I wouldn't consider them ready for actual security monitoring. So the good video quality is the only thing worthwhile, which meant I should have opted for their cheaper non-pan version. A few other things: speaker and mic are not very good which means the 2-way talking isn't actually useful. There are several options for these cheap cameras (they look to be Xiaomi cameras) that probably use a similar/same sensor and on-board processing, some of which are cheaper. So I suppose what makes this one different is the Wyze app (phone apps only) and their ""eco-system"". This means installing yet another app (FYI, I think you can only view this on your phone and not on a computer) and creating a new account, then streaming your data through their servers. Their servers are also where they provide ""free"" 14-day cloud storage. App usage is intuitive including camera setup, but personally, I already give enough of my data away to these companies; web activities are one thing, but video streams of my home seems too much. I read a review on this camera about having a stranger randomly speaking through the camera in a different language, so there's seemingly a security risk with these as well. Personally, I will not be using this camera any longer. I had originally thought about using this as a baby monitor, but now see why that's ridiculous - don't use a wifi cam, use a baby monitor. Not only is there a security risk here, but the delay in streaming is sometimes 30 seconds and you'd have to have an app open at all times. Finally, the claim to working with google home - You can get connected to google home, but it's unreliable and frequently disconnects, yet another unpolished, useless feature. If you're just wanting something easy to set up that has good video and some features you can toy with for fun, this is fine.

Changing the Detection Zone, changing the sensitivity, turning things on and off, etc. 90% of what it records is moving shadows and things moving outside. Recording: Once it picks up something to record, it will record a 12 second clip. Be aware, that it then seems to pause for 5 minutes before it records another clip. The closest consecutive clips you will get are always paced 5-6 minutes apart. So if you're looking for people moving or alike, you'll miss a lot in that gap.

Our living room/kitchen is approximately 35ft x 25ft. Our Foscam R4, in very dark conditions, could see everything without issue. This allowed us to use one camera to monitor the entire area. The Wyze camera hardly illumiates the coffee table 4 feet from the camera. Given the poor conditions, I don't believe having more Wyze cameras would be a solution. I don't understand how these cameras could be useful in dark conditions. Had the camera's night vision been around 15 feet, I would understand, but this is unusable for night time situations. Unfortunately, night time is when cameras are the most needed. Other features on this camera are incredible for the price. The app is intuitive and does a wonderful job of differentiating human movement from any other. We have 2 cats and it has yet to falsely identify after months of use. My favorite feature is the recording to the card and being able to view from the card remotely. All features are accessible and changeable from the app. This is leaps and bounds ahead of Foscam which requires some settings to be changed via a PC. I am bummed that the night vision is so poor.

It will recognize the SD card when you first put it in it will even record but then after a few days will say that there is no card in camera and the only way to reinsert the card is to take it out and put it back in after that everything it recorded before you doing that is now a erased so there's no way to access what it's recorded. I thought maybe it was the SD card I used then I thought well let me let the camera format it properly and its own way but I've been using these for 3 months and every few days it says there is no SD card in camera and I have to restart it reformat the card and start it fresh so yeah it works for 2 days but then all those two days worth of video if you did not look at them within those two days it's gone it's completely erased. So please don't waiste your money. I was gonna buy 4 more but wanted to make sure it wasn't the camera before I did.  Nope it's the camera. Could be the software  or firmware on camera? But so far same problem every three days.",Update. They have updated the software and it's working pretty great now!

I have a 200mbs wifi connection (supposedly, not always) and my current wifi camera system is a little older and tends to draw a great deal from my bandwidth making transmission slower.  I bought several of these cameras to see where I might want to use them in and around my home.  I adore them!  They allow me to set up the area to be scanned (it will go 360 degrees) and doesn't move unless it senses motion or sound.  I immediately get a notification which is great!  I work a distance from my home and I keep my cameras up on my work computer all day.  My first intention was to install this in my dog room so I could watch them throughout the day and communicate with them if they were doing something naughty.  My voice sort of freaks them out as they can't see or smell me so I limit my talking.  The motor on the panning camera is rather noisy and if used solely for security, I think it would need to have the microphone moved so it's not picking up the motor right away and to have the panning capability quieter in the motor. I like these and the stationary cubes  so much I ordered 5 more.",Love it!!  My only suggestion is to quiet the panning motor

Easy to install and connect to internet. 2. Good picture quality. 3. Lots of settings and features. 4. The manual panning settings work very well. 5. Good build quality 6. Good sensitivity and accurate event alerts. 7. Quick learning curve with app. 8. Stays connected to wifi once the app properly loads. 9. The live stream runs flawlessly once connected. Things I didn't like. 1. There is a 5 minute cool down period after an alert which means the camera will not record or alert again for 5 minute. 2. Having some storage issues with alerts and events. 3. Having some loading issues with the live streaming but once loaded is good. 4. The night vision is not powerful enough past about 20ft + or - 5. Occasionally a light or some other object will erroneously set off an alert when in  the night vision mode. The 5 minute cool down period is a deal breaker and renders this otherwise good camera almost worthless.,The 5 minute cool down is a deal breaker

Overall, it’s a good little camera but it does have a couple of issues. Here’s a list of my Pros & Cons. Pros: • Setup was fairly straight forward • Great picture quality (except when there's backlight). Night vision is good too. • The speaker quality is good, but not great. The person needs to be fairly close to the camera for a conversation. • Supports a 32GB MicroSD card for playback (it would be nice if it officially supported larger) • Playback of SD card recordings works well • Reconnects to Wifi after power outage without issues • Motion detection works fine • Notifications to my Android phone work fine • One really nice feature that I like is the Alexa support. If I’m watching TV on my Firestick, and I hear the Wyze notification sound on my cell phone from across the room, I don’t have to get up and it. I’m able to say ""show me the condo cam"" on the Firestick and the app with the camera image immediately opens up automatically on the 50” TV screen (i.e. I don’t have to manually exit what I’m watching, find the Wyze app, open it up, etc…). • Another bonus is the sound notification (i.e. smoke/CO2 /water sensor alarm). If an alarm ever sounds, the camera issues a notification to the phone. In the cons below, you’ll see that I rate the microphone as being terrible, but it was good enough to alert me to the (loud) noise coming from outside when workers were redoing the balcony cement with jack hammers. So even with the poor mic, I’m pretty sure that it will pick up a loud smoke alarm. Cons: • Right out of the box, the 1st camera I ordered was defective (the microphone did not work at all). Amazon replaced it no problem. • The biggest disappointment with this camera is the terrible microphone. Even with the 2nd camera, the microphone is extremely poor. During a conversation, in order to hear the person they have to be right beside the camera, speak loudly, the phone has to be by your ear, and then it’s still faint. I am not able to look at the image on the phone and have a conversation with the person at the same time. And this is with the phone’s volume turned all the way up. Another example is that the camera is about 5 feet away from a dehumidifier (which is fairly noisy in a quiet empty condo unit). I cannot hear any sound AT ALL from the camera. Yet I have a second camera (a Zmodo brand) 20 feet away at the other end of the room which picks up the sound fine. • Only supports 2.4Ghz network (time to support 5ghz Wyze!) • There is no Windows/PC Interface. Geez guys, how difficult would it be to offer this? When I’m at home, I like to check on the condo when I’m working on my PC and I don’t carry my cell phone around on me. Over time I have purchased 4 different brands of cameras (Lorex, Zmodo, Reolink & now Wyze) and this is the only brand I have come across that doesn’t have a PC dashboard. I was however able to install an Android emulator on my laptop (MEmu) as an ugly work around, but it should not be necessary to have to do this). Overall I would have given this camera 3 stars because of the poor microphone and lack of Windows support. But because of the sound notifications and Alexa support, I’ve bumped it up to 4. Overall a pretty good camera for the money. Update May 17, 2020: I have to downgrade my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. In the last 2 months the camera has lost detection of the 32gb MicroSD card several times. I.e. one day I'll go in and check and it will say ""no SD card detected"". After restarting the camera, it's recognized again (for a while). And then at a later date, the same thing happens again. What makes it worse is that I only find this out when I occasionally go to review the video recordings and discover that I can't. A security camera needs to be reliable and this one falls short.","Overall, an OK camera (with issues though)"

The software is  poor, and will only run on an Android or Iphone device, so if you want to use your PC to view the camera, you're out of luck, not even a web interface, of course viewing the cam on your device drains the batttery like crazy, so its no use setting up a dedicated tablet to view the camera either.  Besides the software limitations, there is the connectivity issue, I have the camera literally right next to the wifi router, and I can mange to get about 0.7 FPS,  less than one new image per second, when the camera is actually connected...  before you assume its a wifi problem, my wifi works well for my other cameras and I can stream 4k netflix all day.  it seems getting a 1080p stream from the camera in the same network should work, even lowing the resolution on the camera doesn't help.

Often they are off on their own and require manual reset or lose connection and again require manual reset. Very difficult to go back and view a specific time period of a possible occurrence. The motion detection is great at detecting sunsets or trees blowing but will miss a car that parks in the driveway! If you turn up the sensitivity then you’ll get notifications every 2 mins. Turn it down and it misses everything. Frustrating. The night vision sucks. Good luck ever detecting a would be perp on night vision! These are high quality baby monitors, and possibly very low quality security. They are handy and cheap, but with just a hint more effort from Wyze they could possibly be usable.

I have contacted support and if the issue is resolved I will edit this review. My search in the forums leads me to a firmware update issue. UPDATE: I got a second one and did a comparison. The second one (same firmware and settings) was better but not by a lot. I guess the Cam Pan is not as sensitive to sound as the CamV2. That one is really easy to set off a notification. It picks up by ice maker dumping ice and the phone ringing while set on 50% .  The Cam Pan does not react to this. It requires a sharp loud noise as far as I can tell from testing 2 of them. UPDATE 2. A recent firmware update on 7/28/20 has not fixed this issue. I also tried the IR at night with a V2 and the V2 provides better IR than the pan. Final update. After not hearing back from Wyze on a 'ticket"" I submitted, I am returning the item. I am keeping the bulbs , sensors and the two V2 cameras and I plan on buying at least one more v2 but until the above issues are addressed I am staying away from the pan cam.",Relatively Poor Sound Detection and IR lighting

They only work with 2.4Ghz wifi, which is common. I have many 2.4Ghz-only devices in my home which work perfectly with my Google Wifi mesh system. Google Wifi only broadcasts 1 SSID for both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, and there's no setting to change that. These cameras would not connect to my Google Wifi, always resulting in the blue/yellow flashing light and the audible ""Could not connect to local network"" message. I researched and found a workaround of disabling primary wifi, creating a 2.4Ghz hotspot with the same SSID/password, connecting the cameras to that, then disabling hotspot and re-enabling primary Google Wifi; but, the cameras would still not connect to Google Wifi after that I tried that process with a hotspot on multiple Android/iOS devices.

That being said...This product is absolutely amazing!!! Seriously, if you were on the fence about purchasing this product, please read my full review because I sincerely pride myself on giving true unbiased reviews.  knowing that as a Amazon shopper myself, I rely heavily on the reviews of others. Originally I wasn't going to get this awesome product because of some low starred reviews, but I was in a rush to get a camera as I was going to Las Vegas and had someone staying in my home as well as just wanting to feel secure that my home office would not be tampered with. I GAVE THE WYZE CAM PAN 5-STARS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: 1) AMAZON WAS ABLE TO DELIVER QUICKLY 2) THE WYZE WAS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE TO SET UP. 3) THE WYZE DID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND WORKED LIKE A CHARM! 100% 4) THE RIDICULOUSLY GREAT PRICE! Just in case  you need more here is more to save you from the fear I had before finally just trusting and making the purchase.  I'm not putting down anyone's opinion or experience, but I struggled with my discussion un-necessarily because of reading some reviews. This particular WYZE  can rotate, has voice, CONNECT WITH ALEXA : ), Night vision, and more. While away in another state, I was able to totally check in and view the the entire living area that included the front door liv rm, kitchen, and back door, all because of the pan feature which I was able to control from my phone. Honestly this is a no brainier.  Of course it does rely on wi-fi and is not hard wired, but I didn't want wired anyway. All you need is: The WYZE Cam, a phone or tablet, WiFi and about 5-10 mins to set up. I watched a YouTube video and was amazed at how quick and simple it was to actually start using it. Don't fret like I did, do yourself the favor and get it...It's a great product and not just for the price, but also because it works as described. Something rare now a days. Thanks for reading my review : ) ps: Ill upload some video and pics at a later time.",Absolutely Amazing!!!

Te device I receive does not track consistently and if you move too quickly it will lose track and then focus on something that you never added to the field (pan scan settings). If you move unnaturally slowly it will track but you sort of but then eventually loses track of the motion and goes back to some position where it will not experience any motion.  When there is no motion the camera focuses on a part of the room where there would be no motion to track and I have reset position on the device several times to no avail. I may have received a bad camera or its abilities were exaggerated. Update: 9/10/20 with some frustration I have learned quite a lot about this camera. I recall originally being impressed with the description presented  by Wyse. Unfortunately not much is true. This camera fails to track anything consistently and easily loses track of movement and turns to a position where it can no longer track anything... like toward a wall. I have set all parameters correctly in settings and limited detection zones and still spins out of range where it can't detect.,Does not follow motion

Then the company offered person detection which was a nice add-on feature BUT after a few months they then announced that they made some changes to the business and would start charging for the upgraded level and person detection by subscription. However, they said, that since they originally said it would always be free to early purchasers, they offered us an option to continue people detection but not have any recording but asked us to pay what we felt it was worth. I didn't find it to be great, so I subscribed without paying (which they offered as an option). Anyway, that said, the person detection is really not very reliable; sometimes it does send me notifications and sometimes it doesn't. I am so happy that I did not pay to subscribe! It is a nice little cam, but not worth what they are asking; too many small glitches in the app and not much support. Support does  answer my emails, true, but I feel like they dance around the problem and don't really fix the problems (my person detection wound up working on one camera but not the others).

I bought 2.  First the app is clumsy and not PC usable. The app will not even auto detect your wi-fi network. I've NEVER seen a set-up where I had to manually type in the SSID. Then if camera says ""setup complete"" the app still says connecting and times out. I found after camera says ""setup complete"" you close the app using your phone's close apps program. Then when re-opening, camera is connected. Really that needs work. I updated their firmwares and next after that oddness. I find that motion sense is DEAD on both cameras, absolutely no motion following at all, or even recognizing of motion. For kicks, I danced in front of it, and it was just a brick with a blue LED. I contacted support and received a robo e-mail that they will review my ""case"" and get back to me in 3 days. That turn around is not what I call good support. I also aw these same issue all over the forum, and the ""answer""  was to manually re-add the last firmware, but of course the link to that is not avail, and only the firmware older is a clickable link.

The picture quality is reasonable as long as it is not in motion and if you purchase an optional SD card, you can rewind the recording. Cons - The camera has lots of software issues.  Initially, it was slow to activate the image on my Wyze phone app.  Using Alexa was very inconsistent to the point that I usually had to ask her 3 times before she could connect.  Finally, after a Wyze hardware update, the system really suffered to the point that you could not turn the camera off through the app.  The result was always yielded the response... ""Operation Failed"".  The Wyze tech support is non-existent.  You put in a ticket and they send an automated message indicating a response time of 3 to 5 business days.  5 days later, you get a response telling you steps that you have already done (reboot, unplug, reset,).

This camera have given me some issues by chasing movement that didn’t exist and notifying me about it while in bed, forcing my to check it out. This is in part because I have motion tracking on, it picks up on something even though I have the sensitivity really pretty low, then it turns around and sees the light hitting the wall behind and chases that. Eventually it resets its self. Another issue I have with Wyze is the ‘cool down’ period where movement will not getting reported to you, but it does make you aware of something going on before that typically.

Needless to say, this takes awhile to process if you are a complete noob to smart home gadgets. Here's why I bought the Wyze Cam Pan. I have quite a lot of Alexa related devices. It was definitely tough to choose between Alexa Cloud Cam and Wyze Cam Pan. People are not fond of the Wyze app, but the same could be said for the Alexa Cloud Cam app. As for the price of 1 Alexa Cloud Cam, I could snatch 1 Wyze Cam Pan (this one), plus 1 Wyze Cam V2, and 1 Sense Starter Kit. Like if you do the math, Wyze wins. It really completes the whole collection and makes my home ""smarter"". You just can't beat the price for something that Wyze Pan can do without paying for a subscription to get your recordings stay on the cloud for more than 24 hours. Think about it for a sec, getting Alexa Cloud Cam is equal to paying for the basic subscription. You just can't micro-manage everything when you have other stuff that matter more. Your kids? Your work? Your ""me time"". What if you forget to save the record when someone breaks in? You only have 24 hours with the Alexa Cloud Cam. That's why I went with this guy. With everything in the kit, I automate a few rules to kick it up a notch when it comes to my apartment security. When my front door opened, the Wyze Cam Pan will send me a notification, along with a 12-second recording. When the Cam Pan detects motion/person, it'll send another 12-second recording. Literally, every motion is captured on cam. You can also talk to your phone app to reply through the cam. Have to yell out loud though as their 2-way audio is not so good. If you don't have any microSD, every recording will be sent on the cloud and stay there for 14 days at no additional charge. This right here is a big selling point for me as I mentioned above. No sub for 2 weeks recording on the cloud. Yahooo! The night vision is amazing. It works great in complete darkness, and you can still track the camera and see what's going on, or what the intruder looks like. At this age and time when break ins happen like meals, I think it's a wise decision to have an entry security system at home, even if you don't have kids or pets. I live alone and I work 9-11 hours a day, 6 days a week. So now I have that peace of mind that there won't be any break in any time soon. And when I'm home, I feel safe. Tips: I use the Pan Scan option, but you'd need to set up some waypoints. Do make waypoints overlapped a bit so they don't pan left and right too fast and lose focus. The pan covers about 120-140 degrees. I also set the cam movement to about 30% for the same reason above. By setting up this way, the motion tracking and tagging work much better. It'll detect and follows the person without turning too quickly, so you can see their faces more clearly.","Don't think about bad reviews, just buy it!"

They're easy to set up, connect, and use with a simply designed yet robust mobile app. During the day we can keep tabs on the inside of the house and at night and while we're on vacation we can move the cameras to monitor our porches and exterior entrances. The best part is that the cameras have both motion detection and an AI tech that can detect people specifically. No more random alerts from a tree branch moving outside the window when it's set to ""people detection"". This is far more sophisticated than what we can set for alerts with our Ring doorbell. Unfortunately we have been using these cameras for almost a year and the only thing our dog does is sleep, eat, and sleep some more. Very lackluster.

This is how i know it was not me or bad settings, it just decided what it wanted to do no matter where you set the pan. I'll have it pointed in one direction, pan setting off and when i check the camera an hour later, it's pointed up or down or just completely opposite of what i intended. Anyhow, i returned this. I ended up getting the cheaper version which i think works perfectly. Also the notifications came late 2 minutes late. You know how much damage a thief can do in two minutes? No thank you.",Hated It

Unfortunately, I should have probably read more into it. Setup was easy, for both the physical setup and the app, but from there, things got a little more involved.  During setup, a firmware update was recommended, so I did it.  Once everything was set up, the motion detection and notification did not work.  Upon further reading, I found the solution was a manual roll-back to the prior firmware version.  Ultimately it was not too big of a project, but between the time looking for a solution, putting firmware on a micro SD card, and then flashing said firmware, it's not something that should need to be done on a brand new product. Since rolling back the firmware, it has mainly worked as advertised.  I have played with the sensitivity settings, but I do not know how effective the adjustment really is.  I've had it set to below 50 and had it detect light from my upstairs bedroom TV (cam is downstairs), but at the same setting, I've walked right by it and not trigger the motion detecting or notification.  I've had the sensitivity set much higher, with the same results.  This leads me to wonder if there was an intruder, whether or not the pan cam would notify me. I ended up getting a fairly large micro SD card set to continuously record, so at worst, if someone breaks in, I can view through hours of recorded footage if/when the cam fails to notify me.  At the end of the day, I'm not sure whether I would purchase this again.  Some features are great, primarily the motion tracking and the notification ability, but it's so inconsistent it's hard to suggest this product.  Since I did purchase it, and spent the time getting it somewhat working, I'll probably stick with it and hope for some firmware improvements. TLDR: Currently (5/9) I do not think it is worth it for recording an intruder / break-in, but that could change with firmware updates.  If you want a cam to keep an eye on pets, and not for security purposes, then it is most definitely worth it.",Somewhat works when using prior firmware version.

Unfortunately Apple bought the company that developed the technology, and Wyze could no longer use it. They are developing their own in-house person detection which is constantly getting better and better, but not quite up to XNOR standards yet. Another downside is that the connection to the micro SD card is constantly lost, so that the recording function constantly fails. The app reports ""SD card is not available."" Because of where the camera is mounted, I have to remove the camera from its location to access the SD card slot and remove and reinsert it to get another few days or hours of recording to the micro SD. All the other functions work perfectly: The image quality is great especially considering the price, night vision works well, and the two-way audio is great for confusing the cat all the way from work or saying hi to one of the grand kids.","Was a Fantastic 5-Star Value, Now Just Very Good Value"

Full disclosure: I have a very fast internet connection (750+ up/download speeds), and a Google Wifi mesh (one per floor) which provides blazing wireless speeds. Negative: 1. Voice is very delayed 2. Tracking is noisy and erratic - seems to jump from an actual object/motion to other non-motion 'ghost objects' and back again - not sure why this is 3. Finding it hard to make this work with Google/IFTTT - might be my lack of knowledge, but ideally I want this device to turn itself on/off based on whether someone is home or based on issuing a Google command to start/stop monitoring when I leave or return home 4. When I turn it off and on again (in Wyze app), it sometimes reports an error (unable to connect), asking to try again - this is most concerning to me as I could not depend on this to reset itself in the event of any failure when I am away from home - yes, you can restart it remotely, but have seen reports that sometimes that is only possible if you disconnect/reconnect the power Positive: 1. Great picture, and clear recordings 2.  Fast panning 3. Excellent features for the price I will update this review in another week's time as I become more familiar with the advanced features and test it out while physically away from home (see hom much pet activity is picked up or not...)","Good value for the price, if you dont intend to use it for home security"

We bought this hoping to use it as a baby monitor, but I'm actually still using another actual baby monitor at the same time. I like: that it sends you alerts, that it works on wifi and can be accessed via an app on your phone, that you can share the video streaming with other accounts, that it's quiet, that you can turn the indicator light off. I dislike: that it only sends you an alert every 5 minutes. So if at minute 1 there is a noise, I will get a noise notification, but then I won't get notified for all the noises in between minutes 1-6. On the one hand, I get it, it's a free service. But this is why it does not work well as a baby monitor. Also, if you were going to use it as a baby monitor, you need to be a light sleeper, as the notification is just a phone notification. If you're prone to sleeping through text alerts, this is not the camera for you. But if you just need a camera to check on your house, your cat, or periodically check in on your kid, then this would work fine.",Good quality camera - iffy for a baby monitor

They *are* a lot more convenient to set up and use, which is cool if you're a normal person.  But I A/B-ed the picture quality with my *worst* IP cameras (e.g. SV3C A-series 4MP) and the cheap  ""real"" IP cams just blow them out of the water. Keep in mind:  Poor quality security cam footage is worthless because it can't be used to identify people.  1080P is a crap resolution for any sort of digital zoom.  Wyze cams might be OK if you're only using them indoors in small rooms - hence, near field of vision. For my own system, I will only install 4K IP cams or Dahua IVS Starlights these days w/ a VMS system: Milestone xProtect, Ivideon, Blue Iris, Shinobi, Zone Minder, etc. or a real NVR like Dahua or Hikvision (or OEM - there's a gazillion of them that are re-branded that are all just fine compared to Wyze).",Was disappointed

But I was won over by all the rave reviews. I'm gonna call it as I see it: this is an unreliable toy, not a real security camera. Pros: Good image quality Easy setup Simple design Lots of features Pan and Tilt at this price point? Amazing! Cons: Flaky hardware Poor motion detection Poor connectivity Poor alerts (probably due to poor connectivity) Details: I installed this in my office at work, for testing purposes. I'm the network admin, so I have control over our wifi and physical network. The camera was easy to setup, but has poor WiFi reception and connectivity. I have several other wifi devices operating in the same area, same office even, and none of them have connection problems. The Wyze Cam Pan drops the WiFi connection frequently. This adversely affects its ability to do its job, which I see as notifying me of motion in the camera's viewing area. Of course, it still records the events, but I don't find out about it until hours or sometimes days later. That's not very useful. Also, while it is having connection problems, I can't remotely view the camera. That's not very useful either. But wait, I can put a microSD card in the camera and have it record all of the time, so I don't miss anything. But that doesn't work all of the time either. When I first put the card in, the device wouldn't recognize the card, but it didn't let me know about that. It went a couple of weeks - not recording - before I went to pull a recording and found out there was nothing there. It took several reboots and reformatting the card before the camera would recognize the card and start recording to it. Even so, it was a pain to get it to start recording to the card. The settings just didn't seem to want to do as they were told. The last nail in the coffin of this camera as a motion detecting security notifier is that there is a several second delay between when the camera detects motion and starts recording the ""event"". For instance, when the night time cleaning folks clean my office, it triggers an event. But I can't see them because the camera misses them coming in the door of my office and doesn't start recording until they're already standing behind my desk (too close to the camera to see their faces) and the camera stops recording several seconds later rather than continuing to record the whole time the motion is going on. That's a double-fail in my book. So buyer beware: it's fun to play with, but if you actually need to secure anything with this camera, buy a ""real"" security cam.","Less than impressed. This is a toy, not a security camera."

Both the pan and the stationary. I've had several different app cameras and home security camera systems... And for the price with the features and video quality, these are hands down the best bang for the buck. I'm buying more to eventually replace my wired camera system. I just hope the manufacturer continues to improve the software. Pros: cheap, great day & night picture quality. App is very easy to use. Super simple to configure. Lots of features. Great detection notification, even with person identification. The 7 second detection clip sent to you is great Expandable memory. Panning and motion tracking are very useful. As is the ability to manually move the camera nearly 360 around the room. Cons: app only access; no website viewing. Very sensitive motion and sound detection even when turned down (had 12 motion notifications in a few hours because of a fly). The Pan Cam every so often resets the detection zone to default. Not a bad thing because it increases the detection area, but if your area is high traffic you'll get a lot of notifications. The mic/ speaker are only useful in small quiet rooms. Large areas with any background noise makes it impossible to distinguish what's being said. Plus the delay from send and receive, but I didn't buy for 2 way communication. The pan movement can be finicky, and not as precise as you'd like (for the money however it's not a true complaint at all). I wish: I wish the app would allow all the videos to stream at once. You have to click on each camera to see live feed. If you have good internet it's only an inconvenience of an extra click and a few seconds to load, but coming from streaming wired cameras it'd be a nice feature to add. Weatherproofing or some kind of IP rating would be fantastic. Two of my cameras are currently outside, under awnings, in aftermarket housings, and protected, and work flawlessly, but there's that uncertainty of failure at some point. Bottom line: I constantly recommend these cameras. Several of my friends have them set up and love them. Cheapest best,  most feature packed cameras on the market. Worth the $25-35 price all day in my opinion.",Best cheap cameras on the market

Pros: very easy to use and set up. Nice looking piece of machinery.  Lots of recording options. Cons: first off, it never said anything about how to name your wifi network and how having spaces in the name causes issues with setting up the camera.  Of course I then had to rename my network, then on top of that, reconnect all of my devices to my network which was frustrating.  Second: I never would have purchased it had I known it was contingent on paying for a service.  I thought it was just a cam connected to my wifi. Like I said, its a nice piece of machinery but if I'm going to pay for a service as well, I'm going to with something more substantial.","Hello bait, meet switch."

You can also tell your any echo with a video screen to see what the camera sees. If you are looking for an indoor camera. Youd be kinda insane to not pick this for 37 bucks.

Also, after it records, there is a ""cool down"" period before it will record again, so if there is motion/sound during the cool down period it will not record.

R.,"After owning two Wyze cams and learning more about the company, I decided to give this one a try. As soon as it got here I was a bit disappointed because it looked like it was re-packaged since it seems that things were not properly placed in the box and it was a bit bloated. However, I could not find any indication that it was used of refurbished so I carried on with excitement. Getting it to sync with my app and wifi was as easy as the Wyze cams, which means - very easy... however, navigating the options of this one was a bit a mess. Even now, after having the camera for a few weeks, if I want to change the zones that it scans, I cannot find it until I look at all the different settings menus. Yet, something like that would not prevent me from enjoying my new toy, so setup if over and now let it do its thing. It does its thing, but there is a big issue, it lets you know that it is doing its thing. The motor is very noisy, to the point that if you sit in the same room as the camera, it is very annoying and noticeable background noise. At this point, it became useless for me to use in the house or even in the patio, and it found its way to the garage. Do I need a pan cam in the garage? no, not really, but it is the only place the noise will not bother anyone :( I was really hoping to get some more of these for the other locations, but know it seems that the collective noise will be sufficient to discourage any burglar wannabe even before they will come in range of the camera. Another issue is the motion tracking, it is useless in close range and actually, cause the camera to miss what is going on. If the object is close, the camera will frantically try to follow something making the video feed useless. Last recommendation to the app. If I control the camera manually, pause the pan scan and resume it after 10-15 seconds. I found myself fighting for control with the pan scan. Still a very exciting company with very useful products, but this one needs to be as quiet as a security camera...",Good camera for a great price but very noisy and software can be better

The app works great, no monitoring service to pay, it alerts my phone and I decide if its a threat to call 911 about or if it is something else.  We use two as baby monitors, it will alert when it detects sound or movement.  Its motion is based on pixel changes, so turning on a light will set it off.  I shared the cameras with my wife, and now she can use her phone as a monitor/controller as well as to arm and disarm.  You can create shortcuts for anything you want.  We have  Away, Home, Bedtime, Baby Down,  Baby Up, Playroom On,  Playroom Off shortcuts, each one turns the phone alerts on/off for any combination of devices.  I only wish I could set the time between event triggers/notifications, the 2 year old likes to lie in bed and play for a little while at nap time, so I get an alert on my phone every 2-3 minutes until she falls asleep.  It would be nice to adjust that to 5 or 10 minutes, or any variable to meet your specific needs.",Works Great!

I was swayed by the low price but I didn’t expect the camera to be that good. Yeah, it takes forever connecting to the internet sometimes if the connection is lost and has the longest reboot ever, I feel. Or maybe I’m just impatient. Either way, I can get over those minor details. I really just use this to check on my cat when I’m away for many hours during the day. The pictures are crisp and the night vision is excellent. I also love that I can talk to her through the camera. For this price that can’t be beat. I don’t really need the camera for security purposes (like to put outside my living area and such). So for what I use it, it is excellent. I will update this if anything changes.",Bought this to check on my cat

Goal with the outdoor cam was to motion sense for any animal activity and trigger our irrigation through IFFFT in the event of deer activity for instance. Pros : they're super cheap, very easy to get online, and picture quality is surprisingly good. App is nice and simple / easy to use as well. Cons (for our application) : outdoors the motion detection triggers for every bug that flies in front of the camera. there were hundreds of triggers within the first few hours and no way to eliminate. so night vision motion detect outside is totally unusable. IFFFT integration is also buggy, often requiring you to kill the service connection and rebuild applets, and does not always work as support suggests. There is no phone support (goes to VM). Email support is slow and poor. They either don't fully read the specifics of inquiry and provide an incomplete or irrelevant answer or don't seem to fully know their product. I bought a motion sense kit to try and work around the issues with the camera motion sensor. Now bugs don't set it off but every flutter of a planting leaf does, with no ability to adjust sensitivity. There is also no way to set detection time windows with the dedicated motion sensor as on the cameras. And contrary to what support suggests, IFFFT integration with the sense motion sensor doesnt seem to be available/working. Overall disappointing for our needs. Could be great for the price especially, but needs refinement and better support. For indoor use only as a simple live view camera, it's a good option.",Lots of potential but issues and poor support

The App works very well, it's easy to use, and it saves video from motion sensing activitvies with no monthly subscriptions or SD Cards. I installed an SD card anyway so all recent video would be saved and i can easily replay any saved video from the App. I used to be a videographer so i'm sensitive to image quality, once again this surpassed my expectations. It records sounds well, and i'm able to speak through the App and it has a built in speaker to broadcast my voice. This has kept my kids and pets in check :) .

Although we did want to find a battery powered one, those were either too expensive (Arlo) Or did not have great reviews or did not have great reviews (Blink). The Wyze Camera seem to generate a lot of positive reviews, and have won awards in consumer magazines (Pc Consumer magazine 2019). At under $40 per camera, it is also one of the most affordable options out there. We have only use it for about a month, but do find that the picture quality is pretty superb, including night vision. The only downside is potentially the microphone, as our cameras which are mounted on the ceiling do not pick up the sound as well. I suspect this may be the case for any camera that is mounted so high, however if this were better than this would be the ideal wired camera.",Excellent indoor camera!

Turns out, it times out after 10 min on the Echo and you have to constantly ask Alexa to show you the bedroom to reopen the app... the camera was much better on the actual app. It didn’t time out on there, but 2 out of 10 times, the camera wouldn’t connect when I would open the app. To fix this, I would have to force close the app and open it again, and then “turn off” the camera... and then turn it back on! Super annoying. Well... after 5 months of use, it finally gave out. The camera wouldn’t connect to the app, no matter how many times I force closed the app or disconnected the camera. I contacted customer support for this issue on 9/1 and they told me they would send me a replacement right away! Awesome! But then two weeks go by and the tracking number they sent me has zero updates. Two weeks later, I call CC again and they say “hmmm that’s very strange. We will go ahead and send ANOTHER replacement”.... it has now been ANOTHER two weeks (I’m writing this on 9/30) and I STILL DO NOT HAVE A REPLACEMENT CAMERA. It has been an entire month. They said that because they’ve already sent out two replacements, they have to wait for one to hopefully arrive “soon”... even though I’ve been waiting literally for the entirety of September lol.

Kays,"Thought these would be great, but they have SO MANY BUGS.  They only work about half the time.  The pan feature doesn't work right,at all.  You tell the camera to pan right one click, and it ends up going all the way to the right or all the way to the left.  And it is down more than it is up and working.  We installed these on a remote cabin so we could keep an eye on things when we were not there, and it kept shutting off, or had bad quality video.  Had to drive back out there from time to time just to get the cameras up and running again.  Ended up buying more expensive cameras, and they are SO MUCH more reliable.  Look at the Q&A on the product website.  There are tons of problems with these.  Unless you like to spend hours and hours of re-booting, resetting to factory default, re-setting up your cameras and constantly tinkering to get them to work, BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  I am tired of trying to make technology work like it is supposed to.  These only have one job, remote access of video, and they are not reliable!",Don't waste your money!  Not worth the effort.

On *Ease* of Use: Power Supply + Mobile App + WiFi Connection = Good to Go! On Setup: You would have to try to make this difficult and even then it would still be a no brainer. PS Bonus Points if you have the non-Pan Cam and you like magnets or simply appreciate how completely 'under-rated perfect' magnets are for lots of things in general (maybe I took some creative liberty in applying my own neodymium discs where I felt could work, or... see next). On Durability: It stands to reason stuff just isn't made to last nowadays or has been designed obselesant. Well, I also like to ""Putz"" around with things, and I'm not always the most graceful or delicate either. That said, despite many drops, tumbles, and knocks that should never have happened, all my Wyze Cams seem unaffected, and I was pretty sure I should have shattered this one the last time I drop-kicked it off of the balcony by mistake, oops! It landed in a planter 3 floors below, but it was completely fine, surprisingly, though I strongly discourage testing durability. Wyze Cam App is legit - I mean, it is super user-friendly, has a clean interface, and anything you might not know, is very easy for anyone to figure out without much effort. Of course, the company probably has customer support that is superior to any other brands, from what I hear, of course I wouldn't know from experience because I've never needed it (sorry about that one time I thought something was wrong, but it was just me, and/or another tech gadget, so yeah, I was wrong Wyze!). On VALUE: Try finding better and you'll find you're just wasting your time. I won't go over details with specs, they're listed. And you can pay 3 to 10 times as much for the same features or even fewer features. Simply put, there is no better overall value. Side Note: As someone who regularly attends baby showers (proud Guncle to so many and counting), Wyze Cams across the board are substantially WAY better for baby-monitoring than most run-of-the-mill ""baby-brand"" cameras, which, you should know typically cost much, much more and usually have less to offer. Wyze is what's up. Not going to brag, hut I pretty much started the entire (unofficial) Wyze Cam Nursery division when I decked-out one of these with baby-themed animal character pizzazz. Just saying, like, I probably, sort of, maybe, *definitely* started that trend. #supercute",No. 1; No Brainer

Great communication with customers via forum. Still working great! Alexa integration could be better. All you can do from Alexa is view the feed, no controls. Update 5/8/19 Still very reliable. The company Updates their products in as regular basis. The camera and the Wyze company continue to impress! Update 3/16/19 The camera has been extremely reliable since my last update,  with no dropped signals that I have noticed. It faithfully reports when my daughter comes home from work at night. I still find it amazing that such a useful item (and service) costs so little! Update 2/13/19 There have been a lot few dropped signals since the lad software update. The camera has been working well. Great integration with Alexa would be nice, as right now all you can do with Alexa is view what the camera is seeing; there is no control of the camera except with the app. Update 1/26/19 Still working well. Have had trouble formatting the SD card while in the camera, will try to use my laptop instead to see if that works. Have had issues with dropped signals at times, But that may be due in part to a lousy Wi-Fi provider (at one point WYZE did note they were having issues, but quickly fixed it. Don't forget to check out  their forum).  I haven't had any issues with sensitivity or alerts. Even when I couldn't connect to the camera thru the app I was still getting alerts. Original post: This product is amazing! It was easy to set up, and has been operating for a week now without any issues., i gave it just 3 stars for sound and video quality, but that really isn't fair. Its a security camera, it was never intended to be used in a studio. I am often away from home during the week. My kids keep an eye on things when I am gone, but they obviously can't be there all of the time. Now, for just a few bucks, I can check my house from anywhere at any time. And if anyone enters the house, or if the smoke detector goes off, I receive a text immediately, giving me a chance to call emergency services. I can even take a picture or a video on my phone (in addition to the continuous video on the memory, and the free cloud storage from the Wyze company). And I can use the audio functions to chat with my kids when they drop in to feed the fish.",Great for peace of mind

Contacted customer service, sent my activity log and the video, and was basically told that the engineering team is looking in to it and hope to have a fix in a future update?!?  Ummmm how long will that be? And no guarantee it will be correctable!  Think I’ll likely send these back.

Having been using mine for over 2 years and its been working great.  I only bought one and will maybe by another if Wyze doesn't start charging for person detection. Pros: reliable doesn't need to be reset and when i pull it up in app i can move camera around and see entire garage. When it picks up person or dog it will follow the person around garage. Con: picture is sometimes jerky when its following a person because its trying to keep it in the center of the frame and it will sometimes come back if it overshot the motion. All together great camera for $37 and I like that it will stay facing the entrances to the garage unless motion is detected and will follow until they leave and will go back to my set location.

Support was quick, tried several things but in the end returned both the 32GB card and camera not knowing if it was the camera or card although all things pointed to the camera. Replacement arrive in a day, no kidding. I was not optimistic with it arriving in a soft package and the case being split from rough handling (see the pic). On setup, I had the same glitch and camera not recognizing the card or being able to format it. I formatted it in my PC and tried something a little different than the on line support suggested. I reset the camera and restarted it with the freshly formatted card in it BEFORE the initial setup so the card was installed first, not after the WIFI setup. Success! I carefully powered it down through the app instead of just unplugging it and it seems OK for the last hour or so. I haven't tested it recovering from a power failure yet. As noted in a couple of other reviews, the motion tracking is a little buggy and they really need to support 5Ghz WIFI.","A nice toy, but still a toy"

It sucks for that use. 1) it pans 360 left or right, sure, but the up or down angles suck, so unless you mount it sideways (which mounting requires a separate kit, can't just hang it on the wall like most), you have to basically have it relatively close to the level you want to view. I wanted to sit mine on top of an armoire and have it look down into the room so I could see into his bassinet, but it couldn't look down far enough without me propping something under the base, which made it unstable. I also, incorrectly, thought it would operate like bluetooth, and that it would just need to be paired with my phone and then it would connect to my phone directly. Instead, it had to go through your WiFi, so if your internet goes out it's worthless. That also means if your phone isn't connected to your WiFi you can't connect to it at all. So if someone is babysitting my child and I want to check in while I'm out, I can't. I thought there would be some benefit to being able to use it through the internet. I thought at least I'll be about to check from my phone, and I can through the app, but if I want to use my phone for anything else other than leaving the video steam up, it will disconnect from the live feed and you have to manually come back to check it, instead of being able to listen to it like a regular monitor. There's also no way to adjust the volume of the video or the camera. I tried using the 'talk through the camer' feature, and whispered into it for my husband, who was rocking the baby to sleep. I could hear it from the living room, down the hall, through a closed door. I also can't have to turn the volume up all the way on my phone to barely be able to hear my son cry. My son is about 8 feet from the camera. You can't turn the volume sensitivity up or down on the camera at all, so I can't hear him unless he's wailing, in which case I can probably already hear him myself. I would return it, but I stupidly threw away the box and packaging as soon as I opened it, because I was confident I would love it, a it was recommended to me by a fellow parent. It also took me several attempts to connect it to my internet the first time. It is a simple process, but it just wouldn't connect. Also, it doesn't support 5G, so you have to connect it to a 2.4 band. Also, now after a couple weeks I'm getting an error code 90, and says it isn't connected. There's no way to re-sync it besides unplugging it and hoping that fixes it, which it hasn't for me so far. Google 'Wyze error code 90', to read tons of other people frustrated with the same thing, and no real solutions, other than, ""eventually it should come back."" It has great picture quality, and the night vision is fantastic, and it was priced nicely, and the app is simple to use. If it could be viewed from my phone while I was out and about I'd say it would make a great security camera, but like I said, you can't view the live stream from another WiFi. It will send you a push notification if you want and a short clip of the recording if it detects motion or sound, which is ok as a security feature. I'd still prefer a live stream. Not really sure what this camera would be good for, honestly.",Not for use as a baby monitor.

It has pretty good resolution and image quality, and decent motion capacity. The night vision works great too. The camera’s firmware and software to use the camera is... alright. Firstly, the way the firmware handles motion of the camera is lousy. When the camera is tracking motion mode, the camera only move in increments for whatever reason, and when moving in increments sometimes the motion is lost because the camera is so jerky when moving. Also why can’t you change the duration of the waypoints when in pan scan mode? Also why can’t shared users view SD card footage? Shouldn’t I be the one to decide that? I don’t know, the software just seems like it’s lacking features that just make sense. If I have a personal camera, I want to be able to personalize how it behaves. On top of all that the app tries to get you to pay more for longer motion captures. If you have an SD card in the camera, the 12 second limit doesn’t matter. I’m not giving any money to a sub-par app. Overall it does it’s job pretty well and it’s certainly a good value still. I recommend it, but I hope the software gets better.","Excellent camera, OK software."

It's sooo much better than the other brand I purchased.  I was so disappointed with a different brand's cam performance, (that was 4x more costly!); their tech support just made excuses and blamed my wifi connectivity, so I decided to give Wyze a try. I will definitely purchase more of these. Download of the Wyze app was quick; has good control options and functions.  Wyze cam pan has quick record response, no lag,  immediate starts recording much quicker and clearer than my ring cam. Live stream and playback are excellent, picking up voice and the tv from 15 feet away.  Included separate push notification alarm settings for CO and smoke detection alarms; event recording storage on your purchased SD card as well as cloud storage, separate detection settings for motion and voice (better than other brand's ""zone"" detection setting); rotate image and take a still photo of what you are watching; freeze a specific event so it is not accidently recorded over.  The cam picked up voice from 20 feet away and good clear picture quality during daylight. I have not yet tried  full dark/nighttime detection recording to view quality; but with small over the counter kitchen light on, 20 feet from camera, live stream viewing seemed fine. You need to plan to use internet search to find numerous, excellent utube videos for step by step install and trouble shooting help. There is no printed instructions included in the packaging, so I took 1 star off my review for that. I did not have to call or contact Wyze tech support as I was successful in setting up the camera using utube video help.",Very satisfied.

I also have a normal Wyze camera that, while a problem to connect to through the app, works most of the time. I am giving it 2 starts because when it works it looks great.

"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2019,MikenzCO,"I started out with the basic Wyze cam and was so impressed by what I received that we picked up several more. Then the cam version cam out and picked up that too. We currently have eight Wyze cams different versions throughout our household. Price, quality, customer support and ease of use is why we have stuck with Wyze products and will for the foreseeable future. The Good – Price, quality, features Customer support Free storage No fees Up to 32 GB local storage Frequent updates Recording quality The Not So Good -  Limited to a maximum micro SD card size 32 GB At dawn and dusk the ‘auto’ setting for light can jump back and forth for a few minutes between IR and day camera modes The cam motor can be a bit on the noisy side if nearby The biggest difference between the original Wyze cam and the Pan version is of course movement. You don’t get a full 360 degrees but close enough. All the settings you would find on more expensive setups you get with this including time lapse. The motion sensing can be on or off. You can set sensitivity and detection areas. Notifications work all the time without fail. When triggered the clip is sent to your phone no matter where you are. The IR video is easy to see. You can set it to pan scan the full range or just a set area. The clarity of the images is good enough that you can make use of the zoom function and still be able to see things well. Unlike other systems there are never any fees after purchase for saving your recordings. I have SD cards in all of ours (not needed just an option). That way I record 24/7 as opposed to shorter video clips when activated. After about five days it will start to overwrite the oldest recordings (not saved). FYI cards should be formatted exfat not ntfs. The system worked great with google to start and now you can even use Alexa devices like the show to view live streamed. I have had great success with Wyze to date twice I encountered hiccups but it all was easily worked out. Thanks in large part to one of the best customer support teams I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Polite, friendly, U.S. based, they know their products and don't just read from a script and best of all they actually listen to what you have to say. Better still if you need to contact them after all is said and done you'll be sent an email asking how your support went? not typical as you then get to choose how to reward the support person w/gift cards, coffee, movie tix. A company that treats its employees well, what goes around comes around and it works! All said we got started with Wyze products to keep track of family. To keep an eye on both kids and our mom who is older and falls at times. These products enable us to check in and make sure everyone and everything is where it should be and okay. Yes it is great to keep tabs on garbage pickup or deliveries but there is so much more. I still worry when we have to leave our mother alone for short periods of time but being able to take a quick look around and know all is okay? The peace of mind, I cannot say enough good on that aspect. There are fun bits too. Like setting up slow motion for something like a big snow? Watching it pile up or melt down? Just one example. Or putting out food for the critters, squirrels, rabbits, and birds then watching them all eat together cafeteria style, something only the Wyze cam caught. While not fun it also came in handy last year. We got hit with a bad very localized hail storm. The cams had been running and caught it all. I was able to take the vid email to our agent as further proof. The Wyze Pan is just a more versatile version of their great original Wyze Cam version. There aren’t many products out there that give you so much value for the dollar IMHO. Plus getting it all backed with fantastic U.S. based customer support. I have recommended these to family and friends alike for all the reasons mentioned.","Updated 12/2019 Fantastic product, helps keep tabs on family too"

It gives you great tilt pan ability and the picture quality is 1080p. The person tracking on it work better than some expensive brands. I was a bit skeptical about them at first but after getting one and seeing what it could do I wished I had these years ago for my home security system. They are not exactly waterproof but there are many products on Amazon to make them usable outside. I have gotten feedback from many that have used them outside without any issues for a year now. I have had one outside for a few months and still working strong. For an inexpensive home security camera these are the best and work with many  camera applications like Blue Iris, MotionEye, etc.",Just WOW!! Love Wyze Cameras

I have tried several wifi cams over the past decade and this by far has the fastest pan & tilt movement.  I also like the audio, it’s a open two way like a phone call vs a press to talk walkie-talkie design. The app has all the features you’d expect including control over night vision and 180° Picture flip. You have Full resolution control, 320p SD and 1080 hd. There’s lots of accessories available including silicone sleeves for outdoor placement. An Alexa skill is available, I’ve tried it with my echo show and show “5” It works perfectly with good audio. The frame rate is extremely smooth, i’d compare it to the Amazon Cloud Cam For picture quality & smoothness. “Disclaimer” I have gigabit fiber optic internet & a nighthawk triband router so even on 2.4g wifi my speeds are 250mbs+ with 10ms latency.  I’m so impressed that I will be replacing all cameras that fail in the future with wyze.",FAST & SMOOTH

These are the first ones that are super easy to set up, and they perform well, although with some flaws. They can be installed at more or less any angle needed, including upside down (without the image being upside down). Pan speed is good. Images are very clear. Captured video is streamed to the company's site in real time (secured to your account) from which you can view them easily from the app you put on your phone. I would rather I didn't have to depend on that and could directly access the cameras since any company can eventually go out of business, but it works. I get a lot of notifications of movement or sound that do not have any accompanying saved video. I don't know why that is, and if my security threats were at a higher level, that would be a disqualification. I get false alarms pretty often, mostly due to the movement of sunlight in the areas being watched, but they are understandable given the necessary technical limitations of the device type, and no worse than similar products.","Far better than most, but still lacking in some regards"

I have 2 Wyze indoor cams but I use them outside. They did fine during the winter and nothing is wrong, but I live at the back of a cul-de-sac and I have wanted a pan for a while. I got it installed and I regret not doing it sooner. Motion tracking is great and picks up neighbors, hummingbirds at the feeder, people walking away from the garage, and so on. Being able to pan across the back of the cul-de-sac this way is awesome. It gives a better view than the cam at the other corner of my garage. Photos and video are just as clear as the other Wyze, if not just a tad more clear. I did have to buy a 4rd party mount but it worked perfect. I use an SD card in each of my cams so that I can continuously record. This is helpful for playback and going back several days if need be.

"Wyze Cam Pan 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Indoor Smart Home Camera with Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Works with Alexa & the Google Assistant, White - WYZECP1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Mar 2019,ColoDad,"For the approximately $40 I paid, these are the best pan and tilt motion Sensing security cameras out there at that price point In my opinion! I was surprised at the features included and that was the number one selling point for me. Ok now to the meat of the review. First off I am using these for outdoor security camera's (and they work well) even though they are rated for indoor use. I did buy third part weather sleeves for them to protect them from the elements. I have had them for about 3 Months now and have had no quality control issues. They are easy to activate and install out of the box as long as you have an electrical outlet nearby, about 5 feet. If not there are work arounds, extension cords, longer Micro USB cables etc. Ok here's My pros and cons for the features I use. Pro: 01: Manual Pan and tilt camera with easy to use App that lets you use touch and a zone button for camera movement. It also lets you pinch to zoom in and out and has the option to live stream/record at HD (1080p), SD (720p) or 360p. 02: Automated pan and tilt with fairly easy to use pan and tilt zone settings. 03: Two way audio. 04: Motion and/or sound event detection with sensitivity control, tagging and push notification. 05: Free 14 day Cloud Storage for recording on event and/or Local SD Card storage (not included) for continuous or on event recording with the option to turn off sound. 06: Manual Video/Pictures and time lapse that can be saved to an album on the SD card and shared. Con: (Remember for me a $40 Camera with these features = 5 star rating even with the cons!) 01: No Windows 10 support. This almost killed the deal for me since I work at a Win 10 Desktop at home and a Win 10 Surface on the road. 02: Cloud storage of events only allows 15 second clips with 5 minutes between events. I've had events go unrecorded because they happened after a squirrel ran across the lawn and the event happened before the 5 minutes was up. No option to purchase longer cloud storage clips with no delay and No NAS or computer recording option. 03: It could be just me but I can't tell the difference between HD and SD camera resolution even when zooming in. 04: The Motion and sound detection is pretty much all or nothing, the sensitivity controls do not work all that well. The motion detects headlights reflecting off the lawn or cars in the driveway at night, Reflections on windows day or night, even moving shadows set it off. Also the motion detection zone placement only allows straight lines like cropping a photo into a rectangular or square area. 04: If you want to share a camera or event you have to have the person your sharing with open an account with Wyse or give them your login credentials?? All in all I would purchase them again though, and probably will for my Fiancé.",5 Star rating based on price for the features included!

It would be so much easier to accept this issue —-> It didn’t connect as easily as most of the other reviews bragged; however, when it connects, this thing is impressive. “When it connects . . . “, “When it connects . . . “, this thing is impressive. Sadly, this thing will consistently not connect to the app. I have to access/kill the app repeatedly to get it to eventually connect. Beyond frustrating.

Kenyon,"A few months ago I ordered two Pan Cams, two V2 Cams with sensors, and two four packs of Wyze bulbs. I've been extremely happy with all of it, pretty much the best home automation stuff I've used and at an awesome price, but there was one problem. A few months after I bought and started using it one of the pan cams started randomly dying. Unplugging and plugging it back in would usually get it back online, but the problem was getting worse over time. So I contacted Wyze directly, wondering if it was maybe a bad firmware update or something else that possibly could be fixed. The Wyze representative asked me to do some diagnostic stuff, including one thing I hadn't thought to try, and it turned out that one thing seemed to get the cam back online. I sent an e-mail back to them, telling them what had happened, thanking them, and figuring that was that, but then I got an e-mail back telling me that what I'd tried and worked indicated that the cam had an unrecoverable hardware fault and they would be sending me a new pan cam to replace it. A few back-and-forth e-mails to get my snail-mail address and such, and a few days later I had a new Pan Cam to replace the old one that was, indeed, still acting funky. Good products, easy to use, very good at what they do, and a company that backs their products when things don't work as they should. Couldn't ask for more than that. Highly recommended.",Impressive support

L,"Bought this camera because it claims to have xx days of free cloud storage, and the super nice reviews from over 18k users. Here is what I got out of it. 1. Very disappointed to find out that the cloud storage is limited to 12 seconds clips triggered by motion/sound detected. And it has long delay before it makes a second detection. What can a 12 seconds clip show you? You see someone approaching your house, and that's it - you don't know what the guy does. Watch the ad selling their Complete Motion Capture service in wyze app and you will know what I mean - basically useless. 2. Pan/tilt stepping angle is limited - it doesn't go to whatever angle you want. You can't tune the position in small steps. My 10+ year old foscam overperforms. 3. Noisy motion. It must use very cheap motors. Again my 10+ year old foscam does much better. 4. Exposure in night mode is weird. If you have some light on, you will see bright area around the light in the live stream. If you turn the light off, that area is still bright!

I set it up with a two factor safety which makes me feel better. I've seen people's cameras getting hacked and that made me nervous way back when.

I looked around and was debating on this or a Ring cam. I'm not very handy so I wouldn't have been able to install a Ring cam on my own. The Wyze seemed to have good reviews and wasn't going to break the bank. It was pretty easy to set up and the app is great. I use it in my front window and the sensitivity is good that it picks up motion across the street as well. I can also pan it around to check on my dog while I'm at work. The notifications are great and they come in pretty quick. The only improvement I could suggest is allowing the user to make the speaker a little louder when talking. Not really a big deal but it would be nice for when my dog is barking or I need to tell her to get off my bed. Other than that I love it and I plan on getting one or two more. Edit: June 13, 2020 I really really want to like this cam but lately the ‘view playback’ feature does NOT work. It’s very frustrating when there is an event I want to see but cannot watch it because the cam didn’t record it. I googled it and it seems to be a very common feature and other users have said to restart the cam. Well this is all fine and good but the cam won’t playback anything from before you restarted it. Why is this an issue and WHY does it keep happening?? From what I can tell it’s not something the folks at Wyze are addressing or seem to want to fix. It’s kind of crap, honestly. The cam is supposed to hold two weeks worth of video but it doesn’t.",View playback stops working after after a few months. Save your money and buy something else.

I can set the sensitivity of both, set it to alert or not, to have night vision or not, or auto.  It has a microphone, and it saves several days of video to the server and my SD card.  It even does time lapse if you want. Additionally, the app is very advanced, amd works flawlessly, and WYZE is an AMERICAN company, with customer service in the US, so it's easy to communicate with them.  Furthermore, the Wyze forum has areas for suggestions, peer help, upcoming improvements, and customer service, and they really do take the suggestions and problems of their customers seriously.

I am a firm believer in NOT paying mortgage prices for technology because it changes so #@*# fast! I've only had this camera for a short amount of time (A few days) and, I am already giving a review on it. I usually like to wait 30 days to get a full product review, but this doesn't need a total 30-day wait because of the price. This camera comes with many excellent features that I think all cameras should have like manually recording, motion detection recording, time-lapse recording, 2-Way Talk/Audio on and off, motion tracking. Now, I have been looking for a security camera that could record manually as well as motion detection. Just having those two recording options was enough for me. The time-lapse recording was a bonus. There are different situations you need to record things: You might be watching the camera(s), and you see something of interest, so you manually record it. Then, you have motion detections which will record ANY movement, and lights turn ON/OFF, trees moving, shadows. This feature works excellent. I have the camera in the kitchen window overlooking my car. I would say my car is about ten feet away from the camera. So, I can pretty much hear the activities or conversation going on around my car. The bonus part about this feature is that I can also chat with my wife while she is in the kitchen and I'm at the computer desk in the bedroom(50 feet away). The features keep getting better as I learn about this little inexpensive camera. The most awesome features are ""MOTION TRACKING"" and ""MOTION TAGGING."" I didn't recognize the features by name which is a surprise seeing I watch TED TV and a bunch of other tech channels. Well, I set both the motion tracking and motion tagging and went on about my business thinking no more about it. It wasn't until I went to get in the car that I saw the camera following me as I walked around the car. THAT BLEW MY MIND because I was there watching Ted TV or Youtube when they first discovered this technology, and I said wait they are going to charge insane prices for it. It's a good thing I didn't bet anyone about the cost...LOL! WYZE my hat is off to you and your TEAM. You didn't do what many other companies did with new technology and trust me, and I know what it takes to program a camera/device to track motion. Tracking is a form of AI on a fundamental scale. I am looking forward to seeing future features and products from you. WYZE Team you outdid yourself. Thank you!",Not what I expected

Set up was a breeze. Where it is positioned, we can get the walkway, door, drive and street beautifully and then spin it to catch the yard and ""upper"" part of the street. It responds nicely and the night vision is quite good. It has never dropped the wireless signal, not once! My issues are that unlike another camera that we had to return for dropping the signal all the time, only one account can sign onto this camera and be able to use the full program. You can ""share"" it with your spouse or children, but they do not have access to any features besides watching and seeing very short clips of events (motion alerts). Also the white color is a large issue at night as you do have to deal with some reflection issues in the glass. I solved that by building a paper housing for it (black, of course, and yes it looks really bad, LOL!) so that the camera itself does not reflect. Also, it needs positioned in such a way that the infrared lights do not reflect - just a slight angle does that very well. We have had no false alerts which is amazing!  Playback is a little clunky and hard to work with until you get the hang of it (and truthfully even then) and the fact that it will do only one alert in a five minute period seems weird, but you can still go to playback to get the video. I love the fact that you can set an alert zone so when we do have it aimed more at the drive than the sidewalk, we can set it to not pick up the neighbor's activity but if you want to watch something else it will revert back to the original position in 15 seconds if the defined alert zone is set. So there are a few issues that need worked around, but all-in-all it is much better than the large number of cameras we tried in this price range (and it had the lowest price tag - go figure).  I love being able to check on the house or know when packages arrive when we aren't home. When someone we didn't know came unexpectedly the other day, even my husband who was at work knew it and called to see if everything was ok as the camera alerted as the guy walking up the driveway.

We use it to check in on the pup throughout the day. It was recommended and thought for the price it wouldn’t be much of a loss of it didn’t work well. I can tell you that this camera has features that some more expensive camera do not have. The image quality is really good even if this was bought at a higher price point. The ability to remote control the camera position is great as well as the 2 way communication. If you have a good WiFi connection you will have good results with the Wyze cameras. Another cool feature is that the app allows you to group cameras together which allows you to set up outside and inside cams or different homes if you have a vacation home. Once you set up one camera the rest will be a piece of cake.  As great as it is there are a couple of cons. A couple of the cons include instructions that non tech folks may find a little lacking and there is motor noise when the camera is moving and you’re listening in. Not a deal breaker but I wouldn’t use this version as a baby monitor. They do have other models that are not motorized and give you various mounting options so noise from the motor is not an issue. Those cameras are about 25 bucks and the night vision works extremely well. All in all I gave it the 5 stars because it does everything it advertises. Are there better options? I’m sure there are dozens out there but these guys put out a solid product with web servers that are based in the US, the ability to set zones for motion detection, programming for when to record, and the inclusion of a micro sd card slot for recording.",Great Camera especially at this price point.

If your own Mother stands at the end of that driveway you could not identify her. Same goes for the Microphone. You have to be real close and speak loud and clearly if you want to hear anything. But the biggest drawback is that it doesn't have a scratch feature. So if you have a memory card installed and you try to find anything in playback mode you have to bring a Mountain of patience. To get precisely the moment somebody walked by your house is complete Luck. You can of course just watch the playback in real time which means you have to stare at your phone for 24 hours or more (depends on what you're looking for).

I am blown away by the picture and sound quality for such a cheap device. (Had to share pics to show the clarity, so please excuse the messy house! I wasn't planning on posting them to the internet when I took them.)  The pan works great. It does make a faint sound when it swivels around. You wouldn't notice if you had any other noise in the room. But at first my puppy did lift his head and look every time I panned the camera. The zoom is also great. (Zoomed pic is in SD instead of HD because my connection isn't the best right now.)  I can hear clearly when someone is talking in the room. On the negative, when someone using the app tries to talk to the room it is difficult to understand. If that is an important feature for you, this isnt' the device you need. If you were trying to sneakily spy on someone, the panning would definitely give you away as the whole unit spins on a base.

The camera is designed for indoor use but there are several reasonably priced enclosures available that are designed specifically for this model that permit it to be used outdoors as I wanted to do. I got the silicone cover and it fits perfectly and protects the camera without interfering with its operation. The camera supports pan and scan movement. I won't repeat all of the specifications that are readily available in the description but I'll say that this is a well thought out design packed with useful features. It's worth mentioning that this camera's movement is fast. Some cameras I've tried before turn slowly so you might miss the action your trying to see. Combined with the Play Store available application, it can serve a wide variety of needs. It is supported by Amazon's Alexa so it's as easy as saying ""Alexa, show me the (name) camera""  and the live picture appears on your Fire TV; saying ""Alexa stop"" returns you to the program you were watching. There are a variety of tracking options including motion,  person, and sound. I found it easiest to experiment with the settings to find the best way to invoke the 12 second video that it records onto an SD card which you supply and insert; I'm using a 64Gb card. There is also a recently available paid but reasonably-priced option to record longer videos. You can share the camera with anyone using the software but be aware that if you use the notification option, it will notify the shared people as well. I hope they make this configurable in an update because in my case, my friend one thousand miles away needn't receive a notification every time someone pulls into my driveway. I hope they make it so each user can receive notification or not. The software application available on the Play Store is great. It is highly configurable so you can tweak the settings to fit your needs. The camera is easy to set up and connect to your WiFi and doesn't seem to have problems staying connected. Also, the base is easy to mount and the cable is connected so that it doesn't interfere with the pan and scan motion. Generally the whole unit is well built and seems like it will last a long time. All things considered - the excellent price, configurability, support, and build quality - I recommend this camera.",Great features and quality

And at the moment motion tracking does not work for pan cams. Their engineers promise they are working on it hard but have no timeframe to have the problem corrected. Without motion tracking the cam doesn't know where it needs to pan. Seems like a fundamental flaw. I have a regular wyze cam v2 in the same room as the pan cam and it tracks motion just fine.

It works excellent.  I may even buy another one for a different room.  We use it with an old Android phone and with some new Iphones.  For a little while, I noticed the frame rate on the Android didn't seem right, with about eight seconds of lag.  However, the app developers are actively maintaining the app and I downloaded an update that made it work just as well as the iphone app.  Our dog had a barking ""problem"" after we moved to a new apartment, because he was so scared.  When we trained him, we needed a way to make sure everything was still ok.  We play some quiet music and leave, then watch the camera and listen to the audio stream.  If we hear the music playing and no dog barking then we know all is well.  Good thing because our neighbors were getting angry.  This camera was a life saver for us.  It has pan/tilt and can be set for 360/720/1080 which is great.  At 360, the lag time is only about a second or so.  At 1080, faces are easy to recognize.

I did my research and was going towards an Ar*o or Ri*g wireless camera set for inside. However, I got discouraged w/ both brands because I read many, many reviews on how over a period of time it gets annoying having to recharge. I read very positive reviews about these little guys and I must say I was impressed but thought it was 'too good to be true.' To begin, the fact that it was not wireless or meant for outdoor use was a huge turn off. But then I thought about the locations where I would install. I took a chance and ordered 2 of the regular wyze cams and 1 of the pan. I couldn't be happier. For less than $120 I got 3 cameras and extra mounting hardware for a secure install. So far, I've had them for over 8 months and I'm satisfied. As you can see from the photos, I drilled a small hole through the inside of the cabinet for the cord to run down and reach the outlet. Because I installed the pan cam at this location (see photos) I have a complete view of my entire living area (I only showed a portion but it rotates all around) including the front door. The angle on my garage with the regular wyze works well too (excuse the mess :). You can't beat the price for it's functionality. Bottom line, it's a good camera to have inside and innexpensive. And even though I read some people's reviews on outside installing I really don't feel like drilling holes through my walls in order to do that. I can't wait for these guys to make an outdoor camera. With that being said I do own a Rin* camera doorbell and floodlight but I paid almost $400 for those two items. If you want to save $ on an inside camera then, this is it. Outdoors- that's another story.",Surpassed expectations for an inside camera

It does get triggered by swaying tree branches, and during sunsets if the sunlight is momentarily blocked by same swaying tree branches. One rather big negative is that it seems to ignore any events (e.g. motion or sound) for a 5 minute period once triggered.  So, if the camera gets activated, it will record for 12 seconds (the default free duration) and then will not pick up any more video until 5 minutes goes by.

I bought this to check on my cats while I was at work. Wyze app also works with Android emulating devices on a computer so you can check on your computer as well. Here is my unbiased opinion after purchase in September of 2018. THE GOOD: 1) Installation is super easy, video quality is crisp and night vision mode is good enough to see most things clearly. 2) You CAN check on your camera any time with any wifi or mobile data. I read a lot about people who could only see the video on their phone if connected to the same wifi, and that is not the case. 3) The fact that this camera can rotate (and you can control it) is pretty neat, it has almost 360 degree vision. 4) Notifications are pretty nice and convenient. You can also toggle the sensitivity of the camera as to what triggers a notification. You can also have the notification feature on at only certain times, so that you're not bombarded with them when you're already home. 5) The developers really seem to listen to what the people want, and they patch up the software so that they give the people what they want without any added cost. Pretty cool! THE NOT SO GOOD: 1) My biggest gripe is that the camera can be too sensitive. My only example is the light coming through the curtains from my sliding door to the patio. If the the light is shining through a slit, it kinda looks like it's blinking - like the flame on a candle. That sets off the motion sensor and the camera keeps focusing on it, which makes the camera notice it more, leading to a vicious cycle where the camera just fixates on the light without getting much of anything else. If I tone down the sensitivity, it just misses everything so I have to decide on getting what I want along with the occasional fixation on the curtains or no movement detection at all. 2) The talk function is pretty bad. There is a speak function where you can talk into your phone and it plays on the camera, but the quality is pretty awful so it's not worth trying. Likewise, the sound quality received from the camera is not great either. Not a deal breaker for me personally since it's not a feature I was particularly invested in. 3) When the camera turns, it's actually pretty loud. My cats eventually got used to it but it was very startling for them initially. Overall, it does most everything I want and for the price point, it deserves 5 stars.",Better than expected

To Wyze's defence, they very quickly responded and fixed the issue within a day. While they didn't try to cover anything up, aren't exactly advertising the flaw. I realize it was an overlooked bug, but it begs the question of the long term success and security of the technology used to route the camera feeds. 2.) Motion recording. I can't get playback to work right at all - I'm using a brand new MicroSD card, and the image in the app just hangs/is frozen when trying to play back footage. The live monitoring and panning works fine, and I see footage on the scrubber/timeline, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Still need to look into this. Overall, I'll keep it around for messing around, and at ~35 bucks it might be worth trying... but I'm tempted to return it given the concerns.",An easy-to-use camera with teething problems.

Mitchell,"Love this camera! It follows every move. It's visible, but not unattractive, so I don't mind. I bought it to monitor my elderly parent (and the aides who care for him) when I'm not at home. But it has come in useful for so many other things. If you're hoping no one will see it, then you need to know they'll certainty hear it. Each time it scans the room you hear the camera make a whirring sound. I'm not a tech expert by any means, but downloading the app to my phone and inserting a HD card (sold separately) was pretty easy. I'm still trying to understand how to use the app and all its features. I can see real-time super clear and rewind is also easy. But it takes patience to search by date and to establish settings to your liking. It's cool to be away from home and to have the ability to just open on the app and be 'back' in my living room in real time. I read several reviews and while I also have privacy  concerns, I really don't think someone would find my private life all that entertaining lol. I got over that hack-paranoia pretty fast. Because the ease of set up, great picture quality, and price I would recommend this device 100%.","Simple, quality, security"

The main selling point for me was that I didn't need a cloud subscription! It can handle up to a 32gig micro SD card that will store a few days worth of videos. We have ours set to record only motion so we have several days of footage on the SD card. You can view everything stored on the SD card from your phone.

I have good views day or night, and it has a strong connection to my WiFi, better than my phone gets in the basement. The motion sensor is sensitive enough to detect changes in shadows on the ground from clouds/light shining in through the windows.

I'm very happy with it! It is easy to use, and the WYZE app (android) is comprehensive. This camera was a breeze to set up, however it needed at least 4 updates taking 10 minutes a piece. The functionality of this little camera is great and it gives you that peace of mind. The video is crisp, night vision is clear, and sound pickup is sensitive. I'm not sure if it is our internet (it's honestly awful), but there is a 15-30 second delay for live steam. The unit itself does make noise, but we've gotten used to it.

It is portable, small, lightweight, has night vision, and it rotates. It also has a slut for a memory card so you don’t need to pay for a monthly/yearly fee to access the videos. You can get the videos right from the camera using your phone. I use mine to keep an eye on my dog who has a back injury and has separation anxiety.

Especially for the price!  Well, as satisfied as we were with the regular version, we were very delighted with the added capabilities the Pan version of the camera offered.  We can now survey an entire room ...up and down.....left and right, with one camera.  When on our window ledge, the camera permit us to see all of the room by moving the camera AND by rotating the camera, we can see out the window as well.  We can monitor conditions on our front lawn and front steps using this.  Note: looking outside through the window works fine during the day, at night we get window glare back. We have purchased several of these Pan models and keep finding new uses for them.  The picture is clear and night vision is adequate.

The versatility is what I love most though. I can set the camera to pay automatically and select what spots it pans. The user has the ability to adjust the sensitivity so you decide how much movement is enough before you should be notified.  I ended up buying a longer cable because I mounted mine outside of my house. This camera has held to freezing temps, without a loss to audio or clarity of picture.

My issue is probably 75%+ of the time it won’t let me live stream and when it does it skips and makes it hard to hear at times. Also, there are times when I move the camera where I want it and it continues to move back by itself so I’m not too sure what causes that. The picture quality is great if your WiFi is superb and you can use the HD. I have the Ring Pro Doorbell and Floodlight and never have issues with connectivity like this one but I put up with it for the price point and ability to move. All in all, it’s not too bad!

I had somewhat low expectations but these cameras were well ranked among several indepenent review pages so I thought I'd try them out. The motion tagging and tracking are terrible.

I'd get a recorded event of them a few minutes later walking around the floor. This camera has TERRIBLE motion activated recording to say the least. As a business owner this doesn't make me feel safe or secure that I can't rely on the security camera I purchased, someone could walk in grab whatever they wanted within a few moments and leave and the camera would never record a video.

Good quality cameras, but they are still in a beta (testing ) stage and should not have been on the market yet... so many bugs. I have 8 wyze.  They all fails one thing or others. Ones more than others. For example, It does not stay in ‘detection area’ i have set up to detect and fail to return to that set location after motion tracking which it should with in 10sec or so. Also  It drifts off to an Obsolete areas all the time from my Area of Interest. Pan cam way points (you can set up to 4 zones) but They also become obsolete since they drift away from my set areas of scan within a day. Notifications are Erratic...sometimes works other times none. Detection for movements for a person fails more than a 50% of the time. Tracking works most of the time but camera gets stuck at that last tracking position and forgets to return to My area if interest or way points. If you set you cameras to schedule times to turn on or off, for privacy issues, forget it ...do not depend it on that. It fails half of the times.

The night vision was the best feature (still is). But that's about where it ends. It now seems to have a servo motor problem. It rotates by using the controls just fine, but when it boots up it goes to the far range of rotation and just stays there. You have to use the controls to adjust. Now it won't track motion about half the time, either. It also doesn't recognize the SD card. Well, it's actually had problems with that for a while. You have to reboot the device, or eject and reinsert the SD card frequently so it recognizes it. Motion detection is hit and miss at best. The whole ""you have this free for x weeks"" things are annoying and frankly confusing. If the SD card feature worked fine, I wouldn't need cloud storage.

Color is excellent, even in low light and night vision (black and white) covers the whole room. Image quality is great in color and very good in night vision. My only complaint is motion detection. The company is currently  ""in-between"" with person detection having deactivated it at the present due to a license issue, and regular motion detection is unpredictable. We have a light in the room that turns on in early evening and off later on. It triggers motion detection when it goes on or off, but different areas of the room seem to trigger randomly so you can't set a zone. If you turn down motion sensitivity then the camera does not detect a person moving around.

I have changed rating from 3 to 5 (3 was being real generous) since it really works properly now. Real flaky controls to turn it on and off and setting a schedule are my biggest complaint when you shut it off via the app it does not appear to completely shut down. Same with setting a schedule. When it is supposed to be off it still responds to noise and movement and if you have it send to push notifications it will confirm it is still operating. It's to bad I like the way it looks and when it's running works reasonably well for it's price point, hopefully they can fix these issues. (decided to keep it anyway) The picture quality and sound are decent. Zooming will degrade picture quality but is good enough to make out larger details, this is not unexpected though since it is just an interpolated zoom from a very small sensor vs. an optical zoom which would cost much more money. The night vision has limited range and field of view for small rooms would be fine but very large rooms you would miss out, there again I knew ahead of time it did not that great of range. I sort of fixed the issue of it continuously running by blocking it's signal in my router setting it to a time schedule that appears to disable it. The better way to make sure it is not running is to pull the plug or put it on a wifi or regular timer outlet. I do understand it needs the connection open to recieve commands. But when you shut it off it should give some indication of that like a red light etc. If and when they ever fix the issues will update my rating.

These Wyse cams were cheap enough that I was able to gauge if I liked the idea of security cams. I did, now I will buy something useful. Now comes the bad. The software. It is an app only. There is no way to get it on a PC. As such, there is no way to store the video offsite, well other than pulling out the memory card. The app is very clumsy to use. This isn't helped by the near thirty-second delay between any two events. Watch a car drive by using the Mk.1 eyeball, then in about thirty seconds the app shows that car driving by. So, send a command to the camera, wait about thirty seconds for the command to get to the camera. Then wait another thirty seconds for the resulting image to show on the app.  This would be great fun if I wanted to play ""moon-man"" however, on earth, it is very annoying.

Well, that’s true and not true! As of this writing, the camera can only be controlled by echo’s with a screen. And tablets don’t count.

This is a very, very basic camera. This camera doesn’t work at night. It works well enough for wide shots but don’t try to zoom in. Zooming shows a blurry view of whatever you wanted to see. Motion sensor works well, but it misses some things when it works. It doesn’t always catch my cats playing on the ground. I bought it mainly to watch my cats. Don’t pay for Wyze Plus, I made the mistake and won’t pay again. Invest in a micro card and record on that. The Wyze plus recorded twice all day.

This is our 6th camera but first pan version and while our main intention was for security we actually use it more as a baby monitor. If we are doing dishes or laundry and the kids ages 1-4 are playing in the living room this thing is perfect. We can tell the kids not to climb on furniture through the speaker, see at night or during the day, if a kiddo is hiding the face recognition will highlight their head in green if they peak out which is awesome if we cant see them immediately, I love this thing. The only gripe I have about the camera is the motion sensor feature that moves the camera automatically is jumpy. Even on slow it moves too quickly and too much. If a kid stands from a sitting position or even flails their arms around the camera jumps all over the place until the kids stop moving, even if they haven't physically moved from their spot. We just shut that feature off and moved the camera high enough to see the entire room and no more issues. I still wish the software would allow me to save clips to my cell of video by choosing a time stamp or something instead of needing to take out the SD card or record it during playback from my phone. If it had that feature this would be perfect",Minor quirk but no camera can compare for price and quality

I have a Logitech Circle Camera. Cost 199.00 and not the features of this Wyze Pan camera.  This camera varies in price from 38 dollars to 59 dollars.  It's a steal at 59 dollars.  The camera pans 360 degrees !  Looks up and down by using your finger on the screen.  They sale a waterproof silicone cover that fits over the camera and then it can be put outside.  Even in  the middle of the yard.  This camera syncs to wifi quickly, every time I add another camera.  NO issues.  I do not understand how they can sell for this price. With the ability to pan 360 degrees and look up and down, activate activate zones, notifications of course.  Only camera I will ever buy again.  Again I have a 199 dolar Logitech circle camera, 299 dollar ring camera, however the ring camera doorbell is a special device that can't really be compared to the Wyze camera, and a Arlo Go, which cost 459.00.  The Arlo Go is a cellular camera, not a wifi so it is different of course.  But the Wyze cameras picture is just as good as the Arlo Go.  Of course the wonderful ability of the Wyze camera to pan 360 degrees is what really makes it special. And the price is insanely low.  I have two Wyze cameras outside, not under cover, 100 percent exposed to the rain and they work fine.  I have two Wyze cameras in my house.

The second one I purchased, I also bought the black silicone case and mounting bracket ( + longer cable) and have it mounted outside over my driveway.  It has stood up to fierce wind & rain storms- several of them since March of this year (2019).  A family member mounted it for me & drilled a hole through the stucco and we plugged it in to the garage opener mechanism that has an outlet on it. I bought an electric hybrid car last year & installed a charger in the driveway and learned that catalytic converter theft is an epidemic in my area! My car is not a Prius  but still a concern.  I am able to program the cam to alert me to movement in an area that I specify by drawing a little box so if I back my car into the driveway, no reason why anyone should be walking around the sides or back of my car.  If they do, I can yell at them through the camera! Haha! I haven't actually had to do this yet but think it would be pretty entertaining to scare the crap out of someone with bad intentions.

It does not support a 64G micro SD even thought when we first got it, it would work. An update they did made it no longer work. I contacted customer service and though they were responsive, they told me the product officially only supports a 32G micro SD. So the weird thing is that the playback feature would *sometimes* work with the 64G card, depending on its mood, time of the month, alignment of the stars, etc. I finally got a 32G micro SD last week, plugged it in, and the playback feature seemed to be working. So I rest easy right? Last night, we got home late and Amazon notified me that a package had been delivered. We look everywhere and can’t find it. Decide to pull up the good ol’ handy “security” camera and guess what? The playback feature was not recording. Like, none of it, at all, for the past week. Now, I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong but if I am, this UX is awful because it’s not self-explanatory on how things are supposed to record. (Though I’m fairly certain I’m using everything correctly because it WAS working when I first plugged in the new card.) So the first time our package gets stolen, the camera which is pointed right at it is not recording even though it was on and had the correct micro SD card in it.

The only negative I can see right now is in night-mode, the motion tracking is often fooled by the IR illumination that it thinks it's sensing motion when it's just things being washed out from a sudden flood of IR lighting. The motion tracking itself leaves a little bit to be desired in low lighting... my camera often spins 180 and faces the wall while trying to follow something as it walks by. The pan feature also needs some altering, I if I have it positioned on top of some cabinets, it tilts up (to be level) then goes all over the place, usually musing any action that's near the floor.","This thing is so inexpensive, and provides so much ..."

So the price now makes sense for it being a PTZ camera. You are able to use an SD card installed to complete ""what they call "" Constant recording"" but it does not work as they state, the item when set on constant recording is supposed to record and overwrite the oldest part of the video when you run out of space. When i set it up, with the setting of constant recording, it seemed to only record when it wanted to, and before anyone says anything NO it was not set to only capture motion...etc, it was set to constant, So this is not reliable for someone that was looking for a 24/7 recording device, that you want to be able to use your computer to store and or view the recordings/live feed. It does not work like a typical IP camera, its locked down with their firmware, So unless you are good with editing/creating your own firmware to have it work to your liking, I recommend spending a little bit more to ensure you have full functionality and access to the device.",not really what I was expecting...

I wanted to mount the camera on the ceiling, but I cannot see anything on the floor for probably a 5-6 feet radius because the lens cannot move down enough.

It draws attention.  zip, zip, zzz zz z zip. 2.  It can't decide to just smoothly follow movement.  Walk in front of it from left to right and it tries to zero in on your movement as if you're standing still, goes left, goes right... as you're walking left.

There are plenty of technical reviews on this camera, so I’m not going to do another, but wanted to say your making a mistake if you don’t give this product a try. After purchasing this and trying It I instantly became curious how a company could make a quality product like this so affordable, and still offer free cloud storage— you just don’t find this combination at this price point anywhere else, so I decide to do some research on Wyze. I found a very inspirational story about some young kids mostly who put everything on the line with the goal to make friends, not customers.  Well, the product is really good, and the story just make you want to help them succeed— I’m a fan, and I would encourage you to try it too. Your really have nothing to lose, try it, if your not convinced send it back. I have two in my home now and they have been working well and provide us with a added sense of security when we are away. I would love to see some sort of wireless siren that could be added to the system making it more of a security system, but maybe that will come down the road.","If you are looking for inexpensive home surveillance, read my review."

It was  9.99 to save, record and get notifications. I tolerated it. There are some glitches in this app, on occasion. Nothing too serious. I did have trouble with it and/or the camera when I used a ""used"" micro SD, but once I replaced it with a new one, it was fine. I love the detection settings, detection zone, motor controls, adjusting the sensitivity to sound and motion are a snap, night vision is pretty good for this inexpensive camera and you can turn off the night vision IR lights if you need to place it in a window. The speaker/mic are great! It has an ""off"" option so you're not using it when not needed. It is a little noisy as it pans and moves. When I decided to subscribe to the service after the free trial it was only 1.99 per camera!!!! That service is much easier to navigate and view than my previous. Once in awhile it freezes and I have to close the app to view the next saved clip but that could have been my wifi. I actually bought this to keep an eye on a new puppy as well as use the speaker.

When I bought this cam it also was supposed to give free video clip storage for 14 days before the video gets deleted but that is not the case, apparently now we have to pay a subscription model to get all their previous free features which is fine if they updated this onto their listing prior to doing this sneaky business move. I could look past all of that if the camera actually was good quality, all the good reviews for it made me hopeful only to be severely disappointed. If you are right in front of the camera a couple inches apart then it works but if you are trying to get it to clearly see either objects or pets or even children / people 2-3 ft away then it will show you a blurred image. I made sure to properly clean the camera thinking that could of been the cause but nope it was doing this since I first got the product. I have 1gb/s download speed and 50mb/s upload speed and I even installed an SD card into the device and the video capture quality is just horrible. Setting it up was quick and easy but the app crashes a lot on my samsung s10 so if I was relying on just the live feed I'd be in trouble especially since the rules I set up do not work at all. I set it up so that every morning at a specific time it should of captured a video and sent to the cloud but it doesn't do it at all. I deleted and re-added the rule multiple times to no avail.

It would not hook up at all, even after going through all of the recommended troubleshooting. The second one is working fine. It does seem to pick up motion well, but the camera movement is jumpy as described in other reviews. The jumpiness makes reviewing the footage a little difficult. The pictures quality seems to be good, but the audio is not so great on the one camera that I am using. This may be normal or the audio on the working camera may be defective. I will know more when I receive the replacement camera for the one that did not work. I recommend purchasing and using a memory card.

W.,"We wanted cameras that could keep an eye on my dad, who has dementia, when he’s in another room. These cameras provide peace of mind that he hasn’t fallen or gotten confused. Pros: - Price - Reliable app - We like that several of us can check the cameras from anywhere, simultaneously or not, at any given time. Wyze cams are a good option when you have a “team” of caregivers. Anyone who is invited can have access. You do NOT have to be on the same wifi. Or even in the same town! - Picture quality is good, night vision is good, sound is good. Cons: - Haven’t been very impressed with motion sensor alerts - I don’t honestly trust that they’ll let me know what’s up. I just keep an eye / ear on the camera images. - Not super discreet. Whole camera moves with pan. - The set-up voice and noises are super loud/jarring. Prob not a problem for most folks, but really not great when you’re trying to set these up quietly and peacefully. My dad is very confused by extra noises and “voices from nowhere.” So that was tricky. All in all, very helpful for our family caring for a loved one with dementia. If you are in the same storm, but a different boat - Blessings to you and your loved ones. Hope this review is helpful.",Very helpful caring for parent with dementia

I like that I can pan the camera to face backwards when not it use. I would 100% recommend over the stationary webcam and will be buying another in the future. The daytime mode works great even in the dark. I'm not sure why other reviewers are saying it feels cheap, I think it feels like it was built of quality materials. The bad is if you have the mic turned on, the motor sound from rotating the camera (side to side or up and down) overpowers everything with an unpleasant whirring noise. It is incredibly loud over the air, however if you listen to the camera in person it isn't making much noise. I think this is poor mic placement or poor sound isolation that they should work on as a revision to this camera. If you are away from home in an area with poor wifi bandwidth (good connection but a low bandwidth) the camera will often fail to load and will be very laggy. I do not like hat I can't switch apps back and forth without re-loading the camera. I like to multitask with the Alexa app to turn lights on and off and talk to the animals via drop-in instead of the camera, but every time I want to change something I have to re-load the camera.

Of course this is a power tethered cam with those limitations compared to a battery powered tetherless model. I have not tried the new arlo 4k cams, so I cannot give a comparison there. Audio quality is good, interface for the phone works well. Biggest fail IMO is no email notification (with still capture) heck no embedded email notification period) tho it seems possible using a round about process using alexa skill and ifttt - however, there are no ifttt ingredient for still capture regardless of there being a declaration of the ability in the service description. 2nd fail is mSD on board storage - no way to automatically off load video to remote storage. The cams have a USB port but it is for power daisy chain, it does not pass data, so not remote connection to a storage device and no existing solution for automatic remote storage.

I used to pay for Ring monitoring but figured I could do it myself (plus my dog kept setting the motion detectors off on my Ring system).  I use my Wyze cams with IFTTT so that the cams turn on when I leave the house range and turn off when I get home.  The video quality is great, manual panning is functional, and the audio (sound and talk functionality) is so helpful.  I haven't bothered to put memory cards in the cams yet but need to start using this functionality.

The pan can be useful.  Picture quality is very good.  I also like the ability to turn it ON/OFF remotely, although, since it's plugged in, it's something that may not get used often.  The fact that it has to be plugged in, limits my use to inside the home.  I have an older home and the places where I need a security camera, it would require too much work and expense to get electric to that area.  The night vision on this camera could be better.  I am using it in my garage and I can barely see anything at night time via the camera.  It has a lot of features and for the price, it's an excellent buy.  Haven't had it long enough to evaluate long term use, but if night vision isn't a must for you, I'd recommend this camera. UPDATE: 3/20/2020 I contacted Wyze and made a complaint about their IR night vision.  They were responsive and asked a few questions and wanted some information.  After I responded to their requests, within 2 days, I got a message from them apologizing for not having satisfied my needs and are sending a replacement camera at no charge.

I got a second one from the company- thinking the first one had a defect.  However - it appears the camera isn't ready for 'prime-time' when you use it in Motion Tracking mode.  That said - the company was SUPER RESPONSIVE.  And as long as you don't try to use the camera with motion tracking...it's fine - but they make a less expensive non-pan version if you are going that route.  When motion tracking - the camera is - ummmm- SPASTIC would be a good word!  Lol.  And if on a wooden surface, generates a lot of noise (all do) when panning.

I had two attempted thefts on the catalytic converter in my old car that parked on the street in the previous year.  This cam also has a clear sight of whoever comes through my front gate.  Its day-time picture quality is excellent.  Its motion detection is also pretty decent.  However, since my street is pretty busy, I think that this cam tends to capture fast moving cars over slow moving pedestrians. I'd like to see two improvements  - (1)  there is a bright street light in front of my house.  The light from that street light would bounce off the lens of this cam and reflect on the window glass.  The result is a huge glare in the middle of the image. I have tried to position this web cam differently to get rid of the glare to no avail. I wonder whether there is a software fix for that.  (2) because I set it up to watch the street, the motion detection is skewed towards moving cars with headlights than other unlighted objects/individuals.

The Wyze app will capture the required Wi-Fi credentials and transmits them to the camera via QR-code. And then, what was the first thing the camera did? A firmware update. This is how devices are supposed to work. I found the image quality to be reasonable, albeit it quickly loses detail in longer distances. The sound quality is somewhat below average. While hearing conversations near the camera in real time, many times the sound is choppy and unintelligible. It seems to work better when hearing the conversations after they are recorded to the local SD card. The camera supports a maximum of 32 GiB SD card for continuous local storage of streaming video. In HD resolution, that amounts to roughly 4 days of video. Capture to the local SD card and to the cloud storage occur independently: the local SD card captures the streaming video or event capture (selectable), and the cloud storage stores captured event clips for 14 days. The manufacturer claims that the device uses end-to-end encryption while sending the streams for storage, and possibly while viewing the streams through the app (the camera utilizes the manufacturer's servers to be able to stream the videos out of the consumer LAN). Using HTTPS, the end-to-end encryption is met. However, it is unclear to me whether the videos are encrypted at rest (i.e., when stored in the AWS cloud) and who possesses the encryption key. Since this is a pan camera, once can move the camera in gradual angles in several directions. Using the Wyze app, one simply needs to swipe over the streaming image to move the camera to desired directions. Excellent. The included USB cable is long, but I did have to purchase longer cables for properly positioning the camera high in the wall and over a fireplace. For the price of this camera and included 14-day storage, it is unbeatable.",Superb.

I got these cams for a critical reason.  My mom is in poor health and my aunt who lives with her has alzheimers.  All these cams do is buffer even at the lowest resolution of 360p.  1)  Internet speed is fine (over 100 download and about 11 upload).  2)  Got updated modem.  3)  Router is fine and firmware is updated.  4)  My internet company does not throttle.  5) I disconnected other wifi things to see if that would help.  6)  My router and modem are literally sitting directly below my echo show.  Many people have made complaints including myself and I guess Wyze does not care as they know but have not bothered to fix the issue.

I immediately set the thing up thinking I should probably get schooled on its use just in case they ask me about it. Cons – No Windows interface… yet.  It won’t look through glass at night due to the reflections but no camera will that I know of. Pros - Viewable on cell phone, you can add a 32gb micro SD in a slot underneath in case the internet goes down. Selectable 1080 or 720 resolution, free two weeks of incident storage on the Cloud-Encrypted storage and rolling overwrite, no-cost and its forever.

Any Amazon device with a screen should allow full function although I haven’t got it working on my Fire tablet yet. A green square highlights the detected motion.

Set it in the middle of a table and you can see a whole room.  It has a snapshot and video album so you can save and export files. Yes, it has night vision; off, on, and auto.  Easy set up. You download the App onto your phone or ipad. It gives you a 3D matrix for the camera to scan so it knows you’re related.  Then you tell it the network password and you’re good to go. It has a standard ¼-20 camera mount if you’re securing it to a wall or mount.  Camera access can be grouped so you could put one in a remote building and have multiple users be able to check on it.

It's super easy to setup, use, and the app makes it easy too! The motion detection is the only thing I have any issue with. Well, it's not really the motion detection because it spots motion with excellent accuracy. The only portion of the motion detection that I don't care for is when it's set to track motion. This in theory is great, accept that the camera overshoots the target then readjusts, overshoots the target, then readjusts, and continues this cycle making it extremely difficult to keep track of what's actually going on. My dog was laying on the couch and then got up to turn around, when he moved the camera started moving all over the place trying to get him in the frame, but it just kept jerking back and forth after it missed him the first time trying to focus on him. At first I thought it maybe was because I was on 360p video so I switched to HD. Didn't seem to make any difference. It's still jumpy as heck but I can just see the video better between the jumps. Otherwise this thing is great. I love how it can articulate not only panning right to left but also up and down. Even without a mechanical zoom the digital zoom is pretty decent.

I can use this to check in on the kids without bothering the roomies. I make sure they do their chores, are not on the video games, haven't left lights on all over the house. When I need to pop in and let them know ""Hey, you left your bedroom light on again,"" it's kind of nice to just pop on the 2 way real fast to let them know, instead of dialing the house phone and waiting for them to get to it to answer. The 2 way is loud, they hear me from everywhere one our main floor. Downfall? The Pan!! I love it, don't get me wrong. But I wish we could customize the time frame that it turns. Every 10 seconds is great, and I understand why it would do it that way. But whenever we're sitting in the living room trying to relax we have to turn the Pan off. It's not very loud but just loud enough that when we're 4ft away from the camera we hear every 10 second pivot.

Considering the price for this thing, you get a movable camera with HD, possible recording and snapshots with micro-sd cards, this is a great bargain. Not a good hidden camera.

A great camera for the price and features I wouldn't have thought would come with a $40 camera. Such as night vision, motion detection/following, you can record past events with an SD card, and the pan/tilt feature works great. It is a wide angle camera so it can capture an entire room, which IMO is good for recording past events, but it would be nice to turn it off and have a little better picture when needed. So far the biggest issue I have had is connection. Most of the time it works great, but it does tend to disconnect and require you to restart the app. Also the playback seems like it would be more seemless, but it can take it a while to buffer before it shows the actual time your'e requesting. Overall though it is well worth the money and I will definitely buy another as I try to replace my security system with a DIY system.",Amazing for the Price

Use this to watch our pets while we are away. Enjoy the fact that you can use a MicroSD for continuous recording. Much better than paying for cloud storage that thinks continuous recording is recording every 10 seconds (like Zmodo). With this, you have a one time cost and your done. I would say this camera is for more casual uses like pet watching while away as it does have some WiFi connectivity issues at times, as well as night vision issues unless you have a small dim lamp on somewhere in the room.

I now have 5 of these looking at different areas inside and outside our house and  they all work well. With the option to pan, if someone jostles a camera, I can 'adjust' it remotely back to the original view, which I like, as I am currently over 2,000 miles from the cameras. Also, when traveling, I like to be able to keep an eye on our cat. Having the ability to pan both sideways and up-and down allows me to find him, rather than hoping that he is in the place the camera is pointed at.

At first, it was too sensitive to reflecting light outside, but I was able to tweak the positioning to help that.  Then, months of reliable ownership.  Then, every so often, it would reboot, positioning wouldn’t go back to where it was, either.  Then, the person detection changed.  It was flat out bad at first, but got better with tweaking.

For a significantly lower price, the Wyze picture quality is better, it tracks motion and pans to give a view of the whole room rather than being stationary, and it does not require additional fees. The only feature it does not have that the dog specific camera did is the ability to dispense treats which I found to be gimmicky anyway. This means it takes up a lot less space.

Out of the box it took about 5 minutes to setup, including inserting the MircoSD card. The camera has several different video qualities including 320, SD, and HD.

When I have it on motion tracking and have it set to record any motion, when it starts recording,  the camera is constantly rotating right to left. It won’t sit still. So the whole recorded video the camera is moving left to right. Once I turned that off, it would record fine without moving. The second thing is the delay in hearing and talking through the camera is super delayed to where I can’t always hear the responses because my voice is still going on my end when they are talking and it won’t allow you to hear both. It’s quite frustrating. I am a single mother of 4 and it’s a great way for me to communicate with my children at home. I do love how the sound is crisp and clear when I’m just listening in.

Material Quality The material has great quality but there's always room for improvement. It seems to be made out of a plastic that could break, crack or fracture easily if hit with enough force or dropped from a high enough altitude. Camera Quality and Livestream Quality As with the material quality, there is always room for improvement, especially when it comes to camera quality and livestream quality. I will post a video in the future showing the incredible quality but for now I only have the review. I did doubt the quality af first, as the price is incredibly low for such a great camera. I tested the camera in both light and dark conditions and the quality is incredible. In SD mode, the quality is incredible but when you move the camera around you do see hoe choppy it becomes. I have yet to try 360p but I'm assuming that it's not that great as it is, 360p. In HD mode I was truly astounded. It looks at if it is a high quality movie camera. You have to see it for yourself but in both light and dark levels, it captures every single minute detail and when moving the camera around it  is only slightly choppy and not as choppy as when used in SD mode.

We've been looking at some options like the Arlo or Butterfly but saw the Wyze system and decided to give it a try based on the incredible price and reviews. Camera arrived same day (nice Amazon!) and comes well packaged.  Took it out and set it up easily, connecting to the app was painless and we were able to watch streams and receive event alerts without issue.  The app is clean and easy to understand, setting up event alerting was easy enough that my non tech Mom wouldn't have a problem.  Picture is crystal clear and the ability to pan and setup motion tracking was appreciated in a camera of this price. The camera isn't setup for outdoor use but there are a number of packages and accessories you can get for less than 20 bucks that make it suitable for outdoor mounting (which was our intention.) The reason we'll probably not go with the Wyze camera is strictly from a physical security standpoint.  First, there is no internal battery so if an intruder was to disable power to the unit we would no longer have a functioning camera.  Some of our camera's are high enough where this isn't an issue but our most critical camera, the front door, is easily reachable.  Second, there is no way to secure the power cable to the camera.  Our older NVR camera's are PoE but the cable comes out from the back of the mount, if you install it correctly there is no way to gain access to the cables to disable the camera.  Even if I was to permanently attach the micro usb cable to the Wyze camera any intruder could simply cut the cable rendering the entire system useless, it's easy to do. This is an excellent camera and system for the right situation...however the lack of battery and ease of access to the power connection makes it unsuitable for any scenario where someone can reach or has access to the unit.",Amazing camera and app with some critical shortcomings

The sound detection works okay.. But that was the only notification we got at first, despite having purposefully moved in front of the camera several times. The motion detection picks up maybe 1 out of every 10 motion alerts. I know it KNOWS there is motion, because motion tagging (places a box where it sees motion in the video) and motion tracking (pans to follow motion) all work perfectly fine, although we don't need the functionality at all. I really just want it to send me notifications every time it detects something. My phone has all notifications turned on, and we read through the guide made by the company to fix the settings for a higher sensitivity detection and still it barely picks things up. It's a shame, because we bought these to replace our Amazon Cloud cam which picks up every single movement and records until there is no more movement, which is nice. Now, we have two cameras facing the front porch, the Amazon cloud cam which will basically be there just to get alerts to movements and whatnot, and then Wyze camera for panning and recording longer videos when necessary (because the Amazon Cloud cam can't do this, which is such a waste).

On paper, it sounds perfect for an inexpensive nursery cam. I gave 2 stars because the picture and response were great. However, we quickly discovered that it only records for 12 second intervals and won't record anything for the following 5 mins even when there's motion in the room. A LOT can happen in 5 minutes with a toddler. This was an issue for us. It would alert my phone when she rolled over but not when she got out of bed right after, or if she left the room. The bigger issue for me though was this morning when I turned the camera off because we wouldn't be home... I walked into my daughter's bedroom for something and heard the motion sensor click on. I double checked the app, the camera was indeed turned off and I did not receive a motion alert. So why was the camera clicking on when I walked in the room??? This concerns me for the quality of the security encryption. I don't want creepers watching my daughter or potentially talking to her through the cam when we're not right there. And I especially don't want anyone else to be able to turn it on when I have turned it off. I obviously can't verify that this was the reason I was hearing the sensor click on, but it was enough to make me uneasy. So back it goes and will be buying a better quality camera from a trusted brand.",I really wanted to love it

I like how the iOS app works. I use it to watch my cat while I’m not at home. The motion detection is sometimes slow, the recorded video starts with the cat in the middle of the room and I never know where she’d been hiding. You can record to cloud or to SD card, both works seamlessly well. The only issue is sound. The sound does not sync with picture and it is oh so quiet and has a lot of static. It is pretty much as if it was not there, which is a shame because this makes really nice videos.",Poor sound otherwise great.

Trying to keep all my smart gadgets under one AI assistant is tough when we live in a world where Google, Alexa, Siri, and Bixby all compete, but this was a good start. Typically we used an old tablet and the Alfred app on our phones to keep tabs indoors, but a free app and an old tablet with a 2mp camera just doesn't cut it.  So I saw the deal for this camera at $30, great reviews, and I was like, how bad could it be? Well, it's not bad.  But it's not great either.  The camera itself is cheap, but it has to be for this price point.  The video quality is pretty good and the night vision isn't bad at all.  Two way audio is great. But holy moly, does this thing act possessed!  It has the automatic tracking when it senses a subject in the frame but it freaks out.  You can move into the frame, and the camera pivots to watch you.  But even if you stand perfectly still, it'll keep changing positions over and over as if it can't really grab you thinking there's movement all around you (maybe there's a ghost in my house?).  It's loud too when it pivots so when we're in the kitchen, it's just going haywire trying to focus on something and whirring away.  I get if there's multiple people in the room and it can't seem to figure out who to focus on, but when it's one person, and they don't move all around, why does the camera keep pivoting all over, and sometimes it eventually stops with the camera pointed in the opposite direction. Other than that, it's a decent option for an indoor camera.  I think I'll splurge and buy an indoor Ring camera and put this one somewhere else. By the way you can shut off the tracking and make it a stationary camera, but that kind of defeats the purpose of going with this model.",Is it because it's only $30?

For the record, videos are stored for 2 weeks in the cloud and videos are 12-seconds long. If that does not work for you, shop elsewhere. However, you can also add a memory card for enhanced local storage. There is a critical flaw in the camera that you need to be aware of - power outages. If you live in an area where power outages are common, do not buy this camera. If and when a power outage occurs, you are required to completely unplug the camera and plug it back in manually. I have never seen this on a device before - ever - and can only imagine it is an issue with the firmware. I can easily replicate this and have sent it to their engineering team. They responded with a simple 'thanks we'll look into it' and that was months ago. No fix yet. At the end of the day, this is a device for a place where you occupy daily.

Definitely would want a unit like this one but with better sound quality when available and if not at too much of a price delta.

End result is i'm giving it to my son and just purchased the non-scanning one for the living room.

I put this camera in the crawl space under my house so I can keep tabs on leaks or anything like that. The night vision LEDs are ok but they don't illuminate the scene very far away. 30 feet is being generous. I got about 10 or 15 feet max. The Camera has very fast motion when moving it, which I like.

So many of these home automation products treat the software or the mobile app as an afterthought - this was clearly paid attention to by Wyze and tested extensively.  The app is fast and responsive, and installing the camera is falling-off-a-log simple.  You just open the app and provide your wifi credentials.  The app generates a QR code which you show to the new camera, and it picks up from that QR code everything it needs.  A quick firmware update later and in under 2 minutes you're up and running.  Have yet to try integrating with my alexa spot or accessing the video from the web, but I'm not expecting any trouble.  I bought one and liked it so much I bought another a few days later.  Motion tracking, triggered recording, and two-way audio is also straightforward out of the box.  (I use one to scold my macaw when she disturbs my wife's home office by screaming excessively)  If you want a simple, easy-to-use camera for monitoring pets/home/whatever, get a wyze.  Plan on adding the amazon suggested mounting brackets for it. ('Fastsnail' - 2-pack for 8 bucks)  It will work standing on its base but it's a little top heavy.  The coverage will also be better if you securely mount it.  If you secure it to a ceiling there's a software setting to flip the image so it's right side up.",Unexpectedly good for the price & refreshingly well-designed software.

I click on the notification and it opens a 10 sec clip of the event. I turn it off when I’m at home. I can also monitor it anytime I want, and pan and zoom (digital zoom, not optical zoom) using the app controls. Picture quality is great, night vision works even in pitch dark. Sound quality isn’t too bad either. As a security measure, this could be defeated by a determined criminal by cutting the power or disabling WiFi.

You cannot use the camera until you sign up. They want your email address, and you have to enter a confirmation code to prove it's your address.  It's completely pointless because there is really nothing to do on the website except buy more stuff (that doesn't work).  AFAIK there is only 1 way to video the video and that's with their app. I hit the resend button at least 20 times, and about 15 minutes later, only 8 showed up, too late to use because it said: ""code expired. Please sign up again..."" Tech support was a complete waste of time.  She offered me a link to setup instructions, as if that would make the emails show up.  I expected her to confirm my email and send me a code; but I guess that would have been to easy. To get past the email nonsense I tried to use the web.  However, later in the process, you have to scan a QR code in person, in front of the camera. So I had to go back to the mobile app and make another trip to the camera.  It wouldn't  connect. So, I had to unmount it  to get to the reset button and reenter a very long password. My cell connected to the network, my laptop connected to the network but the camera would not--and each time I had to click the reset button, reenter the password and scan the QR code. So I set up a new network just for the camera and after several more tries, it connected. Then it asked me to enter a name for the camera, but the onscreen keyboard wouldn't pop up.  Hit back space it warned that I would have to start set up all over.  So I had to pick a preset.  Then it got stuck on loading, so I had to shut it down.  I start it back up and see ""CRITICAL FIRMWARE UPGRADE"". So, finally a picture--after 30 to 50 seconds of loading video.  It's a good quality picture.  There is way too much lag time to use the pan feature accurately.  Refuses to go to HD.  When I rotate the screen, it loads the video again. I may or may not try to get it to work with Alexa.

Scott,"I've had this camera for a few weeks now and I feel that the camera and the app that controls it is still in beta. There are lots of quirky things that still need to be ironed out. For example, this camera is supposed to track moving objects, but if you walk quickly, it will easily lose sight of you. Additionally, there are many times when I am right in plain sight of the camera and the camera will not notice or follow me. Design/motor unit: Additionally, when the camera turns, the motor is loud which will easily alert unsuspecting people to its whereabouts. Thus people can easily knock the camera over or just turn it around, rendering it useless. It would be better if it could be wall/ceiling mounted where people can't tamper with it so easily. However, given the design, there is no way of doing this. Motion/sound sensing: This is probably the weakest part of the camera. The app allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the motion and sound detection from 0-100. If I set it to a sensitivity of 100, it will detect tree branches moving outside my window, but for some reason it will still on occasion miss me if I slowly move in front of it. I have tried to set the sensitivity from low to high but there doesn't seem to be a sweet spot where it will detect the things that you want, but not the things you don't. There are many occasions when my dog will casually walk in front of it and it will not detect it at all despite being set to a sensitivity of 95+. Sound detection is perhaps equally poorly executed. There are times when I set the sensitivity to 100 and it will not hear my conversation from 10 feet away. To be fair, I was speaking in a lowered voice, but I was definitely not whispering. There is also almost no background noise in my home so there is really no excuse for this camera to miss my voice. Finally, there is no geofencing capabilities at the moment so you will have to go into the app and manually turn off the motion and sound alerts for every single camera, every time you come home and remember to turn them back on every time you leave home. This is very annoying and something they should definitely fix. Despite all these flaws, I still think this camera deserves 4 stars because as they say, price is a weapon and this thing is cheap as hell.","Camera in beta, but you can't beat that price!"

Responsive for action triggered recording, although a bit delay in sending the notification to phone (maybe 10-15sec). Free cloud storage for 12 second clips. Optional local storage for continuous recording with SD card placement, great option here! Even when wifi is down, it still record to local sd card , and you can access to it later when wifi up again. Night vision not bad quality considering the price. Cons: 1) I really want to like this camera. One of the most cons is the camera seems to be unable to trigger by sound. I yell, play music, clap my hands right around the camera and no sound is detected. Compared this to Wyze 2 camera which detect sound very good (set to 100% sensitive, able to detect slight object dropping to desk/floor, sneezing, talking). This camera, set sensitivity to 100% and no response! Could it be a defective camera only? Not sure. I like this to be my main camera indoor to able to look around 360 degree, able to detect sounds (so if someone break open door or windows, or any one making sounds when no one should be indoor, then I can be notified). This makes it such a disappointment for me. 2) Sometimes missing actions and not recorded, although not very frequently but sometimes happens. I walk right past it and nothing recording or notification made.",Unable to detect sound to trigger recording

It does exactly what it says it does. Here is the only drawback... IF a stranger is entering your home on the first floor and you are on the second or third floor, you will not get a notification for 12 seconds -- the length of the video that is taken. THUS it is not a perfect safety solution. OTHERWISE, it is great! The picture and sound are clear. The sensitivity of the camera is mind-blowing -- it takes pictures of cars going by the front of the house and  bugs that fly in front of the camera--and sends notifications. Can be annoying --- but fine for me. Id rather too many than not enough.  It says you can decrease the sensitivity, and I lowered but it is still sending the same video notifications. One thing to remember -- your own privacy is compromised. You have to remember it records conversations and sends notifications -- so if more than one family member is receiving notifications think about what youre saying ....",EXCELLENT VALUE

For the price it’s amazing. Picture quality is good, sound is great. We use it for my kids’ room. Checking on them while they play as well at night when they’re sleeping. Only 2 issues. 1.  First one isn’t such a big deal to us. When using the microphone to talk to the room the camera is in, the video delays a bit. So I don’t always hear the response. The 2nd one that’s a little more bothersome is that you can’t cast the video to your tv. You can connect it to Alexa and stream to your fire stick or fireTV. only problem with that is it only streams for 10 mins then turns off. It would be nice to be able to have it stream constantly through the night or during the day while the kids are in the room. Other than that it’s a great cam for the price!",Great cam for the price

It actually picked up a leaf falling off a tree at about 300' away on the lowest setting.  So my recorded events number in the hundreds per day, every time a bird flies by, a cat crosses the street, or a speck of dust happens to float by.  My other concern is that it seems to have a fixed time for recording motion events.  It doesn't matter how long the motion continues, when it senses motion it records for X seconds.  Sure would have been nice the other night if it had continued recording as someone broke into my car.  Maybe I could have caught her face on camera.  Overall, a fun gadget.

I love how I can look in on my home, when I'm away. I can arm and disarm alerts from anywhere. I bought the whole setup, including door censers, motion censers, outlet plugs, and 2 stationary cameras. I did have to buy a longer cord for the panning camera, because I mounted it on the ceiling. The night vision works exceptionally well. I was surprised when I pulled up the cameras (on my phone) in the middle of the night, it was pitch black in the house, and I could see perfectly. The door censer mounted easily, and didn't have to be perfectly positioned, mine is off set by about 1/2 in. and still works great. The motion censer covers a much larger area than expected. When my furnace kicks on it moves my curtains slightly, and I get an alert on my phone. Just a heads up, when you have the motion detection on, it will follow you around the house, which is a little unsettling, but you can turn it off. I feel this was one of the best purchases I've ever made. Piece of mind is priceless, but I didn't have to break the bank to buy the whole set up.

I mainly use these cameras to check in on my dog while I'm at work. Now, all that being said, the main drawback to these is that they aren't and can't be connected to a security company for monitoring. So they aren't a true replacement for say NEST monitored cameras.

This will be a problem for anyone that wants to use these cameras securely offline on a local LAN.  Want adjust the sensitivity ? You'll need the internet for that. Want to play back footage locally inside the app even though you didn't record to the cloud? You'll need the internet for that. Want to use the pan controls locally? You'll need the internet for that. Want to use the app  locally in general? You'll need the internet for that.  Also, if something happens to the company these cameras will be worthless. You can use the beta rtsp firmware that wyze provides and the camera will stream locally, but you will not be able to use the app, configure it in anyway or use the pan controls. The second most annoying thing is retrieving the footage. This can only be done by 1) taking out the SDcard 2) Playing the recorded footage inside the app and pressing record, therefore you are essentially recording already recorded footage in real time.

Also there was times when I couldn't connect to the cam from my phone. It would just hang up or never connect.

Sometimes viewing back the recorded footage is a headache. No way to smoothly fast forward or rewind. Tends to freeze or skip at times. Now on to the good stuff.

I would also encourage anyone who requires specific functionality to chat with a support rep prior to making a purchase, being unhappy and leaving a bad review. For those who think they should have all the same bells and whistles that they claim are built in with expensive cameras, save us all the grief of reading your low star ratings and take your purchase elsewhere.",PURCHASING MY 5TH WYZE CAM -  Major Features Listed

What really bothers me is how weak it is when using it with Google Assistant. If you ask it ""hey Google show me (x) on (x) TV the feed freezes instantly or doesn't load. There's lots of online forums with hundreds of posts complaining about the same. Add to that the app doesn't have a Chromecast button built in. It's awful! Look how many apps have a Chromecast button built in! Not Wyze? I won't be investing in any more Wyze cams until they have better Google compatibility. Cameras manufacturered by Google-owned companies are a lot more expensive but they're a breeze connecting to all of my Google TVs and Chromecasts. I can see them whenever I want with voice commands and they always work. Wyze doesn't.",It's Google Assistant compatibility is awful.

A little tricky setting up the camera at first, but then easy as pie after that. The night vision is superior! You will be able to see into a pitch black room and see everything you could want to. Being able to check on my mom while at work was one of the main reasons I bought this system and it delivered. I was unable to really check the 2-way audio feature, as the cameras were situated right next to a TV, which drowned out hearing the person in the room. Could hear the TV just fine, though! If the TV were off, I think you could talk to and be heard by the person in the room if they weren't too hard of hearing. It has lots of features and is useful for indoor security. (You can set up the camera(s) on a window sill to see outside your house if you want to.) I was able to check on my house while away from home, both locally and internationally. As long as you have WiFi access, you can tap into the cameras with the app. It is secure from hacking, if your WiFi is secure.",Vwey helpful with elderly parent check-ins

Cons: The cloud recording is limit to 12 secs  each recording Two-way audio works but hard to have a real conversation with audio delay and not clear on the app. Pros: Just about everything else works really great and the cost is a amazing. I paired this with Amazon smart plug and Alexa to watch my living room when I'm away. It uses goefencing to turn on when I leaving the house and off when I'm in the house so I get privacy, and at night when I to bed using Alexa Routines.

Jones,"This is my second Wyze cam.  I got the standard (fixed) cam to try it out.  The setup, use and value are superb.  Wyze cams work exactly as advertised and are an incredible value.  As I find things that I want to monitor - my first impulse is Wyze.  My only complaint is that the IOS app allows viewing only 1 cam at a time.  The login process to see the cam is quick, but having a multi-view would move this product from incredible value to unbelievable value (and would change this to a 5 star). I have my pan/tilt/zoom mounted upside down on the bottom of an upper cabinet.  The setup easily allows for the reversed view to be corrected.  The pan and tilt are intuitive and useful.  The zoom - not so much, but the clarity of the 1080p image makes up for it.",Incredible value

A car was harassing my wife while she walked our dogs recording her then flashing explicit material of himself on his phone at her. The app crashed so many times I gave up trying to get the images of the vehicle off the app. I record in hd and peoples faces are unrecognizable on the sidewalk from my camera 15' away. During a wyze camera update my camera sd card died. Thats all the bad. I have used other camers systems and this one seems to be right on par with them.

This camera has awesome controls and easy to adjust. The best part was taking it out of the box and setting it up. Honestly from the moment I began connecting the power cable downloading the app and connecting to my WIFI and inserting the 32gb SDC card it took no longer than 5 minutes. The directions are straight forward and easy to understand. Seriously folks for the $ you cannot go wrong! The PTZ works great and I haven’t found one flaw so far. If I had to find an issue I would say the sound coming from panning is a bit loud but unless you know it’s coming you wouldn’t know where it’s coming from. Feel confident w/this purchase you will not be disappointed. This is a great buy for the money. So far the IOS app works flawlessly. I can’t say enough good things about this camera. The power cord is long however I choose the 25 ft power cord option for $10 only because where I want to place my camera I have no available outlet.,Great product for a great price

I purchased the additional motion detector and 2 devices that alert me in real time when the items they are attached to are opened and closed. After a month or so this camera stater acting up and was rebooting every minute and that only stopped when I removed the memory card.  I have no idea why it does not work as it did when I first bought it. I found no explanation for this problem and saw that there are many other users with the same issue. Leads me to believe it's a flaw in the software and am in Hope's that the wyze folks will be able to resolve this problem. When they do I'll gladly update this review. Until then I think it best to seek out another device.,Great camera with a need for software fix.

I will update later but setup was a ****breeze compared to other cameras that I have had the displeasure of buying and trying - one neat thing is that Privacy is BUILT IN.  You physically have to enter someone else’s email address in order to allow them access - other devices had PIN numbers or passwords, those can be guessed if you are anything like me.  This is something that I have not seen before - very nice. The picture is SUPER sharp and I am extremely impressed with the sharpness of the picture.  Zoom is good, still playing with the camera and will be testing IR early tomorrow and will update stars when I have tested and feel confident in my rating. I say awesome camera for now.

Gefaell,"To start, I very much dislike that this product, and others like it do not allow storage to non proprietary remote systems, 'the cloud'. The quality of video, the software and pan and scan with event detection are so wonderful! They don't even charge for the storage offered, however it's beyond inadequate. That is the reason for the 4 star rating. I'd like to give 3 stars because of this, but I feel that's unfair due to all the other outstanding aspects of this product. If only they'd allow configuration to store to arbitrary TCP/IP connected services. Like my own private NAS located in one of my safes, for instance. Or my private virtual cloud servers located far away, or even things like apple, google and other 'drives'. Well, so there you have it. for <$40 you can keep tabs on what's going on at home, while you're not there. Two way audio, 1080P video (with selectable levels of compression), pan/tilt/ and event detection, night vision with IR illumination... FANTASTIC!

I’ve been wanting a home security system for years but they’re always so expensive. A camera from Nest, for example, doesn’t have pan/tilt but costs well over $100. The app is also pretty amazing.

The only thing you can depend on with this camera is getting error code 90. Which means it is not connected to the Internet and therefore useless.  A voice from the camera keeps repeating the phrase ready to connect but it never does. Imagine if you were using it to monitor  A sick person who couldn't get out of bed. They would have to lay there and listen to this stupid phrase over and over. It would be torture. The only way to  shut it up is to physically unplug it from the wall.  I have had this camera for 14 hours and it has failed twice. Error code 90 check Internet connection. The Internet network  in the house is fine.  After deleting the device from the app and reinstalling from square one I was able to get it to reconnect to the Internet. Four hours later… Error code 90  and the annoying voice starts repeating ready to connect.  But of course it can't reconnect  and the voice will not shut up until you physically unplug it from the wall or hit it with a hammer.  There is no 800 number for customer service. All web-based. I don't see how this company can brag about their customer service. There is none.,Be ready for error code 90. Unable to connect to Internet. Unplug from wall and throw in trash.

Picture quality is excellent, it has night vision, two weeks of free internet storage of highlight clips, the ability to listen and speak, and a host of other really great features. They install very easily. If you are concerned with having to reset if the power goes out, bye and I tech smart outlet for 9 bucks on Amazon and plug it into that. On the slightly negative side, it is not always easy to turn these off, and sometimes you cannot disable the motion-tracking, which can be annoying when you're walking by and the camera is making noisy adjustments every 5 seconds.

Sure your camera could get hacked, but that's a risk every single things connected to the internet has, it's a really small chance, and for this price and quality, I mean..

The camera has clear picture quality, great app connection, and good remote control response.  The only drawback, and the reason for my 4-star rating, is the motion detection software is extremely sensitive.  If you turn on motion detection, then the camera CONSTANTLY zoom from one place to another detecting motion.  For example, if I'm standing in one place, it will move to me, but then keep zooming left and right as it detects my hand movements.  It doesn't recognize that the motion is all in one area so just keep still focusing on that one area.  Instead it constantly moves left and right.  I've even lowered the motion sensitivity settings all the way down, but it made no difference.  And the constant back and forth zooming is annoying because of the sound it makes while zooming.  I have 2 cameras and both do this, so I've just turned the motion detection feature off, which is a bummer because that is an important feature for me.",Great security camera; poor motion detection software

You get quick and easy setup, full control through an easy to use app, USB powered versatility, and multiple installation options all in box. I won't go over all the features, you can do that on your own at the Wyzecam website. What I will say is that these cameras are not about the marketing hype or ""charge a premium to make our product seem superior"" like other brands. Somehow Wyze Labs put together a slick little remote panning camera with two-way audio, motion detection, waypoints, and 24-hour configurable app notifications for just $30! It's not perfect - the two-way sound is a little tinny and the ""motion detection"" is based on pixel changes, but again - you can't get better for $30. It's so good that this is my 4th Wyzecam I've installed in the house (two V2's and 2 Pans).

The set up process is not as easy as it should be, after now setting up 3 of the exact cameras I learned that you should ignore what the camera tells you during set up AFTER you’ve scanned your phone for the code. - Every single time I got an error message, the first time I went through their tech support and eventually the camera fixed itself. **Just let the camera sit for a couple minutes after you scan the code on your phone. The last error message I received was- ‘cannot find specified network name. I let it sit and SURPRISE-it fixed itself. Patience grasshopper.

It sounds like a robot doing ""the robot""....constantly.  I use it as a pet monitor and turn on the motion tracker so it can follow my dog when he moves around; I would say this works 90% of the time.  Does not work well when he runs.  The camera isn't able to catch up with the motion. The mic is pretty good and I can hear everything that is necessary and unfortunately, the swivel noise too which would not be too bad but with the motion tracking it constantly swivels back and forth when my dog is just laying there and chewing on a toy and moving his head.  Instead of the camera staying still since my dog is already in the frame, it would swivel back and forth and back and forth.  I just then mute the sound, but then that defeats the purpose of having the mic/sound feature.  Seems like you have to decide to either put up with the noise or go with no sound.  I am going to try it for a few more days then decide if I want to return it.  There are just so many other choices out there.","Does the job, but Noisy"

Cam Pan arrived w black stains. I did not test the functionality of the cam. It failed at box opening for plastic production quality. This Cam Pan arrived factory sealed and pack with a black dusted stained tint within the plastic housing. I initially thought it was dust that’d simply wipe off. Nope. It’s baked right inside the plastic from the mold injection machine that created it.  How does this literal black & white flaw get shipped to consumers?  It unfortunately taints everything I originally thought Wyze. Quality control is everything.  Returned.,Not so Wyze failure is simple as black & white.

Newbold,"Like most others who purchased these cameras, I found the camera photo quality to be fine, but the software running them is absolutely TERRIBLE.  Plus, like most others, these cameras destroyed brand new high quality memory cards.  The range from my router to a camera is extremely limited.  twenty-five feet is optimal.  Anything over that, and the control of the camera goes to about zero.  The recording to their cloud is horrible.  I had seven motion-activated clips supposedly recorded to the cloud, but on two were actually viewable; the other five have not ""finished uploading"".  Plus, there's no way to delete these phantom videos!  I will NOT buy anymore of these cameras!",Great picture - terrible software

Fancher,"I bought one of these specifically to put in my living room for the purpose of training my dog to stay off the couch. I had an Amazon Cloud Cam in there originally that went on the fritz and due to the price, decided to try a Wyze Pan instead. The video quality is great, and the microphone on the unit works just fine so that I can hear things on the camera app. However, you cannot speak through the app to the camera. It just doesn't produce sound. The app will toggle talk mode properly, but nothing comes out of the camera speaker. Unfortunately, that's a pretty sour deal for me given the purpose of the purchase. I can sit and watch my mutt on my couch and cannot tell her to get down due to the 2-way audio not working. I've searched online and see that this is a very common issue with the Wyze camera's due to firmware updates. Wyze would be ""wise"" to fix the issue if they're going to continue to boast 2-way audio as a feature on their camera's. I would buy a bunch if it worked, but unfortunately I would advise against them for anyone who asked.","Great 'camera', 2-Way Audio is useless"

PROS ... Picture quality is surprisingly good.  (Don't except 4K clarity or it to be as good as the camera on a late model phone) Software is is also good and has a easy user interface. Sound and Voice quality is good. Pan Scan options. Excellent live display viewing speed when using my cellular data(T-mobile). Hardware Decoding option.  (Makes the quality on my S9+ even better). CONS.... In a quiet room, pan scanning makes noticeable noise. The motor could be quieter. It's takes maybe a minute or two after lights are turn on, for night vision to auto disable. Sometimes connecting to the cam can be a pain, but 95% of the time it connects with no issues. Too much false auto detection, which makes it pan around too much. Even if you set sensitivity to the lowest. I would highly recommend this as a cheaper alternate to the much more expensive cams, or as a first home cam.",CAN'T BEAT THIS FOR THE PRICE!!!!

So I bought 1 to try it out before I pick up the 10-15 other Wyze devices that I'd be interested in.  Tried to set it up in my office, until I order the rest, I figured I'd use this one to monitor my 3d printer.  After trying to get it to connect to my network for 10-15 minutes (just said that setup failed on the app) and trying the suggestions (restart the modem and router) I gave up and moved within 3 ft of my router and modem.  Yay....It works.  Connected and played with it for a few minutes then tried to move it back to my office.  Whoops, it doesn't reconnect when it looses power (well thats not going to work for me).  But, I still wouldn't mind something to monitor my 3d printer.  So I try and set it up in my office again (after deleting the device in the app and trying a fresh install).  No luck.  And the crazy part is the router is only about 15 ft away.  One wall in between, no microwaves or anything that should cause interference issues.  Going to try and send it back.

I was surprised at their capabilities, but documentation was totally devoid of setup instructions. The app to control the cameras only gets you through connection to the app, nothing else. No explanations on feature sets, functionality, or connection to smart home networks. Their website is VERY Poor. So an IT professional like me, this was eventually solved, but a regular user would be confused and frustrated. The cameras technically were better than cams that are over 250.00 for Pan Tilt Zoom.

Primero decir que la compré en amazon.com en lugar de amazon.es porque aquí cuesta unos 30€, que con portes y aranceles sube a poco más de 40€, y no los 115€ que te cobran en amazon.es. Al haberla comprado en amazon EEUU, obviamente el cargador es el norteamericano, así que toca usar un adaptador a nuestro schuko. Afortunadamente, el cable USB proporcionado es bastante largo, blanco y planito, con lo que en mi caso he podido aprovechar una regleta que tenía con salidas USB detrás de mi sofá. La cámara funciona bastante bien, la calidad de vídeo es impresionante y la posibilidad de mover 360º la visión y unos 90º la altitud, es de agradecer. Se controla exclusivamente a través de una app móvil que podría funcionar mejor (a veces se niega a conectar a la cámara y te ves obligado a cerrar la app y volverla a abrir) pero que es bastante completa, ya que puedes programar eventos, ver las capturas o vídeos que se efectúen cuando detecte movimiento y hojear el histórico de vídeos y capturas por días. Las notificaciones push al móvil no funcionan tan bien como cabría esperar. Se supone que hay un modo que en cuanto detecta movimiento, captura un vídeo de 12s y te notifica al móvil, lo cual es ideal, pero aunque detecte el movimiento y grabe el vídeo, a veces te notifica minutos después o incluso ni te notifica, y te das cuenta cuando entras a la app y ves que el apartado ""Events"" tiene una marquita roja (queriendo decir que hay nuevos elementos). También he tenido que desactivar el ""motion tracking"" y ""motion tagging"" porque se volvía loca girando de un lado a otro... supongo que debo buscar algo de información en internet, pero como estando estática ya abarca lo que quiero que abarque, por ahora los desactivo. Mas cosas chulas. En IFTTT tenemos muchas recetas para automatizar cosas de la cámara, como que se active sola cuando nos vamos de casa, que se desactive cuando llego a casa, ue se pare el ""motion tracking"" cuando salga la roomba a aspirar el piso, usar un asistente de voz para activarla (por defecto, parece que funciona con alexa), y en general lo que se nos ocurra hacer gracias a IFTTT. La gente de Home-Assistant.io han conseguido vincular esta cámara, y puedes ver el live feed en tu home asistant y crear reglas y automatizaciones con ella. En general, buena cámara. Si te preocupa la privacidad, es una buena opción a tener en cuenta, ya que le puedes poner una SD, no conecta con servidores de terceros, y pese a que funcione con Alexa o Google voice, al poder ser controlada via IFTTT o Home-Assistant, es posible crear automatizaciones sin necesidad de meter a los ""cocos"" en tu casa. Y probablemente via webhook se pueda controlar con Mycroft, el asistente de voz open source. EDITADO TRAS 1 MES DE USO Me sigue pareciendo estupenda por su precio (veo que en amazon.es la han rebajado de 115 a 70€, que si bien es una considerable rebaja del precio,  aun es casi el doble de lo que os costaría si la compraseis vía amazon.com) No modifico la puntuación, de la cámara, pero tengo malas noticias para aquellos que nos gusta automatizar nuestro hogar fuera del alcance de los grandes ""cocos"" como Amazon o Google: cuando me interesé por esta cámara era precisamente por su relación calidad-precio y porque había gente en la comunidad de home-assistant que había conseguido hacer que funcionara vía RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) gracias a un firmware ""beta"" que había sacado Wyze, precisamente para aquellos que no quieren saber nada de terceros que se metan en su casa. Pues bien, parece que el desarrollo de ese firmware beta es demasiado ""costoso"" de mantener y aunque lo puedas descargar e instalar, ya no recibirá más actualizaciones. El firmware beta no funciona del todo mal, pese a que la imagen sufra cierto lag. Pero obviamente hace incompatible las actualizaciones de firmware oficial de los dispositivos, el extensor USB, etc... además, he notado que con este firmware beta, ya no me notifica de cuando detecta movimiento o personas (solo me notifica de cuando detecta sonidos). Con lo que si no van a corregir bugs, malo. Si buscas una cam compatible con RTSP, esta NO es tu cámara.","Muy buena por ese precio, aunque mejorable."

I asked Alex to show me the room it was placed in. Alexa said, OK, then about 10 seconds later she said the camera was not responding. I then cycled the power and verified that the camera was working in the app... no problem. Then repeated the alexa command with same response. I then uninstalled and reinstalled everything. Same issue. Went through this about 5 times. Same issue.

Frustrated I finally broke down and called support, she proceeded to tell me that this was a known issue and wanted some information for the engineers, this pissed me off. I asked how is it this has been an issue for a year now with no fix. She then lied to me saying it's a ""new""issue.

I own 3 of these.  Night vision poor can see a few feet in front of camera.  Biggest issue is longevity.  All randomly lose the Wi-Fi and takes sometimes hours to hook back up, Sometimes randomly quit recording to sd card requiring reset.  Biggest issue is one camera stopped recording the full 12 seconds about a month ago.  Tried resetting, removing camera re adding camera.  Contacted customer service who told me to do everything I had done before.  It then starting recording the full time about half the time so I gave up.  The same camera now has lost its Wi-Fi connection and will not reconnect no matter what I do and what customer service recommended.  After chat finished Wyze sent an email asking for update to which they have not responded.  Since one is now completely useless I’m not hopeful the other two will last much longer.  So be warned they are good while they last but don’t be surprised if they don’t last as long as hoped.  Mine were purchased July 2019. EDIT: new email stating they want to replace faulty camera.

Getting an SD card will help to review what's happened (without one it only records ""events"" it deems worthy-- like leaves not people on your property). So if you get the camera it is essential that you buy an SD card, but know that if the notifications from the software are useless it will be hard to know when/where to look for events.

I have the camera facing outside and sitting on a window sill - the night vision does have some issues going through the window as its built-in lighting reflects off the window/screen.  This isn't a flaw of the product itself - I somewhat expected this to happen, just something for folks to note.

I bought them to keep an eye on my new kitten while I'm at work.  For $35 I was not expecting much, basically some grainy video that was just good enough to watch my cat while connected to the same WiFi network.  I was really surprised at everything about these little drop cams. Video: Video quality is awesome - you have a choice between 1080p HD, regular ""SD"" which I assume is 480p, and 360p for bad connections.  I have had no issues streaming live video over my cell connection at work at full 1080p.  They also have excellent night vision.  My kitty likes to hide under the bed, so naturally I put one of these down there so I could watch him.  Crystal clear even in the middle of the night. Audio: The camera has two-way audio and it generally works great.  I can hear what's going on on the camera side with no problems.  Sometimes, especially over a cell connection from work, the audio from me to the camera isn't the greatest quality ever, but my fiancé tells me that it still comes through loud and mostly clear.  I'll take that for the price. PTZ: The PTZ features are also great.  Again, I can move the camera from miles away, over a cell connection, with no problem.  It's not jittery and the movement and connection are rock solid.  It also has a nifty little motion tracking feature that will follow any motion detected in the frame.  It doesn't always work perfectly and sometimes gets confused by reflections in the mirror, but it generally works and follows my cat as he moves around the camera's surveillance area.  It will also highlight any moving objects in the frame with a green box, and can be set to sweep the area automatically. Recording: Video and still recording are both awesome.  It has a slot for a MicroSD card if you want to store video locally on the cam, but it's not necessary unless you want the camera to auto-record.  I don't want my cameras recording without me telling them to, so that's not me.  I haven't felt the need to install an SD card because the Wyze app connects to the photo album on your phone, and will store stills and vids there.  Very cool.  And the video recordings are excellent in terms of both audio and video. Price: These little guys are only $35.  Enough said.  At that price point you'd expect a product that is significantly lower in quality, but Wyze really delivered a quality product for that price.  I would have paid double what I did for these and they still would have been a great value. Presentation: The cams are beautifully packaged in a very Apple-esque way.  White boxes and everything fits together just right. App: The app is very intuitive and easy to use.  You can hold the phone in portrait and use a D-pad on your screen to PTZ the cam, or turn the phone landscape and just swipe up/down to tilt and left/right to pan.  Whichever orientation you choose, you pinch to zoom.  All of these movements are smooth and effortless.  Setup is a breeze too.  You create your account, pick which model of WyzeCam you have, enter your WiFi details, push the setup button on the camera, and the app generates a QR code for the camera to scan.  Just hold your phone in front of the camera and it sets itself up.  Probably the easiest device I have set up in my start home, and I have Nest products everywhere (which are also incredibly user friendly and easy to setup). Overall this is a great product.  My only ""con"" isn't really a con, more of a wish list item: I'd love it if I could access my cams over a web interface.  Wyze's website suggests that something like that might be in the works, but so far the cams can only be accessed from he Wyze app. For the price, you can't beat these things.",Fantastic little dropcam for $35.

Why would I want a camera that records for 12 seconds once motion is detected(not continuously while there is still motion) and has a ~5 minutes rest time EACH time is records? Not sure why this is even a feature! Even with an SD card, it can record a longer time BUT an SD card can easily be stolen then there’s goes any evidence! Shame for WYZE designing such crap, they even admit it shouldn’t be used for security. Well what in the world is a security camera for then?

Even though we don't mount it outside, the quality of the video through the windows are relatively good.  Because of using them through our windows, we don't use night vision.  However, we have tried it out in the house and the night vision did work well.  Our only problem has been sound activation because we have birds that make noise so we are alerted quite often even on the lowest setting.  We like that it can be plugged into a USB charger and moved to almost anywhere in our house.  We also like that having an SD card means that even though the alert videos are only 10-20 seconds long, we can do a full playback using our phones or computers.  For the price, it does a great job :)",Conveniently mobile

From all appearances reading online, I could.  When I began the setup process, the guide that came in the box said to go to the Google Play Store and download the ""Wyze"" app.  I did so, onto my tablet (which is running Android version 4.4.1).  When I opened the app it would not let me into the app until I entered my ""mobile number"".  I did so and got a warning indicating that there was a problem, so I called Customer Service.  I talked to a very helpful gentleman there who clarified for me that I had the incorrect ""Wyze"" app since mine was purple colored and he said I should have an aqua colored one.  It turns out that I was not presented the aqua one on the Google Play Store because I have an Android version lower than 5.0 (and I cannot upgrade) and that the purple one is for teachers.  He told me that I had to have Android greater than 5.0 and that the camera cannot be setup via a laptop, even though mine does have bluetooth to connect directly to the camera, as would a smart phone. The back of the camera box has a nice write-up about how Wyze was formed and their goals to ""build products that are easy to use"".  It goes on to say that ""Millions of our customers can testify that our products just work.  Our business model depends on our obsession to exceed your expectations.""  Well, for me, the camera does not work and Wyze has fallen short of my expectations. I went back to the 1000+ answered questions on this product and found one that I had read about incompatibility with a Galaxy S4, but because I do not own that smart phone, I failed to drop down the 1 comment about the review.  Had I done that, I would have found Wyze's admission that the app requires Android 5.0+.  So, my bad for missing that, but it seems to me that it is Wyze's bad for not publishing the Android 5.0+ requirement right up front with their product description. Here is the product description where it ought to be stated: ""Wyze Cam Pan is only compatible with the 2. 4GHz WiFi network (does not support 5GHz Wi-Fi) and Apple (iOS) and Android mobile devices."" Here is the review posted 8 months ago that Wyze did not use to change their product description: Description says it's only compatible with Apple and Android. The Wyze App is needed for setup. The Wyze App IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANDROID GALAXY S4. Also the camera (setup app) apparently cannot be installed on laptop w/ Windows 10 Cat H.

There will be nothing to see anymore by the time you received a notification and looking at the cameras live view. Motion video capture should record 6 seconds before the time it senses motion and it would be nice if the length of recording can be controlled to how long you want it to record. It would be great if they fix this with a firmware update and this will be a 5 star product. Update: 9/23/2019 This is just an update for the Wyze Cam Pan that I have been using it facing out thru my window before purchasing the Ring Doorbell 1, all I could say is that the Wyze did a better job in my overall experience and it has a free 14-day rolling cloud storage and the option to use sd card while the Ring has a monthly fee.",A good security cam

So long story short, I was sent to review a different camera which is not as cheap as the wyse pan cam but it worked great. I did drop it and the company sent me a new one right away. I ended up liking this new camera better so I replace all my Wyze camera with the new type I received So now I have a camera that works but cam locally record anything and three other Wyze cameras that are sitting in my closet cause I'm afraid they will stop working like the other one did and it's too late to get my money back.",Stopped Working

Second, this product was packed perfectly in a small box and was delivered damage free. Third, the set up for this product was beyond easy. I was worried at first because there are only a few steps and most 1 star reviews were for set up, but I have to say, it was so simple. You download the app and create a log in. Then, you plug in the camera and wait 15 seconds for the light to start blinking. Once it's done, you hold the set up button (which is clearly marked in the instructions) for about 3 seconds until the device says to you that it is ready for set up. You go back to the app and click ""i heard device ready for set up"" and a barcode will pop up on your screen.

It was very easy to setup. Just download the app, put in your WiFi name and password, it gives you a QR code to show the camera, and the camera does the rest.  For the price, this is definitely the best choice for indoor surveillance. The app is pretty self explanatory and easy to use. You can put a micro sd card in and record local, or you can record events to the cloud. You can setup alerts by sound or motion. I use the motion alert for the front door of my house. It sends an alert anytime someone comes onto my porch. The alert takes about 10 - 20  seconds to arrive on my Phone from the time the person actually came into view. The only thing that I don't like is that you can only access it from an app on your Apple or Android device. At this time there does not seem to be a way to view from your computer.

No sound: you cannot hear what happens in the place it's mounted, you just get distorted noise at a very low volume. After checking the wyze community forum, it looks like this is a well known firmware issue, which wyze fails to solve for over one year. 2. No customer support. Just check the above mentioned forum. 3. No easy way to feed/stream other then their application that has only a phone version. For any decent other brand I've used, you could just http the cam ip in a browser.. For wyze you have to do a bootable sd-card with a non-standard firmware version (which still doesn't solve the sould issue btw) and enable RTSP, then open the feed into vlc or other external player.

The picture quality is great, it sounds ok but I can't tell if it is durable since I owned it only about 1 month Compare to Nest (previously aka DropCam), Nest provide continuous recording in the cloud whereas Wyze only store 10-12 sec clip notification in the cloud (albeit it is free). However, I noted that the notification is not ""fool-proof"" as if there are 2 movements with a short span (about 5 minutes apart), i got the first movement notification and was uploaded into the cloud but the 2nd movement (a different person) did not trigger the notification. Therefore, you can't reliably count on this as a security camera as you might miss something important. Although you can check the recording in the SD card that is available, but this can be erased/removed (for a case of theft or break-in) and the Wyze app does not provide an efficient option to quickly review the recording.

If I had someone break into my home, I dont believe I would get a good shot just because with average to slow movement, it is a blurry picture.

A friend suggested Wyze - he set one up at his mom's house and was pleased with it.  Since the price was so low I though it worth a try and purchased one.  I was so pleased with its ease of setup and reliability that I purchased 3 more for my home and one for my parents.  The cameras are an absolute fantastic value and there are no monthly fees! It's clear that the team that put this product together really placed a tremendous amount of thought and time into the design and execution of both the hardware and software.  Pan and tilt, motion and sound detection, motion tracking and tagging, infrared night vision, talkback capability, adjustable output resolution - as I said, a lot of though went into the design.  They also have a fantastic customer support team - I had a question and suggestion regarding an app update and they got back to me within 24 hours and even followed up to see if their response was satisfactory.  I've now been using 4 cameras in 2 locations since November of 2018 and remain completely satisfied. My last point is regarding motion and sound detection alerts - not only do they work well, but unlike the other cameras that I've looked into there is no monthly fee and the encrypted alerts are stored on their server for 2 weeks (we can delete them sooner and they can also be download to our phones).  I simply love these cameras and highly recommend them!

First and foremost, I can't believe how great this is for the price. Motion tracking, pan, picture quality, etc.  If I would've paid $60 I'd still feel like I got a great deal.  I use one camera to watch my room where my husky is, as I have AirBnB renters in other rooms and dog walkers that come occasionally. The problem, though, is that the camera will shut off at random times for like 20 minutes at least 3-4 times a week, then when it comes back on, it is in the far right position essentially just facing a wall.  This is is a problem because you never know that it shuts off until you go to check the live stream and see the camera facing the wrong direction.  So it could shut off as soon as you leave the house, then you don't realize it until you get back or maybe a few hours after you leave when you check the app. Thankfully, my use is pretty simple, but I can see this problem being a significant issue for people with multiple cameras who are often gone.","Stops recording regularly, but still a good deal for the price"

Then, I didn't serious research on the Arlo camera, which looks amazing what would have cost almost $2,000 for a full install... Then I started seriously thinking about the Wyze camera system. ultimately, I figured I had nothing to lose because the entire system would cross under $500. Little did I know that the setup would be incredibly easy, the quality would be amazing, and the features of the pan camera were beyond all expectations! I installed 15 cameras in our home in Florida that we only visit every other month for about a week. We need to keep an eye on things like vine grow, battery tenders on vehicles, insect infestations, rodents, wind damage, rain damage, and the list goes on. We have neighbors that are great but we don't want to impose. Installing the Wyze camera system was the best project I've done all year. We can have a two-way conversation with a delivery person at the front door, speak to the pool guy if he has any questions directly through the camera on the pool, watch our vehicles, and control the cameras 360° as well as up and down panning and zoom that actually works. In fact, I just tested the zoom in feature on the battery tender and I can clearly see the green or red light on the vehicle. When I arrived to you this week both our golf cart and our Lincoln MKZ were dead and they were on battery tenders. If I had the cameras, I would have seen that the battery tenders were not working and saved myself two days of hassle running around trying to get those two things in order. I ended up ordering five cameras to take back home, I have already pre-ordered the Wyze doorbells, and I've pre-ordered the Wyze v3 and we'll be ordering some light bulbs for when I get home so I can throw out our stupid wink system that decided to start charging service fees so we unplugged it.

I discovered that they do not detect very well and tested the theory by not turning them off before going into the office myself. They missed my detection several times (and yes I had the detection zone and everything set up correct). When I contacted the company to return I was sent several emails about how to fix it which did not work and I finally gave up because of the amount of time I was spending was not worth it. The company should have refunded my money and stood behind the product.,Do not purchase

I have one facing my parking lot, it detects the cars passing by my house but sometimes doesn’t detect me leaving in my car. If someone moves fast, it doesn’t detect them. the issue I’m having now with the cameras, the video pic will show someone but when I click on the video to play the clip, it shows nothing.

However, if you have problems with it, you're in trouble. The first Pan cam I bought bricked after a few weeks of use and all troubleshooting related to the issue failed (Google ""Can't get past the solid yellow light wyze forum"" to see an example of this). I then spent a few weeks having a customer service agent tell to re-attempt every step of their troubleshooting guide over email before they agreed that the problem was a defective unit. When the replacement camera arrived, it had it's own issues with the camera showing everything in a strange tint (Google ""purple tint wyze forum"" to see an example of this). At this point, I'm not sure if it's even worth it to go through their support system again if it will take weeks of frustrating emails to get a solution or replacement.

First of all it is sooooo slow. When you go to ""View Playback"", it takes forever to load each time you move on the timeline. If I need to find something fast that happened, its impossible. I also think it needs a ""15 second"" forward and backward button. When you try to navigate using your finger, it is so hard to get to a specific time. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT would be that when you move the pointer to a certain time, lets say I'm at 3:30pm and need to see what happened at 2:24pm, when I carefully move my finger backward, I think I should see the feed as I move. (This is so difficult to explain) But in other words, say a picture fell off the wall, when I move my finger I should be able to say ""there's the picture... the picture is still hanging... still there... OK NOW ITS NOT THERE!"" all while moving my finger. Instead, I move my finger and the screen is still til I lift my finger, then it loads, then shows me recording at that time.

I purchased an outdoor housing, and the camera is so relatively inexpensive that I can just replace it if outdoors doesn't work out.

For a $5-10 you can get a camera that reliably works with your Google/Nest hub, has a desktop client, and much better picture.  And reliably works period.  It's a constant ""is it going to work this time?"" with these cameras.  They have been relegated to the lowest convenience functions and even then continue to disappoint.  The were a good value when they first came out, but certainly not anymore. Original: I live in an area where I don't need wifi security.  That was fine with this camera until recently.  The app has been updated and no longer allows open networks ""because we take your security seriously"".  Security while on my wifi is my problem, not theirs.  They need to worry about the trip out to the cloud and back, not my wifi network.  As such, these cameras are becoming useless quickly.  Direct quote from email with support ""security requirements have and may continue to change in the near future."".  Basically, it might work when you buy it, but they might decide that you have insufficient security and will render your camera useless based on a whim. Asked about refund since they are actively causing my cameras to not work and they said they would refund only if they were bought in the last 30 days.  Well I wasted several weeks trying to reach their phone support (never once did anyone pick up).  Liked the product when it was working, but the support is horrible.

Also, when I manually move the camera through the Android app it is extremely laggy. Both the camera and the app are on the latest firmware, and update as well. We have several reolink cameras and they all work exceptionally. When it does work the picture is nice, however it's not worth the trade off. I also find that the speaker is a little bit too soft for two-way conversation. Another downfall to this particular camera is that you can only access it through an application on your phone, there is no computer software version to access it.

If your power goes out like it does they will not reset by themselves. I have a few and they all need to be reset. I'm 2000 miles away so that is impossible. Wyze must have changed something in the firmware update. Never use to have an issue. They are sensitive. My lights are all controlled with timers to give the look of being occupied.  Everytime a light goes on or off you'll get a notification. Lots of them.  Wyze uses a pixel to pixie flame comparison. Even on the lowest sensitivity they are sensitive.

Picture quality is pretty good with a little distortion at the edge due to the 120 degree wide angle lens.  It responds to motion and has a number of alerts which you can easily enable/disable. Cloud storage works but the clips are short. I've ordered an sd card for local storage and will see if that allows longer videos. I had hoped that I could control the video length and capture video for as long as motion occurred. The only setup difficulty occurred when trying to enter the QR code.

Setup was incredibly easy. Cons: The is effectively useless as a security camera. It loses connection often. The only way to reconnect it is to unplug it, wait a while, and plug it back in. The iOs app offers a remote-restart option, but it never works. If you're 1000 miles away, as I often am, having to wait until I get back home to reset it makes this useless. I had earlier purchased another wifi camera (for less money), which has fewer features (it doesn't pan), but it reconnects flawlessly on its own whenever it loses connection (either power outage or wifi outage). I would like to like this device more, but I cannot recommend it. If future firmware updates resolve the connection issues, I'll be happy to amend my review. UPDATE: A year later and I seem finally to have it working consistently. A problem with another device gave me a clue about what was causing my problems. No thanks to Wyze, I've discovered that the problem seems to have been the cord all along, not the device itself. I needed a longish cord to position the cam where I wanted it. I have now replaced the long USB cable that I was using with a short USB cable plugged into an old-fashioned electric extension cord. It's been working for two weeks continuously with no problems.

It works great day and night and the motion tracking is pretty darned cool as well though I don't need it. I actually bought it to hack into a custom item... yes, I have already voided the warranty.

This camera only works on  Android and Apple smartphones and tablets, nothing Windows related. Moreover, there is no app to use it on a desktop, although none of this information is in the advertising.  In addition, you must be physically present to set it up. We wanted to set up this camera for my mother-in-law in another state. I shipped the camera to a friend, who was going to set it up. However, it could only be set up on HIS phone (one physically present at the time of set up), and needs to stay on HIS phone even if you are going to share it with another phone. Moreover, the shared phone can't watch the streaming, nor can it pan or tilt the camera!

The only issue is that after using it daily for 6 months the cam pan stopped being able to identify our WiFi network even with the router right beside it. We loved it so much and are still figuring out if we should buy another one or try a different brand. Really amazing quality for the price. We had both the pan and the smaller V2 camera and used them for our nursery. My only complaint about the V2 is that the infrared lights are quite noticeable in a dark room and our baby kept staring up at them. 4 creepy lights staring at her. So I covered the lights up with electrical tape which takes away the night vision but I just use both cameras (at different angles) and they both pick up the infrared light from the cam pan. The cam pan doesn’t have the creepy red lights which is nice. Just a blue light which I think can turn off from the app but I just covered it with tape and it’s fine. Would have given 5 stars if not for the connection issue. We recommend this camera to our friends all the time.","Great quality, connection issues after 6 months"

Wyze provided an answer that wasn't about my issue then asked ""Did this solve your issue"" or something to that effect. But instead of giving a yes or no option so I can explore another solution, it only gave me the option to answer 'yes'. That's pretty useless since I can't go any further than that. After MANY multiple attempts , it decided it had enough of tormenting me and read the damn QR code. Finally got the unit working. The camera, panning, speaker, etc seem to work well.

I was excited to get it and set it up. Right from the start, I had problems with excessive movement while in motion detection mode. This was one of the main reasons I bought this cam, to detect and track motion while recording. Unfortunately, the camera would move excessively while tracking even a slow-moving target. It would often lose the target and end up pointing at a wall or other inanimate object. Then just this past week the motor that Pan's the camera started to get louder when the camera was moving. A couple of days ago it gave up moving. The motor makes a noise but the camera does not move. I understand that this is a budget camera but I expected it to last longer, further I also expected it to perform a task it was advertised to be able to manage. Motion tracking clearly needs work to be even remotely useable. A quick search online reveals other owners with the same problem dating back months with no resolution in sight. Wyze needs to up their game and manufacture a market-ready device rather than selling a beta test platform. Video quality was just OK, not what I'd expect for an HD camera but acceptable.

Even the night vision looks good through the window which I was not expecting. The pan & tilt function is also very smooth. The motion notifications have been wonky.

I have two of these, one aimed to monitor the door and the other monitoring the driveway.  They both miss people and vehicles that come and go.  You would think one or the other would record such motion, but VERY OFTEN they both fail to record.  Less than 50% accurate. Night vision is also very poor.  With lights off, when it does choose to record, you cannot make out distinguishing features at all.  With lights on you can distinguish it is a person but would never be able to identify the person unless they walk up to the camera up close and look toward the lens. Scan feature also gets stuck far left or far right and does not return to the center position.  This would cause further missing of recording of events.",Undependable

Once they send a device for free because I said it failed to work properly so it a decent company for that... I don't like being disappointed which it does. #3) There is no feature that allows you to have it on without recording. Once its on it records for a bit then acts funny after...

After 3 months of use, my review is as follows. The cameras are fine. Good picture quality, average motion tracking. However the Wyze app is really bad. First of all it takes several seconds to just start streaming. Each stage, (connecting to the camera via secured channel, authentication and then getting video data) takes several seconds before I can start seeing the live feed. That is bearable still knowing that this is what you might get for this price range, but the most frustrating part is, it rarely works seamlessly. Most of the times, it just gets stuck on one of those three steps and then times out. I have to force kill the app or worse unplug the camera and plug back in. This kind of defeats the purpose of having cameras at all when you are away. Overall, I would not recommend this camera for the sole reason of bad quality of the app.","Ok camera, really bad App."

This Wyze camera has proven to be better in almost all aspects. But be aware, these cameras are made to get a wide angle of view which means you’re never going to get a great view of the persons face unless they’re right up in front of the camera or you un-warp the video, that’s my biggest gripe with all of these cameras. Quality isn’t bad, motion detection is ok, when I set mine to follow the motion it seems to constantly want to move, especially if there’s more than one person which makes sense. Being able to pan and tilt is great though so you can look around.

Since using this system, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to pay for the more expensive cameras.  The video is quite good, as well as the audio.  It does just about as well as the ""more costly brand"".  The only real difference I can conceive is that it is wired versus the other brand is wireless.  To me this was not a deal breaker.

The only downside is that the video clips are only 12secs and the motion detection has a 5min  “recharge” time, meaning that when the camera detects motion and takes a video, it has to wait 5min before it can do it again. You can overcome this with a 32GB SD card, but you have to set the video for “continuous video”, and you have to access the more extended video via the entire timeline.

The video quality is very good, even at night with the IR illuminators.  Camera pan, tilt, and zoom all work with just a swipe on the phone screen. Setup was easy and worked first time.  Motion detection is amazing, and the sensitivity is adjustable. The exposure level is apparently an average, so not ideal for seeing very dim or bright areas in the room.  If wi-fi is interrupted, not able to reset camera remotely.  I put a timer at the plug to power cycle the cam 4 times a day.  This saved me several times during a 2 week trip.

But I found that I could not zoom in as far as I needed to do at times, so the picture quality was below what I was looking for.  But it is entirely likely that I would have run into the same problem regardless of the camera unless I spent $$$$.

Records events well and easy to look at the events on the app.  The dislikes are: Will not work with Alexa if you have an Amazon Firestick v1. Will only record on SD card with the Wyze app while the app runs only. This doesn't affect cloud recording of events since it will still record events. The SD card recording problem isn't good since your IPad, iPhone or Android device battery will die quickly if on batteries. Video is sometimes a slight bit choppy but not a deal breaker.

It's amazing how affordable it is for its functionality; you get full 360 degree panning, the app is simple and free of bugs, and there's no extra charges or payment plans to put up with. All you need is a decent internet connection and an SD card if you want to save video, and you can tune in from anywhere to an HD video feed. The compression is pretty good quality and doesn't impact video quality too poorly; I can make out text on the covers of books and magazines, for example, despite being pretty far away from them. This camera also integrates with Alexa and Google Assistant, although we haven't found a need to use that feature. This is a great affordable system for home security or just monitoring in general. If I could improve some things, pretty much the only thing I'd change is the microphone, which sometimes struggles to pick up softer noises in the room and sounds very compressed. The speaker is just loud enough to be heard in a quiet-ish room with TV on low volume, but it could definitely be louder. All in all, you really can't beat something this well-rounded at such an affordable price. It's a simple camera with a great app that's free of bloat and bugs or privacy concerns. Just set an email and password, scan the QR code, and you're done. Not to mention it's a classy design without branding all over it, so it fits in to your decor quite nicely.","Great, affordable indoor camera"

I wanted something that would let me see a particular section of my driveway not captured by my outdoor camera; outdoor cameras are expensive and I thought I'd try this in lieu of another outdoor. My idea was to put it in the house behind a window.....found out quickly that doesn't work with night vision cameras (my mistake).  What I like about this one is that I can turn the night vision OFF and adjust lighting outside so I can keep the camera inside behind the window and still get a decent picture after dark.  The other brand I purchased didn't have the option to shut off the infared, so it didn't work for my use. I also like that I can turn the camera off with one touch on the app when I get home, and back on again before bed.  I don't need the camera recording ME LOL.  It has a great range, I think the pic quality is great (even at night with the night vision turned off and outside lighting), and it picks up EVERYTHING.  I had to adjust the sensitivity settings; the bug by my window was very active yesterday :)  But it STILL picks up movement in my neighbors yard over 100 ft away. It doesn't make much noise when it rotates.  It fits behind a blind,  love the free cloud storage, and the app is easy to use. All in all, a good camera.  I only wish WYZE made an OUTDOOR camera that would withstand cold (in WI) so I could use the same app for all of my cameras.  I'd replace my outdoor with a Wyze immediatley if they did.","Nice camera, especially for the price"

Smarius,"A couple of things about this camera, daytime the quality is amazing. Nighttime is a different story, I feel like it doesn’t deliver much; however for me the primary use is for daytime. So I’ve decided to use it more as a surveillance camera pointing at the front of the house through the main window. However I am a bit annoyed with the camera, because even with motion tracking, motion tagging and pan scan DISABLED - it still moves around! So annoying. It never stays fixed, just randomly out of nowhere it just rotates by itself (tracking ghosts I guess) Picture quality is really great though; It is a bit noisy when it rotates, weird for such a small device. Overall it’s not bad, I’ll live with the random “ghost tracking” feature.","Great picture quality, not so crazy about the motion tracking"

Picture quality is very satisfactory. Even in low light situations. For my purposes, 12’ to 15’. I have no issues seeing detail and the colors look true. Panning is great and you get what seems like more than 180 degrees rotation. Horizontal (L/R) movement is mechanical and fluid. Vertical pan (up/down) appears is also mechanical. Solid and reliable across the board. Audio is just “OK”. You can hear just fine when monitoring through the app. However, when using the talk function, I find people have a hard time hearing me. Audio comes in broken and digitized. We’re still testing, but for now, I wouldn’t rely on this to communicate with anyone 2way. We have almost 500mb bandwidth and other cameras where I’ve tested similar functionality adequately, in this capacity. I also closely monitor my bandwidth and connectivity. So that’s not the issue here. I suspect his is an audio processing problem and could be fixed with a firmware patch. But for now, it’s too inconsistent for me. Build quality is very solid. I would’ve expected to spend 2 or 3 times what I did, to get a product this sturdy and well built. It’s larger than I expected; (see the measurements in description). It’s designed to sit on a flat surface though it also has a mounting hole under the rotating platform. There is a light in front. There is an option to shut the camera off through the app; and the light goes off. So if your paranoid like me...you have some level of comfort that can be achieved should you so desire. The WYZE App is good,  but I’m not personally a fan of the pan, tilt controls. It’s hard to get the camera in position and it via the pic drag. The digital control stick, makes for bit of a choppy action. Otherwise, the app is clean, intuitive and easy to use. There are even interesting smart functions like movement tracking and motion follow.  I look forward to future updates. Setup, is just easy. I had this hooked up in minutes. I spent more time reading through instructions and looking for online “how to” content, to make sure I didn’t forget anything, than I did actually setting it up. Overall, this is great value. I was worried about spending only $39 for a security cam. Now I can’t imagine getting more bang for the buck anywhere else. I’m a life long tech guy. At the time of writing this review, I run an IT group for a robotics company. And for what ever it’s worth, I am actually impressed with this product and price point. 4 stars from me. Losing a star only as a result of 2way audio consistency and the pan tilt controls on the app. 1 of those which is arguably subjective.",Impressive value and functionality and unbeatable price point.

Another outstanding feature is the 2 week event cloud storage for free! I have installed a 32gig SD card in each camera for continuous recording. The app makes viewing the events and SD card recordings very handy.

You can remotely pan and tilt to point the camera where you want it. And you don't have to pay any monthly fees for access to your camera or past recordings. On the downside, you are relying on Wyze's servers. If Wyze's business model or viability changes, your service will be affected.

The only issues I've had have had to do with opposite ends of the motion detections sensitivity. If the sensitivity is too high, then the lights outside (we leave our porch light on and share a parking lot with other residents) can every once in a while trip up the night vision which then trips up the motion tracking (dont know how that works but ok), and if the sensitivity is too low, the camera will not detect us if we happen to enter or leave too quickly. Having said that, those issues are not very frequent and serve more as minor irritations. The product works very well most of the time, and gives us ease of mind about living in a bit of a not-so-great neighborhood. The biggest reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because I think it's ridiculous to make you pay a monthly fee to unlock your camera recording more than 12 seconds after it detects motion. This is not something I should have to pay for. I understand the company wants to make more money to support the app, but this is just not the way to go about it.",Worth the asking price under certain circumstances

It doesn't matter whether it is day or night, the center of the image is always blurry. The 2nd camera has only a slight distortion in the center so not as noticeable, maybe because the objects/furniture in the image are further away? The second thing is that when I zoom in, it only zooms into one area, I can't get the image to zoom into the specific area I want to see. Is there a way around that?

I bought two Amcrest: one broke recently after one year of use. One is still functioning. After I got the WyzeCam, I really like it. Here is the side-by-side where WyzeCam beat my Amcrest: 1) Price! The $ I paid for Amcrest can buy me two more WyzeCam! 2) WyzeCam is so easy to use! It is easy to setup and the smartphone app is great; 3) I never got the Dropbox function of Amcrest working - so old-school arcade user-interface and just won't work! WyzeCam is seamless!

Alexander,"Setup was pretty easy, and the night vision works very well.  The quality of the picture is quite good, and zooms well.  Unfortunately (and this was a deal breaker for us) the motion detection is terrible.  It goes nuts!  It rotates, as if the air itself sets it off. Having said that, Wyze told us to keep the camera - free.  They refunded the full price.  So, next time we want a camera, they will be the first place we'll look, but we'll go for a higher quality (and probably higher priced) version.  That kind of support is what really matters.","Great quality, horrible motion detection"

Setup was a breeze!  The live feed has been working great with excellent video.  I am not using the motion tracking or panning features.  The sound event alert works awesome.  There is only about a 10 sec delay from when the noise is detected to when I receive the alert on my iPhone and iPad.  The event video clips are super.  There is one MAIN problem. The motion alerts do not work with the latest firmware as of 5/1/19.  This is a common issue based on a Google search and is software related.  There is a fix if you have an SD card installed.  Otherwise you will need to wait for the firmware to be updated which will hopefully be soon. I did send an email to the company asking how to change my account email address.  They responded within 24 hours and let me know that it cannot be done. A new account would need to be opened. Not a big deal but this needs to be addressed.  Based on the quick response, I gave Tech Support 5 stars.  If the motion detection worked, I would have rated the Wyze Cam Pan 5 stars.",Great value for the features with some glitches.

So far I have been very happy with all things Wyze. I finally decided to give the Pan a try! After mounting it in my livingroom and playing around for a week, I don't think's it's quite there yet. Camera works great as long as it's stationary, but that defeats the point. Half the time the camera is not following me, and when it does the video is blurry, as it spazes left and right. Mind you I have it on the highest video quality with slowest motor speed. Sometimes it will get confused and spin towards the wall and stare into the corner. I also have a wyze bridge connected to it which lost connectivity to my door sensors for no apparent reason. I was able to finally fix this by completely unplugging the camera, since a restart wouldn't fix it. I also wished it had a user programmable home position for the camera. Often the camera will follow something to be stuck at an awkward angle, never to catch movment again without user intervention. Regardless, I'm sure with a few tweaks, Wyze can make this into a winner like the rest of their product lines.","A nice effort, but not fully realized"

I absolutely love Wyze cams for their easy set up and use.  I have 4 cameras running, and this one is the only pan cam I purchased.  My issue costing the product a star is the volume on the 2 way communications.  All the other regular sized Wyze cams have loud volume and 2 way communication is easy (albeit a slight delay).  This pan cam has very, very low volume and it's not possible to communicate.  This was a problem since I wanted to use the camera in a Ring doorbell way at my front door.  Amazon swapped out what I thought was a defective volume issue, but the replacement is the same way.  No real problem, as I will change to a regular camera at the front door and use the quiet pan camera where communication is not necessary.  These cameras are awesome and I will continue to purchase regular Wyze cams when needed.","Awesome camera, 1 issue"

I love that I can talk to him and hear him.  I wish the volume of the microphone was louder though.  The picture is very clear during the day.  I was amazed at the quality of night vision as well.  I love that it pans around allowing me to see outside and in other rooms.  I wish we had bought this a long time ago.  Highly recommend this!  Setup was very quick and easy although I'm still trying to figure out how to make Alexa do more with it for me.  It does 10-second recording if there is motion or sound.

Not sure what the review saying that manual reboot or unplugging cameras is about as I sometimes have to reset router and have not had to do anything with the cameras to get them to connect back up to the WiFi.  These cameras are amazing for the price.  I have a nite owl system from Costco that had nowhere near the image quality of these for 3 times the price.

It was so cheap but it does so much. I've had cameras that are twice the cost and half the functionality. The app is great and the settings can be customized easily. The motion tracking is pretty good but not the best at longer distances. I would recommend turning down the speed setting at which it rotates when motion tracking tho (easily done thru the app). Mine would rotate back and forth to follow people walking across the room, but it's own force would cause the whole device travel a few inches from its spot on the bookshelf, often resulting in it staring at a wall by the end of the day. Lowering the speed and affixing the base to my shelf fixed this. Reducing its motion speed also improved the image quality when it was moving too.","Great camera, can't be beat for the price"

I thought the version with Pan and Tilt would be the same quality, with more features. I wanted it to keep an eye on a relative in a nursing home, especially after the nursing home entered lockdown due to COVID-19.  I got it installed there yesterday and the picture is great. But, the 2-way audio is a complete and total FAIL! I went online to look for a solution online last night and found a thread on the WYZE site where people have been reporting this problem for OVER a year! Apparently, the audio problem started with a firmware update from over a year ago. Some people have had success reverting to old firmware. But WYZE seems to have deleted the option to revert to the prior firmware now.  Since the camera is in my relative's room in a nursing home and the nursing home is still on indefinite lockdown, I can't enter and try adjustments. I can only ask/plead/beg with nursing home admins and maintenance techs to install the camera. I'm thinking about cutting my losses right now, and asking nursing home staff to remove camera so I can return it  and replace it with something else.

It works EXCELLENT, and was easily MUCH cheaper than anything branded as a baby camera. The night vision works great, and you can hear and see whats going on from your phone wherever you are. The application is password protected, and the programming is such so that it can only be set-up to one network at a time. (Making it much more difficult to hack, unless you have an unsecured network.) We added a small roof and perch which made it look like a birdhouse in our woodland nursery. The only downside is sometimes the sound will lag by 2-3 seconds. If you're worried your kid will die within those precious seconds this is NOT the camera for you.

You can change the motion sensitivity levels and set the zone that will trigger event recordings.  The device records 10-second ""events"" when it detects motion or sound (I have sound disabled). Wish I was able to lengthen the 10-second event setting because sometimes the motion isn't strong enough to keep the device in record mode (ex: people walking and then standing still in my parking lot). Also, the app allows for you to customize many settings so that's nice. From the distance I'm using it though, the video quality isn't strong enough to show clear facial features.

The set up was alittle tricky. It had a hard time finding the WiFi network at first but after a few tries it finally connected, that could of been something to do with my WiFi though. The motion detector isn't the best, it does loose track of you sometimes if you move to fast or something but that's not the biggest deal expasially since I'm just using it for a live stream so if I need to I can move the camera while I watch.

I liked this so much I purchased a second camera. I mounted this outside, just under the eve. Even in hard rains, this area stays dry. Although not recommended for outdoor use, so far this camera has been working and recording fine. For the price, I felt it worth the risk to see how it would do outdoors.

They are responsive over internet/cell, are quick to set up, easy to use, and so far seem reliable. I especially like the push notifications with video clips. I do note that the motion detection can get a little wonky. The green motion detection boxes in the video sometimes accelerate off the screen, drawing the camera's pan over to a wall or corner where there's simply no motion. But they recover quickly and get back on task. Also, some features like restricting pan/search parameters are buried deep in menus when really that's one of the initial setup tasks you'd want. That aside - great little cameras. Someone's got to make a Dr. Who Dalek skin for them. The low servo noise and tracking motion is uncannily similar.","Quick Setup, Easy to conenct"

I absolutely love it! Incredible quality for the price. Set-up was very easy, and it has worked perfectly every time. The zoom is impressive, and I’m able to zoom in far enough to see my dog’s chest moving while she breathes. There’s a bit of a video lag or lapse, as with all security cameras like this, but as long as it’s on a strong wifi network it should be bearable. The pan, both side to side and up and down, is awesome. It does sometimes stall when you’re trying to position the camera from the phone app, but never for too long. Just be slow and patient when panning. The night vision is creepy, but gives a very clear picture. The audio is pretty good, and the speaker is loud enough that I can speak to my partner through the camera and the app on my phone. Easy to use, easy to set up. For the price, I’m very very happy. It does need to be plugged into an outlet at all times, though, so keep that in mind while positioning .

Whenever you turn on motion tracking even when all light and sounds are turned off in the settings the Cam emits a loud beep each time it moves. This certainly effects the security aspect as it lets anyone know that they are being watched. A bad thing if ur intentions were to have a cam that is used for household security. Silence is golden or should be for a security cam if that is how a person wants there individual systems to work.  Wyze needs to have a switch in the settings to be able to turn this sound off if desired.  I would have otherwise rated this as a 5 star.",Camera is great. Except....

This in-home camera outperforms my expectations by leaps and bounds!  Very easy to set up, with foolproof instructions.  It took maybe 15 minutes to set up a free WYZE account online, then enter the info online to add the camera to my account, then connect the camera wirelessly to my encrypted WiFi network.  Now I can get into the WYZE app from anywhere, using my phone or tablet, and see what the camera sees.  I can remotely pan and zoom the camera, and—remarkably—see, speak to, and hear my pets from miles away.  There are options for storing video, some of which are free.  The price of the camera is unbelievably low, and there is no monthly fee.  What’s not to love?  Granted, if I were trying to surveil a multi-million dollar art collection, protect a corporate mogul’s private office, or remotely monitor something else of huge monetary value, I’d invest in more robust security than this camera.

Picture quality is pretty good. Not great, but very good.  Night vision is also very good.  Pan and tilt is a bit slow but otherwise works well.  The camera's pan function works differently than most other cameras.  It rotates on it's base.  The reason I bring this up is because the entire camera rotates, causing potential for bumping into adjaction things, and possibly falling over.

Great quality image (you can choose between higher quality images or faster speed motion tracking) and easy to set up. You can also choose how sensitive you want motion detection to be. If you dont want to be notified with every slight movement in the house, set it to a lower sensitivity.

Camera quality is awesome, night vision is good and there is 2 way communication.  There are 2 things that need a little improvement. 1. Motion detection --  If we travel too fast, the camera captures the video but is unable  to follow us all the way. 2. Notifications -- The PUSH notification doesn't work all the time.  When we setup the first time, it works and then for the captured events there is no notification.  We can go to the events and see all the events for the past 14 days.

For the price, the ability to share and control access by multiple accounts is huge (you do need the Wyze app, not a big deal though). Motion tracking is a bit ""eager"", but night vision works well and the image quality is sufficient to see what's going on from your phone's screen, just don't expect super fine detail. I do wish that shared accounts could have access to file playback as an option. Right now only the ""parent"" account can take advantage of the SD card storage, would be nice to share/rescind this option for shared accounts. All in all, amazing product considering the price.

I got this camera to watch the living room and more specifically my pet rabbits. The picture is very clear both day and night and the night vision works very well. You can set the motion detection sensitivity in the settings of the camera through the app that you download to operate the system. My only complaint is that the camera sometimes doesn’t pick up a lot of movement like one of them jumping out of the cage but will notify me when my rabbit scratches her ear.

Its not weather proof so the night vision is pointless since it can’t see through glass. 2.

It wont record time lapse into its cloud, only events, so get the biggest SD card you can or it will fill up fast. 5. If using a SD card.

However, after having a YI camera for a couple of years where I could look back at the day and the hours I wasn't staring at the screen, I begin to wonder why I couldn't do that with the Wyze camera?  After some research, I realized I needed a MicroSD card.  No prob.  Got one of those.  Tried and tried and tried and it didn't work.  More research told me I needed to format it in a computer or something to get it to work.  What?!?!  I don't even know what that means!  So I shelled out the $15 to get the Wyze specific MicroSD card and my camera STILL won't recognize it!  IT'S YOUR BRAND SD CARD!!! What is the point of having a camera if I can't go back and look at what happened during the day?  The 12 second clips it does record are practically useless so I would like to see the whole day.

All you do is download the app, plug in the camera, select the wifi network you would like the camera on, and then hold your phone screen in-front of the camera for it to read the QR code to sync up. Took maybe 2 minutes. Setup after that is fun. You can choose if you would like it to auto pan vs stay stationary. Both of those options also have the ability to track movement. I was surprised to see that the movement tracking also works in pan mode where if the camera senses movement it will break from its panning to follow the motion, then returns to the panning after 15 seconds. You can also choose the spots you would like the camera to pan to and from (up to 4).  Sound quality is pretty bad but it is understandable if you talk to someone through it. The most frustrating part of my camera is that when the sun set and the night-vision went on I got a weird white defect in my picture (see attached photo).

This JERKY movement is all over the Wyze forums with only the reply from Wyze that it is being looked into (over a year with zero fixes).

I was very happy with it. But something happened after I had it off for a week I couldn’t get it up and running no matter what I did. I contacted support here on amazon after they tried everything they got a wyze support person on the line. This person went through all the trouble shooting with me. Then decided that I needed a new unit. She never made me feel like I did anything to cause the problem. She explained the next steps very well. This all happened yesterday. And today my new camera is on its way to me. With another 12 months warranty. This camera was the least expensive I saw. Both my kids have the more expensive brands. And mine is just as good if not better. The customer service was above and beyond anything I expected. Thank you amazon and wyze for all your help.,Best decision ever.

The motion detection, night vision, and scanning with movement. Being able to watch playback is good too. Ability to watch from a computer would be great, but doesn't affect the usability of it. The only downside I've found so far is that when I manually record and save to my phone it says it's shareable, but never actually sends the clip. Doesn't matter how short or long the clip is.

When detecting a motion the camera goes out side the zone setting that was set for a reason, like there is a wall there so do not go there. The camera has a AI mind of it's own and goes into the wall. So why have the motion tracking? When courtesy information sent to the manufacturer they respond as if I had asked them for a response to flip the issue back on the user. Not a good business model to work too.  They since have continued to send customer advice how I should solve the problem that is in their programming parameters.  They treat the customer like a ignorant door stop.  Personally I could care less about their resolution of this problem one way or another. I do however find that the contact back over this issue was insulting to the customers and user intelligence. I can turn off some of the tracking settings and resolve the jumping out of the zone issue but why does the camera not say in zone parameter setting is a programming issue. I have used and had different products from different makes and models I did not how ever get a chip on the shoulders attitude from any of the other customer service representatives like Wyze does. The camera's are cheap enough if I am totally dissatisfied with the camera I would just trash them rather than in good faith try to help the company and alert to a problem with their system.  I remember reading another individual's reviews that he too was a programmer and attempted to do a courtesy feedback to get the very same type of attitude and treatment.

The wyze cams are decent for the money. This pan cam however isn’t worth the extra money.  The main problem I have with this camera is it keeps moving to a position that just looks at a wall no matter what I do. I’m to the point of building a box around it so it doesn’t have the option of moving.

I had them less than 3 weeks and one started to malfunction. It would randomly do this LOUD buzzing like the motor was jammed!! I immediately contacted customer service and they walked me through the trouble shooting (which did absolutely nothing) and ultimately sent me a replacement. I got that one set up as soon as it arrived. Less than a week later, the BRAND NEW unit started doing the exact same thing. It was random so I just dealt with it. The major issue came when the one in my daughters room started doing the EXACT SAME BUZZING. It happened in the middle of the night and absolutely traumatized my child. She is scared to death of her room and going to bed because shes scared it will make the noise again. At that point, I was done with the cameras, I just wanted my money back seeing as Ive had them LESS THAN 2 MONTH total!! I contacted Wyze yet again and told them what was happening, where the tech, Neil, told me that because they had already replaced on of them, and the fact that it has scared my Autistic child, he was going to forward my ticket to upper management and someone would contact me ASAP.....that was 3 days ago and I haven't heard a word from them. So in the meantime, I ordered the Wyze V2 cameras (2 of them) because I needed cameras and trusted the reviews. The V2 is stationary so I wouldn't have to worry about the motors failing like with the Pan cams. They shipped quick and I had them the next day. Immediately set them up and got them going. Here's where it just gets stupid....2 cameras, ordered the exact same day, set up immediately and ONE DOESN'T WORK! It would keep signal for all of 5 seconds then totally drop signal and wouldn't reconnect. I did a factory reset, reset my router, everything customer service said to do! NOTHING WORKED! I put in for a return less than 6 hours after receiving them. I'm done with this company and their joke of a product! I now have to deal with trying to get my special needs child to feel safe in her own bed again! UPDATE 4/20/2020: My support ticket never got sent to upper management!

I fell in love with this camera. It works so much better than my $100 baby camera. The sound is so much better and I can actually position it so I can actually SEE MY BABY !! LOL. I love that when I goto the grocery store and my dad watches the baby I can see everything that is going home and I know if its time to head home if he gets fussy. I can talk to my baby or my dad through the camera too. I bought it thinking its only 30 bucks so if its crap I'll take the loss. I can't get over how crappy the other camera was that I bought compared to this one. I wish I would have gotten this one first. Also if you have an Alexa device one with a screen or even a fire stick you can watch your baby on there. I have seen the posts about privacy but from what I see there is nothing to worry about. Also the cord on my other camera broke after a month and my dad had to cut another cord a rewire it due to not being able to charge the monitor. Well with this camera if the charger breaks its just a universal micro charger!! Couldn't ask for anything better.

However, the quality control need to be improved. I had to exchange 3 camera and all 3 having issues. 1-All 3 having vary bad night vision. You won't see anything more than 3 feet away. I did troubleshoot and verified the the IR led are on but very weak. 2-One out of the three has a bad picture quality. Its white background is having a red tint all over it 3-But here is the very bad issue that happened on all 3 of them, they lost the SD card after about 24hrs/48hrs.  The playback will suddenly show ""no videos at the selected time"" and need to restart the cam to recognize the SD cards again but it will wipe out all videos. I was using Samsung micro SD 32GB, changing to different cards did not help. I finally bought a Wyze sd card thinking it will be more compatible, but still same issue. I called support, they had me flash the FW to an older 2017 FW and upgrade again but did not help. They finally told me to return the cam and buy another one! I actually love this feature rich camera, but I was so disappointed quality control especially the SD and playback issue, so I took off one star for the Night vision/ red tint picture quality and another star for the SD card/playback issue. So the final rating of three stars would be fair!",Good budget camera with good features but need quality control

It even includes a tripod mounting hole so it can be made stable on a high mount. The software works well, and very predictably.

It has motion detection - which seems to work well; and person detection - which is only so-so.  But there is an AI feature and you can share when YOU see a person, so it can learn.  I have hopes that this can become a fantastic feature!  That said, it didn't seem to pick up several times when I walked in front of and even waved to the camera.  It was around this time that we discovered our power cord had gone bad.

Definitely nowhere close to the quality of my Ring cameras. Night vision IR is basically useless unless in complete darkness. If there are any lights in the area you get a strange white-washed ghosting effect that prevents you from seeing anything. Oh and there’s the problem where it alerts me to the detection of a person and when I go to see the recording it’s staring at its own shadow looking directly at the side of my house. It’s $35.

Had a lot of potential but is seriously lacking in the software department. Boasts that it can have multiple way points but you cannot individually adjust the detection zone for each. You only get one and are forced to make it work. Motion detection is awful. Even a shadow from headlights in a window triggers it and it follows and fixates on them potentially missing other true motion alerts. It is set off by dogs no matter how small. Has detection sensitivity setting but it will not make a difference. Overall, great idea, but horrid execution. Product was clearly not ready to be released.

I had sent several messages to WYZE.COM on an eBay listing for this and the original WYZE camera and whoever it was who replied, was respectful and honest and THE reason why I actually purchased their camera. The only reason I purchased it on Amazon was because I would get it a week quicker than eBay.  Received 3/8/2019 My reason for purchasing a security camera is because the downstairs neighbors have had gunfights in and outside of their apartment, and this camera is an extra set of eyes to protect my car. I am not using the night vision (Infrared) lights because of the reflection from my window but so far so good. 03/15/2019 i thought WYZE customer service was good - but now that i purchased this P.Z.T. cam, they have not responded to my after purchase message. do not expect much from them - they do not care about you once they get your money. sadly, i will keep this camera but only because i do not want to deal with WYZE to return it - and i did change the rating from four to two stars, because of WYZE customer service. if they respond to my message, i will edit this review - again 05/10/2020 this one was the first wyze ptz i purchased - turned out to be pretty great. BUYER BEWARE mid April 2020 i purchased my second wyze ptz - absolutely sucks. it will not stay one - it resets and pans several times an hour. i have deleted, and restarted it many, many times.  i have tried to email wyze support with no avail. i am not happy that it will not stay on - and record any events - except one - of me trying to restart it.  just so disappointed in wyze. i should have never purchased the second one.

Able to choose image quality based on cell coverage. Meaning areas where you have bad service, you can choose 360p quality so it doesn’t lag much. I disliked the sound it makes when panning the camera. It defeats the purpose of being discreet. Also the sound is terrible. It’s choppy and unclear at times. My Nest cam is much faster in connection and sounds a lot clearer but of course you get what you pay for. I just wanted an additional cam for coverage and I didn’t want to spend so much on a Nest.

I was prompted to update the firmware after initial setup and that went off without a hitch.  Initially, the video quality was poor and response time was terrible; after I closed the app and started it back up it was MUCH better so I think I needed a fresh connection after the firmware update.  I love how small and light this camera is, and the speed of response when I pan.  The wide view is also impressive, and the image quality may actually surpass my Nest Cam.

After tons of research, I landed on the Wyze Cam Pan due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews and price compared to cameras like Nest and Blink. The camera was packaged very well. It felt like the kind of touch a company would give to a premium product. The camera itself feels like it should cost a lot more than it did. Setup was incredibly easy as it only took about 3 minutes total. After setting up the camera and app, I was met with the option to use their cloud service to record a 7 day continuous loop, but I opted to use an SD card (not included) to avoid paying for cloud service. (2 week trial included for cloud service). I like the 2-way audio feature, having the ability to pester my dogs from miles away is awesome. The pan/tilt on the camera works great and offers a large viewing area. Motion tracking was a little laggy, but I suspect that is more of a software problem.

The convenience of having it is great. The price is great. The bad: The app and software driving the camera need some serious work. The motion zone does not work. When I set the camera up, everything looked great, worked great - until I turned on a ceiling fan. That sent the camera into a fit. It sent out notifications constantly and was moving back and forth on its base trying to track the fan. Went into the app and found the motion zone settings. Changed the zone to well under the ceiling fan. Nope. Camera continued to freak out and track the ceiling fan even though it wasn't within the motion zone. Tried many different configurations of that zone and no matter what, it always found and tracked the ceiling fan. At one point, it spun around and faced the wall and would not budge until I reset it. The scheduling options in the app also don't work well. I tried setting it to turn off notifications at 9 pm, and turn them back on again at 8 am. It gave an error that the on again time has to be after the off time. I flipped them. Same error. Can't get that to work at all, so I manually turn notifications off at night, and manually turn them back on again in the morning. If you aren't relying on motion zones or notifications, and don't have ceiling fans going, this is perfect for you.",Good camera with software/app that needs work

I have two of these cameras installed recently. I just got a chance to review the events recorded and realized some motions were definitely missed by comparing the events generated and the playback recorded on SD card. Motions in the exact same area were not being detected consistently. This makes this camera pretty useless as a security camera. I have two Wyze Cam. Not sure they have the same issue or not yet. Downgrade to one star...to confirm the problem I suspected, I tried walking in front of the camera today and the camera indeed could not detect the motion consistently.  Very disappointing... To be fair, this PTZ camera is very cheap for its hardware functionality (not sure about the durability since only have them for a few months).

These are great and were easy to install, which was my big issue with the other brands. Both cameras failed to connect on the first try, but each time I just rebooted the camera and then it connected with no problem. I also appreciate how response customer service is; while it's an email and not a phone contact, they did respond reasonably quickly to my inquiries. The only challenge I'm facing is that I use these as baby monitors, and there's a glitch in the app where if you want to leave the app open with the sound on, it will auto-shut itself in the middle of the night. Thankfully after many back-and-forths with customer service, one of their team eventually acknowledged that this was a known issue and pointed me to a forum where I learned the issue is with the sound. If you mute the camera/app, the picture will stay open all night long with no problem, so as long as I remember to do that before bed (when I can hear my babies without needing the app), it works fine for me.

I have not found a way to change the video length; I assume there is no way to change it.

For the price and it's capabilities it is absolutely unbelievable. After I set it up and worked out the initial configuration kinks I have it all set up now for use and I am very happy with the results. The only issue I have is the short duration time of the activity alerts recording which. Activity alerts trigger the camera to record a brief 12 seconds video. Best part if you can keep 14 days of these alert videos online for 14 days FREE. However this is not an issue if you insert an SD card into the camera and keep recording all the time. A 32GB card holds about 2 days of HD and 7 days of SD resolution audio and video. Video and audio quality is excellent. Tracking and motion detection is great. You can set the sensitivity of motion detection to suit your conditions inside or outside or completely turn it off.

When I speak through the speaker it just sounds like static. When you go to play it back on the ap you can hear the words but it makes it impossible to talk to anyone or my dog through the speaker. My second concern was that there wasn’t any encryption on the camera so I would assume it’s easier to hack. I found my camera turned in the opposite direction that I left it multiple times which is pretty creepy and it wasn’t it just resetting.

I installed the 32gb cards to get continuous local recording and ensure coverage if the wifi goes down.

I did A LOT of research before I found something that was great priced AND efficient and WYZE cam is exactly that. DONT BUY AN EXPENSIVE MONITOR, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!

A 14 day revolving CLOUD recording is automatically included with your purchase no expensive cloud subscriptions.

I have two in separate locations linked to some Smartthings senors so when I'm not home the camera wills start recording and be able to receive push notifications. In the daytime, the picture quality is clear and high quality. However, the thing I will say is, the night vision is not that great. I have the camera on my island and the camera could see maybe 3 feet away clearly, but after that the vision gets a little blurry. Also, the camera has a build in microSD slot for recording events. The app also is able to record events, but when I don't have the microSD card in the camera, the camera does not always record on the app. I'm not sure if my camera is faulty or that's just how it's made.

Picture quality is good. The pan and tracking features need work. They aren't accurate and are too abrupt. I disabled all motion and use this device as a static camera. Another super annoying feature is that cloud saving is 12-second clips in intervals of 5 minutes.

When I was using this camera it had a 30 to 40 second delay in the live stream. The motion sensor worked find it would pick me up when I entered the room. The problem it when I walked thru the room and went to my office to see the feedback it would not show me in the picture. Then I would appear and could be seen entering and leaving the room. The problem in that was approx. 30 to 40 seconds earlier. For me that did not work well for what I wanted to use it for, like when working in my office and wanted to watch what my dog was doing upstairs.

The app is intuitive and well-designed, and I've had no issues with the basic cameras. The pan cam, however, has bricked two SD cards and counting. This is clearly a known issue based on the forums, but it continues to happen. The worst part is that there's no indication on the app that the SD card is no longer functioning - it's not much fun to look for footage and find out there isn't any. The least Wyze could do (if they can't figure out how to stop the bricking) is put a visible flag on any cameras that are live-view only.","Good cams/app, but unreliable as anything but a live-view camera bc it destroys microSD cards."

It's a good value for your money. However, when a motion event occurs, only the first few seconds are recorded. Example: someone enters through the door, they're still far from the camera, the camera starts recording. It records the first seconds, and then nothing. You don't get to see that person's face as they move around the room. The camera won't even wait for the person's face to be a little closer so you can identify them. It'll just stop recording after 12 seconds (I think that's the limit). Another limitation that makes it inadequate for security purposes is that when someone enters your home and sees the camera, they can go to the camera and disconnect it. If they don't spend more than 10 seconds doing that, the camera will not send any recording to the servers, and you won't get an event notification. In fact, every time I return to my place, I walk to the camera with no hurry, I disconnect it, and I never get a recording or notification of that. My recommendation is to buy it if you want to check on your puppy or your baby, but don't buy it for security use cases.

That said I believe if you use apple you may be fine. But for android you will only have issues. First the mic does work at all so no 2 way talking, just listening. This has been an ongoing issues as you can clearly see that has not been fixed on the wyze forums. Also for the past 2 weeks it quit sending notifications to my phone, nothing was changed it just stopped. Also today it started only to display black and white images. This is in addition to the motion tracking bouncing a around from every little change in light if someone is in the room (ex : will track the person, go to the window light back to the person then to kitchen light, and continuously do that.

Sound and motion detection options for event recording, great night vision, solid motion detection, and most of all the price. Some areas of slight improvement: they had a quick start instructions in the box, but nothing more detailed explaining what features there were or how to use them. We’ve also had issues with it being set to record events, but then not recording them. Major issues: Free two week cloud storage is great! However, the camera will only record a ten second clip, after which there is a five minute cool down before it can record again. This only applies to the cloud, you can still record as long as you want to an SD card. However, let’s be real, an intruder WOULD 100% of the time steal the camera, or destroy it. A subscription service for longer cloud clips or maybe a one time optional purchase would potentially solve this?

In a lit room it worked only so-so. The night vision was completely useless. Picture was almost black and would serve no purpose whatsoever in identifying the source of movement.. I contacted Wyze customer service through chat and after spending almost an hour checking things I had already checked and providing screen shots of the dark garage, the technician told me he was moving the issue to an upper tier technician who would contact me. After several days I got an email presumably from the upper tier technician, who asked that I again provide screen shots of the dark garage. I pointed out that I had already sent screen shots to the first technician and to get them from him. I never heard back from anyone. It was too late to send it back so I have an expensive paperweight.

Pros: I love the pan, tilt, and zoom functions. I use this camera for my chihuahua yorkie. I can track her anywhere in the room with the live function. She is low maintience so I have no need to record events. There is no cloud subscription which is why I initially purchased this device. If you wanted to record there is the option of using a micro SD card. The cool thing is that you can still take photos without one. I bought the wyze pan outlet mount stand and it keeps from knocking it over on the floor. Also no need to worry about wires! It looks like you can also attach it to a small tripod if you wanted to. Cons: When I first set up the device the speaker was ample but after the update it was non existent. When using the app you can barely hear what's going on in the background. When using the speaking function in the app the volume from the wyze camera is indistinguishable. Again I believe it's a software issue but truly dissatisfied with the lack of tech support.

What Wyze does not tell you is that it cannot be connected if you are running a VPN program on your phone or tablet.  When I contacted their tech support because I could not get a connection, they provided no good solution.  It was only after trying every other possibility that I hit on the fact that the VPN was preventing the connection.  If you have a similar problem, stop the VPN, connect the camera, and then use the VPN software to exclude the camera connection.  Then it works like a charm.  One difficulty is that due to the panning action, you can only set it in a location, it cannot be secured or hang from a wall or ceiling.","Great camera, but check your VPN if it won't connect!"

Started with Kamtron pan cameras. The night vision was horrible and they kept disconnecting from the wifi. Also, they don't motion track. I will use these as backups with a wifi plug so I can reset them when needed. Then I bought a Movelli pan. This one motion tracked but would not return to it's starting position and again the night vision was horrible. Then I stumbled across these beauties. I don't think I could ask for anything more for the price. Tons more features than the other two. Fast connections - hasn't dropped wifi yet - wide angle lens to view corners - motion tracking with return to starting position - great night vision - you can set it up to scan areas automatically -detection sensitivity adjustments - alerts for co2 or fire alarms if they go off - alerts just for sounds - people specific alerts (instead of all motions) - set detection area (I only wish it could be set up for multiple detection areas) - camera position auto-return (I had an issue with this that was a little complicated. I set up a detection area but after I place the cam I wanted to view it a little lower so I adjusted the angle from the app. However, after 15 secs it returned back to it's starting position. Turns out I could either turn off the detection zone or when you are setting it you can move the cam angle where you want it to return using the touch pad below the zone screen. There's tiny print below all that which somewhat explains it that I missed). Also, they produce 12 second clips then won't record for 5 minutes so if you need to see more of what's going on I recommend getting a micro SD card and turning on Continuous Recording. The option here is either only your events will be saved or it will continuously record (obviously). Then you'll have to find the time of the 12 sec event from your app then go and try to find it on the timeline of your SD card. It would be easier if they could have those events tagged somehow on that looooong movie but now I'm just nitpicking!)

I own the more expensive Arlo camera and thought it was really great -- until I used my first Wyze camera. My Wyze camera has a sub one-second latent video stream, so when I'm watching the live stream through the app it appears nearly instantaneous. I imagine this may vary depending on the network, but it beats the multi-second latency of my Arlo camera. My Arlo camera feels more premium and still offer a few features that my Wyze camera is lacking (such as geofencing), but for the price Wyze is 5 stars every day for me. The Wyze community is pretty active and it appears that Wyze is adding the missing features that the community is asking for. The Wyze app just got a major overhaul and now feels way more functional than that the Arlo app (which kind-of just feels ugly now).

I have been blown away by all of the technology and features packed into this camera. I’ve had family members spend upwards of $100 (not counting monthly fees for cloud video storage) for each camera in their home surveillance setup, and the Wyze Pan outperforms them in just about every category when you compare them. It pans, it tilts, it records in HD, and it has an IR night vision feature. You can even set up push notifications directly to your phone, and it has detection zones that you can use to limit areas that will activate the camera’s motion detector. The app is user-friendly and the cloud storage is free. I’m incredibly happy with my Wyze Pan.",Best Camera Dollar-for-Dollar

That said, the main advantage of this cam over the v1/v2 is the pan function, but there is not an easy way to add preset position button so that you can easily jump from one preset position to the next. You'd have to manually rotate It to the desired position every time through the app, which can be painful and inconsistent because you always over or under shoot the desired position and require many micro adjustments. It is such an intuitive feature that's missing for a panning cam. It does have a feature called Waypoint position that lets you cycle through preset positions, but it's nested deep within settings and its intended use is for continuous surveillance that cycle through the desired positions every 10 minutes, so this is not a practical workaround. They have this feature requested on their official forum for over a year now. It is still just an overlooked post on the wishlist at the time of this writing. I hope Wyze devs can see this review and add this important and intuitive QoL feature, at which point I will gladly change to 5 stars.","Missing ""preset position buttons"" feature.

When I put it on 'track a specific' object, it hunted around for the object and easily got confused. Panning instructions lagged by 10 or more seconds and it was easy to give multiple commands, thinking the first few hadn't been rx'ed only to have the camera go wild a few seconds later catching up on the all commands.

Cons: noisy when it moves (not discrete); spazzes and moves away from motion.. I would be super happy with this camera for the cost, except that it is super spazzy after catching motion. The camera can't stay focused on the motion, it starts flailing back and forth, trying to land on the motion but ends up moving away from it.. Since it's motor makes noise when it moves, that makes it very noisy when trying to follow the motion, so it's not discrete. Because of that, it makes it terrible if you're trying to use it for security, since the camera can't stay focused on the motion to get a clear video..

I was ready to go all in and cover my place with this Wyze cam 2 pan but currently NO Apple HomeKit support or any on the horizon will leave me with just the one I bought for curiosity after hear great things about it. None of their products are HomeKit comparable and the company clearly  doesn’t care to make them so. These app gets a little glitchy sometimes when trying to press buttons or enter text. The pan cam is great but is a little noisy when panning. For now I leave it still and stationary. Best bet is just get the non pan model.

Not reliable. Not acceptable as a home security cam.

I set up a network of these for a fraction of the cost of a security cam system. The sd card storage allows for plenty of playback time and the app has many great features. These were extremely easy to set up and use and many people can join the network. The two way communications are just good in a quiet environment as the speaker level is low. One of the best things is that because these have plenty of local storage capability ( add 32gb mini sd card) and you don't have to pay for a cloud storage fee if you wish to have playback features.,WOW!!

Easy set up and excellent features. However, connectivity is an issue. After initial trouble with setup, I learned the camera does not support 5GHz (most modern modems use 5 GHz). That was my fault for not reading the description closer, so be aware. I switched my connection to 2.4 GHz (luckily I have modems that offer that feature) and it seemed to work perfectly..... until I left the house. Being less than a mile away, I found that connectivity would drop after 5 seconds precisely and I would have to restart the Wyze app. This is not a modem/internet issue as I connected to a separate modem in my home. Same issue. My cell phone also had 5/5 bars during the live stream. You will be able to watch a live stream, as long as you manually restart the Wyze app every 5-8 seconds.

It has a great panning feature so I could scan around the room and then zoom in when I spotted them. I only ""talked"" through the camera once and they could clearly hear me from the other end of my apartment. If you're looking for a detailed image, this may not be the camera for you, but just being able to see my kitties having a nap or playing for the other side of the world was awesome. I can't really comment on the night vision since my apartment is by a streetlamp and it never gets fully dark, but I was pleased with the quality overall.

Thought I would give it a try, and have no idea how this gets positive reviews unless the product quality is that hit and miss or if all the positive reviews are sponsored. I was told at work that you always start a review with a positive,  - the video quality is very good and sharp. The color of the camera is pictured white and it did arrive white. That's all I got. SD cards - believe the negative. First off, it takes about 25 times pushing one in before it locks or it just keeps popping up like bread that's been in the toaster 20 minutes. I never chose for it to format it. Going to the app, says no SD card. WTF. After removing it and 75 depressions getting it locked in, same thing. Put the SD in my laptop, and what do you know. It's bricked worthless junk now. Don't do what I did and try another or like me you will have 2 bricked SD cards. Tried 1 new one and 1 known good one. Now have 2 that are destroyed and not recoverable as they are not recognized in anything. The audio - I can hear the person near the camera, they could hear me if they were to pick it up and hold it to their ear. Pretty much sums up how great that is. motion detection seems to be on it's own. With all motion settings turned off, the camera would just start whirring away, moving back and forth. Night vision, if there is anything resembling even a dim bright spot, the bloom effect is overpowering and you can't make out anything. This cam is like a piece of gum - it's sweet at first, then after you chew it a little...… it's time to spit it out. I would've included pictures but it is on it's way back.

Lohr,"Just about everything is okay with the camera except for the fact that the camera rotates on its own... A LOT. I have three of the cameras set up in various spots around my apartment and, while they are supposed to be pointing towards specific spots, I *frequently* find them pointing in the wrong direction. For example, the two I have set up to point out windows are frequently found turned completely the wrong way, pointing towards the blinds instead of outside the window. (Please note that I keep the firmware updated on all three cameras.) Per this, I would very strongly advise getting the cheaper version of the camera that doesn't rotate. Or, to the team at Wyze: maybe find some way of locking or disabling the rotation...? Don't have much use for a security camera that can't stay turned in the right direction.",I would suggest buying the version that doesn't rotate

As of now I haven't been able to get the app to recognize that my camera has an SD card.

Take long time to turn it on or off on app, always failed on the first try (even under the same wifi). - I guess this could be solved by app update. 2. Can only record for 14 days no matter how big your microSD card is. Based on the product description it sounds like notification can be saved for 14 days on the cloud but didn't mention that the local storage can only save the record for 14 days as well. Why not let it keep recording until it capped the max capacity? (Correct me if there's a way to change the set-up to keep the history more than 14 days. I select ""continuous recording"" in the local storage and see only 0.5G/30GB used but can only see past 14 days record.) 3. You can set up for motion tracking so that the camera will rotate to track motion, which is good but only if the object move very very slow. Which means it won't capture the moving people from one side to another if the person was moving in the regular speed.

Clear picture and the zoom works well. Still learning the features, but an awesome amount of them for the price.

I have had mine for a few months and we used it to watch the puppy when we were at work.  We can even talk to her and she recognized our voice.  It was great!  Now I’m using it as a security camera.

It even has night vision and it’s not a bad picture even in the pitch black.  I would expect to pay a lot more for this little camera.,A bargain-worth a lot  more

This was an option i had with foscam and foscam apps, but then again those were pitas to configure via IP addresses and when they stopped working it was practically impossible to reconnect.

For $37 I can do pretty much anything high end cameras can do. Setting it up was very easy. There are many accessories on Amazon to customize it, like waterproof covers to use it outdoors, stands to install it on the wall, etc. I basically use it to check on my dogs when I'm not home and together with my ring alarm system let's me keep track of what's going on when a sensor activates inside the house.

Got it for my pup while I’m away and it works like a charm. When shopping around and reading reviews, a lot of people claimed that this camera, while away, takes a long time to connect to from the app, not the case for me! Literally takes three seconds and I can see the inside of my house and what my pup is up to. There is absolutely no motion delay whatsoever! The camera itself is very HD (super distinctive) i love that it has night vision - when turned on, i can see everything and him like clear day. The controls are very easy to use, you can go up, down, side to side, ZOOM IN! And even TALK THROUGH THE CAM WHICH IS AN AMAZING FEATURE!! Only thing I would recommend is getting a mount for it, didn’t come with one. This product deserves a 10 star rating due to what you’re getting for the cost of it!",Awesome!!!

Unfortunately the devil is in the details and it's problematic on many levels. Set up seemed to be relatively straight forward but the scanning of the QR took many attempts.  After I exhausted every solution tip offered online to link up with the QR code (low lighting, bright lighting, move the code further away, move the code closer, etc) it finally linked up when I haphazardly passed my phone in front of the camera and it finally linked. The range of lens motion isn't as great as I imagined it to be.  It's not true 360 lens or body.  Picture quality is above average. I have 2 wifi networks at my house and would prefer to have the camera on the 5G network but it's not able to function on that one so I had to reconfigure my networks to accommodate moving all my other wifi connected devices to the 5G and dedicate the 2G network for the camera.",Difficult to set up and not very intuitive

As long as I log into the app regularly and check on the Cam Pan it seems to do okay at maintaining all of the recordings. (About 3.5 days worth at 1080p) But if I ignore it for 'too long' the Cam Pan decides the SD card is no longer inserted. The only way to fix this is to cold reboot (unplug) the Cam Pam. It is only a partial fix since the freshly rebooted Cam Pan will say the SD card is empty and start over. The motion detection is simple XOR so if the shadow from a tree on a wall moves too much it will get triggered.,You get what you pay for (cheap)

OK, I've got to mention this - Today I was placing the 2nd unit on a covered deck, and it was sitting in the tool tray of the small stepladder I was using. One of my dogs rocketed past and bumped the ladder, knocking the camera to the deck - easily a 4 ft drop. I figured, $37 camera...no way it would survive a drop from that height. Plugged it in, and it works. I'm impressed.",Been using for a couple of months now...

I have another regular Wyze Camera and that works flawlessly both on Wyze App and on Alexa Echo Devices.  I will have no other option but to return the Pan Camera .

Super easy to setup, price point is incredible too. My wife and I use it everyday. I opted for this instead of the Ring doorbell. I positioned this in my front window so that I could move the camera to see the front porch and also turn it to view the pets. It has a rotating base so the whole camera turns almost 360 degrees. There is 2 way communication with it so I can hear what’s happening inside and tell my dogs to go lay down if they are barking all day which is more common than I thought! The other bonus feature is it can supposedly listen for the loud beeping of a smoke detector or Co2 detector which means this baby can save me $100 on a smart smoke detector, it says it will send a 10 second push notification video to your phone if it picks up any of the detectors.

That makes it difficult to search if you’re looking for a particular moment or just wanting to quickly see what happened on cam for the day. But the fact that you don’t have to pay a subscription to record  makes this a minor inconvenience. Well worth the money as this company continues to improve the product and add features  frequently.,Great cameras at a great price

It also records a short clip where you can take a screen grab or enlarge. Bonus, it pans around 180 degrees so I can spin it around and see, listen to and talk to my dogs!

Good video quality with the option to change between HD, SD, and 360p. You can also turn off the IR lights to do night vision through glass. However, I would recommend supplying some light to the surveilled area otherwise it may get too dark to pick up anything. Perhaps a night light of some sort. One bit of useful information for anyone creating their own mount, the base screw hole is 1/4” - 20 size. This can be found in the Wyze app, in the shop, by clicking on the Cam Pan and viewing tech specs. Took me awhile to figure it out, hopefully this saves you sometime.

I have this item in my living room and monitors across the front door thru the dining room into the kitchen. Under normal light it’s ok. The real issue is when you turn on a light in the distance and this is located in a dark room. Example in my case is, this is in living room (light off in living room) and you turn on kitchen light (in the distance) you cannot see anything in the kitchen area as the light from it turns the camera area, in the kitchen, into a blob of white light.

So you cant view just over the phone, unless u r connected to a wifi. Limits it to only being able to see video at work , for example. Why is that ? ? It should still show.some video without a wifi network, even if tekhey r low frame rates or grainy vid. But No picture is shown without being on  a wifi network. Huge weakness in an otherwise excellent product.

(How convenient) a few weeks ago the camera in my bedroom began to spin like crazy then it stopped working, the other camera I don’t know what happened with it. The second camera sits high, I noticed it wasn’t working after being away and trying to check in on my home but it kept showing offline.

Setup is extremely simple and straightforward. The video, sound, whether live stream or recorded playback all operate without any glitches on the app (Piper sucks at this). I can insert an SD card  into the camera and it has a rolling two day video recording, so I can look back on what my child and nanny did during the day without having to pay for any Cloud storage subscription. For all its functionality, the camera is almost feather light and has a very small footprint. Only downside is that the pan and tilt feature operates in a very obvious way (It's loud and the whole camera moves, compared to a very discreet pan and tilt feature in Piper). However, the camera has a pretty wide angle, so it can be placed in the corner and have it cover the entire room without any difficulty. This is a great buy for my needs (I wasn't looking for a full fledged home security system although this camera does have some of those capabilities). You can't beat the price.",Under 5 min setup and works effortlessly without glitches

I have been in the market for an alternative to a ring camera, that doesn’t have any subscription fees, and stumbled upon the Wyze Cam Pan. Now the only problem was this camera is rated for indoor use only. I did some more research and found that a lot of people have been putting the regular Wyze cam outdoor, with protective cases found on amazon. So I found one for the Wyze Cam Pan, and mounted it above my front door, covered by an overhang. I mounted it upside down, and flipped the camera 180° in the settings. FEATURES: The motion tracking is alright, especially for a $37 camera! It can follow subjects okay, but tends to over rotate. HD 1080P, yes it is full HD! The picture quality is fantastic! 2 Way Audio is okay, quite on the cameras end when talking through it. I will say the microphone on the camera is exceleant. It picked up kids playing multiple houses away. PTZ is excellent, there is LITTLE to no input delay from the app to the camera. However the zoom feature is only a digital zoom, so the quality is low when zooming. Motion detection is great. You can select one detection zone. I have noticed there seems to be a delay period after the camera detects motion and sends you an alert, before it can send another alert, maybe a few minutes or so. The only other problem would be sometimes it detects motion once the object is close to the camera, but you can put in a Micro SD card to constantly record. I have yet to install an SD card, so have not tried the timelapse feature. The Pan Scan feature can be used to set up to 4 waypoints the camera will automatically rotate between ever 10 seconds. I haven’t had to use it, but it certainly works! Smoke/CO alarm detection is AWESOME. I tested it and was alerted in 10 seconds. This is a feature the Wyze developers never needed to add, and not many other competitors have, it is truly an awesome feature! Finally, FREE 14 DAY CLOUD STORAGE?! You can store as many clips(14 seconds each) in the cloud for 14 days, FREE! That’s unheard of for a camera of this price! Overall I think EVERYONE should own this camera!  The price can be misleading, but so far I am blow away at this little peice of tech!",WOW! This camera is extraordinary!

At first it worked really well- app always connected, was able to turn it on and off, it rotated around entirely so there’s a good 180 view. It was really easy to set up on my own. But for the past week it has been really buggy, takes several attempts to turn it on and off and sometimes I can’t get it to connect at all. Even when it’s working well it takes 20-30 seconds to switch the camera on or off because it has to connect wirelessly,  and there’s no on/off button on the camera itself so when it won’t turn off I either have to unplug it or just accept that it’s staying on.

PRICE - THAT IS IT. The Wyze cameras actually work BETTER. Plain and simple...these are the best home cameras on the market. I never write reviews, ever, in fact I am at work right now but felt that this company deserved a real solid positive review. I have the Wyze Pan and the standard Wyze camera. Both are awesome and they have more/better features than comparable cameras. I know because I own a Canary, 2 Ring Stick-Up cameras and another Ring camera with a light for above the garage. The Wyze cameras have a few advantages over the other cameras but that being said, the true advantage is they cost SIGNIFICANTLY less. Only things I would request would be to have the notifications shut off based on the location of my phone (I'm home), perhaps a battery/rechargeable option and a line that is made for exterior use.

Wide angle lens allows clear view of spaces and pan/tilt works as expected. Very good range of motion for such a compact and sleek camera. Several extra features would have been nice to have though, most of the fall on the software side but include; siri integration for iOS, ability to turn off both sound and video detection with one button, ability to store certain camera positions with a quick shortcut, and a more easily controllable way to control camera angle, rotation. The video quality is advertised as 1080p but I personally feel as if it was only 480p at best.

The ability to set detection zones (and stay out of certain areas) while panning is a HUGE plus.  The only annoyance that I've found is that the camera makes noise tracking objects.

Now the notification feature doesn't function properly and on top of that, the company lost their ""Person detection"" because they literally didn't read the contract that they signed with the company that they outsourced it to.  This isn't conjecture either... they openly admitted to this in a mass email they sent to their customers explaining why person detection was going away January 1st.  Person detection saves a ton of time because instead of having to sift through video every single little motion it picks up, you can skip right to the ""person detected"" videos.  Overall the whole experience has stunk of rookie mistakes and mismanagement.  Buy your camera with another, more professional outfit.",Don't buy from this company.

So I can only assume that the problem is not with the camera but with my phone. We tested the motion tracking and it worked well. The recording to the cloud works as well as the recording to the sd card. It has a wide field of view and the clarity is surprisingly good. I am including a picture taken from the app. Forgive the messiness, I am a slob. Pictures save in PNG format and video saves in mp4 fprmat, both in 1920x1080.",Works and is worth the money

Sometimes we get a notification and sometimes we get the video. The camera is connected to 2 phones and the notifications and videos don't appear the same of both phones.  I did a live chat with Wyze and the person couldn't help me and was going to send it to the next level of support.  I haven't heard back from anyone. If the camera wasn't so inconsistent I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope Wyze is reading this and will make the necessary changes to make this a GREAT camera instead of an OK one.,Very Inconsistent

I'm often at work or on business, so its reassuring to know what is going on around my house and to know there is a video of it all on the cloud somewhere.","I'm new with cameras, this was really easy to setup."

Moving object tracking works, and will actually follow multiple targets, alternating back and forth. I wouldn't even say this requires setup, just plug it in and connect to the app. Sharing with other people is a snap too. The biggest downside (really only downside) is the lack of integration with Google Assistant / Chromecast. We also have a Nest so that we can call up the video (its in our daughter's room, so quick pull-up on other devices is quite helpful), but if Wyze starts integrating with these services I can see no reason to go elsewhere.

The panning feature is VERY erratic. It may focus on movement in the camera field of view, but then in pans 180 degrees or extreme left or right so now the object is no longer in the field of view. I would not recommend this item.",Does NOT work offline

Super ideal to have one camera that can move and view different angles around the house. I initially got this for my dog (he gets anxiety when I leave him home) and it’s super convenient that I could talk to him through the camera. You could set up motion detection, where the camera follows a moving object. There is also a memory card you could insert to have all footage stored there. Only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I don’t get notified when there is motion going on in the house, this would be a super convenient feature and I hope they work on that. Other than that, it’s great! The quality is great and the motion on the camera doesn’t lag. Amazing product for the price!",Accurate description & great customer service

The power cord seems to get in the way of mounting the camera as well but it worked out in the end. I love this camera and you can’t beat the price.

It was cheap enough to start off with one and see how it worked, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I ended up getting a few more, as well as SD cards for each, and I was still paying less than for one high end Nest cam.

I returned after it failed to perform. They took out the one important feature because the contract were terminated by their partner. I love the cute design though. The picture and voice clarity is absolutely stunning. Hopefully they will improve the features otherwise it is a complete waste of money.,Disappointed with the features

Decent zoom. Decent picture. Two-way audio. Simple setup, the app is a breeze. Optional cloud service or 32gb memory card. I’m sure there’s more that I’ve missed, but those are all of my favorite features. I use mine to watch my dogs while I’m at work. Apartment life’s no fun when there are barking pups. The only semi-negative thing I have to say about this camera is that there is a bit of a delay with the two-way audio. For under $40, though? That’s a-okay with me.","Two Months of Research, and This is the Best Affordable Camera I Found"

We are using it as a monitor for our toddler's room. The motion detection is very appealing for this reason, as soon he will have freedom to roam when we put him in a toddler bed rather than his crib. The picture quality is impeccable!

It is difficult to hear what is happening in the room unless the camera is RIGHT next to the crib, which defeats the purpose of having a view of the entire room.

It was extremely easy to set up, and to my knowledge hasn’t  disconnected from our wireless even once after 3 days (in same room as router). I bought this to spy on a new foster dog while I was away at work for a few hours to make sure he was ok in his crate. It has been a life changer and I don’t have to stress! I have the motion alert set, although normally I just plug my phone into the charger (does run battery down if you are viewing all day) and watch the live stream at work. The app is really easy to use, and I like that if you rotate phone sideways it goes to a full screen view. It has a running date/time stamp so you know it is current and working. The WiFi at work is crappy, so I ca easily tell when it’s disconnected because the clock stops and then it lets you know  and I can reconnect. The lighting has also been really good, it adjusts to a bright window on one side of the room during day, and I can see really well at night. Be aware the app for me automatically was set to use cell data, so I had to go turn that off in settings. For the price and the ease of use, you can’t top this camera!

What's the point of having the camera, if I'm unable to view it.  Both are getting returned, and I'll find a better system.","Decent camera, poor software"

I monitored my home from halfway across the world: I could ensure that my home heating system was functioning (LED display in field of view), and that the sump pump area in the basement was dry. This was made very easy due to the pan/tilt feature. Another are of improvement would be the sensitivity of the Microphone.","Excellent set up instructions, works really well"

I have it high up on the wall in the corner (a longer cord would be nice).  However, the sound consistently drops every night and during her naps on my app (iphone).  It indicates sound is on but nothing comes through; turn sound off and on again and it works.  Both app and camera are updated and all settings are correct.  Because of this, I'm going to have to either buy a different camera to try or buy an alexa with video to use this one.

In short, even with the camera having detecting motion and sound off and having the schedule set to a minute in the morning (08:00-08:01), the camera still records clips throughout the day and night as soon as I pass the camera. There is no way to disable this, nor can you delete the individual clips through the (iOS) app. This is to me a huge privacy concern, since it would seem from the settings that no events should be recorded.

Camera has excellent quality.  The immediate reaction to commands is impressive.  All for the price. Second, if you are planning on using this as a baby monitor, forget it.  Actual baby monitors are expensive for a reason.  Motor that rotates the camera is noisey.  The push notification does NOT work and if you aren't right next to a router you lose signal and you habe to MANUALLY restart the camera for it to connect.  Network connection issues is a major pain in 2019 with all of the technology at our fingertips.  If you want to watch your pets throughout the day, this is the camera for you.

I'm using a small 4GB micro SD card.  You'll need this if you want to record about 9 hrs of continuous video. I have it on the front widow sill (inside my house).  When sun is not shining on the camera, photo and videos are clear.  When you try to zoom in on an object, there is pixelation.  Someone standing 10 ft from the camera (through the window) can be recognized, 15 - 20 ft, no way. When sun shines on the camera, you get a ring reflection (sun shines on the window and reflects light and camera picks up the reflection).  Night time, turning night vision on will also reflect on the window making viewing not visible.  Notification when motion detection didn't work for me until Wyze support informed me that I needed to use an app from the apple store called IFTT.  It basically has you connect to an API interface to your cam. It's like when use use a 3rd party app to connect to Amazon's Alexa enabled devices; e.g. plug to control a light.  IFTT (if that, then this) has prebuilt macros and you tell it to do something (e.g. text you) when the cam is triggered (motion detection).  Why can't Wyze do this without a 3rd party app. NetVue came can do this.  Odd. In any case, I'm limited to 100 notifications a month (unless, I'm presuming I pay for additional notifications using IFTT).  Notifications were being triggered and I was getting text whenever motion was detected.  I noticed notifications were not consistent. I've walked in front of the cam several different days and it didn't notify me.  Keep this in mind.  Overall, Wzye cam is easy to set up and use. For internal monitoring, I'm sure you won't have sun reflection problems, and motion detection problems or night vision issues. Using for my specific needs, it's a little flawed.  I wish the text notification was built into Wyze app.  Perhaps a s/w upgrade will fix this.  Not perfect, but decent for $ 35.  I do like the 360 rotation and up and down mobility of the lens.  I hope they improved the notification software as it is good, but not great. Lastly, if a notification occurs, it does record a segment of the video onto the micro SD card.  You use the mention to look at Notifications and can replay the snippet.","Good Cam with a few flaw, worth $ 35"

I love that I can connect it to our Amazon Echo devices and it connected easily and the video is pretty good for a small, low priced camera. The Wyze app though will not pull up the camera when I open it and constantly says it has trouble connecting. This is super frustrating seeing as I have to use my app to pan the camera and use the voice feature. So I have to re connect it every time I open the app on my phone. The sound/video is also about 5-8 seconds delayed. All in all for the price it does what we need it to do, but it would be nice if the connection problems weren’t an issue and the delay wasn’t so bad.","Does the job, App has conncectivity problems"

You cannot beat it’s performance in this price range. I was able to watch my pet turtles from literally on the other side of the world a few weeks ago.

It's a little noisy when night vision is on (lots of clicks).  To me, that's worse than the sound of it panning, so I just use it in normal vision mode.  It would be nice to have a web app, but the phone app works ok.  I currently have Arlo Pros for most of my cameras, but those suckers die often enough that I won't be replacing them as they are way too pricey.

It does everything right and addressed pretty much all the gripes I had with cameras from other brands. I will mention the most important ones: 1. video clips covers the time before the event , so if someone runs quickly across the field in front of the camera, the recorded video clip captures the whole event; When my neighbors turns on his backyard light, the video clip's first 0.5 seconds shows the dark backyard. This is done right! 2. Prompt notification How fast is it? Usually within 1-2 seconds after I walked into the detection zone of the camera, I got the notification on my phone! 3. Able to download the cloud stored video clips to my phone. 4. Has time stamps on the video clip. 5. Generous cloud storage, once put in a SD card, the local storage was very robust and doesn't take too much space thus can do a continuous recording for a very long time. What can be improved? 1. the schedule function can be more flexible, now it is all or none, 2. If it can detect the presence of my phone and stop sending notification, that would be even better. (more IFTTT support is always great) 3. When are you going to have an outdoor version?",Does everything right
