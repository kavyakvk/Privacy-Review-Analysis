Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,IoTGuy,"I have been researching a video doorbell to replace my current Arlo Pro camera that I had on my front door. I was torn between the Ring and the Nest. After watching and reading other's reviews, the Nest's 4:3 picture made more sense to me than a 16:9, which makes everything fish-eyed. The facial recognition works as advertised and is already identifying the USPS and UPS drivers. I have both a Google Home Hub and Echo Show 2 and the camera works great on both.",Excellent Video Doorbell
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Aug 2020,AmandaRubntug,"I love the design of the Nest but the main reason I went with this over the Ring is the button push! The click and the chime is instant gratification. If you have used a Ring doorbell you know what I mean, theres no haptic feedback. I easily installed this my self, I had to buy the power supply separately since I don't have an existing door bell. I also had to buy a longer masonry drill bit to get through the stucco exterior wall. Choose a spot on a stucco wall carefully as once you drill you might get stuck with an uneven doorbell. Regardless I highly recommend this over the Ring!",The button press is so worth the price!
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Jun 2020,Dave,"I purchased this because my wife and I were gifted a Nest Hub recently, and after many hours of research, decided to purchase a Nest Hello after moving into a new house.

You should know that if you live in an older house, you may have to upgrade your doorbell transformer in order for this doorbell to work. This wasn't that difficult, but locating the transformer can be a quest in itself.

The doorbell has been very reliable and provides a great piece of mind since it records 24/7. The only downside is the monthly subscription, but I knew this going into it.",Awesome home security doorbell
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,GGHopwood,"Absolutely love it. I have it for home but also for my office when I'm away. I really like that now it's only one affordable  fee for all the cameras in your home. It's peace of mind and very convenient for someone to reach out if you're not there. The camera quality and audio is very good too. Also, it's fairly easy to setup. It's step by step and several resources are available for installing.",I love it.
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,GHOSTLEADER,"This Nest Door bell is good overall. But that’s it it’s just good I had an issue with this nest doorbell after a couple of days of rain it went out. I went trough all the necessary steps to try to reboot it but unfortunately it was basically destroyed from days of rain. Took it back to Best Buy as we only had it around six days before it went out. Best Buy exchanged it for us. We installed the new camera but had issues bringing it back on line to my nest account.But because I didn’t have the original nest contract number I had to call nest customer service. I was able to resolve the issue through nest, however the wait time for nest customer service are exceptionally long you may want to pack a lunch. I bought a protective silicone case to protect the door bell from going out due to weather. It’s been a good couple of months and I have had no issues after protecting it from outdoor weather which I think is crazy being a doorbell is usually outside in the weather. So why didn’t nest design this doorbell to work in water, snowy and cold environments? You will have to ask nest.. From what I’ve experienced is a poor execution for an outdoor doorbell camera. I feel there should be no need for me to buy a rain coat for my doorbell nest should pay me for having to buy such a ridiculous item and the charge $100.00 a year to store 10 days of video. Did I mention this $100.00 is per nest cam so For every nest cam you put in your home it is going to cost you $100.00 so five cameras that’s $500.00. This is why I don’t plan on buying any more of these cams I’d rather record my video locally locking my dvr locked in a safe location. When nest wants to be a little more reasonable on there prices I’m out.",It Works
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Jul 2020,TheGreatDoorbo,This product checked almost all the boxes for what I wanted. I was hoping that being able to create “zones” I could avoid getting notifications for every passing car. Not the case. I turn notifications off when not expecting someone. Not really effective for having an app and doorbell that should work together. Maybe the developers will add more customizations.,Good overall
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Mar 2020,WarpedTrekker,"The Nest Hello works great and the video is good. Night vision pretty good too. The transformer in my house is 16v 10A and it works with the Hello. Other competing doorbells would have required me to wire in another transformer. Nest Hello is a great addition especially if you have other Nest products. You can manage it all in the Nest app, or access it in the Google Home app. Streaming the doorbell video to my Chromecast TV is great. I ask Google Assistant to show my front door and the TV switches inputs and shows the live video. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great because it shows people head to toe, and also I can see my patio where packages are left.",Excellent security camera

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Sep 2020,eeakin2018,i switched the doorbell from ring to the nest and I love the quality of the camera. The only thing that I am not real thrilled with is that the nest monthly coverage is a bit more expensive than the ring. You could do $3 a mo for the ring but nest is $6.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Popatlal,"I have been in the Nest ecosystem for a few months with their thermostat and added the camera. Google Nest had the package deal at Best Buy which offered the Google Nest hub free with the purchase of the Nest doorbell. 
The installation was fairly simple since the Nest doorbell is powered through the doorbell wiring. 
I also got the Nest Aware free trial for 30 days, 

Setup was relatively easy, and the only difficult part is figuring the transformer rating on the chime device because the text was difficult to read. 

Connecting the doorbell camera to my WiFi was easy as I already had the Nest thermostat and used the Nest app. I can stream the camera to a computer, my phone, and my Google Nest hub, 

I turned off the motion notifications as it picked up every car that drove by. 

Overall the product seems to work well and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",Perfect Doorbell with Camera

There is two-way communication, so you can speak to the person at the door through the app. What I found convenient, was that I was able to see faces on my Apple Watch!

I bought it replace my Ring doorbell because it took so long to connect to the app to see who was at the door. Nest is much quicker. It took a little more time to install than my ring doorbell did because you have to install a piece into the chime box. It was still pretty simple overall.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2018,tristan,"I was skeptical about getting a smart doorbell due to the price, but since I needed a security camera and I wanted to replace my doorbell anyway, I took a hard look to the Nest Hello and after hearing from a friend with Nest camera, I decided to give it a go. I was blown away by the image quality. The HDR camera is by far of any smart doorbell or security camera I've seen. I have this doorbell facing south, thus, in this time of the year, having the sun directly on frame, not a single shadow or highlight blown or lost. It captures every single detail.
Another great thing over the Ring 2 or the original Ring is that the Nest Hello records 24/7, which allows me to scrub through the day really easily. 
Also, it integrates seamlessly with my Google Home, Google Home Hub and Chromecast, so I can always ask google to show me the camera and the speakers will announce when someone is at the door.
My favourite feature is Familiar Faces, so if one of my friends or family members is at the door (even if they don't ring the doorbell), I'll get a notification that that specific person is at the door and the Google Assistant will also say that that person is at the door.
The audio is pretty good.
One drawback is that you need a strong and robust WiFi connection for the streaming to work 24/7.

TL;DR: You definitely cannot go wrong with the Nest Hello.",The best smart doorbell / security camera.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Jan 2020,Brian,"I have the Nest and my father has the Ring. The Nest is approximately half the size of the ring but double the weight. The best way I can describe it is the Ring feels like a toy from McDonald’s and the Nest feels well built and high quality. Over the past month, the performance has matched the quality build. FYI, you will have to purchase a subscription to enable all the features. If I remember correctly, it’s $5 a month.",Better than Ring

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Feb 2020,Shay,I am still in my free trial period but this doorbell is awesome. It integrates with my nest hubs flawlessly and the notifications have been on point for the most parts. I still have had some times where it senses motion but doesn’t alert me but for the most part it does. It does take up a lot of data though if you let it run 24/7 as I do.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Jul 2020,Elmo,As a video doorbell this nest rocks! Now we can clearly see when a package has been delivered and it’s so easy to see and interact with people at the door. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because there is now NO WAY that this system can turn on the porch light when the camera sees a person at the door or when the doorbell is rung. That capability was removed and so the system is really a not so smart home type system anymore. I hear google is going to do something about it and that would be great. Not holding my breath - so now I’ll have to hire a consultant to create a true smart home security system where everything interacts with each other. Oh well. If that’s all I can complain about Then I’ll count myself as pretty lucky! It’s a good system - it just doesn’t talk to other things like lights.,This is hard to rate

We have the thermostats, and this doorbell easily integrated with the Nest iPhone app.  We replaced an existing wired doorbell, so this was a very simple install. Be sure to read installation procedures to confirm this will work in your own home. Likes: learns your face, so easy to identify visitors; recognizes when a ""package"" is dropped off (and picked up); starts recording as someone walks up, not when someone presses the doorbell; easy to talk to a visitor through the camera; phone app works great.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Gwailou,"Ever since I installed this unit in my front door, religious solicitors and various other annoying people have stopped coming to my door. Some still do, but they don’t ring the doorbell, and I won’t answer the door without a ring.
I love that it records motion, and signifies it between motion and people. What I don’t like is the fact you need to pay a monthly sub to keep the 24/7 recording. They do have a very affordable plan, but I wish there was a way to set it to record to a local NAS or something, instead of it being cloud based. 
People don’t like it because they know once they ring, they are recorded. But most people don’t realize it records on motion, too, so even though they knock still, thinking they are avoiding the record, they still are saved forever into my phones list of people to ignore.
It can be a bit sensitive with the motion detection, and I do get false reports of people coming to the door, who are just walking down the street. It’s good for an anti social introvert like me, to know what’s happening outside without having to leave my comfortable chair.",People don’t like it but I love it

Easy to install, though I did have to drill new holes since the holes for the old doorbell would not have positioned the doorbell properly. I changed the doorbell transformer only because I installed one in front and the rear; with just one Nest Hello I would not have needed to do that, as the old transformer works fine with just one. Night vision is acceptable, though you can't really identify individuals. Notifications work well. I do wish there were a way to stop a snowflake from causing a motion alert. I wish the exposure would adjust to contrast (shadows/sunlight) better, though I gather that the Nest is better than others in this regard.",Great product with some room for improvement

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Sep 2020,Emily,"I like the view, it's great and the facial recognition is cool too. The reason why I took two stars off is because I set up the zones so that I don't get notified when everyone and their mother walks by. It says  a person was detected in the zone but when I look at the view they are like 20 feet away. Our zone is set up within a 2 foot radius from our door since we are in a condo. None of our neighbors or people coming in the building come close to the zone we setup but we still get non-stop messages and it drains my battery. I have to keep them on because we need to know when someone comes up to our door and don't ring the bell or drop off a package. It also says there has been a package dropped off if someone is walking by with bags in their hands. It's pretty annoying. And considering we are paying extra for this service is really frustrating. I do think it is more expensive than it should be and the extra cost for facial recognition and having the zones is hardly worth it.",Zones don't work

I love the Nest Hello because it added a doorbell where I didn't have one and it rings on the various google assistant devices in my home. Every once in a while it disconnects from wifi but resolves itself in a few minutes. It's also a little sensitive. It sets off the motion sensor when bugs fly in front of it or when something far away like a car goes by on the street. Probably something that can be fixed in a future software update.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2018,SecretAsianMan007,"Installation of the actual camera was a breeze. I live in a house build in the 50s so the door bell system had to be slightly upgraded before the Nest Doorbell would work. I had to change the transformer yo a newer and more powerful one. It was pretty simple but I would consider myself pretty handy. Hopefully your door bell system will work. 

Once installed, the camera worked wonderfully. The resolution was very clear. I especially love the iOS Nest Application as it is easy to navigate and use. Downloading video clips are a breeze! I highly recommend this camera.",Excellent camera. Love the Nest App Interface

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Trentimus,"I have a bias for the Nest eco system. I have the thermostat and multiple outdoor cameras. The Nest Hello just goes one step further to learn people's faces, and it alerts my Google Home products. It's really fantastic. The only draw back is if your front door faces a street it will think cars are people and notify you each time. This isn't a huge deal because your smart phone will have a little 4 frame clip of what is at your door, and if something is happening you can view it on the Nest app. The night vision quality is incredible.

I love this for my wife, it will say over the Google Home ""Someone is at the door"" when someone hits the ringer. Especially on the Google hub it will show up with a visual. Then you can use Google home to send an automated response through the doorbell that keeps it anonymous whether someone is home or not. You also have the choice to listen and speak live.","Get more information, feel safer"
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Jan 2020,DocTheSpot,We have it linked to our nest account so we get alerted every time some walks up to the door.

Maybe in the future there would be an update for a better video resolution or maybe a new camera at 1080p which most doorbells have.

It does work when talking to someone at the door.
The app isn't my favorite and doesn't allow you to always pan the camera when you are zoomed into a picture.  However you can pan the camera during live feed.

Only being able to log in with one account is also inconvenient. It is either myself or my wife's account that can log in. If she were to change her password for whatever reason, I wouldn't have access to the Nest.",Meh

One useful trick I learned was that you could use an external battery pack to power the doorbell prior to final installation to ensure you place it at a good height that you're happy with.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 May 2020,KimmerC71,"I am not impressed with the Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell. It does not work well. The notification sound on my phone is the same as all my other notifications and is not changeable. Therefore if my Nest Door Bell has a notification it isn't any different than if I get a notification from NBC News. Also ,there is the option to get notified if your Nest Doorbell hears a sound at your door. Well once I realized it would go off due to the wind blowing and birds chirping I turned that feature off in the settings. Guess what, it still notifies me of sounds at my door even in the middle of the night. I purchased the Nest Doorbell because the home we purchased had a Nest thermostat and thought I would like having the same app for both. I wish I had purchased the Ring like we had in our old home. It was a much better product.",I am not impressed.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,2,23 Mar 2020,Disappointedcustomer,"I bought two Nest doorbells from Best Buy. The first one installed easily. The second doorbell would not work. Finally after about two hours of trouble shooting, my electrician called the Nest ""Help"" department.  The problem was diagnosed as the doorbell in question having a faulty component. My electrician worked an extra two hours trying his best to do the job he was hired to do. However, since the doorbell contained a defective part, it was impossible to install. I am not happy that the Nest company has such poor quality control. The doorbell should have been tested before it was allowed to be sold. I had to wait for the replacement component to be mailed to me, and then my electrician had to return a second time to completeI the doorbell installation. I want the Nest company to reimburse me for the extra time that my electrician had to spend in an effort to follow the Nest installation directions, The faulty parts contained in my doorbell purchase caused me stress, caused my electrician stress, and necessitated my having to rescheduling appointments that I had made.

You might get a doorbell notification when somebody rings the bell, but no video. However, there are no problems when you are connected through cellular network.

We absolutely love the ease of use of the new doorbell camera & installation was a breeze, but we simply wish the actual chime when someone rings the doorbell was much louder. We've looked all over to find a way to make it louder & we simply cannot find a way. It's audible, but not as loud as we'd like b/c with us having dogs & our media room is upstairs, we don't always hear the ring when someone is at our front door.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,2,23 Nov 2019,UFalum88,"The nest hello is an excellent video doorbell. However, it must be used with the nest aware service. There is a monthly charge for this and there is not enough warning when you purchase this item. Once you get the doorbell, I believe you get one month of the service and then it's cut off. During the first month, when someone comes to your door there is a short video taken of their time in front of the camera. Once the nest aware services off, the doorbell is almost useless unless you're speaking to someone live. There is no video of the person nor even a snapshot. This is because the camera starts to record as soon as there is motion in its field of vision. So the most you will get is possibly a picture of their shoe coming into the frame. Therefore, it is almost useless for recording people who come to your door while you're not there.  Nest aware cost between $5 and $30 a month. So, factor that in when deciding whether to purchase this item.",Works great until Nest Aware runs out

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2018,MadHatter,"I have been in the Nest ecosystem for a few months with their thermostat, and wanted to add the camera. While I did not need to replace my doorbell mechanism, the package deal offered for the Hello made it a better option compared to the stand-alone security cameras. Since it is powered through the doorbell wiring, it also simplified installation. I am also reviewing this before ending my Nest Aware free trial, and after only a few days, so this may be tainted a bit. I am trying to make sure I do not use any Aware features such as zones or familiar faces, but could be surprised next month if certain features disappear.

Setup was relatively easy, and I did not hire a pro. My house is less than 15 years old, so it has a relatively modern doorbell system. A couple of screwdrivers were necessary (a Philips for the Nest Hello, and Flathead for my old doorbell because of course); and a flashlight helped since I could not see the transformer rating on the chime device because the raised plastic text was tiny. Once I figured out which circuit my doorbell was on, I spent more time going up and down the step ladder to read each step than was necessary to perform the actual work. Connecting the doorbell camera to my WiFi took a couple of tries before it was stable enough to stream, but once complete I have not seen any issues. I can stream the camera to a computer, my phone, and my TV through Chromecast, which is a bit addicting.

As with any notification system, false positives can be annoying. I initially had the system setup to pick up sounds, but that reacted to too many things. Motion notifications also picked up every car that drove by at night. While Person notification tells me I came home, it did pick up a delivery to my house that I was able to review remotely. By the time I received the notification, the person was already gone, but he never rang the doorbell and just stayed long enough to drop off a package. I was able to view the clip of the delivery, though without the Nest Aware I do not believe I can save the video. I also started setting up zones, then realized that without the service those zones would disappear.

Overall, the equipment seems to work well, but as lots have mentioned I cannot justify the cost of the subscription service. While I recognize that having free storage of recorded video is not necessarily realistic, when I am streaming the information to my phone or computer I would like to be able to press a record button and store the live-streamed video locally. I see that as a basic service that would facilitate security without taking away from a paid service such as video storage.",A Decent Entry-Level Outdoor Camera

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Nov 2019,SanDiego,"Not ready for prime time. This doorbell functions at about half what was promised. The main difficulty I find is with the zoning feature.   According to their literature and their tech-support, we simply create a zone,  select whether we want people or motion or both to be reported and only people or motion within that zone will prompt a report to the user. Anything outside that zone may also be set to report nothing or everything.   Evidently, Nest Hello didn’t get the memo.  It continues to notify me of anything inside or outside of the zone regardless my settings. I am constantly receiving notifications on  events I do not want to know about.  

 The second and not as onerous is the facial recognition claim. It may work 50 or 60% of the time even after several different views of “familiar faces“ are committed to the system memory.  

I would not buy this unit again, nor would I advise others to buy it.",Not ready for prime time

The free 30-day trial was nice. After that, it got real. Camera quality went down. The still photo capture of the motion detected is garbage (as in doesn’t even capture any image). You can’t review any thing from even the same day, same hour, or even the same minute.  The only thing you can do is go live view or wait for someone to ring the doorbell.  And even that service is way worse now without paying the extra fee.  I could barely make out the person at the door on the app and I was inside of the house!

After being on hold for over a hour with Best Buy customer service, I told them about the problems I was having and they schedule a service repair. Again, it worked for another day and then did not work. The reason I purchased the nest smart doorbell was to know when packages arrive, 9 times out of 10 the video is offline when deliveries arrive. It's very frustrating. I called Best Buy and asked for refund due to all the issues I was having with the doorbell and they told me there was nothing they could do since I called 4 days after the return policy expiration and suggested I  contact google for a replacement.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,NosX,I really like this camera. I was originally going to go with a Ring Pro 2 however I realized this would integrate better with my just about everything Google Home and that integration works great! I like that you can set up alert zones for different areas and get alerts base on motion in that zone. It also recognizes familiar faces if you have the subscription plan. The app or my google homes will tell me who is at my door if I have them saved. The biggest down side to this and nest IMO is the subscription plans. $5 is the cheapest you can get away with when it comes to these plans and that is only 5 days of cloud storage where ring is $3 and you get 60! I think nest really needs to change that. It really made it a tough decision to purchase this because of that. Otherwise I am happy with it. Good video quality even when zoomed it. I haven't had too much use of the IR because I have a light at my front door at night but even in tests it looked good. For a wireless camera it does pretty well. Only a few dropouts every now and then and if so it's only for a few seconds and that may simply be because of my router.,I see you

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Pauly802,"The Nest Hello doorbell camera is amazing. I have my home set up around Google Home, and this is a great add on. The only thing is to get the most out of it you have to pay monthly or yearly for Nest Aware, which starts at $5 a month and I don’t think that is too bad for what you get from it. When someone rings the doorbell google will announce somebody is at the door, but with nest aware it has face recognition and if it recognizes the person ringing the bell it will say, “name” is at the front door. If you have a google home hub the video stream can also pop up automatically, and you have the option to choose a pre-programmed response, or even talk to whoever is at the door. The nest app is also very simple to use, and you can go through and see a snapshot of who has been at your door, or if you have nest aware you can even watch the video from when your doorbell was rang, and their cheapest plan lets you go back 5 days, and if you want to be able to go further back you can buy a bigger plan.

Love how I can get notifications when my doorbell sees people on the front door and even talk to them directly via a phone or google smart display. To add to that the google assistant can even show you the doorbell on smart display when someone rings your doorbell. Did I mention this thing can even learn and recognize faces too? Now the face recognition could use some work, but it’s still really cool though I must mention it requires $5 subscription to Nest aware for face recognition AND package recognition. Yes this means it can see where a package is delivered and picked up, so porch pirates have met their match now. This camera also has a very wide field of view which I love.

The Nest Hello has a lot of good features that compelled me to purchase this unit. My unhappiness has more to do with styling. The unit is simply unattractive on a house.. or at least on a colonial home. Nest needs to design a unit that can look old school and not this modern oval thing that juts out from the door.

I do not like that it did not work with my home doorbell (its an old doorbell chime box). Meaning it connected just fine but the bell is not strong enough to make the sound. So the way around it is to use a google mini as the doorbell chime. It also works with my alexa show in showing me what live views but cant get it to ""sound"" the doorbell when someone presses it on the Alexa products.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,2,23 Feb 2020,TechguyDoug,"I am a Google fan. I wanted to create a smart home setup, I love my Nest thermostat, my android tv just not the doorbell viewing. I will have a notification of a person and I tap the notification and see nothing or I have to find the dot that represents the 3 seconds of someone at my door. Compared to Ring the viewing sucks. That viewing was easier and I didn't have to scroll through a timeline to find the exact second a face showed up.",Viewing events are terrible!!!
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2018,alquek,"Just recently installed my Nest Hello and it was easy to setup. Install wasn't too complicated, you just need to know where your doorbell chime is and how to take off your old doorbell and you should be good. Just a good flathead screwdriver should do the trick, maybe some wirecutters and pliers, but those are not necessary. Unit itself is clean and stylish. Picture quality is excellent and the app is great if you're already familiar with the Nest apps. The ability to have 2-way communication as well as pre-recorded messages by Nest to use when you want to respond quickly without talking yourself are great. The facial recognition is also fast and it starts to learn who people are and will start to recognize familiar faces. Last but not least, one of the best features is if you have Google Homes in your house, you can set it up so that it can announce that someone is at the door when someone rings it, and it can even tell you who, if it recognizes who it is. Overall, a great product from Nest!",Excellent Smart Doorbell
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2018,davidjc70,"I really love the new Nest Hello Doorbell. Installation was a breeze! The hardest part, which really wasn't that hard, is that I needed to change my doorbell transformer. My old transformer was rated at 16V 10VA which didn't work. I bought a 16V 30VA and it worked perfectly so definitely make sure all of your wiring and your doorbell transformer meets the minimum requirements. Set-up was very easy through the Nest app. It walked me through all the steps from start to finish which made it super easy to install. Since having the doorbell over the last week it's been great. It's very sensitive so it picks up the motion of cars driving down the street. I need to change the zones so that it picks up a little closer of a distance. If I'm away from home it picks up pretty quickly if there is motion or someone at my house and rings the doorbell to alert me. The picture quality is great as well as the sound quality. I never had a Ring doorbell to compare but I can say that this one is very solid.",Love the Nest Hello Doorbell!

The hardest part of setup was climbing through the hot attic to find the old doorbell. I also could not find where the power to the doorbell was fed from so I did all the wiring with power on. Ties in nicely with the nest thermostat and using the app made setup simple. Take a picture of the qr code on the doorbell and the app walks you through the setup. 
Camera quality is great although there is a fisheye kind of view. The familiar faces feature is nice and lets you know who is there after it learns each persons face. If someone rings the bell the google home mini will even announce who’s at the door if their face is recognized. My neighbor has the ring and this camera is hands down a way better camera than his.

REVIEW
We finally decided to take the plunge into the world of smart WiFi doorbells with video to keep an eye on things. After looking at the various options out there, I decided to go with the Google Nest Hello. I’ve had a very good experience with my Nest Thermostat, and I liked the idea of having one app that controlled both devices.

The Nest Hello app does a great job of walking you through the installation process; including how to determine if you have the correct wiring and power to run the Nest Hello.

During the setup, the app alerted me that the transformer for my original doorbell was only 5 volts, which isn’t enough to power the Nest Hello. By “alerted me”, I mean that it told me to look at how many volts my transformer would output. The Nest Hello requires something in the 12 to 16 volt range if I recall correctly. Understandably, the Nest Hello app tells you that if you don’t meet their requirements, you should buy their power adapter. I get it, they don’t want the liability of telling someone to change their power transformer.

However, I did not like their option of having another power supply being plugged into a wall outlet and then punching a hole in the wall to get it to the Nest Hello outside.

A quick trip to Home Depot and $16 later, I had a transformer that met the requirements. If you are handy and a DIYer, you’ll have no trouble installing the transformer if needed. It’s a great option to keep all of the wires hidden in your wall.

The device was very easy to setup via the app and does a great job of alerting us when there is activity at our door. The number of alerts you get may or may not bother you, but you can adjust them. You can also create a custom zone so the camera doesn’t catch activity like a car driving by.

My only complaint with the Nest Hello is that it uses a lot of bandwidth to transfer the video to the Nest service. I have two teenagers and for the past 3 years, I’ve never received a notice from my ISP that I’ve used my full bandwidth cap. That’s with two teenagers streaming NetFlix and YouTube constantly.

But within 1 week of having this up and running, I got an alert that I was at 80% of my bandwidth allowance. Two days later, I had exceeded it and had to pay more money to my ISP.

You can adjust the quality of the video that is recorded and drop it down (or adjust it up if you so desire). I wish that the setup wizard gave me this choice in during setup rather than having to look for it later.

That aside, I’d recommend the Nest Hello to anyone looking for a video doorbell.",Nice Doorbell - watch out for the bandwidth usage
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,1,23 Mar 2020,unhappy,This product is way overpriced if you check with the competitors. The competitions doorbell has way more user friendly. If you do not subscribe to the monthly fee it doesn’t work much better than your original doorbell. I use this product for 60 days. It worked beautifully for the 30 day trial. Now it’s nothing more than a $200 doorbell button. If I could return it I certainly would. It will probably end up in my wastebasket.,Buyer beware!!!

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Feb 2020,Deniolan,"When I purchased this, the form factor was much sleeker than any of the offerings from other manufacturers.

Just keep in mind that any of these cloud-first video products chew up a lot of bandwidth sending video back to the mothership - so if your internet connection isn't the best - look for something that doesn't rely on the cloud to save the video.

Another big selling point for this one for me was that I already have Nest Protects and a Nest Thermostat in my home - so it lets me manage things from an app I already have installed on my phone rather than having to add another one.

They do not have any work arounds for this product and their “Pro Support” is basically useless and in fact most recommended returning the product outright and buying ring since ring offers an external chime you can purchase. Nest is such a great company that it is unbelievable to me they launched this product without some sort of option like an external chime like ring.

Pretty simple and of course they all do roughly the same thing. THE selling factor for us to get the Nest..was the fact that it was the only one that syncs with our Smart Displays. It also does NOT need a Chime as we have Google Assistants that act as a verbal chime throughout the house. App is fantastic and the setup was Plug and Play. We did not have wires from an existing doorbell and we found a wall plug adapter and we were up and running in minutes.

I have been using a standard nest outdoor cam for my front door security and it has been great. I could also talk through it and hear reponses... but I now know it had limitations. The nest hello doorbell/cam gives me a much better image, wider view of my porch and it also allows two way communication without having to switch on and off the microphone! Now I can talk with guests and hear their responses when I am not home or unable to get to the door. Installation was a breeze and took maybe 15 minutes or less. If you are considering a camera for added security on your front porch then look no further. It's well worth the price tag!

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,HockeyBuck,"Been a longtime Nest cam user...and I can say that Doorbell cams are a different animal than standard security cams. Shorter general range and taller field of focus are required to do it right, and Nest Hello does the job very well. We get quick texts when the cam spots a person, and a great view of the front porch and walkway.
Nest instructions are detailed and there are good videos and resources on their website to prepare you for installing Nest Hello.

Note. Not all doorbells are placed in the desired spot for a good camera view. Nest Hello includes a 15 degree wedge adapter in the box so you can adjust where the cam is pointed a little and improve your view a bit. If you need a bigger wedge to adjust your view from a bad doorbell location, 30 degree wedge mount adapters can be found for Nest Hello made by other companies at bestbuy or amazon.

I installed the Nest Hello Doorbell without any difficulty. I first replaced my existing doorbell transformer with one that could provide 8, 16, or 24 volts. I used the 16 volt terminals on the new transformer. My old transformer only supplied about 10 or 11 volts. 

The doorbell and it's software were easy to install and set up on my PC, my laptop, my tablet, and my phone. The picture provide by the Nest Hello doorbell is terrific. and it it is very sensitive to sound (I could hear birds tweeting nearby). 

I also purchased the Google Home Hub to go along with the Nest Hello doorbell. The combo was a terrific deal. I was under the impression that I could see who was at the door with the Google Home Hub and listen to them. That was indeed true. 

I was also the impression that I could speak to them via the Google Home Hub. That was indeed not true. You cannot presently talk back to the Nest doorbell via the Google Home Hub. You need to additionally use a smart phone or tablet to speak to the doorbell and talk to someone at your door. The Google Home Hub used with the Nest doorbell is not doing much more than a TV would do if hooked in with the Nest Hello.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Murdoch,"Had a disaster with another brand's video doorbell. I picked this one up and I love it. The video is crisp and I get all of the daily notifications like parcel deliveries, familiar faces, unknown faces, etc. The only time the audio has been useful is to talk to my son when he's outside with his mom playing during the day. It seems to work well, I just haven't found it useful for anything else due to the delay in getting the notification that someone is at the door. I have top of the line mesh (hardwired) with 1 gig internet and the doorbell is locked on the main router, so I don't know why I can't get better real time communication through the 2-way audio. The only other downside is having to have a subscription. I have three total cameras, including the doorbell, and although the new Nest Aware is only $120/yr, I'd rather have an option for localized storage. Also, at night it is okay, but you need to leave your porch light on or have a motion light. Otherwise you will get ghosting of moving figures and if you needed to identify someone you wouldn't be able to do it. I would think they will come out with a unit with a spotlight or something in the near future. Some of their major competitors are already doing it.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Jan 2020,stevern,"Just installed today but so far it's been great. The camera works superbly - super clear. At night, it is super clear b/w. I wish the up/down view angle was wider - can't see the ground right in front of the door (means I can't see packages on the ground there), but the left-right angles are great - very wide. When installing, look carefully at the site where it will be mounted. I had some door frame trim that was in the way of the mounting bracket, so I had to use a shim (a paint stir stick I cut to size) behind the mounting bracket to get the bracket into the right position. But the install guide was super smooth.",Nest Hello Doorbell

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,SWhitlock,"My family has the Ring system, but my house is all Google & Nest. I decided to give this doorbell a try, since I wanted to stay in the same product family. I was not disappointed. Personally, I think the Nest doorbell is a much better product in both build quality and video quality from the Ring doorbells. First of all, the picture is MUCH bigger and clearer than the Ring system, and the field of view has a bigger range than the Ring doorbells. And, when someone rings the doorbell, I not only get notified on my phone/tablets, but my google home speaker and display systems react and tell me someone is at the door. With the Google displays, I can just say ""Hey Google, show me the front door"", and it instantly shows me the live video feed; and I can also talk to the person through it too. The Nest Aware subscription has different price points, based on the number of cameras you have, and what type of video/storage you want to have. The basic plan gives me 1 camera with 5 days of video storage for around $50 dollars a year. With Nest Aware, you can save/upload/share videos, create still photos, and even set up ""monitoring zones"", so you can tighten down the monitoring area. Without Nest Aware subscription, the doorbell will only give you still photos instead of a live video feed when someone sets off the motion sensor.","Great product, and easy to set up."
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Dec 2019,Camilo,This doorbell is great we had it for a year now and still going strong ! The quality of the image is amazing better than ring in my opinion. The install process was easy but I would recommend before buying  to go t the nest website and make sure that it’s compatible with your system. On the nest app you have a lot of options and you get a free 7 day cloud recording. If you do want more than that you have to pay a monthly fee.,Best doorbell ever !

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,ChicagoJoe,"I bought this because I already had a Nest thermostat and thought it would be just as easy to integrate with my network.  Very easy to install, and the camera quality is great.  I set it up to get notifications whenever the doorbell is pressed  or someone enters my predefined zone, and it works great.  I also have it detecting sound and motion so that is recorded as well.  I'm able to watch the day's triggered videos without any subscription.  I  can view live video and communicate through the device without any problems.  If you really want to watch 24 hours of video, you can subscribe but I don't see the need for it, at least where I am.  Very happy with the quality of the video and it's overall performance.","Great camera, easy to install"

I already had the Nest thermostat so figured I'd stay with the same ecosystem. Was very easy to install (must be hard wired, not for wireless use) and was easy to use. The videos available for feature use and installation was useful. Comes with everything needed for installation. The night mode can be activated on and off, good speaker/mic quality and you can set up for notifications to be sent via text when ever the unit detects motion or sound. The 30 day trial for 24/7 uploaded recording is a nice feature, definitely recommend this unit",Works great
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Aug 2020,BillfromSalisbury,"We bought one of these Nest ""Hello"" doorbells for our back door, and liked it so much that several weeks later we bought another for our front door.  The monthly fee, which is only required if you want to see video of past events, is less than $7/month for an account which can include more than one Nest device.  The ap for the phone is quite useful, and allows you to see what's going on at any moment from wherever you are with your phone.  I especially like the fact that the ap recognizes package deliveries and actually tells you that there has been a delivery.  You can narrow down the kinds of notifications you get, to cut down on things like movement alerts when a moth flies by (it's sensitive!).  All in all, we are very pleased - and impressed! - with our new Nest Hello devices.","Nest ""Hello"" works very well and easy to set up!"

I have a 24v transformer which was a little too much for this doorbell with my mechanical chime (even though it says 16-24v is okay.)  The camera function causes the circuit to be always on which caused a hum and my chime to break.    

I researched the issue and after replacing the chime I installed a resistor to lower the voltage getting to the chime and it has been working great.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Clancy,Had the ring doorbell at Christmas but I’m more set up with google so I decided to return the ring and get the nest. Everything about the nest in my eyes is better then what the ring has to offer. The picture quietly is better the app loads faster the camera has a wide view to see everything. It works perfect with my nest Yale door lock. Only drawback which should be fixed with an update soon is the motion detection. Sometimes it doesn’t see anything or I could stand in front of the doorbell and it will take like 20 seconds for it to see me. Hopefully they fix it soon but it’s not a deal breaker since it has 24/7 recording,Great product hate the delay

Rather than panic, the problem subsided after a couple days. Now, I'm really enjoying the convince of this device.

A couple minor issues:
First a lot of functionality is tied to the nest aware subscription. I knew this going in so it wasn’t an issue for me.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Nov 2019,AmarilloWx,"Best Buy installed this product for our family within a week of purchase, though there were a few challenges during the install. The greatest part about this doorbell is the resolution that you receive through the Nest app. You can watch the camera on what the door bell receives in real time, and see short snippets of the past few days worth of notifications that you set for the doorbell. Unfortunately, you only get 1 month for free and have to pay $50 a year to continue receiving this service. If you do not sign up, you will only receive snippets and not be able to play them back. Another negative is that the notifications you do receive on your app are delayed long enough that often times the person who you would want to talk to has already left. So even if you wanted to send an alert, or make a sound, to scare off any would be package stealers, they will have already ran off with your package. 

In the end, what you get for the price compared to other products is not near as good. If you are part of the Nest family of products (like I am), this could serve as a decent addition. Otherwise, if you can find a product that finds more features, I would encourage you to seek them out.",Great Video Doorbell

In one short month this has already worked flawlessly through wind, snow, rain, and direct sunlight. Was very easy to install, like all Nest products are, and looks great on our house. I used the grade changer to get a better angle, but it wasn't absolutely needed. We've tried other similar products and this tops them. Very little to no delay in video or conversation. Sometimes a slight delay in the notification. The app is great and always runs smoothly. Only drawback I see is the price, which isn't high for what you get, and you get what you pay for.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JamaicanGeek,"I have been searching for a doorbell camera for some time, but had too many concerns with the Ring products. Then I came across this beauty and was sold. The setup was super easy. I have a 16V 10VA transformer and really small wires to the doorbell (did not verify the gauge), and this doorbell has worked flawlessly for weeks. I love that it is constantly recording so even if the motion sensor alert is slow or fails to detect motion, I still have a full recording of it - unlike ring and other cameras that only record when they sense motion. I would gladly recommend this doorbell. However, the temperature limit range leaves me s bit concerned. The max temp is 104, which summer days in Texas easily surpass. I purchased this on the tail end of this summer, so we will see how it goes in summer 2019. It is also recommended that the doorbell not be in direct sunlight, which again is something I can't help, based on the design and orientation of my house. I purchased an artificial tree to offer customizable shade as needed. I just think outside products should be able to tolerate being outside... maybe I am just crazy. Despite all this, no regrets. It has already payed for itself.",I love this thing!
Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Apr 2020,Switched,"Moved from a Ring Video Doorbell 2 to this. This is a far superior product. Installation is about the same, with the added step of the included chime. Video quality seems improved and wifi reception is more stable in the same location. Unlike the Ring, this does not require a battery (a plus in my book, since I hated having to charge the Ring battery even though it was hard-wired). Nest app is better with a better user interface. Monitoring is more expensive, but with multiple cameras it’s close to being the same price, but Ring does store video longer.",Better than Ring

the installation toke a few minutes because every door is different, and spacing/ length of the wire pig tail can add to the installation time.    The package provide a lot of clear instructions.  

I youtube the installation instruction and make sure you understand what it is trying to tell you to do before doing anything.  I feel the instruction on the app makes a lot more sense once you watch the youtube video.

I installed everything physically before I fire up the app, and click through everything.  It toke about 15 minutes to watch the video, and do the physical installation, and 5 minutes to get it on-line.  your millage may vary.

I had another smart doorbell (Skybell mini) and this blows that away. The video quality is outstanding, the latency is minimal, sound quality is good, and notifications come through consistently. I'm still tweaking my notification settings so I don't get too many, but the Nest Hello can notify you as it detects every sound, movement etc. if you like. (The birds and the bees set it off as they're doing their thing.)

It's also easy to install yourself if you have a newer home; it took me about 1-1/2 hours but I walked away a couple of times to address emergent stuff and I looked at the You Tube video two times during installation.

You get the most benefit from it if you subscribe to Nest Aware. Yes it's pricier than certain Ring plans but certain features are better.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Dwiseman109,It is what is is.. Its an expensive video doorbell that does its job. Notifications lag and without a Nest aware account.. Its not worth the money. You'll have to buy into Nest aware if you want to access all of the additional features. Otherwise you just spent $200+ on pretty much nothing.. However.. Video quality is decent and it was easy to set up and use. Not sure if I'd buy it again but I definitely preferred it over the other options in the store,Decent but comes with extra fees

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,SmartCasita,"For starters, you need to pay the $5/camera/month if you wanted to save your videos for up to 4 days. I actually like that feature. It also documents all of the motions, people at the door, and doorbell rings. It even shows you a small preview of the video on your phone, until you click to open the full video in 1080. It has night vision. 

Very easy set up/install. The step by step instructions are found on the app. Just make sure you have enough voltage to the doorbell to operate the camera. You will need WiFi.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Gzsquad,"Google's Nest Hello Cam is excellent. 

First, I purchased the product because I believe it has or had a superior program over its competition. This does stem from me knowing that Google's AI is better than its competitors which include Amazon's Ring. It is slim, sleek, and works really well. It has a wide-angle that captures motion, sound, and can detect faces and packages. You can then put a name to the faces and it will notify you if that person arrives. It will also notify you if a package is left and when it is picked up. 

Second, if you have any Google products in the ecosystem such as a Google Home Mini, Google Nest Hub, and Google Home, there is no reason to not get the Google Nest Door Bell. They all will link and work together. The doorbell rings the Nest app on my phone, my Google Home Mini in the bedroom, and my Nest Hub Max in the Kitchen.",No Complaints

Picture is MUCH better than our previous smart doorbell. (Ring). Really like that it's always recording... you don't just get the delivery guy walking away from the porch anymore. Installing the Hello was more of a challenge than the Ring, though. Wire management was a bit of an issue. Communicating with someone at the door is easier... smoother than the Ring, which was usually choppy. The annual subscription is more with Nest but in this case, you get what you pay for... and for me, the extra few $ are well spent.",Definitely an upgrade

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,TheDude,"Just like any other Nest product, the instructions were easy to follow and installation was a breeze. I chose Nest over Ring due to my positive experience with some of their other products (thermostat and cam). So far it has worked flawlessly. My wife's favorite setting is the fact you can switch the mechanical chime off using the Nest app, leaving it only to buzz your phone, so our dog wont flip out when someone rings the bell. My only concern is the minimum recommended operating temperature of -4F. We haven't hit any extreme temperatures here yet in the Midwest but when we do it could affect the performance.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,judyb,We looked at the other door bell cameras out on the market and settled on this one. I cannot be happier. Can see very clear. Works well Can set your settings the way you want. Easy to install Took about one hour from start to finish. 24 hr recording along with clips that can distinguish between person and motion. It can also learn peoples faces. With Nest you pay for what you want. You can get 5- 10-30 days of saved recordings. For this since I am home I chose the 5 day which most people go with. Each one costs a different amount and if you also put up another device you get a discount for the 2nd device. Really like it Only issue is that you cannot hear yourself on the saved recordings while talking to the person outside. So for that I give it 4 stars but I believe this doorbell fits my bill and is worth the money,Can see whats happening

With the intro free trial membership I can tell a clear difference on time and accuracy of how the video worked and reacted vs. when my free trial ended.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,1,23 Nov 2018,Jkomv,"I bought the Nest doorbell cam because I had other Nest products in the house that always worked well. However, this product has been a horrible experience. The camera is super slow to connect through the app. And when it does, it never works right. Video cuts in and out, lots of delay in the feed, and very difficult to pull up the image history. Plus, lots of false notifications of movement in the camera. By the way, I'm using a Google Wifi mesh network and the signal is very strong throughout the house.

When someone rings the doorbell, the phone notification is sometimes 30 seconds after the ring. Then it takes time to pull up the video feed, making it useless as a doorbell. Also, it won't ring my mechanical bell for some reason so I got a Google Home Mini. But I can't get that to work with the Nest doorbell even after spending 2 months with Tech Support. Nest sent me to Google, Google sent me to Nest - I just got tired of the whole thing. Still doesn't work right today. I'm replacing this as soon as I find a suitable solution.",Good Design in Concept but Pretty Worthless

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,TomN,"I had BestBuy install this for me.  You could tell that the technician has installed many of these before as he was finished in short order.  I was worried that I may not have enough wi-fi signal strength to power this thing since I had measured it at -63db which is on the low side but I do have a smart bulb out on the front porch and it works fine.  I was worried when at first during setup when it wouldn't connect but it did on the second try and hasn't lost connection at all.

I'm still in my 30-day free trial period of Nest Aware but I can already see that they've suckered me into their $50 a year annual fee because any of the worthwhile features won't work without paying it.  Until my free trial kicked in, I got a chance to see how it operated without them.  Gee, a photo of somebody's back, how nice.  But frankly, the features you end up having to pay for are exactly what make this video doorbell worthwhile.

Right away I learned to turn off notifications based on sound as the birds kept those notifications coming far too frequently.  I'd like to be notified based on motion and I did set up a zone right outside the door which seemed to cut back on the number of notifications I receive.  But I still get far too many ""false"" hits like when a car drives by even though my zone doesn't include the road or sidewalk at all.  I can understand how a spider crawling across the lens would set it off but it's sensor is very sensitive.  I may end up just turning off the notifications altogether because you do get a nice ring when someone chooses to ring the bell.  You don't have to wait for the app to load - you can respond right from your home screen.  All your Google devices will tell you there's someone at the door (if you want) which is good because sometimes I don't hear the bell from certain parts of the house but I have a Google device in every room.

I sort of like the fact that I can tell my Google home devices to project the live video image onto my Home Hubs or even any of my TVs with Chromecasts.  It makes for some boring viewing but the cool factor is there.

It's a very attractive product that works as it should, perhaps a bit better than it should but so far, I'm happy with it and I will likely end up paying their fee when my free-trial expires.",Great image but too many false hits

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,teddythetank,"Better than a cat or a dog. You can watch every car drive down your street. You will know when the mailman delivers the parcels. You will know when your neighbor's dog takes a crap on your front lawn.

And for a modest subscription fee of $50/100/300 a year, you can retain 5/10/30 days, respectively, of play back video (and audio if you enable it) for every play-by-play going on out front.

I do advise that the product streams 24/7 to the Internet, so be sure you have a fast enough connection with an appropriate data plan. Right now my camera (at the highest quality setting) is putting out 384-512 kbps. Assuming consistent 512 kbps on a 31-day month, that adds up to 159.6 GB (worst case scenario).

Wireless signal strength is also a factor, as overcrowding can create breaks in your playback stream. My research for a wired LAN adapter turned up nothing for this product. You have been warned.

AFAIK, the Wifi network you connect it to will need to have SSID broadcast option enabled, as the camera fell off the network in the middle of the night, prompting a ""Your camera is offline"" email from Nest. And it reconnected immediately after re-enabling the SSID broadcast option.",Front Door Sentry Activated

The real problem is after the free month of the monitoring service it loses most of its value. It will tell you someone was at the door, but usually does not capture a picture and if it does it only last for a couple hours. Zones don't exist and other features are lost.

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Moose,"After weighing options on the doorbells that are out there, I landed on this one because of the free Google Hub offer, and so far it has been pretty good.

The install was easy for the most part. The wires from the existing doorbell left very little slack to work with, and would not retract into the wall easily. This led to about 3 tries where snapping the doorbell in to the bracket also dislodged the wires and I had to start over.

Allowing zones and notifications specific for them is great. My one issue is that at night, the ""motion"" of a passing car's headlights on the porch trigger an alert. The good thing is that the ""person"" and ""package"" detection work great, so turning off notifications for motion alone did the trick.

The app is serviceable. I hope that with Google at the helm the app will get a little bit more of an upgrade. As is, it works as expected. You do need a home computer to set up zones.

I'm trying out the monthly $5 ""save your video clips and get a few more options"" plan from Nest. The ability to pay as you go is nice. I'll probably consider paying $5 during the months I expect to have many deliveries.",Good Video Doorbell

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Oscar,"I was a Ring Doorbell user since 2 years ago and thought it was the best doorbell product out there. I had seen the Nest Hello and never thought about switching. We ended up buying Google Home minis as well as the Google Home Hub. I saw that the Ring was not compatible with the Google Home and saw that it was compatible with Nest Hello. We were already using Nest Thermostats in our home and noticed that the Nest Hello was cheaper than the Ring Pro. Replaced our Ring with the Nest Hello and HAVE NOT regretted it. The app is miles better than the Ring app. It lets you identify faces so that when the doorbell rings and it recognizes someone, it will tell you who is at the door. The alerts and recordings are in the Nest app are so much better! They send you a screenshot of what the camera captured so that you can check if it is worth it to open the video and investigate what is going on. The Ring simply sends you an alert that motion was detected and by the time you open the app to see the video, it's too late. Nest Hello is superior and would recommend replacing your Ring with it.",Better than Ring Products

The only thing is that you must purchase their service to be able to record up to 5 days otherwise it only records still pictures so you really must pay for their service which starts at $5 per month or $50 for a year and higher (with more perks). I just went with the basic one.",We love it!

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 May 2020,Infrequentbuyer,"This is a project, not a plug and play product like ring.  I upgraded from a 1st gen ring that stopped working.  The ring had a built in battery to stabilize voltage whereas the nest hello requires you add a capacitor to your old door bell mechanism.   Attaching  a cap to my 60 year old doorbell wiring felt like a hack ( and likely to cause a short), and the cap didn’t even stabilize the 16V power supply enough to begin registration & configuration. Fortunately, after waiting 30 min,  the yellow warning light changed to blue and I could connect the ring to the internet.  If this didn’t work, I would have needed a rewriting project to upgrade my doorbell ringer box, wiring and transformer.
Pros: Night vision is cool. Good resolution.   I was able to share the Device with family over google home. 
Cons: Nest and google home apps take too long to connect, so  it’s impractical to answer visitors with the app. (It’s a poor Quality intercom) . Also, this is the only google home device I couldn’t get working with my Sony android Tv.   Advice, if you can, wait till technology matures.",I almost gave up

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Sandjam,"Replaced  Ring Doorbell Pro with this one.  Reason being is the Ring was unreliable with Amazon Echo Show display.  Also the massive motion alerts no matter how I adjusted it was horrible.
 The Nest is much better looking design.  The button is nicer feel when pressing it and what I really like is there is a chime for the person at the door to let them know it rang.   I love the prerecorded responses.  So if you are away from home in a meeting and get a notification you can just click a response to play and don't have to actually talk into your phone.  I have both Amazons Echos and Google Home and this works flawlessly with google home system.  When someone rings bells it pops up on google home display immediately and announce who it is.  Facial recognition tells you who it is if you store their picture (like mailman, neighbor, friends, etc).  Motion detection seems more refined than Ring.   However 1 big reason for me was to keep everything in a single ecosystem.  I have Nest Cams, Thermostat etc. and eliminating Ring eliminates another app.  The cost for storing video is more expensive with Nest, but because I had other nest products I got my 1st year free.   Great doorbell though and video is actually better on the Nest.  This latest version is well refined.",Great Video Doorbell

It never started recording until after the person had turned around so we were never able to captured a usable video. We also were never able to answer the door via the phone app. It always took too long to connect and by the time it connected they were gone. The nest solves a lot of these problems by always recording. We can review the entire day’s recordings to see if we missed anything.

If I wasn't already invested in the nest ecosystem, I'd have gone a different direction. First the monthly per devise subscription is expensive but that should be resolved sometime this year with the new nest aware plans. But the biggest missed opportunity with this and other Nest devices is the weak integration between other devices in the Nest ecosystem, lack of support for hubs like smartthings and non voice activated automations/routine support for Google assistant. Has so much opportunity, I'll hang in their and pay the premium for what the potential of a few software updates could do.","Overall good device, but ecosystem lacks support."

Google - Nest Hello Smart Wi-Fi Video Doorbell,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Lizzardo,"The Nest Doorbell Camera alone is fine. But, I was given a Google Hub for free by Best Buy to go with it. I thought it would be great because Nest is now owned by Google, so I could use them along with my Nest Thermostat. I made the TERRIBLE MISTAKE of integrating my accounts (the option is given to do this). Before, I did that, I was seeing the images from my doorbell camera on the Hub and was able to adjust my thermostat. Not anymore! I spent over an hour on the phone with Nest Support, but they couldn't help me. They said someday everything will be integrated. OH, JUST GREAT! So, now I have this Google Hub which is fun, but as far as using it with the Nest products, it's now useless (until someday). One of the main reasons I went with Nest for my doorbell was because I already had a Nest Thermostat. I envisioned having the ability to use it all together. Well, you kinda can on the Nest app, but you kinda can't on the Google products, sorta. It's annoying and frankly stupid that they give you the option to integrate the products. Once that's done, it cannot be reversed (which is stupid) and it basically cripples the whole concept of having it all together...until someday when they get their act together.","Would love it but, why Google?"

First, is the lag between spotting someone/ringing doorbell and notification via cell phone. Its not my Wi-Fi signal or internet upload speed. So I assume its the product.

Ability to converse with someone via a tablet, phone or video hub, great!!
Ability to set zones that trigger a notification, great!!

Does NOT record your side of the conversation if you talk to the person at your door using a tablet, phone or hub. This is insanely STUPID!!! 

Sends a LOT of false motion detections so you start to get numb to notifications. 

Notification sound can’t be changed and sounds like every other kind of notification. 

In Illinois there’s a law that doesn’t allow you to use face recognition so this is disabled in that state (look it up). Bought this for this feature only to find out AFTER installation. 

Make sure you have the right doorbell transformer and it’s relatively new. Mine was the right specs but due to age was just under the threshold of working right. Swapped with a new one and it worked just like it should. Great customer service team at Nest was able to help identify the issue and provide how to resolve the issue.",Could be better....

After several tests, there was always a consistent delay (about 21 seconds or more) in both doorbell and motion phone notifications. There would be times where I wouldn't even get a single notification on my phone. It can't be my network because I have 400mb speed and my doorbell transformer is at 22v.

Reason being, since I do not use my own doorbell on my own house, I did not realize it faces inward and not outward towards my driveway and my street, so if I installed this Nest Doorbell, then it wouldn't capture anything.  I should have looked more closely first.  I called a Nest installer, but they don't move doorbells and rewire things (then I'm not sure of their point); they said I had to call an electrician to move my existing doorbell to an outward facing position and then he would come out to install my Nest Doorbell.  So I called an electrician; he wanted to charge me a minimum of $150 to move my current doorbell.  No way.  So I returned it and bought an outdoor Wi-Fi camera instead, where I could install wherever I wanted.

I cant believe that they are in no hurry to fix this knowing that Samsung phones are one of the most popular Android smartphones in the world. One other issue is that you can not adjust the volume on the doorbell and it's very LOUD. I mean LOUD!!
