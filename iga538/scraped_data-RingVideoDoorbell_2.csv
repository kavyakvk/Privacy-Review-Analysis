"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2018,Walt Frank,"Installed today.  Low-volume, garbled audio from the speaker in the doorbell.  Apparently a hardware problem. A replacement will be shipped, but Ring first expected me to wait 7 working days or more for the replacement.  I had to insist on express delivery.  Motion detector works erratically.  Also, I am not receiving tone alerts to my phone when the doorbell button is pushed.  Ring tells me that this is due to a software problem that has to be solved at their end.  Resolution date uncertain.  Overall, performance is nothing like what Ring describes in their TV ads.  I had planned to buy more from Ring, if this first product proved worthwhile. But, after having wasted half a day on this one, I will not be buying anymore Ring products until they give me a basis for confidence.","Avoid this product, at least for the near future"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2017,Chrissy Gem,I’ve had my ring doorbell for a couple weeks now and I couldn’t be happier! I moved to a new neighborhood recently and had a lot of creepy solicitors come to my home. I paired this with a no soliciting sign. It was packaged with all the necessary tools and mounting plates needed for attaching outside my home. I plugged in the rechargeable battery and let it fully haste before going further. That took about 10 hours.I did not have an existing doorbell so I was able to mount it and set upnrahee quickly. This does come with everything you need to wire into an existing doorbell if you choose to do so. Once I figured out the best placement for my doorbell using the side angles mount I was able to attach it in minutes. I downloaded the app for the Ring doorbell and completed the set up. Once attached I placed the last security screw and was ready to go! I also purchased a chime for indoor use which is just an extra device that plugs into any outlet and rings nice and loud so you are sure to hear the doorbell. My ring is set so that it senses motion about 15 feet away. Once it senses that Ring alerts my phone and the doorbell and the chime room no to alert me someone is approaching. Video has been very clear and I love being able to talk and see whoever is outside my door without opening the door. Works great with the night vision.As a single woman living alone this is a must in today’s society. I feel much safer knowing I can look outside at a live view anytime I need to. Comes with stickers you can place on a window or door letting people know that there is video surveillance.,A must for home security

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2018,Another Consumer,"This product is not worth the money one that I regret purchasing.  Do not buy without reading. Pros Easy to setup Great documentation Cons Requires monthly service plan (while it is cheap, it adds up over time) video quality is poor and choppy no feature to send still image of what triggered motion sensor When battery starts to go dead, the unit triggers random motion sensor chimes that are confusing and annoying Once the trial is up, no storage of videos and no local storage options. Once the trial is up, alerts and notifications are delayed to the point that the person/thing that triggers the motion event are gone. Requires very fast broadband connection (min 50 - 100Mbps) Always on/Live View is the only way to view video whenever you want but it drains the battery very fast Will not work with Blue Iris and other software packages for local video storage. Bottom Line --------------- If you are non-technical and willing to pay for a service plan then this could be the product for you.  There are better options out there if you are remotely technical or if you are willing to learn.  If you care about your privacy and storing your data, then this is not the product for you. I had reasonable hopes for this product.  I was hoping for timely alerts, clean video feed, simple setup, and no need for a traditional doorbell setup.  Now this product is reduced to a standard doorbell.  All because Ring wants to force you into a monthly service plan, snoop through your data, and control you as the consumer. This product could be so much better.",This product is a huge dissappointment
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Aug 2017,Doug W,"I have mixed feelings about this product.  Before I really get started - note that when you look at the reviews they're mixed in with the reviews for the extender - the doorbell reviews are less positive. Anyway, the motion detection is terrible.  It catches cars far off in the distance and misses people walking up onto the porch.  The video quality is good when it works, which is usually.  Sometimes it just records black.  The audio quality is not understandable between the phone and the unit.  The software is kind of iffy - the software for other products like the Arlo is much better, showing useful thumbnails for the video, (and by the way not charging for storage for the first five cameras). I contacted support about the motion detection and the black video and the audio problems.  We've been circling the drain where they keep wanting me to send updated bandwidth figures and rebooting the unit (which improved the video somewhat but not the audio or motion detection) and then after that they want me to call their support number.  So basically they don't have online support, they just have a couple of canned messages that you'll get every couple of days.  Just go right to calling support.",Feels very first generation even though it isn't
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2018,Kikikins,"Three stars for the peace of mind the Ring provides, great picture quality, and low monthly monitoring cost. Two stars off for bizarre motion sensitivity that significantly lowers the usefulness of the product. My house faces a quiet street that dead ends several homes down, only neighborhood cars and delivery trucks pass by my house.  The front door sits ~10 feet from the street, with a single car driveway on the left half of the property and a small patio and landscaped area (with a tree) on the other.  The Ring is installed at my front door and gets a perfect fish eye view of the patio/landscaped area, with equal views on either side of my driveway on the left and my neighbor's driveway on the right. I have the Ring set to the lowest motion sensitivity, which, according to their chart, means it should only pick up motion right on my patio or the inside edge of either driveway (see picture - the Ring should only pick up motion in the blue areas). 1. People: this works well, but because the sensitivity is set so low, there's a few second delay. It mostly picks up delivery drivers as they are leaving my front porch, unless they're slow to place the package.  This isn't really a huge problem, but if someone were to steal a package from the porch, the camera would not be quick enough to pick up a face. 2. Traffic: it picks up EVERY. SINGLE. CAR. that drives by, even though it's far outside of the selected sensitivity area. I get dozens of notifications every day as my neighbors innocently drive up and down our quiet street. 3. Driveways: It picks up my neighbor's car when they pull into their driveway, but doesn't pick up my car in my driveway.  Even if I park in the driveway, it doesn't pick up any motion until I get out of the car and approach the patio. I can't figure out why it likes their car better than mine, when the field of vision is exactly the same. Ideally, I'd like the Ring to pick up motion on my patio and the closest part of my driveway only. As it is, it only picks up patio motion within a couple feet of the door and nothing in the driveway, but somehow still picks up EVERY CAR in the street. In reality, this camera serves little purpose other than the live view function. I can't check the dozens of motion notifications I get each day when 99% of them are cars. I use the Ring alarm system as well, and I like that this is all in one app (and one price for monitoring). I wish I had more controls around the sensitivity of the camera, and that it was better at filtering out motion outside of the set zones.","Nice peace of mind, but unevenly applied motion sensitivity limits usefulness"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Apr 2018,Mark D. Anderson,"I read reviews, which is why I purchased the product, that were 4 and 5 stars. What I missed was the fact that the reviews were from the product being hard-wired; that is, not using Wi-Fi. I use Wi-Fi: fiber optic cable internet; router w/in line-of-sight and about 20' from an extender; and, router w/in 40' of doorbell itself and 20' from extender. This Wi-Fi use of the product, due to a weak signal despite the close proximity to the router and an extender, causes the video to ""ratchet""; that is, you see someone in motion, then nothing for 4 - 5 seconds, then a brief motion detection again. In other words, useless. A lot of money for useless. Can't return because it has been over 30-days. It took me that long to figure out what was going wrong. DO NOT buy if you intend on using Wi-Fi!",Wi-Fi connectivity can render the product all-but useless.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2018,CiraldoFamily,"Imagine leaving your house, getting in your car and then driving away. Then, once you are three blocks away from your house, your phone alerts you that motion was detected at your door. I got that notification this morning. I was the motion, and it took that long to tell me. That's, well...useless. Completely useless. Who needs a doorbell that tells you someone was there a while ago? And if you want to know who that someone was that came to the door ten minutes ago, it won't tell you. Not without a monthly fee, that is. Because, unlike it's competitors, there is no video history AT ALL unless you pay for it. For as much as Ring charges, you should be able to expect it, at a bare minimum, to be reasonably responsive and to allow you to at least see a live feed of the camera and a picture of who was there without having to pay for it. I could not be more disappointed in this device.","Unreliable, Unusable without paying for additional features"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2018,NeverFinished,"Biggest waste of money I've made in a long time. Bought this in mid November, 2017. Battery goes dead in about a month. Takes hours to recharge. Doorbell is 60 ft from the router. Originally got a weak wifi signal. Spent more money on a Ring Chime Pro. It's 40ft from the router and 20 ft from the doorbell. Still have weak signal issues. Also have 2 Ring Chimes. One loses it's connection to system regularly. I'm resetting something every few days. After the first 30 days you have to have the subscription to access your recored activity. The final straw is it takes a minute or more to access the app to answer the doorbell. Whoever rang it is gone by then. Don't buy this product. It's not worth a damn.",Very expensive unreliable doorbell.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Aug 2017,suz702,"I was a little apprehensive about a couple of things. Was this really a worthy investment, when I actually don't get many uninvited visitors at my door, and mostly deliveries? I already have an alarm system, and security door. Yet, I am gone most of the day, so being able to see what's going on at my door makes sense. My other concern is that my porch has an enclosure and the doorbell does not face front, there is a walkway from the street to my front door, which is a little secluded, and I face my neighbors home, in a Townhome community. Ok, let me dispell a couple things that may have prevented me from purchasing this. I read that with the Ring Doorbell 2, you will receive mounting wedges that will widen your viewing angle in instances where your porch is enclosed like mine. When I was installing mine, I tested the angle before the actual install, with the wedge and then flush to the wall. The difference was barely noticeable! This has an Incredible wide angle lens that captured the walkway around the enclosure wall just fine. So I did the flush mount. Also, it is suggested that you mount the doorbell no more than 4ft off the ground, and there is a wedge that you can install to point the camera in more of a downward direction. Again, I did not find that to be necessary. My existing doorbell was probably 5 ft off the ground and it didn't make much difference in the viewing angle, but I suppose if you want to see packages on your porch, you may want to consider this. I did not use it. One bonus for my neighbor, since we share the same walk way, I can see people approaching their door too, so if anything ever happens over there, I can share video that I have. The install was very easy. The app was a no nonsense install but you must operate it on a 2.4G band WIFI. I have a dual band router with 2.4 and 5G You then must go into your router set-up and disable the 5gh. It is simple to do, and does not effect the quality of your WIFI signal to any of your other devices in any way. Okay, now, if you are getting bad or choppie reception from your Ring Doorbell, the company advises that you spend another 50.00 (49.99) to buy a chime extender.....um, how bout NO!  Listen folks, you can buy their version and it will play chime  tones if your Ring Doorbell is not hard wired to your exiting doorbell, but if it is, you don't need it. ANY WIFI EXTENDER WILL WORK. I already had a TP-Link WIFI extender that I bought a couple years ago, and it works just fine, my cost then 19.99, the cost today on Amazon, 19.99. Up to you if you want to save 30.00. Another concern was my metal Security Door, interfering with the WIFI signal. It seemed to. I put the WIFI extender in the closest electrical outlet to my doorbell, and PROBLEM SOLVED! Do you need the Ring Cloud service at 3.00 a month or 30.00 a year? That again is up to you. But you can save and share a video to your email without cloud service. Let me mention the installation one more time. I hardwired mine to the existing doorbell wires <simple> they tell you to turn the power to the doorbell off at the breaker. I didn't, nothing happened. But again, do what they say, not what I say!  I installed on stucco, again, simple, but you are gonna want to use a smaller drill bit. The whole install is easy as pie! Overall, I am really impressed with this product. The 1080 camera is crisp and lifelike! Is it worth 199.00?? The Jury is still out on that! Seriously, you can now purchase 1080 survalence camera's for inside your house that are FINE products, for about 79.00, and that includes a free app that does pretty much the same thing as the Ring app.  So while I think the Ring Doorbell 2 could be priced more around the 99.00 range and that would be more realistic, I can understand why the creator of this product wants to milk the profits, he came up with a damn good idea! Still, after the novelty wears off, the price should come down.",Flawless
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Sep 2018,Wildwood Seapointe Condo,"I purchased the Ring 2 Doorbell with the intention of monitoring my seasonal home which is 3,000 miles away from my permanent residence.  After installing it and making sure it was working properly at the end of the season, I departed my seasonal home.  About 2 weeks later I received a message on the Ring app indicating that the device was offline.  I suspect there may have been a temporary Wifi outage at the seasonal home but instead of coming back online when the Wifi was restored (like all of my other devices), I am told by the Ring customer service staff that I will need to go back to the seasonal home and reinstall the device on the network. They are telling me that this is some type of security measure to protect me from other people getting on my system.  So instead I am stuck with no protection since my doorbell is now offline and I would need to travel 3,000 to reset it!!!  Why doesn't the system automatically reset like all of my other devices.  This is not addressed in any of the promotional material so I am writing this to raise peoples' awareness that if you are thinking of purchasing this to monitor a seasonal home that is far from your permanent residence, this system has a major flaw.  Hopefully Amazon will figure out a way of addressing this soon.  Otherwise the system is not providing the protection that I expected when I purchased it.",Major Shortcoming With Doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2017,T. Lyon,"I chose the Ring 2 over other options because I wanted a video camera for my door that could use the existing wiring, ability to speak to visitors at the door, and the more positive reviews over the competing products. Although it has definitely been helpful, it still has some major issues. The biggest annoyance is that you either get alerts all the time for nothing or miss actual people at the door. Every morning I wake up with about 10 notifications on my phone, but it's always of someone walking away or of a car driving by. I've since installed a $25 Wi-Fi camera inside pointing out the window, and it does a much better job of capturing the motion that triggered the camera. I'm hopeful that this gets improved in software updates, but given the severity of the issue and time on the market, I'm very doubtful. Setup is not as easy as it should have been. It wasn't mentioned in the information that I read online, but using with a digital doorbell system requires you to connect a diode across the wiring connectors. Given this accounts for most systems from the last 20 years, I'm surprised this wasn't built into the device's circuits directly. If you don't wire it correctly your doorbell won't go off, could go off randomly in the middle of the night, or could get fried in the case that you don't use it and should have. As others have mentioned, you have to use the Ring subscription to get any use out of the device. The alerts take a long time to load in the app and whatever triggered it is gone by that time. Things that are great: - The IR camera works very well in the dark - It looks nice and blends in better than I expected - The field of view on the wide angle lens is great Ultimately, I think that I would like to try out the Nest Hello option instead to see if it can improve upon the motion detection and alerts.",Great concept but still some shortcomings

UPDATE: I am now on my 3rd replacement RING DOORBELL 2 in the last 60 days. I keep being told im in the 1% minority who has issues... but im having a hard time believing that. Ive had the worst time with this product. So heres an easy breakdown of the pros & cons based on my experience. PROS: Customer Service is attentive to the point of annoyance. Its wireless and that seems to work fine. Its easy to set up. CONS: Poor video quality and reliability. Poor sensitivity to Motion Events. (basically its bad on what its supposed to do) ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had massive issues with the first Ring Doorbell i ordered... So RING SUPPORT sent a replacement doorbell 2 camera and a wedge kit. I can say that i am receiving less false positives thanks to the wedge kit... its still not perfect and misses catching the mail man, OR ANYONE for that matter, 95% of the time... but at least its not picking up vehicle traffic anymore. 75% of the time my camera shows an Orange sky & blue people. its the same video issue i was having with the first one i purchased. And because of this issue, the footage is practically useless if we ever have to identify the correct color of someone, or their clothing... so lets just hope we never have to use the footage to solve an actual crime. Ive included an example taken from our new Ring Doorbell 2... so you know what im talking about. To say im unhappy with the product as it currently stands would be an understatement. Unfortunately, the decision is not up to me to return it at this time. If it was, i would return this in a heartbeat. As a person who works in video production full time... video fidelity is very important to me, and this product has not stood up to its claims. As a homeowner, security is very important to me, and again, this product has not stood up to its claims. However, i can say that the customer service department has done a good job of trying to fix my issues, despite the fact that they have been unable to do so. So i dont blame the support team. I blame the engineers and the marketing dept. They have made and sold me a bunk product.","inconsistent, unreliable... unfortunately."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2018,Eduardo Pagani,"Finally, got my ring Video Doorbell 2 over the weekend. PROs - Setting it up was quick and easy. - Great video. - It warns you when someone is at the door or within the set area even before they ring the door bell. - You can see and hear visitors who ring the doorbell quite clearly. CONs - Though you can see/hear people clearly no one can understand you when you talk back.  The sound is all garbled.  The volume is low and it sounds like someone speaking on a cheap walkie-talkie in the next room. - There is a delay to answering the call on the phone.  The phone notifies you immediately upon the ring.  Then you must launch the app and it has to connect, etc.  If your visitor or delivery person is very patient, you will be able to see them.  Actually, you see their ears a lot as they lean closer to the unit to try to hear what the heck you are saying. - The same delay applies to Alexa (Echo devices).  I tell my Fire TV Cube ""Show me the front door"".  Alexa then mutes my show, launches ""home"" and then it switches to ""ring.com"", then it buffers and finally it shows the front door.  Just in time to see the UPS guy jumping back into his truck... - Of course, before I posted this review I looked for answers on ring.com.  There in no troubleshooting guide.  The FAQs and ""Help"" areas are very generic and repetitive with help on items such as ""how to install the app""... Will continue to search for help and I will post updates in case I am able to get the sound problem fixed.

I refuse to pay them every month for the rest of my life for something that I own, that uses my WIFI and my phone, but they have configured their RING App so that it will only let you keep the recordings if you agree to pay them every month for the rest of your life. I have a Samsung Smart Cam, it will record Hi-res video, it is motion activated and will track the subject, I can talk to whomever is being recorded, they can talk to me and I can access it from anywhere thru my phone, I can do whatever I want with my recordings and all I had to pay is the initial cost of it!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Aug 2018,Alexander Houtman,"UPDATE 9/23/18: Downgrading the doorbell to one star.  I've reset it, tried moving the router closer, angled the antennae towards the doorbell, and nothing works.  I keep getting notifications, but the app and doorbell refuse to connect.  If there was a real emergency this thing would only serve as to show what happened after the fact to those that found our bodies, rather than help prevent it.  Useless. I've owned and used this doorbell for the last 6+ months.  The ring video doorbell was easy to set up, the app is super intuitive and everything about installation went extremely smoothly.  Unfortunately that was the last time things went smoothly.  The battery life is great, however with only a single battery and long recharge times, there is a ton of downtime where the doorbell is unusable.  Eventually I ordered a second battery which solved this problem, but this was an extra expense and a seemingly annoying oversight. The doorbell itself worked great for the first month, however since then it has been riddled with connection issues.  The doorbell is less than 20 feet from the wireless router and the router is an extremely well reviewed gaming router.  I can get wifi reception at the end of my driveway with my phone (over 80ft away).  So there should be no issues with reception.  Even with this wifi router I can still never connect to the video doorbell 2 on the first try.  When I get motion alerts, I try to answer and nothing comes up.  I have to exit the app and retry 2-5 times before it will connect, no matter the battery level.  Obviously this is a real problem since if there ever was an intruder or a serious issue not being able to connect for 30 seconds - 2 minutes could be a real issue.  I also know it's not the app since I also have another ring product that is hardwired and have zero issues with it. I think the doorbell is a great idea and everything about it shows how good of a product it could be, but if it can't do the fundamental thing it was designed for, then why did I pay $200 + $30 + tax when I could have gotten something similar for 1/10th the price?","Great Idea, Mediocre execution UPDATE: Horrible execution"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Aug 2017,Lawrence Family,"My very positive experience with the Ring Floodlight Camera made me run out and buy this for the front door. I've been very disappointed. Video quality is OK, not great. Even when people are feet away from the camera you can't make out their faces. It is very slow to respond to motion. Most of the time people have left the frame before video starts recording. The biggest issue is the motion settings. The Ring Pro and Floodlight Camera provide the ability to define a polygon within the video frame where you would like the camera to watch for motion. Additionally the other products provide the ability to set the sensitivity within that polygon. The Ting Doorbell 2 provides a general sensitivity slider and an arc region which almost pointless. The. You get filters for how frequent you want alerts. This system fail miserably.

Recharging the battery requires removing two very small screws from the base of the doorbell, taking extraordinary care not to drop one of them, charging the battery, then reassembling the doorbell, again re-installing the two small screws.  After approx. 16 months, the battery would not hold a charge, and the doorbell stopped working all together.  A call to Ring customer service was answered by a determined technician who ran several tests remotely and finally agreed the battery was defective.  She said Ring would not repair the doorbell, and my only option would be to step up to their Protect Plus plan, which is intended to cover multiple Ring devices.  That plan costs an additional $7 per month or $84 per year.  In return, Ring would provide the latest version of the same model doorbell.  Since I don't have multiple Ring devices, and the same model doorbell was selling for $179, I declined the offer.  Ring also said they would not offer a discounted price, even though the original doorbell worked properly for only four months past the warranty period.  With no better options, I decided to order the Ring Video Doorbell 2 with removable batteries.  The replacement doorbell was installed upon receipt and failed to work properly from day one.  In this case, the IR emitter did not turn on, and all videos taken in less than optimal lighting were virtually useless.  Another call to Ring customer service resulted in more remote tests and final confirmation that the IR emitter was defective.  When asked if Ring would replace the defective doorbell directly to minimize delays, the technician said they would not, and the device would have to be returned to and replaced by Amazon.  As usual, Amazon agreed to replace the defective doorbell, but delivery is not expected until the end of January.  When the doorbells worked properly, they were very helpful.  However, the extremely short battery life in the first model (Ring Video Doorbell), and the out-of-the-box failure of the second model (Ring Video Doorbell 2) has been very frustrating, as well as costly, and certainly indicates poor quality control.  Ring's unwillingness to expedite a replacement and make the customer whole when their products are already defective when delivered should sound a note of caution to prospective customers who are considering Ring's products. Update - 1/4/18 In response to my review, I received an an offer to help resolve my Video Doorbell 2 problems from Ring's Neighbor Satisfaction Specialist, Mary Nell Johnson.  I couldn't reach her during the holidays and decided to try Ring's technical support team again and was connected with Porsha.  She was aware of the problem with my doorbell (firmware was not updating properly) and proceeded to troubleshoot to confirm the exact cause.  After a few minutes, she had me try the doorbell and it worked perfectly! Mary has since reached out to me to confirm the doorbell is now working properly and extended my Protect Plan to compensate for my inconvenience - a fair resolution in my opinion.  I appreciate Ring's dedication to correct my doorbell issues and the professionalism of their reps on the phone.  Because the doorbell now works as advertised and we really love being able to stay in touch with our home while on the road, I now feel the doorbell deserves a rating of 4 stars.  Had it not been for the intervening hassles, I would give it a 5 star rating.",Beware of Ring Products and Their Apparent Quality Control Issues - Updated
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2018,Steamguy,"Six month review: This is a fantastic concept. My wife is disabled, and the idea was that she could see AND TALK TO whomever was at the door. This is a GREAT concept, but... You HAVE to have a blistering fast internet service. Which i don't have, in the rural area where I live. I have DSL. Apparently that's just not good enough. The audio feature is COMPLETELY broken, for slower connections. Minus four stars. You can SEE who's at the door on an Echo Show, but you CAN'T TALK TO THEM! Whiskey Tango Hotel!!! So the ""Works With Alexa"" claim is mostly false. Minus six stars. I can be at work, and the app sends the doorbell tone to my phone. Neat. Try to see who's there.... ""Your phone is having trouble connecting to Ring"" . Time wasted trying again and again to see and maybe talk to whomever is there... And they walk off, in the meantime. Minus three stars. I'm leaving this set to one star because most of the time, you can see who's there. And my wife can call their cell and talk to them (if it's a friend). Would I spend this money again with Ring? Not unless Amazon went into the place and started kicking serious... umm... donkey... in the Software Development department. Those guys have been shooting the breeze and sitting on their butts for WAY too long!",Doesn't REALLY work with Alexa

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Nov 2019,Lou H,"I purchased after my boss highly recommended, after purchase I decided to read the reviews.  Usually I read reviews first. So I was a little worried . But I’m not worried anymore.  Motion detection is spot on , there are settings to help achieve what your looking for ,  Recordings are spot on , system runs really fast.  Maybe people got some bad units , but this operates exact the way it should. A few things to know.  You can change the motion detection to area desired , height desired , so cars are not setting the unit off.  Mine is hardwired. , but there is a Wifi signal bar , battery life bar ,  everything you need to know. Also a system diagnostic test. It will let you know any signal or battery life issues.  Lastly the biggest gripe I read was the 3 dollar a month ,  or 30 bucks a year charge.  Good grief. Are you kidding me.  That’s dirt cheap. Every camera you buy out there has charges and these are cheaper then most .  Only thing I was not happy about is I purchased mine for 199.99 , the next day they change to 129.99.  That stinks.  But great product.  Installed and set up correctly , works perfectly",Reviews are misleading.  Great product
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2019,R. Medina,"I purchased my unit in October of 2017 on the recommendation of a friend. It is hardwired so no battery issues to report. The problem comes with its consistently weak connection to my wireless network. When this unit was installed, my network was powered by an Apple Extreme base station with two bridge repeaters, one of which was in the garage about 15 feet away from the the Ring. But even at that distance, getting a consistent video signal was hit and miss. Sometimes I could get a clear live view, but other times nothing but a black screen. When it did record an event, I was more likely to see the back of the person at the front door walking away than a full frontal view. Mind you, I have a home full of smart door locks, wireless security cameras, Amazon echoes, laptops, iPads, iPhones, an Apple TV, computers, a wireless garage door opener, Lutron Casseta wall switches, Hue light bulbs, Rachio sprinkler boxes, Ecobee thermostat, etc. Everything, and I mean everything, works flawlessly with my network except for the Ring. Yesterday, I replaced my aging Apple network with a Netgear Orbi system with two satellites rated to cover a house twice the size of mine. OK, I said to myself, let's see if this will improve the Ring signal. Short answer, no. It still reports a moderate to weak signal even though one of the Orbi satellites is less than 10 feet away from the doorbell! Enough. I'm done. My advice is to stop giving your money to a company that spends more on slick advertising than putting out a quality product!",A total waste of money and time!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2018,VZI,"Update 01 January 2019 So after changing my app to include live view I was able to set up much better zones. However, I would consistently get a delay in my notification followed by 16-20 seconds of frozen video before it would resume. This is obviously worthless since whatever triggered the alert is long gone at this point. I called customer service and they thought this was strange as this is not an issue they typically hear about. However, they were able to log into my camera and confirm seeing the same issue as well as seeing that my signal strength up/download speeds are all at least twice the minimum requirements. Regardless, they wanted me to set up a hot spot. After speaking with one of the managers, Chuck Kinion, he explained that while this is not an issue that typically occurs, it has been happening with some of the lots being shipped. Sometimes a firmware update fixes the issue, but he didn’t know when another firmware update would occur. He suggested sending me a new doorbell and explained that if this one didn’t work I should call back and allow them to continue to work the issue rather than return it. When the new unit arrived it was worse than the first one. Video quality was extremely poor, as in couldn’t read a license plate 10 feet in front of the door. The video freezes occurred on and off throughout a video instead of once and then working. I again called and asked to speak directly with Chuck. I was told he was busy, but the rep pressed hard to allow me to have her resolve my issue. She went through all of the typical steps, reset, log on, wants to set up a hot spot even though my signal is strong. She clearly didn’t understand how any of it worked and was just reading down a list of troubleshooting steps. The worst part however is that she gave me the same line about how this isn’t really an issue and it must be me. When I asked her what she was basing this on she told me because she works there and answers these calls all day. I, having since done some research, told her not only did Chuck tell me this was a known issue with some lots, but Amazon review, Reddit, and a number of other sites show that this issue has been occurring for over a year with thousands of units. Worse, everyone is getting the same line; new to them, must be your signal, etc…  Which tells you they don’t know what the problem is, are no closer to identifying the problem, and therefore not anywhere close to developing a solution other than blame the customer. Since she clearly could not help me she told me that she would have Chuck call me back, that was three weeks ago today. This is an expensive doorbell that doesn’t do what it says it will. It would be bad enough to wait and see if firmware updates come and make things better, but to require customers to pay a subscription service while the product doesn’t work is unfathomable. There is a reason they kicked their closest competitor off of Amazon, there is a reason they’re giving these things away for free at times, and there is a reason the customer service slogan is “it’s not us it’s you.” They’re hoping everyone is pot committed to Amazon when the dust settles. My experience with this whole situation has made me think twice about continuing to poor money into Amazon products. I have a few Echo and Fire products and was going to purchase more. I’m now holding off now before I invest more money since I may need to consider switching to google or apple as I would like all of my products to be unified as possible and Amazon is not going in a great direction. Original Review: I have been looking for a security camera and my doorbell recently died so this seemed like a good choice. I received it the other day and the battery took about 10 hours to charge. When I initially put the battery in and tested it inside everything seemed fine. However, once I put it up outside I was only receiving motion notifications about 1 in 10 times. I tested every angle and setting.  My wifi consistently demonstrates more than 2.5 mbps upload and more than 28 mbps download, well above the suggested requirements. I thought I finally had the settings that offered better motion coverage and I received a notification that an Amazon package was 8 stops away, all I had to do was wait and see the camera and alert in action. 15 minutes later not only had the Amazon delivery person dropped the package at the door, they were there long enough to take a picture. I received the alert from Amazon that my package had been delivered, nothing ever came from ring, no alert, no recording occurred, nothing. I also find it strange that I can't get the camera to actually work correctly, but the battery is already down 3% after only 4 hours. Doesn't seem like that will last log. For a product that is expensive and costs another $30 per year, per device, working 10% of the time is unacceptable. Worse is that this seems to be a common problem and not only hasn't been fixed, but they continue to push this product heavily. There are a lot of options out there: cloud vs hard drive, hardwired vs battery, doorbell/light fixture/stand alone cams. The one thing that everyone requires above any of those options is that it actually turns on every time. Not 10% of the time.  I will be returning mine and going with a better option.","Does not work, they know it doesn't work, blaming the customer is their strategy to fix the problem."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Feb 2019,EngineersGuideToGod,"My wife bought this doorbell during a Black Friday special offer.  I replaced our standard doorbell with this one in about an hour.  Now that I've done one, I could definitely do another one in about 15-20 minutes.  It is very easy to install.  I wired it up to our existing doorbell wiring, and that keeps it powered and also rings our house doorbell.  Very glad that worked so well.  Our battery stays charged at 95 to 100% all the time, without us having to do anything. We've had this in operation since around Christmas time with no issues.  It has been a great tool for seeing if we have a package delivery (I see this on my iPad at work), and knowing who has been to our door.  We are paying the annual subscription at this time, although I'm not really happy that we have to do that -- otherwise I would rate it 5 stars for sure.  It would be nice if everybody could have a small amount of storage for free, or if it could use our existing iCloud storage. Installation notes:  Night vision was an issue, since it lights up the side wall of our door frame area.  I installed the wedge and this improved the problem significantly and gave us additional viewing area.  I tried putting some black paper on the edge of the door frame area, but this did not make much of a difference.  Our doorbell area was a little too narrow, so I was only able to screw in the left side of the Ring doorbell.  This has not mattered. The ability to talk back to people, particularly my teenage children when they forget their keys, has provided enough amusement to easily make this purchase worthwhile.  Enjoy!

At $200+ it would be in a box already on its way back for refund. Bad mounting design with no gasket and no space for other than flush on smooth surface.  Think uneven brick surface with little to any place for wire nuts to go.  Nice they include a tool kit, but the masonry bit was useless on brick and had to buy better even with a hammer drill. Speaker/mic volume terrible.  Can barely hear talking or listening and this is the R2 and not the pro with a smaller speaker. Poor wifi.  Close to good router and constantly complains of poor signal and noise and gen 2 does not have N. Poor/slow motion detection.  Most of the time it does not actually capture the person and its a straight shot to the front door.  Just watched a video of nothing and then a flash of wifes rear going in the front door.  UPS guy was already at front door dropping boxes before he showed on video. I have motion alerts on and most of time I’m lucky if I get them 15-30m later.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Oct 2017,Firstboomer,"I like this product, but it has two significant design defects. First, you can change the sensitivity of the motion setting using the App, which is as it should be, meaning you can adjust how wide the range is for picking up motion. The range is from 0 feet (off) to  30 feet or so. The issue is that any change won't be SAVED, meaning take effect, until the doorbell button is pushed. What?! So, if you're out to dinner, and you realize that you forgot to even set the motion detection to ""on,"" or change its range, you can log into the app, change that setting, but it won't take effect until the doorbell is pushed. Just plain stupid. Second, if you have multiple Ring devices, you can't switch from one ""live view"" to another device ""live view"" live view immediately, once it's on ""live view"" for one device, it takes a moment for it to let that one go, and allow logging onto another. Annoying. There is a little bugginess setting them up which requires releasing and reinserting the battery, but that's not a huge deal. If these defects were remedied I'd give them 4 to 5 stars.","Great idea and good quality, but has issues"

I wasn't expecting much, but it sure has surprised me.  Mounting the doorbell on the provided mount into masonry was straightforward, and the setup was incredibly easy.  After a week with our new Ring doorbell we couldn't go back to a normal doorbell again.  Being able to monitor the front door live when ever you want is a cool feature, but being notified when someone is within 5 feet of the door is the real neat feature.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Feb 2018,mbuckley,"Installed our Ring 2 doorbell about a week ago. So far I like it, it's nice being able to turn on the live feed whenever I want and actually have the ability to answer the doorbell remotely. But I'm a little disappointed in how many times it has missed picking up movement. We've played around with the motion settings a lot. The first few day it seemed to be working great. My parents were staying with us for a few days and from work I was getting alerts every time they came and went from the house. However, there have been several times when it has failed to pick up activity and I have no idea why. About half the time when we pull into our own driveway, it won't pick it up at all. It didn't pick up three separate package deliveries this past week which included the delivery person walking all the way down the driveway and right to the front door, or our Shipt grocery delivery. It didn't even pick up my boyfriend when he walked right past the door and down the driveway to take the garbage to the curb. What the Ring 2 is excellent at is picking up cars driving past, even though I have brought the motion range down significantly in the hopes of avoiding those alerts. We hardlined the Ring 2 directly to the doorbell, so it's not a battery issue. We used one of the angled bases to make sure it was pointing in the direction we needed it to. Hoping through trial and error we can figure out how to get it working more efficiently.",Works some of the time?
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Mar 2018,JGray49,"Being a security fanatic that appreciates technology, I truly wanted to like my Ring Video Doorbell 2 purchase from Amazon.  Unfortunately, I am going to return the Ring 2 and search for an alternative product.  I firmly believe that RING (now owned by Amazon), has a significant weak link which involves RING servers that stores your video and audio. Despite all efforts on my part which involved an ideal installation with strong download and upload speeds (55 mbps/11 mbps respectively - Spectrum cable) and a strong RSSI signal (-28) (Linksys EA8500 4 attenae router 8 ft from front Ring 2 Doorbell), and a perfect Ring App health report, I exhibit extreme video and audio lag (12 seconds in my last test) in addition to periods of no connectivity at all. (Blue Spinning Circle on Black Screen).  Note: Tested using Apple Iphone 8+ IOS 11.2.6 and iPad with Ring App. Ring customer support offered little or no help other than to attempt to shift the reason for my issues back on the possibility of MY Wifi connectivity which they ultimately admitted to being more than adequate for optimum performance of the Ring 2 Doorbell. (NOTE: Ring customer service can ""see"" your Ring connectivity stats when you call them).  While customer setup and connectivity issues with home router setups can vary greatly, there are many reports on the Internet of Ring attempting to place the responsibility and blame of Ring doorbell issues back on the consumer, even going so far as sending them free Ring Pro WiFi extenders to correct connectivity issues which many times it did not. In my honest opinion (IMHO), I believe that RING (now owned by Amazon)  currently has issues with it's recording servers and the growth of the company.  Imagine all the video and audio information from ALL the RING security products (doorbells , floodlight/cams, etc.) across the world going to one or several server storage locations without the adequate upgrades in hardware required to handle all this data.  Your Ring doorbell camera or floodlight camera when viewed with the Ring App does not ""see"" in real time.  FWIW. I do have a home 6 camera DVR recording system that DOES give real time video even when viewed with my viewer app.  The video signals are transmitted directly to my phone or viewing device without going to a storage server like Ring engineered into their product. Ring/Amazon is attempting to capitalize on selling you storage space for your video and audio.  While that is certainly fine and does provide for secure offsite storage of your video/audio, it is NOT well engineered in it's present form.  As a consumer of a security product, we need instantaneous viewing of what is going on outside of our door so that we may respond appropriately.  This Ring product in its current form is going to give someone a false sense of security and may end up harming someone or result in unrecorded property damage or theft.  Hopefully now that Ring has been purchased by Amazon, Amazon will invest the money to perfect a product that is truly unique and has great potential.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2018,Amazon_Customer,"The concept of Ring sounds great, video doorbell that allows you to see, hear, and speak to anyone who comes to the door. The price seems pretty steep, but I jumped on the opportunity to purchase not one but two of these during the Black Friday promotion. After installing the app on my phone, and installing one of them I get a message that says I have started the trial for the ""Protect"" plan, I am thinking ""okay whatever that is"" and go about getting ready to install the other one, as I am doing this I think ""what is this Protect plan it is mentioning""? Well low and behold, the people over at Ring have a business model that relies upon a monthly subscription, similar to cable TV, Netflix, etc. except they are basically charging you to access your own content (video/audio recordings from your doorbell that you spent upwards of $200 on in the first place). I don't write a lot of reviews on Amazon, but when I come across a product that irks me I feel the need to let people know about it. If you want a fancy (although HUGE) doorbell that may or may not show you who is at your door right now, or want to pay $10 a month for this company to let you see who was there four hours ago then go ahead.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Sep 2018,718 Enterprises,"Initial review of my first 24 hours using the Ring Video Doorbell 2. Since installation I’ve had 4 people ring the bell during different times of the day. Keep in mindy phone was within the same WiFi as the doorbell 2 was connected to, i was home. When someone rang my door, in almost seconds both my wife’s and my iPhones rang with an incoming door bell alert. Clicked open the alert, and within I’d say 10-12 seconds the live stream loaded clearly and 2 way voice communication worked flawlessly. So far I’m happy. Keep in mind my home WiFi is Verizon Fios 100mbps. I have no use for the motion unless I am away on motion, so I will not review that. The doorbell aspects and functionality works and does it’s job. There are some minor delays in loading the live picture. But not too bad. In one instance, the person at my door waited close to 25-30 seconds before I could speak to them or see them from my phone. Which I thought was borderline too much time to keep someone at my door step waiting if I’m home. But, I understand WiFi tech is never perfect, so I’m ok with that. Ring live preview can also be accessed from my Fire tv on my big screen tv in just 10 seconds. Worked flawlessly 3 times on command. I’m pretty happy with that. It’s been 24 hours, and the battery life is now at 99%. I will update in 3 weeks and see where the battery life is at. If I can get 3 month of battery life out of one charge, I’ll will be happy. I am going to get a second battery for a quick swap, I believe that is the best option. Installation was quick and painless into aluminum door molding. No drilling required. There are slot of negative reviews of the bell and app not functioning the way it’s supposee at all, BUT that’s not my experience out of the box. So far it does the job for me. Pricey, but I think eventually I will get the WiFi extender chime to compliment this. If it fails me more than 3 times within this month, I  will be returning this. Too pricey to keep if it doesn’t function at minimal standards.",WiFi range and strength makes a difference.

We heard multiple times it was our WiFi speed when we have a fiber connection. Software and interface is poorly programmed. Constant false alarms no matter what the setting, missed real motion alerts, videos so long and quirky to download it’s easy to miss what actually triggered it. There is a $30 per year fee per CAMERA to have it barely usable. The video capture is 160 degrees, but it warps the image so it’s hard to make out who people are even if you know them. Their promo materials tells a much different story than reality. Everyone I know with one is frustrated. Save yourself hours of headache and avoid.",Avoid
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jul 2017,HFL,"I love this doorbell.  I added the chime for indoor sound too, making this system even better.  I prefer the battery option since I do not have a wired doorbell to attach the Pro model to.  The fact that it comes with all of the extra pieces to tailor the setup to your particular scenario is great.  Set up was unbelievably easy.  The battery does take a while to charge, I left mine over night.  So far it is working great.","Works great, no wires needed."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Aug 2018,Michael,"At first glance it seems like an expensive but nice feature to add to my home.  I would love this if it just worked as described with out buying add-ons. The problem, starts with the fact that it won't work as advertised without paying for a monthly service.  However, I have not seen a single place where they state this so you are aware of that before buying it.  I would not have bought this if I had know that it required a monthly service to function as they described it.  I see this as just plane fraud!  I understand paying for long term storage, but there are plenty of ways to make videos available without them forcing people to use their monthly service. I was also disappointed to find that it doesn't have any kind of chime for inside my house included.  Once again it is extra, but not stated anywhere.  It will work with an existing hardwired doorbell, which is a nice feature (if you have one).  Since it works with a wired doorbell I can understand the chime being separate, but it should be stated that it's not included.  When paying $200 for a doorbell, I don't expect to have to pay extra for the actual ""bell""! The adjustable motion sensor, doesn't seem to really be adjustable.  I have set it to the minimum distance of 5ft, but it still triggers on cars in the street, which is way over 5ft away.  Also, it is so slow to start recording, many times what ever triggered the motion is completely out of frame by the time the recording starts.  I have walked up to my door opened the storm door, opened the main door and went into my house and the only thing recorded was the storm door closing. The video is supposed to be 1024, and technically it may be, but the actually quality of the video is very poor.  I get much better quality from an $8 Chinese made thumb drive camera. When an event does occur, the time you have to answer the notification on your phone is so short that I've only been able to do it once.  The single successful answer was because my phone was in my hand and I knew the bell was about to be rung, because I had my daughter press the button as a test. For $200 I expect a doorbell to be something really special and the way this is described it would be, but it doesn't work close to the way it's described without buying add-ons and then it still doesn't quite get there.  It feels like if I paid for a first class airline ticket, but have to pay per minute to look out the window and I'm still being charged separately for drinks. Update:  I spoke with someone from ring that did suggest changes that improved the problem of too sensitive motion sensor.  However, I was pretty much blown off on the other issues.  They did offer a refund & I told them I'd prefer they make it do what they say it does, but they basically said they think it does what they say it does.  I assured them mine doesn't come close.  In all these months I have only been able to successfully answer a doorbell one time when I didn't have their ""optional"" service.  It does NOT work at all, except as the most expensive dumb doorbell, without their ""optional"" service.",It would be hard for me to be more dissapointed in this.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2018,I.B.,"Forced remote server processing causes slow response times, slow video recording triggers. (I have FIOS, 100 up/down, wifi RSSI -58, device reports 'good' wifi access) Anyone could walk directly up to the doorbell and cover the camera and by the time the device started recording, due to the time required for it to be triggered by amazon servers/processing, camera could be covered and you'd never see who did it. They could fix this by allowing 'local' processing, i.e. allow you to access the camera directly from inside your home network, but that excludes their monthly subscription model. They force you, lock you into, having to send video data to amazon servers to have the image processed to determine if there was ‘motion’ and if it does detect motion, it then triggers recording.  If you don’t believe me, review posted videos… you’ll notice the same thing with most videos, they all seem to start well after the suspicious person is already in view. The ONLY time this doesn’t happen is because something had already triggered the ‘motion’ event, which then triggered the video recording to start. Oh by the way, recording is only available if you pay a monthly subscription. Once the one month free trial finishes, you are left with ‘live’ access only.  So at the end of the day, you might as well buy a raspberry pi with a HD camera attachment and have a camera you fully own and control.  So in the end, you will pay at least $100 dollars (more if you get the newer versions) for what is basically a raspberry pi, camera attachment, battery backup, and iphone/android app.  And the Android app is fairly buggy when it comes to phone orientation. Expect it to crash often and have to close out the program and have to reopen it. The Fix: Allow a “serverless” option so I can access the device without having outside internet. Let me run video processing locally, don’t force me to have my video sent off to some EC2 instance that is also processing every other ring video feed, and might be grossly starved for resources.",Greed leaves you with an expensive IP camera you can’t use without Amazon’s servers.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Aug 2017,Vegas Steve,"It works great as a doorbell that you can answer from your phone.  The motion detection is dreadful.  I have Arlo Pro's installed as well and I thought their's wasn't very good, but compared to this, they are great.  And if you go with Arlo, you get 7 days recording free, where Ring wants to charge you for any recordings.  Don't confuse this for any sort of security system. However, I'm returning it.  I have a Nexus5x phone that has the most current Android OS.  It DOES NOT allow you to bypass the lock/swipe screen.  By the time I get to the notification, I CANNOT use the video/audio of this doorbell (I'm on battery power only).  Ring has no solution to date.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Oct 2018,L,"I like the idea of what this device is suppose to do but it is a very high priced door bell and does not function as advertised. Video quality is poor it skips a lot, when it works colors are nice but it cannot focus on features very well if you needed to identify a burglar or a license place in my driveway. Video also starts with image white out during live view. It is useless at night as the light makes the image blotted out. Ability to change functionality of device on phone app is limited and non-existent on computer. Live view is not available on a computer, on the app it works with delays. Motion sensing does not activate someone approaching camera until they stand in front of the device and wait with max sensor. Two way audio is poor, I could hear my neighbor across the street start his car but could not hear the person at my door, that same person could not hear my either as the audio was breaking up. It also takes several seconds for audio to activate for someone ringing doorbell when it should already be functioning from the motion of the person walking up to ring the bell in the first place. It states it works with Alexa but its only works with certain Alexa devices that has additional devices. For example, it you have the Alexa dot it does not work with that alone or on your phone, you need an additional device (fire stick TV) for it to function, very misleading and unclear from marketing.",Needs improvement
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jun 2018,Chris H.,"I've had this thing for less than a week and I can tell you that you should look for another video doorbell. The battery depletes rapidly. I've had to recharge it once already. It's picky about it's WiFi connection so much so that I went out of my way to bring three mesh WiFi routers to my home only to buy a Ring Chime Pro to help out. The app (for iOS at least) is crap. It crashes on open, it crashes when trying to view a video; heck! it won't connect to the video more than half the time. The motion sensor on it is a joke. So much so that the cheap Dlink camera does a better job at a fourth of the cost. It can't decide if a person right in front of it is a motion event until that person is about out of frame. The doorbell isn't much better. Sure you'll get a notification but by the time it connects (if it connects) that person could be long gone, or worse inside your house. The firmware for the product is pushed out selectively so who knows when it'll update for you. The app will tell you it's up to date even if it's not. Other annoying things is it doesn't work with Google Assistant or HomeKit. Unless they rebrand to Amazon Security they should support other home talking-trashcans. The good, customer service is great although you have to call them. Let's hope their CS team isn't taken over by Amazons. Installation was easy, like less than five minutes easy.",Do not buy.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Aug 2018,Mr C King,"We bought this as more an add on, as we have cameras. I didn't want a recording but more a way to interact remotely with people at the door - for that it's useless. It worked well the first month, while in the ""trial"" and connect live instantly to my phone; however as soon as the trial ended and it went to live only mode (the mode i had been using) it now keeps telling me it can't connect and bombards me with requests to pay their $30 subscription. It's bascially now just a large doorbell with no connectivity (note I have disconnected and reconnected and made sure the WiFi is good - it is).

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2018,The human,"update after months of using this: the live video feed stopped working and Ring customer service wanted me to remove my doorbell and put it next to my router to test the signal, even though my router is 10 feet away and the RSSI signal strength indicator was -46, perfect, in the ring app. The doorbell rung about 50% of the time, while the video feed worked about less than 10% of the time. I even hardwired it because I thought that the battery was not outputting enough strength to the wifi video feed, but I was wrong and only wasted time and money getting it hardwired. The customer service rep wanted me to upgrade to a more expensive doorbell, even though they could not resolve my issue. What a sham. They should modify their app to not only include the RSSI strength, but also be able to perform jitter/ latency testing... etc... so that customers are not put in this situation and both parties can be technically sure of what kind of signal quality there is. original review: I liked that it has an app and i get a notification on my iphone when someone rings the doorbell. I dislike that the battery drains so fast, about a month or less. My house is the corner house on my street, and my ring 2 doorbell picks up all vehicle traffic, even with angled positioning and reduced sensitivity settings. My ring 2 doorbell app said it had half battery life left, and I went on a vacation for one week, but the doorbell barrery drained 2 days after i left. Someone broke into my car while i was gone and the stupid ring 2 doorbell didnt catch any of it because the battery drained prematurely. Garbage battery. I now have to hardwire this, which is not what I wanted to do when I bought this underperforming rindg 2 doorbell, which means spending more money on it. If i buy more batteries, there is another hidden cost. Also, the recording feature requires a paid plan, so more hidden costs.",garbage plus Hidden costs

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Feb 2018,JD Droddy,"I waited for awhile before writing this review to be sure that I really understood the pros and cons.  Based on some of the other reviews, I was a bit skeptical.  As it turns out, I really love this product.  Many of the negatives I heard about seemed to me to be caused by not having sufficient Wi-Fi signal.  ' When I purchased the product, I thought I had a hard-wired doorbell in place.  It turned out to be a battery operated remote.  So, I installed the system as a battery operated unit.  I discovered that the battery would drain faster than I chose to fool with, so I purchased the solar operated charging sleeve.  I had to buy it from the factory ($49), as it was not available from Amazon.  That was much cheaper than having an electrician come install the necessary wiring.  I'm pleased to say that the charger works  very well and the unit stays at 100 percent most of the time.  It drops a bit after two or three days of cloudy weather, but has never gone below 94 percent. It took a bit to adjust the zones to the point that I didn't get excessive false alarms from passing traffic.  I occasionally get one now when a large vehicle passes on our side of the street, but they are relatively rare  and not significant considering the stability.  The unit had only been installed a few days when our doorbell went off at 2:00 a.m.  From my bedroom, I was able to determine that the ringer was a mentally ill person who lives in the neighborhood and has been reported by others as ringing the doorbell in the middle of the night.  I monitored the situation until the person went away, without having to open the door. I highly recommend this product if you have a good Wi-Fi signal at your door.  If you don't, you might be disappointed.  BTW, the $30 per year subscription comes to about 8 cents per day.  This is certainly a small price to pay for having all incidents recorded and downloadable if necessary.",Works as Advertised if you have good wi-fi -- Recommend Solar Charger if you don't have hard wiring available
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2018,She,"Just bought this device less than 1 week ago and I am ready to return it. Worked okay for less than 1 day then stopped working. It wasn't showing the live stream at all just hours after set up. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled like instructed and still I'm having issues. I unattached the device and decided to start over, but now the ring won't even connect to my router at all! It's not even showing the router as an option most of the time. My internet works great and I have great speed. My modem and router are both brand new (purchased and set up at the same time as the ring) and built for high power gaming and streaming. There is currently only 5 devices connected to my router (for 2 people) so I know it is not being overused. I've called customer service and followed instruction and still not working. This item is trash and I will be returning it today. So sad because I was very excited, but I chose to ignore all the negative comment and give it a try so this is what I get. Not worth my time and money. Also, the few hours the device did work, it wasn't picking up motion until I was directly in front the device, but later at night, it started picking up cars driving by that are much farther away than my lawn. 😒 Wow. This item is a great concept, but the overall mechanics needs more work. And for the cost we pay, these issues should not be so prevelant this long after the initial product was launched.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2017,Maxwells,"Everything about this is a 5 star device except for one thing. They either purposefully or ignorantly made the wifi receiver incredibly inefficient. They basically make it so you have to buy the stupid Chime Pro to be able for it to function. Before we got the Chime, the video would play 3 seconds, freeze for 5 seconds, play for 3, etc. Useless if you're trying to use this for security. It sits a measured 22 feet from my high-powered gaming router, WELL within what they describe as acceptable distance to receive a ""very good"" signal. The infuriating part is when I bought the Ring I also bought a regular non-antennae Chime to put by our bedroom. So now I have one useless Chime and a Chime Pro I shouldn't have needed, on top of a $200 doorbell. But yea... beyond that, it's great. After the stupid Chime Pro, video is very quick and the quality is great, the app is great, the notifications it sends you are instant and the live feed is a great touch. Before the Pro, it would send me notifications 5-30 minutes after the ring, live video wouldn't connect, let alone doorbell ring videos. Just do yourself a favor and incorporate another 50 bucks into budgeting for one of these.",Useless without the stupid Chime Pro
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2017,Cliff,"I love it. I have a really weak, at the front door, wifi signal. I hope the extender will help when arrives. That being said, every time there is motion on the porch I get a notification wherever I am and can access the video and audio. My only issue and I will update,  is access to Live view is sporadic. I'm almost positive it is because the signal strength is poor. 30 bucks a year for the basic service is doable for me, and as much Amazon as I do, could pay for itself. It works, but be ready to relocate your wireless router or use an extender. I agree with another review that the packaging is super and everything you need is there, though I found a cordless drill helpful. I particularly liked the remark to put the n/a hardware in that drawer with all the stuff you'll never use. I called with some questions. Either I. got lucky or these people know about what they are selling and have an appropriate personality to assist. Got the Chime pro. All is well now, .

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Aug 2018,Lindy,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Revised opinion of doorbell: once you get past the setup, it works like nobody's business! Update: See the video. It looks as if these two are dressed as plumbers but the only tool they carry is a drill. They wear black rubber gloves because California this time of year is so breezy.  I ran this by three expert opinions. 1 - a plumber)  No tool belts, no tools except for the drill, no holster for the drill. These are burglars not plumbers 2 - the cops) Every detail is consistent with burglary. Do not treat this as a joke or prank. 3 - Ring customer service)  The video and audio are coming out great! Those are burglars. I called the plumbing company. Yes they had staff on the job at my location that day. But, it was an outside line that needed work. The only reason for anyone to knock on a door would be to get access to a power line. No electrical extension cords on these two. I conclude this plumbing company has a criminal ring inside of it. The cover story is they are just a bunch of jokers. Management is not clueless but they are afraid of going out of business and unable to handle the situation. Out of some sense of kindness to the company, I've withheld the name, BUT they are located in the Bay Area. If you are a local resident and would like to follow through contact me directly lindy.cheng@gmail.com Moral of the story: I went and purchased two Ring Security Cameras. One for each bozo. End update I had my troubles getting the Ring Video Doorbell to run smoothly. I finally traced my troubles to my VPN. Shut down your VPN and the setup goes smoothly (more or less). Next when I went to mount the doorbell, the only bolts that fit were too short to reach the mounting bracket.  So, i put the video doorbell in the closet, and by pure luck aimed it at the door handle for the front door.  It stayed there for over a week. During the week, I managed to cry a bunch on Peter's shoulder, Ring's Customer Service Angel.  Because during all these weeks of trying to set up Ring, the O-Beast, my very own personal stalker had tried to break in twice (that I could detect) and the stress had gotten to me.  The truth is, by the time Peter appeared to fix things, the equipment was  WORKING but I was so stressed out I couldn't figure out simple things  - like how to mount the Ring Video doorbell without the correct bolts. Peter got to work and did he pull off a doozy. He set up an more advanced configuration of sensors so I could keep windows open. With so many sensors, the software can't keep up with all the possibilities! But the new versions are coming!  Even limited to current software, the option to keep window and patio doors cracked open but alarmed has made a huge difference in livability. But here's the big one: I had completely forgotten about my smoke & carbon monoxide detector. It was old and needed replacing.  It didn't occur to me my O-Beast might try and set the place on fire. Since many of my evening medications are sedatives this kind of attack means CERTAIN DEATH. I would die of smoke inhalation before I woke up.  But the Ring fire alarms goes straight to the fire station. May I respectfully advise everyone who uses sedative medications to PLEASE GET AN ALARM that ALERTS the FIRe DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY!!! You don't want to wake up dead. Meanwhile, forgotten in the closet the Ring doorbell had dutifully recorded my passing feet...exits/entry. And two mysterious events. At 1:30 AM  and then at 5 AM on two very different days, something triggered the Ring doorbell and it recorded something for over two minutes each time. Unfortunately, the resolution is too low (it's near pitch dark) and the audio pickup too faint.  There are no other incidents which occur this late at night. My best guess, there is PLENTY of other evidence which shows someone has been trying to pick my lock using the credit card method. My previous doorknob was worn down useless, my weatherstripping around the locks *only* was in tatters.  In fact, I listened to her do this for one night but she ran too quickly for me to wake up enough to do anything sensible like chase after her. Even though I only put it up today (I decided to skip the ""right"" equipment and just use JB Weld Steelstik - metal epoxy).  The camera has been working great on everyday tests. I suspect I'll have results before the week is out. Update, Sept. 2, 2018 The Treasure Truck is a great deal! But it sure don't give you time to research before you're forced to make a buy decision. About Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) - the RSSI number indicates the strength of a wireless signal with zero being perfect and -100 worthless.  If you routinely experience trouble viewing video,  since the Ring video is HD, you need a better signal. Signs of bad signal, B&W video in daylight,  you get motion detection but the video hesitates and may not turn on all. The reason why my wireless signal is pathetic is because I live in Silicon Valley in a huge apartment complex. Everyone has souped up wireless except me. First - download a wireless analyser app and check your environment. 15 or so wireless networks with stronger signals than yours is bad news. Second - move your router closer to the video doorbell. It's worth  trying. Third - The Ring video doorbell will alert the app but it won't alert the base station. You may want a Ring Chime or Chime Pro. The Chime Pro will extend the wireless signal while chiming every time the video doorbell gives the alert. The  doorbell operates much more like a doorbell. Finally, Costco has their usual get-a-deal-if-you-buy-the-economy size on Ring security devices. I found the prices fair but the packages were much more thoughtfully sized for a small apartment. It comes with equipment that I wasn't sure was necessary but I'm discovering is essential. Update: Dec. 2018  Sometimes old-fashioned is as good as anything It looks like the O-Beast is up and raring to go for the holiday season. On Thanksgiving day roundabouts dinner time and 11:30 PM.  I got home, dis-armed the Ring alarm to enter. Then when I tried to re-arm it, it kept telling me ""a sensor is out of place"". One by one I checked my two windows and two doors. I tracked it down to one window in particular. It was less than 1/4"" out of place.  The window had not opened any further because I'd cut wooden dowels to fit when I moved in.  This was enough to break sensor contact but not enough to trigger the alarm; it takes 1/2"" of movement to get the alarm. Sigh, my windows are two stories up. At this, I was afflicted with a vision of the O-Beast up precariously, over 200 lbs of suet flapping in the breeze trying to break in.  TMD. I would pay money to erase that. I checked the windows again. The one with the dis-placed sensor had a strangely clean fly-screen. The window that read OK was just plain dirty with fierce dust bunnies defending it still. Huh. Too bad, the O-Beast hadn't cleaned the windows. I might have some forgiveness. Why, oh why hadn't I put cameras on the windows? Once you start putting up videocameras on your wireless network, you quickly realize that most routers can't handle it.  Not only did I need a router that could push signal out far but it needs to handle large volumes of HD quality video. I was getting garbage when I tried to put cameras on the windows. I wrote a really long email to Peter, my Ring Customer Service Angel describing the problem and he wrote an treatise on how to handle wireless for Ring. Option 1) I can stick with the mandatory AT & T router and daisy-chain Chime Pros all the way out to the bedrooms. I guesstimate it would take 3  Chime Pros to throw the wireless out that far. This doesn't handle the AT&T routers issues with massive amounts of data.  At Blk Friday prices, that would have been $150 Option 2) Get a better router: Peter recommended the Netgear Orbi's (high end solution) or the Netgear Nighthawk Dual Band series (lower cost solution).  Both effective with Ring devices. I ended up going with the Orbi because 1) my TV is about 5' away from the AT&T router and has trouble picking up the signal and 2) I ran into the Orbi RBK40  Blk Friday sale price ($200) and I just fell in love...with the specs, yah, ya. That's right, it was a cold decision based purely on performance (and looks and price. I'm just a calculatin machine I am.).  Plus, it's not real clear that I'm done adding videocamera's to Ring.  Higher end is safer for me. Now, after Orbi, the RSSI signals from the video doorbells and cameras at the window are SWEET (RSSI's all around 30-ish) and.... I ordered two more video cameras from Ring. Why two more? One for my window w/o a camera and one for my door where I already have a video doorbell. Huh? The kind policeman explained it (yes, I have been known to roam the landscape searching for answers): The two cameras protect each other.  Mount them so each camera sees the other. When the crook tries to take out the first camera you have 1) evidence that a crime was committed, 2) enough $$$ damage that they can be prosecuted for something meaningful and put away and 3) Ring has a warranty on the video equipment. If the cameras are stolen (must file a police report) and if you get the 1-year protection plan ($100)  then they will replace the stolen equipment. And yeah, Ring just announced their series of *indoor* cameras. Sigh. Just as soon as I finish the outer Ring camera system, I'll have to think about the indoor Ring of cameras. I sure hope I don't need more Orbi satellites.... Did I forget to mention that? The base Orbi system can be extended beyond it's original 5000 sq ft  specs.... And since the Ring system can support up to 99 devices... I can probably get signal out to my car. On the freeway. Don't laugh. The O-Beast will trash my car if she thinks she can't get to me.  This is the next logical step after the windows/patio door are denied her. Luckily, she thinks she's a suuu-per geN-iUs.  That's right. She thinks...  I'm dinner? I guess, she never actually paid attention to that show? Gotta go build my Acme Beastie-Blaster specially designed for our automobile lifestyle. Beep-beep. Remember the value of autos is automatically high enough to put her away. I just need a camera that can take video in all directions at once....",Detected the stalker from behind a locked door and caught these two
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Nov 2018,Sandra Johnson,"So I installed my new Ring Doorbell 2 today and tried to wire it where the old doorbell was but no go. I tested the wires but they are dead and I don't know why. The doorbell always worked before but whatever. No big deal. After some frustrating time which felt like an eternity I finally got the Ring device to work. It wasn't the device it was my WiFi connection but I didn't realize it until two hours into this process. The device works fine and the image is very clear during the day. It's night time now and I just checked it. Wow. Looks like daytime out there. I'm very impressed with this device so far. I don't get many visitors but I live on a busy avenue near a high school and there is sometimes a lot of sidewalk traffic. Also, earlier this year my mailbox was stolen and the thief even left his or her gloves on the sidewalk. The police didn't do anything about it because they said it was a petty crime. Maybe if the mailbox was full of donuts they would have tried to find it. Anyway, the Ring Doorbell 2 is pretty neat. It's my first security device and I might even get one for my backdoor. I think you will be pleased if you get one of these devices. I'm a woman and live alone and if I can install this thing so can you. The box comes with everything you need to install this device but I used one of my own screwdrivers for the concrete screws. Had to put some oomph into it. Now all I need is for someone to come to the door to test it out. Oh I want to add that I would have given this five stars but the sound quality isn't very good. When I tested the device (several times) I spoke into it or at it from various distances. Even at very close range the sound isn't good. It's especially not very good because of the traffic going by. I could hear that quite well unfortunately. My voice sounded far away and like I was speaking into a tin can. Update Dec.16: So I was going to buy another Ring Doorbell 2 and see that it is now $169. I paid $118 for mine. Why the jump in price???",Who's There? Ring knows!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Feb 2018,Customer8284,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Great concept, but the device itself fails to deliver.  Specifically, the motion sensor is inconsistent.  It triggers when a car is passing by, yet it periodically fails to trigger when someone is approaching my house.  The recording would show a person walking away from my house, but it didn't start recording the approach. Very disappointing.  Also, the video quality is fairly poor.  The device itself feels very cheap. Finally, the mounting is poorly designed.  There are no mounting holes at the top of the device, which creates a small gap between the wall and the ring doorbell.  It looks bad, and make is fairly easy for someone to just rip the device out.","Great concept, but the device itself fails to deliver"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Oct 2018,M. N.,"UPDATE : Through a series of updates, the doorbell speaker volume is now so low I can't actually interact with anyone ringing the doorbell because they can't hear I word I say. I have finally reached wit's end after owning this doorbell for an entire year. Let's be clear, if someone rings the bell, you'll get notified. If a solicitor is standing in front of your door, observing everything around the front of your home within eyesight, you'll be notified after they've had their fill and are leaving. The bottom line is the motion detection on this product is absolute garbage. Speaking of garbage, it'll detect motion when the weekly garbage truck goes by, but not when a persistent roofer comes onto my property to leave solicitations on my door. It'll detect motion when the daily schoolbus goes by, but not when fedex runs over my mailbox. Make no mistake, I have opened many service tickets to address the issue, but it's the same run around every time. ""let's try a factory reset"" is always going to be the response no matter the issue or how many times you call. I have installed the included directional wedges in the hopes of getting a better experience. No such luck. Pass on ring guys.

In this case one is needed to save others from this purchasing mistake. The neither the motion detection or doorbell worked as seen in their ads. Both worked some of the time if at all. Ring 2 is a product with potential, maybe in another 2-5 years it might finally work as advertised (Like Dial-Up vs Fiber) I watched all the YouTube videos on using Ring 2 and I saw the happy people but I think that's a very small part of the product's story. Most of the people who ran into problem probably just gave up and didn't even bother to waste more time writing a review. If you do decide to buy any Ring doorbell. TEST IT BEFORE MOUNTING!* First check your internet speed. How old is your Router? 3 years or older, you might need a new one. Stand  out side of your home with Ring in one hand and your phone in the other. Ring it. Try the motion detection. Repeat this indoors, repeat again right next to your wifi router. If it works for you then you are one of the lucky few. My bet, by the time you've done the outdoor test you'll be ready for a refund. Ring 2 is a great product idea, it's just not ready yet for wide public use.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jan 2019,Jeffrey,"My first ring installed easily. Worked fine for about a year, then disconnected. Tech support helped to get it back on my network, then it failed about 30 days later. After spending quite a bit of time on this, upgrading to the new Ring doorbell, I did get things working. There was a major effort by tech support in getting me a new unit and hanging in there to insure success. While my wifi network shouldn't have been at fault, there was something about my network that caused problems. The fix was reverting to the built in wifi in my Comcast router instead of my Ubiquiti WAP behind the firewall. Who'd have thought? Chances are an ""average"" network environment would work better. Maybe it was my firewall? Kudos to tech support who went above and beyond to earn 5+ stars, but I had to give 4 for the amount of time I spent.",It's a cool device that does a lot.

I don’t normally take the time to write product reviews. Amazon is great at taking things back when they don’t work. This however is so enraging that I feel it necessary to inform everyone of the fraud that Ring is perpetuating upon society. First, let me say that if you’re looking for a video doorbell, I assume it will do the trick, though the slow speed and lag time between ring and video connection makes it useless for anything except someone sitting and waiting at the door. The real failure of this device is its “motion detection”. To illustrate, I’ve attached photos and video. It goes off about every 5 minutes (leaving battery life that lasts 3 days), even for things across the street, even though it’s supposed to have a 5’ range (also attached). The kicker is that it Doesn’t actually catch people coming up to the door. It only shows me coming in our out about 1 in 10 times. I even thought about making a video to show this, but it’s not worth my time for this Piece of junk. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY",One of the worst products I’ve ever seen
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2017,Particular person,"Here is some of the information I was looking for before I purchased this Ring Video Doorbell 2.  So far it has exceeded my expectations. This doorbell records for about 30 sec and is activated in one of three ways: by pressing the ring button, having motion, or pressing ""live view"" from your phone.  It stores this video to a Ring Cloud using a good WiFi connection to the device.  From the Ring app on my iphone I can select any one of these videos to see.  My wife's phone was set up as a shared user so she can see the videos also, from anywhere there is WiFi or a good cellular connection.  My minipad has the Ring app so it gets all the same information my iphone gets.  My iphone or minipad can delete files, but my wife's phone can't (I assume because she is a shared user.) All of these devices can hear and speak to the ring doorbell when activated. This model uses existing 12 v AC wires from the old doorbell transformer.  This keeps the battery charged and pressing the Ring door bell also activates my house door bell just as the old button did. The motion sensor  always activates before anyone can get close enough to push the doorbell.  I can set the radius of sensing somewhere between 6 ft to 30 ft.  About 15 ft has worked well so far.  In addition there are pie-shaped motion sensing zones.  My door bell is corner mounted with one vertical wedge to aim the camera more towards the front.  Because of this aim direction, one motion zone closest to the corner was set inactive. It will pick up night images from near total darkness,  but images are not as good as in daylight.  Camera was mounted 48 inches high as recommended.  Try to avoid light sources that might shine directly into the camera if you want highest quality images.  I plan to add the Ring Cloud package for $3 per month that lets my images stay stored for a month or so. If you are away from home and not in a good WiFi zone, I think obtaining a immediate live image would be difficult.  However, if a live image was previously stored, you would probably be able to view it with a good cellular connection. I installed the doorbell one week ago and so far It has worked very well.",Summary of some useful user questions
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2018,M. Moss,"This is practically unusable for home security. I have family that sing Ring's praises, so I was shocked at how bad the Ring 2 was. I had it hardwired with a strong wifi signal, and had the following issues: 1. The doorbell is in a shaded alcove, so anything outside the alcove / in sunlight is completely washed out and unidentifiable 2. While on cell connection, my phone has worse then even odds of being able to connect for live view, and doesn't provide an error message beyond 'we're having trouble reaching the servers'... despite the fact the servers just told me about motion detected. 3. This wouldn't be as big an issue if I could view live motion on a PC. Unfortunately, every PC I have is a windows 7 or linux machine, meaning I only have access to the web app, which can't provide live view, or do many other things. 4. Occasionally I'll attempt a live view from the cell phone, and it won't fail- but it will show nothing but a black screen. Figure, ohh, maybe this is a bad cell connection, let's see what the Ring website has recorded for the live view session.... it's a black screen. :( 5. Recording only starts 1-2 seconds after motion detected, which means for delivery folk you only see their backs, if you see anything at all 6. Motion not reliably detected, despite sensitivity being cranked up to max 7. The white ring LEDs are far too bright, they invite attention, which is the last thing I want; there's no reason that can't be disabled in settings 8. I don't know it for a fact, but I expect if internet is down or Ring servers are down, nothing will be recorded 9. I find the vendor lockin / Apple approach of ""Closed hardware used the way we tell you to"" annoying. I'd like to have the option of, say, uploading to a local FTP server rather then sending video to the cloud, especially if my own internet isn't great. Though I accept the DIY tech crowd isn't part of the target audience. I've switched to the Ring Pro, and most of these seem to be either resolved or at least acceptable, but the Ring 2 is unusable for security. And I don't really understand why- it was released more then a year after the Ring Pro, it's hardwired, it should be able to support basic things like a video buffer, and reasonable internet connectivity. Nice things: PIR motion sensor (probably), so things like shadows from trees blowing in the wind don't trigger a motion alarm Did come with all hardware needed, and useful extras (though the hardwire kit didn't come with anything for connecting to existing wires) It would support battery operation, so if you wanted to just duck tape it to a post in your front yard you could.",Not usable for home security
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2017,Baseballman86,"Pros: I love the concept of this product, and it is extremely useful and reassuring as a homeowner.  The design of the product is sleek and attractive and the user interface of the app is very easy to learn and navigate.  That said, this product has one annoying flaw, and it's really more of a ripoff than a flaw. Cons Once your trial of ring video recording ends, you can no longer access past events without a paid subscription.  That's not such a big deal until you realize what counts as a ""recent event"".  If you don't press the button within about 5 seconds of getting a motion alert, you missed your shot and now it's a past event.  Say the UPS guy comes, presses the doorbell and walks off immediately.  Your phone properly notifies you that somebody is at your door, but you've got something in your hands, or your phone is in your pocket or any other distraction is going on that takes 5 seconds to finish.  By the time you hit the notification banner and go into the app, it will take you to a screen that says you need a paid subscription to see past events.  Earlier today I got a notification WHILE holding my phone, clicked it immediately, but the live video loaded slowly and by the time it did load, the ""event"" was considered done and it took me to the screen saying I needed to pay.  I have no problem paying to record everything and be able to pull up events from hours, days or weeks ago, but needing to pay because 5 seconds went by and the app loaded slowly is a rip-off.  This is a $200 item which replaces a $5 hardware store doorbell, and the ONE thing it's supposed to do (show you live video of rings or motion events at your door) doesn't work about half the time without paying extra.  There needs to be about a 30 second window at minimum where you can see what's going on without having to pay extra. When I contacted customer service about this, they were friendly and helpful, but ultimately only gave me one extra month free trial, which has since expired and doesn't fix the problem.  This is a product flaw.  Be aware that if you want this to work properly, you're going to need to sign up for an ongoing subscription.  To work as advertised, this is really a $200 doorbell with a $30 yearly subscription fee.",I love the concept of this product

With the only other upgrade being 1080p video, which isn't much different than 720p. Also in order to view any saved video captured from motion, you have to pay $30 a year.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Nov 2017,Amy D,"I have given this product one star because I can not give it zero stars. We had very high hopes for this product as we had heard many great things.  As I read the reviews I became a little concerned about some of the one star reviews and complaints about functionality but figured it might be attributed to bad routers, extended distances, poor signals etc.  Unfortunately this was not the case as we had none of those circumstances at our home. I will start with the good.  The item comes well packaged with excellent instructions and all of the necessary tools and hardware.  It also gives you several different manners in which to mount the unit.  We charged the battery for approximately nine (9) hours, tested the camera to ensure that it was working and had it mounted in about five (5) minutes.  So far so good.  Then we tried to test it. Our front door has a walkway that leads up to it and it is clear from obstructions for about 40 feet.  We set the Ring on the most sensitive and furthest range.  I walked at a normal pace from about 40 feet away directly to the Ring doorbell while my wife was inside with her iPhone monitoring the camera for movement and notifications. Imagine my surprise when I was standing right in front of this camera waving my hands like an idiot only to NOT have it notify my wife of anything.  Approximately five (five) minutes later, she received a notification along with a video of me walking AWAY from the Ring and my front door.  The video started when I was about 10 feet away.  (this is after having walked right up to it and waved my hands in front of it). We repeated several tests over the next two days and realize that the capabilities of this product are a far cry from what was advertised.  I'm not sure how we are supposed to have a two way conversation with anyone if we don't get notified until AFTER they leave.  On top of it all, after less than a week, the battery notified us that it needed to be recharged. In short, this product delivered NOTHING that it promised.  It's like buying a balloon that has holes in it.  You can't use it for what it was intended and that renders it useless.",We had very high hopes for this product as we had heard many great things.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Nov 2017,John Archer,"As first-time parents, safety and security are our top concerns. This made a video doorbell very appealing to us. After a ton of research we decided the Ring Video Doorbell 2 would be the best choice. When it works, the Ring delivers decent video and audio and picks up motion without a problem. Emphasis on ""when it works."" Despite our internet running at 300mpbs or faster, our Ring struggles to pick up a solid signal from our router, which is no more than 15 feet from the RING. The several times I've contacted the Ring support team they've been very friendly. They even sent us a signal boosting Chime Pro for free to help with the signal problem. Unfortunately this only made the signal worse according to the support team. Because our Ring receives a poor signal from our router, it often struggles to connect - failing completely in many cases. It even fails to capture motion because of this. Even when it manages to detect motion, it often doesn't record any kind of motion event footage, as the signal was too poor. Fortunately we live in a fairly safe neighborhood, in a fairly safe town. This made it all the more upsetting when we came home to find someone's tools ON TOP of our Ring device. The person failed to detach the Ring, luckily. The real irony is that the Ring didn't even capture footage of the event due to its poor signal. Despite this, we now pay the $3 a month required to save our online footage - when it captures. We're out of the return window due to our many attempts to fix the device through Ring support. If I could do it over, I'd be tempted to send it back and try another brand. Everything else in our house gets a killer signal, so why this device can't get a signal from our router that's only 15 feet away is beyond me.",Great - when it works
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2018,Michael J. McKenzie,"I wanted to start my security with a live view camera doorbell. The Ring video doorbell 2 had great reviews, so I decided to give it a whirl. Here are the pros and cons of the Ring doorbell. My system is not a wired one so I had to use the battery pack. Ring says the batteries come between 50% and 75% charged, but I had to charge the battery overnight before I got the indicator that the battery was fully charged. The package comes with a USB to micro USB charger. Installation was pretty straightforward. Everything you should need is in the package. You may need to use a drill if you have concrete, stone, or wood backings. It comes with a handy level that you can install temporarily to ensure you get a level doorbell. It also comes with wedges if you need to angle your doorbell in a different direction. This comes in handy if you have stairs, a hill, or are close to a road. Installation probably took about 30 minutes, but hats because I had a few obstacles to overcome with my doorframe. Application installation only took a few minutes and after the software was updated (which took about 1 minute) the Ring was ready to use. If you do need to use the battery be sure to install the safety screw in the bottom. Again, the screwdriver and specialty driver come with the package. And if anyone tries to steal your Ring doorbell, Ring says they will replace it for free within the first year. Hopefully you’ll get the video of someone stealing it. For the iPhone, the app is really user friendly. It takes about 5 or so seconds to pull up the live view but every other feature is instantaneous. Adding other Ring devices is also painless and easy through the app. Another great feature is that it is Alexa capable. So depending on your preferences, you can have Alexa let you know when someone’s at the door or you can do it through the phone notification or you can do it through both. The ring doorbell 2 touts a 1080p video, but this is only if the WiFi it connects to is strong. Ring has a level system to indicate WiFi strength. -99 is the worst WiFi strength and I suppose -0 is the best. My living room is essentially in the backside of the house whereas the front door is obviously in front. When I was first installing the doorbell my wife tried the intercom system. She came through broken and choppy and it was hard to hear her. As well, the video doesn’t seem to be 1080p. The first two pics I attached are pre- Chime WiFi extender and the second set is after the WiFi extender. This increased my WiFi level from -62 to -53. I’ve tried the WiFi extender in various outlets and the results are pretty much the same. I’ll provide a review for the Chime and WiFi extender in its own area. It has made it easier to hear and speak through the two way speaker system, but the video quality is still nominal at best. A cool feature is if you use the live view system you can zoom in and out. However, if the video quality isn’t that great, you’re not getting much detail to the zoom. The Ring doorbell does have a lot of neat features like a variety of different rings. The one feature you’ll have to play with most to your preferences is the motion settings. You can increase or decrease the motion ranges as well as turning on or off 1 of 3 preset areas (left, middle, right). See pictures. I also have my live view available which Ring says depletes the battery faster. After about a week of toying around with it, the battery level dropped from 97% to 85%. So we’ll see how long this thing lasts. I’ll provide an update to the full length of battery life. After you register your device you’ll have 30 days of free subscription service. This means all the videos your Ring captures will be available to you. I’m still within the first 30 days myself, so I’m not sure if what is captured will be saved on my device or not, but I’ll post an update when that happens. On the bright side though, for only $30 a year you can pay for the subscription, which is ridiculously cheaper than other products. All in all, for the price point, features, and quality, I am giving the Ring doorbell 2 four stars. This means if I ever need to replace it, I might look somewhere else if something new comes on the market, otherwise I’ll be getting the Ring again. Update: with average usage, the battery lasted 10 weeks before needing a recharge.",Good device for beginner security

Installing it to the wall was the easy part. Getting it to work? Ridiculous. I've had nothing but problems with it for months, and when I called customer service, I was on the phone for a good 35 minutes with a young man who had NO idea what he was doing, and he couldn't assist me. The final straw for me is that I had a package stolen from my front porch today, in broad daylight, and my Ring was just asleep at the wheel. Nothing. No doorbell alert, no front door activity alert recorded even though it was technically 'online.' The Ring Video Doorbell 2 has been worthless for me, and I've had it for 3 months: 1) It falls off the wifi regularly - like others, I had to purchase an extender. 2) My battery drains every 2 weeks - I finally set the perimeter so that it only records the most limited area possible. 3) Even when it's connected to the wifi, when people ring the doorbell, nothing happens on my phone, and the action recordings/alerts are even worse. It just doesn't work. It's too late for me to return this product, and I'm really annoyed about that. Especially now that I have to deal with this stolen package issue.

""Play"" in engineer speak means: 1. Power it up. 2. Move it throughout your home - Dark and Light filled spaces. 3. Press the Doorbell. See how fast your cell responds. 4. Look at picture Quality. Is it clear? Does the video lag behind actual movement? The Ring Doorbell fails miserably on steps 3 and 4. Slow loads, no loads, very pixelated images. Unit claimed that I check my connections.

I bought the bundle with a free Echo Dot. Unfortunately, the Ring 2 Doorbell will not work with just audio through the Dot. It requires video AND audio to communicate with the Ring Doorbell. I think this is an oversight. A much more effective bundle would be the Ring 2 Doorbell and the Echo Show, which supports video AND audio. My Ring Doorbell is named Front Door. I simply ask Alexa Show to ""Show the front door,"" and I can see who is at my front door and talk to them. They do not know if I am at home or connecting remotely. To turn off the camera, I say ""Alexa, hide the front door."" The reason this all works is that many doorbells have 24v power, so the camera is powered and ready to go with battery backup. Initially the Ring doorbell said that my wi fi connection was too weak. In actual practice my wifi connection to the Ring doorbell is fine. If your wifi connection IS truly too weak, consider extending your 2.4 wifi connection using a Rock Space Wi Fi Repeater. You should download the Amazon Alexa and Ring Apps to your phone.

First we bought the one to wire in, but apparently there's a transmitter probably somewhere in our walls that broke, so we had to return that one. We bought this one because I hate having to buy batteries all the time and so hot the one with rechargeable batteries, but the batteries only lasted  about a month before I started getting emails to recharge it, and you have to use a small screwdriver to take it off and recharge it. At the same time I'm getting a million emails about the promotional saved video history service ending- which I haven't really even used. What I really wanted was a doorbell that would work and I could hear all over my house, but I had to buy a separate plug in receiver to hear it anywhere besides my phone. Its supposed to connect to Alexa, and we have 4 dots in our house, but haven't yet found the time to connect those because it was more complicated than I thought. And if you think it's great to know when people are at your door when you're not home, I've just found it annoying because my phone will ""ring"" at inconvenient times alerting me someone is at my door, but because I'm not connected to a fast wireless it takes forever to actually connect to the camera/ringer and so really does me no good. Maybe this is cool for tech heads that want to dial it all in, but if I could return it and just get a doorbell that I could here both upstirs and down without having to tear open walls to fix the wiring I would.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Nov 2018,Olivia L.,"The reason I bought this camera is it has rechargeable battery so I don't have to wire it outside the house. It is said the video resolution is 1080p but the resolution is much lower than the ones I got from the other camera with the same resolution, the ones from Ring must be 720 not 1080. The motion detected videos are recorded with the motion a few seconds after motion is detected so if it is a quick motion, you don't even see anything happened in the video. The ridiculous ""feature"" is you have to PAY for motion detected videos after free trial period, which is 2 months. Who does that!! Without motion detected videos, the camera is useless. I have cameras from two other companies, both offer free motion detected videos for 24 hours, one of them lets you insert SD card for more local storage so you can save more videos. All cameras my friends are using don't charge for motion detected videos either. So taking the subscription fee into consideration, the price is really $200 + $30/year. I was thinking to return this but the return window in ONE month after you purchase it. When you realize you have to pay for subscription to view motion detected videos after TWO month free trial ends, it is too late to return it. What a trick! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I will not pay for the yearly fee even though it is not much. I will go for another camera with higher video quality and free motion detected videos.",Check out reviews and thick twice before you buy
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2019,Daniel W. Mccurdy,"I've installed all sorts of WIFI and Z-Wave devices, and I have to admit I had a little trouble with this one. The main issues are the undisclosed installation details that you may find out that you need to know.  The ""installation manual"", such as it is, leaves much to the imagination in the name of simplicity.  There's not much more help on the website, and you really have to dig. The very first hiccup was that I could not complete the installation right after opening the box.  You have to charge the included battery first -- which took me more than 5 hours (it's rather potent).  So I had to interrupt my task and resume installation the following day.  Bummer. If you are wondering about why the unit needs a battery before it will work at all (even after wiring), you need to know that the device REPLACES your existing doorbell button and connects to the same two wires that were connected to that button;  however it also tries to get power from those same two wires.  Keeping in mind that the device also rings your existing chime by SHORTING those two wires together (just like the old button did), you will now understand why the battery is really there.  Yes, it allows the device to continue to operate during a power outage, but more importantly it also provides internal power whenever someone rings the doorbell because it has to short out its own external power feed for a few seconds to ring the old chime.  Clever design.  So the battery must be charged and installed prior to setup the first time.  Although the documentation does not say so, I am assuming that the device keeps the battery recharged thereafter, as long as it's connected to an existing chime (or a 16VAC transformer somewhere).  Of course the unit can operate wirelessly, but then you have to remove the battery periodically to recharge it.  Supposedly it will last a year. A second hiccup is the included DIODE, which may or may not have to be installed across the two connected wires depending on the TYPE of existing door chime you have.  If it's the old style mechanical type (ding-dong), you don't need (or want) the diode.  But if it's a digital type (the kind that plays a whole song for you), you need it.  And this is the point in time where you finally discover that the RING device is not compatible at all with many existing chime designs out there.  If you dig you will find lists of known-compatible mechanical and digital chimes, and it's a long list.  There are also lists of incompatible mechanical and digital chimes.  As long as these lists are, they are NOT complete.  In fact, I could find exactly ZERO chimes on either the mechanical or digital lists at my local big-box hardware stores.  I ended up settling for a mechanical chime that had a part number that was close to one on the compatible list, and fortunately it worked.  It seems to me that the RING folks should work harder making this part of the project go much more smoothly by providing better guidance on chime compatibility in the box.",Installation: A Bit Tricky

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2017,IslandStyle,"I've had the Ring Video Doorbell 2 installed for one month, and here's how I'd rate some of the functionality: Motion Detection - 1.0 star For my use, this is the biggest challenge with the device.  I live close to the beach, and the breeze picks up every afternoon.  The movement from a plant about 6 feet from the camera triggers numerous false movement alerts due to a deficiency with the infrared detection.  Also, despite having the sensitivity set to ~25 feet, the motion recordings never start until someone walking up to my porch is within 8 feet with most recordings only starting when they are already on the porch or walking away from the porch.  A car pulling into my driveway will trigger an alert at ~15 feet. Security Camera - 3.0 stars The video quality is very clear, but because of the wide field of view there is a bit of fisheye effect.  Bottom line is this is great when someone is standing on your porch but the images 30 feet from the doorbell are too small.  Also, the night vision is okay but it seems like the porch light from my neighbor across the street (~150 feet) impacts my ability to see darker images in my yard. Video Doorbell - 4.5 stars For my use, this is where the unit excels as you can answer your doorbell from anywhere via the app.  I've only had one real experience with this, but it was nice to provide package delivery instructions to the carrier. Btw, this was a wired installation so I can't speak to the battery use.","If you can live with the motion detection shortfalls, this could be a good option for you"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2019,A. Watkins,"I purchased two Ring Video Doorbell 2s during the Black Friday sale, I purchased 2 Echo Dots as well as a Chime Pro and two additional batteries. The items arrived in good condition, were easy to unbox, and the instructions and installion were straightforward. There was some trouble getting the 2nd doorbell to pair to the Chime but it was ultimately resolved. The guided setup was helpful and addressed common issues such as installing near a road or trees that will trigger motion capture. However, the app itself can be buggy. BUT the biggest issues are the complete lack of video recording unless you pay a monthly fee and the intermittent triggering of the motion detection. Set at the shortest range the motion sensor will trigger because the a car pulled into the driveway next door but doesn’t pick up a carrier delivering a package right in front of the door. Increasing the sensitivity only serves to kill the battery faster and cause notifications that you have no way to determine the cause.","Poor motion detection, no video recording without a monthly fee, terrible battery life"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jul 2019,B. CAIN,"It *might* take you five minutes to install the Ring (to screw it to the wall) but it will take you untold hours (and extra $$$) to try to resolve the Wifi issue. I live in a small townhouse. I have strong Wifi and a very good router with two bands. I never have any trouble with any other devices. But even after two setups, the Ring's connection to my Wifi is still ""very weak,"" which means I usually can't see ""motions"" and ""rings"" until notifications that arrive much later -- if at all.  In fact, the wifi connection is weaker after the second setup. My research regarding this issue -- which seems to be common -- shows Ring and other users offering the following fixes: 1/ ""move your router close to the doorbell"" (because everyone is able to put a router by their front door) and 2/ buy a wifi booster or Ring Chime ($50) to boost its reach. And many users report that the boosters don't work. Ring makes it sound like you just charge this baby up and screw it to the wall and you're ready to go. HARDLY. It has been extremely frustrating, and I won't be recommending this to others, unless they are network experts. FYI: My neighbor has Nest and says he has not had these same issues. My brother is looking into the Arlo system, which is what I just recommended to someone who asked me how I like the Ring. ALSO -- the MOTION DETECTION is just puzzling. It will occasionally catch a car going by in the parking lot, which is fine. But when I pull into the space right in front of my door and get out and walk up the walkway to my door, it doesn't pick up any of that. It doesn't pick up anything until I'm right AT the doorbell. Yet, it'll get a car driving by even farther back. And yesterday someone came to my house and rang my regular doorbell (because the RING is TOO LARGE to fit where that is, so now I get to have TWO doorbells and charge this thing to keep it working) and I walked out and stood right in front of the Ring talking to her for at least two or three minutes, and NO ALERTS.  So I really don't get it...",Good luck getting a usable Wifi signal
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jun 2019,Tom4X2,"Well that was easy. It’s not very often I find a product that installs right the first time. Ring made that happen, partly by including just about every conceivable item you might need to complete the installation of the doorbell and the app. Plus, the app works equally well on my iPhone and my iPad. I read through the instructions before I bought the Ring Doorbell 2 and watched the installation video, so I knew what to expect.  ""Murphy’s Law"" always comes into play for my projects though and sure enough when I went to place the Ring Doorbell 2 on the space where my old doorbell was, I found the trim molding on the door frame was about 1/8"" higher on one side than the other. This would’ve affected the viewing angle whether or not I used either of the two included adapters to angle the Ring Doorbell 2 to either side or up or down a few degrees.  I found I needed a 1/8"" shim to balance out the mounting.  I had an old paint stirring stick so I just used a 3"" piece of the paint stirring stick to provide the 1/8"" ‘fill’ and voila, problem solved. Other than that, the installation and configuration followed the instructions perfectly. I did find I had to adjust the ""Motion"" settings to keep the device from using too much power.  There are three ""Motion Zones"" and a ""slider"" to adjust the ‘motion field of coverage’.  My home faces a subdivision street about 50’ from the front door, so I adjusted the slider towards ‘Minimum’ so the Motion Detection covers the front yard, but not the street.  The camera still covers the street, it just isn’t triggered to record/alert except when a motion detection occurs within the narrowed range.  I also turned off the left and right Motion Zones.  Once I did this, the Power Consumption fell to an acceptable level.  Now the Ring Doorbell 2 should run 24x7 and never deplete the battery. I knew before I purchased the Ring Doorbell 2 that I would want Ring’s $3/month storage plan.  I just calculated that into to the overall purchase cost and feel it’s a reasonable charge for what you get.","Well that was easy, and works perfectly."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jun 2019,Dolmanet,"UPDATE -  I started having problems with the battery after about 18 months.  The system kept showing low battery, even after I charged it overnight and the battery indicator showed that it was fully charged.  I love the Ring doorbell and we've gotten really used to having it, so I bought a replacement battery, but got the same low battery error from the system.  I didn't want to give up, so I uninstalled the system and reinstalled it from scratch (had to remove it from the door to scan the QR code), including connection to my Wifi network.  That did the trick!  So if you have battery problems, try that before buying a new battery. I got the package deal with the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and Alexa during the holiday 2018 season.  I waited awhile to write this review to check it against the complaints folks have in the 1-2 star reviews.  First, I agree that the Protect plan trial should last longer than 30 days, but for $36/year, it's well worth it and hard to justify the anger people express about it (YES, Ring should be more forthcoming with that fact!).  I mounted the Ring on my front door, just above the lock (make sure you have enough clearance under the ring to install/remove the battery AND access the screw head), about 4' off the ground.  I left the angle and sensitivity settings at default to see if created any of the 'false alarms' that other people complain about, and it has worked perfectly since installed.  It alarms when someone gets within about 15' of the door (e.g. mowing the front lawn) and it's never been triggered by cars passing on the street.  It's awesome to 'answer the door' when you're at work or even out of town.  Excellent product, well worth the cost, just plan on the extra annual cost for Ring Protect.","UPDATE - Awesome Product, but Pay for the Ring Protect Plan!"

This product is a great idea. The execution of this product leaves a lot to be desired. Did they consult with a tech manufacturer before putting this product to market? It's so close to being a good product though. But, no cigar. The Ring help pages tend to point to the other items connected to the product as being the problem. No. It's the doorbell that's the problem. When you experience problems, they suggest things like moving the placement of the Ring doorbell. That's laughable. They should be ashamed of themselves for suggesting something like that. The doorbell is placed where a doorbell would go. No one is going to move their doorbell. We can't move the entrance to our homes. Then they suggest moving the placement of the router. This is less offensive than the prior suggestion. But, it still not satisfactory. They don't know how many other things are connected to a person's  home routers. Moving it just for the Ring might not be a feasible option. In most cases, it is not. But, I think whoever came up with that so-called solution is very aware of that fact.  My cell phones and tablets get great wifi reception in the location where the ring is.

It has been nothing but a headache and problems since it was installed several months ago.  Who knew a doorbell could be the source of such frustration.  Let me break down the problems with this shit product. 1. The motion detection feature on this device is horribly broken.  My house faces a street and it constantly gives false motion alerts to EVERY passing car.  I have tried updating the setting and tweaking the motion detection shit and nothing works.  It either detects nothing until someone is entering your home, or picks up everything that moves with 50ft of your house.  THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN. 2.  The battery needs to be CONSTANTLY replaced.  Who the hell wants a door bell that you have monitor every couple weeks to see if it needs to be charged.  Seriously, every 2 weeks the battery is dead.  If I turn off motion detection, we can stretch it to maybe a month before it dies, but what is the point of this thing if it doesn't show package thieves or who is on my property. 3.  My wifi router is no more than 15ft away from my front door, its in a wide open room and the signal easily stretches out to my back yard (50-85ft) with full bars.  Yet this device drops the wifi signal weekly and then it no longer works at all until you take it apart.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2018,CiCi,"BEWARE:  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU’RE READY TO PAY FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.  Ring’s new policy renders this device essentially useless unless you pay up for a subscription service ($30/year for 1 ring or $100/yr for multiple rings). None of this was clearly detailed in the product box on Ring’s new policy. We’ve had a ring for years and never subscribed for long term video storage.  We used to be able to see at least 24 hours of video footage from ring for free, which was enough time.  We recently added a new Ring, and all was working fine initially as the new device comes with a trail subscription for 30 days. Well, Ring’s new policy is ZERO video footage available to view unless you subscribe.  Without a subscription, it’s now an expensive electronic doorbell!  You can view LIVE video (which burns the battery down much quicker) and technically, if someone rings the doorbell, you can see the “current” video and use intercom with them.  Per Ring’s settings,  “current view” is within seconds of someone pressing ring.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Feb 2018,Susan in DC,"These devices were never designed to be used in very cold weather.  I had one that was hardwired so I wouldn't have to worry about recharging batteries.  After outdoor temperatures dropped into the teens and single digits, it stopped drawing current from the hardware and started draining the battery.  It never reconnected to the hardwire as it was supposed to, even after spending hours on the phone with customer support and trying every troubleshooting option under the sun.  I finally changed to a Ring Video Doorbell Pro, which is hardwired only and has no batteries.  Let's hope this one works better. Also, the motion sensor never seemed to work properly, taking videos of nothing moving or cars driving down the street (despite frequent adjustments to sensitivity to fix this) and missing other very important things, like whoever it was that abandoned a car in front of my house more than a month ago.  Best I could do with that one was estimate based on other videos showing when the car was not there and where it was.",Stops working in very cold weather; erratic motion sensor
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2019,Paul,"There are 3 things making me write this review with 1 star: 1. Customer Support 2. Quality 3. Required Subscription plan First, I set this up, video looked great, did decent job at motion detection (does not have people detection like many other security cameras).  However, two way voice communication was horrible.  The doorbell sits 15 feet from my router, I have not other issues with any other 2 way vioice systems (Wyze cameras, Brink, Amazon Cloud Cam) nor Alexa video chat or FaceTime.  I contacted Ring support, and they sent me an 8 step try this than that list of stuff.  I stated it would take an exorbitant amount of time to complete, but they just said I needed to go through all of the steps (reinstall apps, reset doorbell, turn off bluetooth, hotspot wifi, etc, etc) in order for them to support me.  Not a very customer obsessed response. Then, I started getting notifications about having to subscribe to their ""Ring Protect"" service, to get online recordings.  For $200, I would think this would be included ... it is in my Blink XT2 (another Amazon product) and my $25 Wyze Camera! For the money, just get a $25 Wyze camera, have it Alert on sounds (doorbells send notifications) and then you can 2 way audio through it.",VERY DISAPPOINTED ...

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Apr 2018,Five Digits,"A couple of things warrant the 3 star rating. We initially purchased and returned the Pro version. We returned it because after speaking with product support our door chime was not compatible. After receiving this unit we discovers that it too was not compatible with our door chime. Shame on me for not looking at the compatibility list (review the list before purchasing), but I assumed it was compatible as the Ring support person advised we get this one. There are 2 other issues that really are detrimental to this product. We have an Asus $200 WiFi router that has 8 antennas. We stream everything as we are cord cutters. So our router is amazing. The Ring doorbell sits about 30 feet from our router. Live video is often sporadic and so is recorded video. We average about 300Mbs internet speed so that isn't the issue. And we stream 4K video throughout the house via WiFi without issue. So it's got to be the Ring that is the problem. The other issue plaguing this unit is resolution and image quality at night. If you want any 8mage quality what so ever, make sure you have plenty of light. At night the images are bad, real bad.

If I was rating it on that it would get 5 stars. It works well as a door bell too. However it is useless as a motion detector camera which is primarily why I paid so much for it. I have it wired to power and it is in a fairly enclosed porch but it still fails to capture on motion until someone is 1-2 foot from the doorbell. It should start capturing several seconds earlier when someone steps onto the porch, but it does not. Terrible sensitivity. Someone could easily steal a package without this capturing it. Video is supposedly 1080 but it doesn’t look like; often very blocky. WiFi signal is strong (-60). I think the problem is that my porch is shaded but also gets plenty of light at the entry so it has trouble adjusting the sensor to that. Very poor quality from something so expensive. Update: The number of times that a delivery has been left right under the doorbell without it detecting the delivery man and recording a video is ridiculous.

Plus, I had a package stolen off my doorstep so I wanted the opportunity to see what happened and hopefully bust the next degenerate that tried to steal from me.  Well, the first 30 days were cool, I could review all video alerts that occurred.  But then they wanted money to keep doing this, which is ridiculous so I said no thanks.  Since then, every time someone comes to my door, by the time I get to the app they are gone and so is any video.  There ought to be a automatic 3 day video retention policy and a way to keep video you want, but alas there is not.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2019,Dent.Arthur.P,"This works well, as advertised with a few cautions and caveats: 1) You can't adjust the brightness levels. This is especially a problem if you install it on a darker covered porch and it's pointing out toward a bright street or driveway.  It doesn't have enough dynamic range to expose both at the same time and you can't tweak it to expose what you want monitored.  So if it exposes for the bright street, it doesn't see motion on the porch because it's too dark.  If it exposes for the porch, it will not sense motion on your driveway or street because it's too bright. It needs to either dynamically adjust according to the subject of the motion or else let me set the exposure for where I want motion monitored so that it can properly sense the moving objects. 2) Be careful where you install it.  It needs a good bit of clearance below it in order to both slide out the battery and so that you can get the torx driver straight up and down below it to remove and install the cover screw.  Even something like the dead bolt key housing is enough to keep you from servicing the battery if it's too close beneath the doorbell. 3) When mounting the frame of the device to your location, don't screw the mounting screws too tight or they will break that plastic frame right off! Use a hand driver and not a screw gun.","Works well, but you can't adjust the brightness level"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Feb 2019,Luvume,"Update 2/16/2019 :  To my surprise I was contacted by customer service, Alexis.  Alexis offered to assist me with resolving the motion issue I was having with the Doorbell 2 by helping me acquire the Ring Doorbell Pro.  The Pro resolved ALL the motion issues I had with the Doorbell 2 (See review below, I initially rated the  doorbell 2 a 1 star). The motion detection adjustment scale on the Pro is so far removed from what is offered within the Doorbell 2 hands down. I am trying to adequately describe my delight and amazement with the technical upgrade in what the Pro offers.  I get 0 motion alerts from cars or any unwanted movement. You can adjust the detection perimeters to be shaped exactly like the area you're trying to detect.  For example, if your sidewalk is long and rectangular, you can adjust your perimeter detection to be long and rectangular. The Pro also has color night vision so fantastical it looks like day vision at night. The clarity of the picture for the Pro is unbelievable.  The upgrades to the Pro are so astounding and vast I can only imagine what the Ring Elite has to offer.  Alexis is one of the most sincere, readily available, immediate response, extremely knowledge of all products, all time customer service Rep I have encountered to date. 100% true professional. Her desire to satisfy the customer was like Chick-fil-A customer service, Top of the Tier. Hope someone reads this and gives her a Promotion.  I end w/recommending EVERYONE to purchase the Ring Pro (5 star rating) or probably the Elite. Amazon sells at a pretty good price, it's worth it. You won't be disappointed. First review 2/1/2019: I absolutely despise this product. No matter how much I adjust the motion sliding scale, I get every vehicle that passes by. The instructions are, in order not to get every car or tree that blows adjust the car icon out of the street range, which I do. I have the person icon as close to the house without turning the motion off and I still get every vehicle all day and night. I even have the sensor set to light. Nothing works. The app alert is so often I find myself snoozing all the time or just turning off the sound which defeats the purpose of having it. I just missed the deadline to return today.

The sensitivity of mine is set to about 15 feet but picks up motion across the street over 50 feet away. As a final note the user interface leaves a lot to be desired in terms of viewing and deleting stored videos.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Frank D.,"It just doesn’t pick up motion (people or cars) in time to see them arrive if they are more then 10-15 feet away. This is installed to cover the door that it’s mounted on and down the driveway, if you push the range out to the max you get cars going by, but even then it’s just the back end as they move by my driveway. When set it to max you get let’s of alerts that are just cars going by, very annoying. If I get a person dropping of a package all you see is the back of the person leaving, not what you want if someone is stealing from your doorway. They also are having an issue with the Rapid Ring app on iPhone, it will not connect to show you the live video if your phone is using WiFi.

It has to be something pretty bad for me to express my concerns about a product. That saying, this is probably one of the worst products I have ever spent my money on.

I tried on my iPad, fail...I tried on my computer Failed and then it locked me out for 24 hours..Fine..I called customer support...(outsourced of course) and the girl said, sorry nothing we can do to reset your password and have you attempt again.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Aug 2018,SkolVikes,"The Ring Doorbell 2 has some fine qualities but in the end I ended up returning it and purchasing a Nest doorbell instead.  The installation instructions are top notch and attempted to provide hardware for every circumstance that might arise.  Everything was beautifully labeled  and extra parts were provided.  They even provide the correct screw driver you will need.  I installed it in about 15 minutes working at a leisurely pace. This model has a rechargeable battery that can act on its own so you never have to wire it.  It is supposed to last 6 months.  It went down to 90% in a week of fairly heavy use which included me testing and tweaking it.  I would imagine the battery life would be better under normal use. Now the issues:  I had it installed on the same level  of my home as my router which has an excellent range.  The Ring app kept saying I was having signal and/or interference issues.  I have many connected devices in my home including other cameras, Amazon Echo’s, and smart bulbs and have never had a problem.  I purchased the Ring chime extender to try to mitigate the problem but it had no noticeable effect.  I then bought a transformer, drilled a hole through the wall and hard wired it so that it wasn’t dependent on the battery.  This also had no noticeable effect. The performance of the camera itself was frustrating.  It would notify me that someone rang the doorbell but it would often take too long to connect to the camera so that the person had already left so I couldn’t actually answer it very well.  The motion alerts were inconsistent.  It would record cars driving by but miss the mailman putting mail in the mailbox right in front of it.  Which really defeats the purpose of deterring package/mail theft. The other problem was that it would only record when activated by motion so that if it missed something there was no recording available to review.  The Nest I replaced it with records 24/7 so that if it misses something or someone mentions that something happened in the neighborhood I can review the footage at anytime. One thing that drove me nuts is that Amazon advertised it as “Alexa compatible”. I assumed this meant that my several Echo’s scattered through the house would provide some sort of notification when someone rang the bell.  This was particularly important to me since i didn’t have an existing doorbell.  Alas it only works if you have an Echo Spot or Show with video capability.  Note that the Nest does provide audible alerts to the Google Home so Amazon is really behind on this considering they now own Ring like Google owns nest. So regretfully, I sent the Ring back.  I feel that it is a couple years out of date and needs some tweaking to bring it up to modern standards.  If you need it to work exclusively on Battery power it’s worth considering, otherwise I would look elsewhere.",Good if battery power is your only option.

This thing will go off all day long but as soon as night hits, NOTHING!!!  You get absolutely no alerts at night.  What a POS.  If you want it so you can see who's at the door when the ring the doorbell, it's fine.  BUT forget about using it for a surveillance camera as the Motion is wayyyyyyyy off.  It'll go off if a car drives by and when you look at the video, the car is wayyy past and down the street. So, of course, if you pull up in front of your house, park your car and start to walk up the 50' pathway to your front door (which is where it's mounted, of course), it will record NOTHING until you are at the door and actually opening the door up.  That's a pretty darn big delay.  So for Motion, it is absolutely useless.  I haven't decided whether to keep it or not, as I own a Nest surveillance cam out front which works great for the Motion, so I really bought this just for the doorbell feature as my Nest is mounted high up and really only gets the top of the head if someone is at the door.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2018,Patilu,"We are very satisfied with our Ring 2 doorbell. We wanted protection as some of our neighbors have experienced vandalism and also because we have  many packages deliveries to our front porch. We think the ring will act as a deterrent and as evidence in case of crime. A neighbor showed me video from their Ring camera and it sounded like something that would fit our needs. The Amazon's online offer to find someone to install the Ring and schedule the installation was instrumental in our decision to go ahead with our purchase of the Ring. We wanted to wire the Ring into our electrical system but were concerned that it could be difficult to find someone in our rural area who had experience installing and setting up the Ring. Amazon arranged for prompt installation at a reasonable price. The tech who did the installation was clearly experienced with the process and when he left our house the Ring was installed, I had downloaded the app on my phone, he had demonstrated how the ring works and I had given it a test drive. It was money well-spent. We seperately purchased an Echo Spot, which has a small screen. When we are at home we can view the front door area and hear and speak to visitors without having to find the smartphone and access the Ring app. We just say ""Alexa, show me the front door"" and we are almost instantly looking at the front door area. We speak to the Echo and visitors hear us on the porch and we hear visitors through the Echo. The sound on the porch and in the house is crystal clear. The Ring app announces through our Echoes (and smartphone) that there is motion in front of the house or that someone has rung our bell. The Ring2 doorbell works just like a regular doorbell in that it chimes when someone pushes it. We had the Ring 2 wired in because we didn't want to lose doorbell function if our wireless went down. We also didn't want to deal with recharging the batteries of the doorbell. Things to consider: Camera angle - Our Ring was installed with one wedge behind it which tilts the camera in the doorbell slightly down. However,  it is not tilted down enough for me to view the porch floor where delivery people usually leave packages. I would like to be able to view that area on the Spot instead of having to open the door and look out if I'm home. I also can't see the packages through the app if I'm away from home. There was a second wedge in the ring package that was not installed. I okayed the camera view with tech, so that's on me. I just didn't realize there was a problem until after he was gone. To install additional wedge(s) we will have to have someone detach and rewire our Ring doorbell. I've since learned you can also  purchase Ring wedge packages  on Amazon with 3 wedges so you can experiment with 1,2, or 3 wedges to be sure you are capturing the area you want at the time you install your doorbell. The wedges can also help you eliminate or reduce triggers that cause a motion alert like cars just driving by your home.  There are settings in the app to help pinpoint the area you want to monitor, but being able to physically adjust the camera angle helps, too. Insets and offsets limit camera view -If you have an inset entry to your front door (or other insets or offsets on the side of your house where the Ring is installed) the camera view can be limited by the walls of the inset or offset. It will not be the expansive view of your driveway and front yard  that it would be if your door, doorbell , and home design are all flush. We do have a slightly  inset front door (about 4 feet) and no offsets. The walls of the inset somewhat hinder our camera view. Through the app we can see the half of our driveway closest to the street and about 2/3 of our front yard, as well as the small porch/front door area. We cannot see any area up close up to our house except for the walls of the inset/porch area and a short section of sidewalk directly in front of the door. You may want to consider additional Ring cameras if the camera view from the doorbell is not expansive enough to meet your needs. Using Ring app on the phone: the app is user friendly, but does not have a setting to repeat  notification sound. If you don't hear that that one notification or see the simultaneous popup on your screen indicating that there has been motion or that doorbell has been rung at your house, you won't know about it until the next time you look at your phone. I think home safety is of critical importance like phone calls and messages and should most certainly have the repeated notification capability of those other apps. Video quality: Live and saved daytime video from Ring camera is very clear on my Samsung s9. At night the entryway/door area is also very clear but the dark yard and driveway in the distance look like smoke that's pixelating.  I think this is because we have a dawn to dusk light near the doorbell camera. I've seen my neighbor's night video from a Ring camera that isn't right near a bright light and the quality is excellent. Saving  video of motion and doorbell rings- The saved video is very user-friendly to access and view through the app. You do have to pay $30 a year to save your video after the 30 day free trial that comes with the Ring 2. If you don't pay, you will only be able to view what the camera sees in real time. If you add additional cameras, there is a different payment package if you want to save video from all of your cameras. Too many motion detection notifications - It might become wearying to hear repeated notifications if you have lots of traffic in and out of the door with the Ring doorbell. You can snooze the notifications for fixed periods of time and turn motion notification off through the app and it's easy to do. We are happy with Ring 2 with qualification that we also purchased  the Echo Spot to coordinate with it.It is very consistent in notifying us of motion and doorbell rings. I gave the Ring2 4 stars instead of 5 because there isn't the option in the app to repeat notifications. For me that severely limits the most critical use of the app when I'm away from home, which is to notify me (more than once if necessary) of activity around my home in as timely a manner as possible.","Works as promised, but app needs a critical tweek"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2018,ArchDruid,"I don't write many reviews on products but I feel I really need to let people know what they are getting into with the Ring 2 Doorbell. First off, do what I should have done and read the reviews before purchasing. You'll save yourself a lot of heartache. During the Thanksgiving Holidays my wife's aunt had one of these and it really impressed my wife so she talked me into replacing my Zmodo camera with this. Big mistake. As others have mentioned the motion detection is really bad. I did like another buyer and watched on my phone as I approached the doorbell. I got all the way to it, waved at it for a few and finally it kicked off. Mine's set for maximum range! If you want a camera doorbell that goes off when you open your door to leave the house..this one's for you! My garage is 15' from my ring doorbell and the other night it went off saying motion and by the time I looked out my wife had already pulled around in front of the doorbell, went out of sight, and then backed into the garage and the only thing the ring caught was the end of the car as it entered the garage. Unacceptable! Another issue as others have noted is the ridiculous speed this thing puts motion is has detected as a past event. I can be at work on a good wifi network and I'll get an alert. By the time I grab my phone, click the alert to pull up live cam, it's already too late. This alert window needs to stay active at least 30 seconds before it calls it a past event. My doorbell is within 10 foot of my router and has a very strong connection and the Ring always says it's a great connection so thta's not an issue. I bought a Ring battery spotlight camera for the back porch and it's detection seems to work a lot better.  If I would have known I would have probably just got another one of them (or stuck to the Zmodo). The only Pro for the Ring doorbell 2 though is great packaging, echo DOT alerts, and easy installation.",Very Disappointed in the Motion Detection
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2018,roll cyclones,Constantly doesnt connect and mostly when it does it's a black screen. My internet is 50mbps and the router was 3 feet away from the doorbell so that wasnt the problem. It did work better at night but still the recording was glitchy. The only thing that worked well was the motion sensor and the actual door bell. App seems nice but I would rather prefer a bare bones app that simply displayed the camera when clicked on. We have a $30 baby monitor that works flawlessly and puts this thing to shame. I really wanted this to work but I had to return it. Oh and the $30 yearly recording fee sucks too.,Black screen more often than not
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,SpitefulMonkey,"Ok, here we go. I purchased this doorbell originally to use wirelessly (not hardwired). The next day I decided I didn't want to mess with charging it. So I purchased a new transformer knowing the one here would not be enough to keep up. I went with a 24v/40va from here for $15. There are no chimes I've ever seen that can operate above the standard 16v, so I just opted to use a ring wireless chime and bypass the old wired one in the house. It could not handle the new higher voltage from this transformer. Now very important here...YOU MUST USE A RESISTOR if you wire directly with no chime. 50watt 25ohm. There are tons here for 5 to 6 dollars. Replaced the Transformer, threw the resistor inline, bypassed the old chime, and wired the ring. All is working perfectly. Video is great, no wifi issues at all, and the echo show integration is flawless so far. I'm loving the device. One less talked about feature is the ""neighbors"" social app. Being able to see all your neighbors posting footage from their cams of strange events and describing them. Seeing a distance from your home of where it took place and commenting on the posts is great. Think of it as anonymous facebook for ring cameras. I feel connected to my neighborhood and any events here I should know about. I feel this was an amazing purchase. Dont be scared off by some of these posts. You just need to do a little research on the best approach to hook it up for you. I cant speak on battery life as I decided to hardwire, but on the other aspects, this has been great. With the angled backplate it came with I clearly pickup my porch, front yard, and driveway. I'd repurchase again in a second. As a side note, you can power a second ring from the new transformer if you desire (backdoor). Plenty of power.","Fantastic purchase, I'm pleased in every way so far"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2018,Philip Weiss,"How on earth could there be a doorbell that doesn't ring?  OK, it rings OUTSIDE, but nowhere inside!  A $10 wireless doorbell comes with a ringer that you can put anywhere inside, but this $200 one doesn't.  No, that's extra I guess, but they don't even say that on the product page.  They do say that it works with Alexa, so I figured, ok, my echo dot will tell me when someone rings the doorbell.  Nope.  I guess you can view it on a Show or your TV, but I don't have those.  I just want to know when someone rings my doorbell.  Is that crazy?  Wish I could return it, but it took so long to figure out all the problems with it, it's been over 30 days.  Most of the other stuff doesn't work right either, but not having a ringer is just a big FAIL for a doorbell.","A doorbell that doesn't have a bell!  Seriously, I can't make this stuff up."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Dec 2018,superK65,"My first Ring was wonderful. No matter where in the world I would be I could keep an eye on my door. The ring died after two years.  I was lost so I purchased the Ring two.  I used the existing bell wires to install.  This ring is not worth buying. It doesn’t capture any night activity. It goes off line frequently. It is slow to turn on, so when it does work, the video shows the person leaving the area, no face just the back. When we were out of town it went off line and there is no way to reset it without being at the doorbell. As I said the first ring was wonderful so maybe the quality has deteriorated over two years.  My son also experienced the same problems with their second ring.  They have switched to Nest.  I am so disappointed given the cost of the Ring and it isn’t working right from the start. I hope no one pays so much money for such an unreliable product.",Don’t waste your money on the current Ring2
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2019,Traveling gal....,"Allow about an hour and walk through the clearly written instructions step by step and you can set up and install replacing a wired doorbell.  We had a problem with the motion detection not going off at night and called Ring and they were great.  They were able to adjust our settings remotely and now it works fine.  Highly satisfied with product and customer support.  Here are a couple of tips:  it's a little large and obvious...fits but hangs over one side....we used the wedge to avoid street motion...the motion notice to your phone lags the recording start so your'e not going to talk to the UPS delivery person...but you will see them...you will be able to talk to someone that remains standing in the area.....the recording lasts for 40 seconds after motion is detected.  After that you have to go to ""live view"" which is also recorded and continues as long as your viewing session continues.  After 2 weeks we have very few ""false alerts"" and it's captured every motion that it should have captured.  The app is easy to use and after a day or so it's very friendly.  Buying more Ring cameras for garage and back porch.  Great product.  Not perfect...but very very good.","...after a bit of ""tinkering"".... here is a ""heads up""....but highly recommend"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Nov 2019,Steve Sussman,"Opinion seems divided on this product, but my assessment is that the Ring Doorbell is entirely unsatisfactory. My experience was as follows: 1. Took two tries to create an account, inexplicably. 2. Motion sensing was erratic and unreliable. I tested this feature several times. Sometimes I received a quick notification; more often the notification arrived some 30 minutes later; sometimes I received no notification at all. 3. Upon pressing the doorbell button, I received notifications properly and quickly about half of the time. 4. I received error messages that the wi-fi has disconnected more than a few times. This, despite the fact my router is 15' from the unit, and that I have strong wi-fi at much greater distances throughout my house. A security product is worthless unless it can work reliably and predictably close to 100% of the time; not the less than half-of-the-time of Ring doorbell. This product is woefully deficient and is definitely not recommended. I returned mine.","Unreliable, erratic, and worthless"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2018,Edmonds,"For a product that is owned by Amazon, I am surprised that the ring doorbell functions as inconsistently as it is. When someone approaches the door, Ring is supposed to let you know there is motion detected. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does not. And when it does, you can answer the alert message by looking at your front door  through your phone.  By the time you answer it on the app, whether immediately or within 1 to 3 seconds the individual that was at the front door has been long gone. The system has so much delay that by the time you answer it right away the person is no longer there. And sometimes the video of that individual that activated the alarm could be seen in the history. And other times it could not. It is too unpredictable of a product, too slow and laggy, and it makes it not worth it to live up to its hype. And this is not because of the weak Wi-Fi situation either. I confirmed this by standing in front of the Ring doorbell and did a speed test from the Ring  application and it shows Uplink 30 MB downlink and 30 MB uplink, which is substantially more than Ring needs to operate.  Finally, who has the time and the memory to replace the battery and charge it every few days? This should come with a AC charger or give us the option to purchase an approved AC charger so that we can run it from inside the house through the wall and to the back of the ring. That option is not available. You'd have to find your own solution for an AC plug in. You are provided a diode to get it to be powered by the existing classic door chime but that also is dependent on how old your existing door chime is.  Just not enough options to solve this doorbell challenge completely.",Unpredictable. Does not function consistently.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2018,Courtesy D,The doorbell seems like a great concept but it just doesn't fully deliver. I have gigafiber by AT&T with 1GB download speeds. I have a WiFi mesh setup with full coverage of WiFi throughout the house. I was told before considering ring to ensure that my network is up to par so I did my homework before making the purchase. The doorbell worked sometimes but it was choppy and people couldn't hear me at times. I just received my purchase 3 days ago and it appears to possibly have been used since it had a few scratches on it. The camera doesn't seem to power on at all now so I checked the battery and it's literally fully charged. I purchased this in hopes of adding additional security to my home but if it doesn't power on that hope is gone out of the window.,Died after 3 days and won't power up
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2019,rita,"I hope to extend this review after a few weeks.  This is just my installation and setup experience. 1. First impression is disappointment that the battery must be charged for five hours before the device can be installed. I understand that lithium batteries probably shouldn't be shipped fully charged, but nowhere in the product description does it say how long this will delay the installation. Bad psychology, in my opinion. 2. Excellent toolkit provided, along with extra screws. Everyone should provide a couple of extra screws. Nice touch. 3. A nice flat mounting plate is provided, but not mentioned anywhere in the instructions. You can attach the plate to the house while the battery is charging. The the doorbell can be attached with four machine screws. Much cleaner and easier than trying to attach the device directly to a wall. 4. You really need a power drill, even if mounting to wood. They provide a masonry bit, but for wood, you will need to drill pilot holes, particularly on an old house where the wood has hardened. 5. I do not advise going against instructions to shut the doorbell power off before attaching the bell wires to the device, but I ignored this instruction, and nothing was hurt. It's 12 volts. I have no idea what breaker controls the bell transformer. And I'm careful. 6. The claim you can install it in five minutes or 15 minutes is just silly. Between gathering tools, reading instructions, removing the old bell switch and prepping the wall, you are looking at one or two hours. An experience professional might manage it in half an hour. But it's something to do while the battery is charging. 7. It works.  WiFi setup is simple and painless. It will probably tell you your signal is weak and recommend an extender. 8. I am a bit disappointed in the signal strength test. It really is necessary, but I don't like the way they do it.  Basically, I think if you and use a phone or tablet at the doorway, you should have no trouble with this device. If that's not true, the product needs to be improved. 9. They use a signal strength number that is technical and is intuitively backwards. Higher numbers are worse. When I translate my signal strength to common terms, I get two bars out of five at my doorway. In their terms, -60 out of -99. They could easily just display this on the app, and skip the unnecessary babble. 10. It works fine. 11. Night vision is surprisingly good. 12. I bought the chime. It is cute and has voices like barking dogs available. I will return if anything changes. There are many features to play with. 13. I added an old, unused smartphone as an additional video chime. No extra cost. I have a couple of retired devices. 14. Old devices can be used to view, but they don't work as substitutes for chimes. At least I haven't been able to get them to sound a chime. 15. I'm happy enough that I added a year of storage service. Someday I may add another doorbell for more coverage. 16. I set the motion sensor to make it less sensitive to street traffic. Now the only vehicle that triggers it is the garbage truck. Hasn't missed any actual people near the house.","First impression is good, with exceptions"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2018,teresaww,"I wish I had done more homework on this. I thought I did...  I've followed ALL instructions that came with this. Searched the internet for anything that I could find.  I even  spent more money on  a wi-fi  extender... The Ring is just two feet away from this, on the other side of the wall, and my connection says that's it's better than most. Our phones are ISP compliant with the Rings restriction.  What's the problem?  I don't get notifications. It picks and chooses when to send them to my phone.  My phone isn't the problem. I've set it so that ANY notification from this app is a priority.  But still, I have to manually go into the app, and look at history, to see that I've gotten a 'missed' bell or motion.  I purchased a Ring alarm system, at the same time, and haven't  even taken it out of the box a month later.

If you’re planning on trying without the subscription I would save your money.  While not within the subscription period, the videos process for so long that any motion detected is gone before you can see the video and 9x out of 10 the video never finishes processing so you’ll never know what caused the motion.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2019,Faith K.,"Our Ring doorbell works great! It picks motion up quickly. The night vision is really good too, especially if there is a light on outside. Obviously it is harder to see details in the dark, but during the day the picture is crystal clear. Good sound and wide camera angle too. It was so easy to set up and is easy to use. I love the Rapid Ring app which can quickly take you to live view upon receiving a notification. We use the battery instead of hardwiring since we rent, and it seems to hold a charge well. This is just what we needed. Installation Hint for anyone who has a doorframe that is not flat - use the corner bracket and just face it toward your door because you only need to mount it right in the middle of the bracket and don’t need a flat surface, and the camera is plenty wide enough to get everything you need.",Exactly what we needed!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2018,Jester,"First off.  If you have a router that is 2 years old or more and you have spent less than a 100 on it... you WILL have issues.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Mar 2019,Sean M,* see update Works as advertised except for motion detection. Mine is positioned about 35 ft from a very quiet rural street. Like the instructions advise I adjusted the motion zones so the roadway is not in them. This did not work!  I now have the motion set to basically 3 ft (lowest it can go) which means motion isn’t detected in much of the area I wanted it to even though I have the angle plate installed. A human now will not set it off until they can look in my window and ups and fedex never activate because they just put the package at the end of the porch. However large cars and trucks will still set it off 50 ft away!  So 75% of the motion activation is false alarms and annoyance and it misses 50% of what would be important to know about. I’m giving it 3 stars because it’s still a useful product as a video doorbell once the button is pressed by a visitor. But they need to be a visitor who wants to announce there arrival. So far battery and other operation seem to be impressive for a device this price. Also to note the app looks nothing like shown here. The motion portion of the app on Amazon shows you can adjust motion with many different fields set on or off. On iPhone at least it’s no where near that. I had 3 zone I could set on or off and only a sliding bar to adjust all motion distance for all zones together not separate which I believe would have eliminated much of my false motion alarms. Although the road is still very far from being in any of these zones and it’s still actives so it appears to be fancier or more of a novelty than an actual accurate adjustment. *Update ring customer service has reached out to me several times via email requesting me to schedule an appointment to speak about resolving my issues. There’s some problems with this. First how do I know that this isn’t a fishing scam requesting my info. Next when looking at this persons alleged calendar the closest time to schedule a phone conference was 2 weeks out so apparently I’m not the only person having issues with these. And finally I have already taken it upon myself to speak to customer service before I made my review so apparently they don’t communicate with in there own company. It would very much seem that these products made by ring are brilliant ideas without being fully refined or developed and sold as finalized products and just using customers as beta testers to see how they perform in the real world. Most businesses that sell and market products that have not been fully completed don’t survive which is troubling because of the amount I have invested initially in cameras and alarms ect. that will become essentially “bricked” if ring folds. It’s a brilliant idea and nice products but they have a long way to go. Also another update after using doorbell 2 for a few months is battery life. I can’t imagine how anyone is getting months on a single charge. Ours is mounted to a side door that gets average traffic from a small family in a rural setting with no other traffic. I don’t regularly check “live” feed and waist the battery yet 3 weeks is all i get. More troubling is that it’s not well disclosed before buying this that the wired versions not only eliminate the low battery life issues but also have far superior motion control that would have solved my above listed problem. Knowing this I would have run my own doorbell power supply and purchased a hardwired version that actually works.,Lots of improvements to be made
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Pioneer B,"I purchased this to replace my old wireless doorbell and allow me to move the other Ring camera to my back door, I can't say that plan worked... Pros: * Usually notifies me when people ring my doorbell (Recommend to use ""Rapid Ring"" app in place of the default to get your notifications) * Notifies me through my Echo(s) when someone is at the door * Video recording of people who are making deliveries to see if things are delivered or not * Doesn't need to be wired into previous doorbell (can if it is there) - Excellent for those without doorbells hardwired! Cons: * Terrible WiFi coverage, even compared to the Spotlight Camera that is 6 feet further away (this is only 3m away from my AP and barely has signal) - Recommended by Ring staff to purchase another of their WiFi extender solutions to have better coverage * Motion coverage for people on a hill is _terrible_.  Even at minimum settings I get alerts from people driving by significantly further away * Doesn't actually always get the correct motion.  I frequently have no capture from the doorbell of the mail delivery, despite it showing fine on the Spotlight video (facing into the house).  Ring staff still can't explain this * Video is frequently ""empty"" (either white or black).  Ring staff have indicated this is because my internet isn't sufficient to do the video all the time.  Again it works fine from Spotlight, and apparently a 1Gbps link isn't enough since they seem to be using the 802.1b antenna at best.","Not for everone, but great when it works!"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2019,Stacy Baker,"The install kit is complete garbage and made of 100% plastic. I installed the camera and we decided to move it down and over after a few days because it was aimed far too high. I took it down and drilled new holes and put the plastic angle mount up for homes with steps back up. The camera will not go back onto the bracket because the top two plastic mounts the screws go in seem stripped. I only tightened them in by hand. I removed them by hand. I was careful and there is zero reason they will not go securely back in. They go in, but if you pull on the camera, it comes easily back off. The bottom two mounts seem to still work, go figure. The mounts should be made of metal. The holes the screws go through should be metal. Everything is plastic. I mean everything. I actually like the camera. I like how it works. I think it’s a great system made totally useless by this piece of garbage mount. So plan carefully your mounting spot kids, it appears if you have to move you’ll have to buy a whole new kit.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2019,Aaron Burt,"I bought this primarily as a security camera to watch my front door. I get a lot of packages and while this wouldn't stop porch pirates, I would hope this could at least capture someone's face to give to the police. My home faces a street, about 40 feet away. I have a 10 ft sidewalk that I hoped the ring would pick up motion for. I tweaked motion settings for weeks trying to get it to start capturing right as they turned that 10 foot sidewalk, but all I could manage was seeing the back of their head. Granted, these delivery people didn't stick around for long, but neither would the suspected porch pirates I wanted to catch. In fact, someone could walk up and hit the doorbell before I would be alerted to motion. I have a Galaxy s7, about a 2 yr old phone. Clicking the motion notification to open the app and connect to live view takes about 7 seconds on a wifi connection. I haven't lost connection to wifi, despite the router being almost as far as possible to my Ring. Install time took a lot longer than 15 minutes. More like an hour, although much of that was my lack of skill, but some of it was drilling into brick. After the 30-day free trial, you lose access to your previous recordings. They aren't stored for a single minute. It's live view or nothing. I ponied up the $3 a month to be able to save and view the recordings, but I don't feel good about it. Overall, this would work great for talking to people waiting at your door, but not for capturing evidence of bad guys.

If you face a street, the motion point goes off every time a large truck goes by.  I set my detection sensor to be low and only pick up  movement in front of the street per the app's directions.  I also installed the wedge looking down as we have stairs leading to my front door.  I can be doing jumping jacks 10 feet  front and center of the camera and it won't pick me up, but if a UPS truck/Van/Truck drives by 30+ feet in the background, it will pick it up every time.  I did some research on how to fix this, and apparently this is just something I have to deal with as there is a serious engineering flaw in the design sensors.  Something to do with IR sensors instead of video sensors.  I am turning off the motion alarms on my Alexa so it doesn't go off all day, but keeping it on my phone for now. We will see how long that lasts.  I am pretty disappointed as I was counting on this to be my security for the front porch and yard, but if I have it turned up enough to do that, it gets every single car in the background which is 20-30 feet away from my porch.

I would say the app and features/adjustments you can do in the app are better then skybells, however my rating reflects the sole purpose of this product and that’s the video quality and clarity. After installing the ring during the day, I was contempt with the video quality. However, once the sun went down, the product was utterly useless. So I got my skybell back out and hooked it up to external outlet that way I can compare the two.  The attached images show the differences in video quality at night. Top image is from skybell, bottom is ring. Ring could barley pick up my white shirt and hat. I am truly hoping my ring doorbell is defective because if it’s not, I will be returning my ring security system as soon as it arrives since it can only use other ring products and this doorbell has left me in doubt of their products. I will first be exchanging this product to see if it was defective or not and will leave a follow-up review.","Horrible, really hope I received a defect."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2019,Kat W.,"7/20/19 Update to previous review: After having the doorbell installed for a few days, I wanted to provide an update. The motion detection appears to be better. The current setting still picks up a few cars driving on the street, but I'm getting clearer images of people as they approach my door. As for the speaker, still unsure. 7/16/19 I received my doorbell yesterday and couldn't wait to start using it. I was going to pay someone to install it for me, but figured I could do it myself after watching the installation video. I'm glad I kept my money because the install was pretty easy. I hardwired it and it took me about 10 minutes. The hardest part was drillling through the brick. I'm not sure if there is an issue with the battery because I left it charge for at least 5 hours and it never signaled that it had completely charged. I decided 5 hours was long enough. When I looked at the app, it indicated that the battery was completely charged. Setup was quick and easy. Wi-Fi connection is just ok. But that can be due to the location of my router, which is at the back of my house, in my closet. I can't move it and really don't want to buy the extender. The motion detection is not great. I was expecting another package and I knew it was in route to my house. So I anxiously awaited it. I got the notification that motion was detected. I looked at the live feed and saw the vehicle driving away. When I reviewed the video on the app, I realized that it did not start to record until the delivery person was at my door. I make some adjustments in the settings and tested it several times and not much changed. A few cars driving along the street activated it and depending on how fast they were going, it caught the tail end at most. I'm going to play around with the settings some more before I draw my final conclusion about this. Otherwise, I tested it at night and the night vision is great. The speaker on the doorbell was horrible during our initial testing. It was muffled SB's echoed. Will continue to play around with this as well. The app is ok, nothing fancy. So needless to say, the jury is still out on this doorbell. I really wanted to love it, so hopefully I can work out the kinks. I will update my review after a few days of using it.",Still not sure

In the last week, it seems to have improved (even though I don't remember getting an update), but I also bought the video storage plan (super cheap... $3/month or $30 for a year) so maybe you get better service that way? LOL.  The camera quality is fantastic and now that I'm actually getting notifications, I don't have as much buyer's remorse as I did before. I still get a black screen 90% of the time when trying to do a Live View, but if there's no one at my house, what's the point of that anyway? So, I like it.

The completeness of installation tool kit included was unexpectedly top notch bar none. The masonry drill bit was unexpected because of the cost it adds to the overall package. Sadly the included machine screws used to attach the doorbell onto one of the 3 included adaptor plates were just a bit too short. 3 out of 4 caught a few threads(not enough in my opinion) one didn't quite reach. I know it was an issue for me because I installed it onto semi uneven brick, but this brickwork top notch, so it's a typical installation. It's an oversight by the engineering team because very few of these will get installed onto surfaces equivalent to what these peices were apparently tested on lol. They included 2 different lengths of wood/anchor screws, but the machine screws were too short even under ideal conditions so it doesn't seem like it was an attempt to cut cost, so it looks like a miscalculation maybe?","Just a bit longer, TWSS"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2019,Lance A,"This has been great.  I have Ring scheduled to ignore when I leave and when I get home.  It's tuned for only the areas where an intruder or visitor would pass.  The field of vision is wide and outstanding.  The video quality via wifi is outstanding. The battery consumption is measured in weeks (I have a charger with a couple extra batteries on standby). I was able to intercept a pushy neighbor making trouble with my wife via the unit's Mic and Speaker remotely while I was at work - on the FIRST day of ownership!  Totally paid for itself in that one instance.  We were also shocked at the qty of events in our neighborhood, another great feature of the product.  Once we saw how many other people in our (very safe) area posted issues such as people attempting to break in to cars and homes in the middle of the night, we immediately bought a stick up cam and mounted it above our car.  The installation and configuration of each was super simple.  The iPhone app is great and very easy to use.  I can't really think of a negative - if you're on the fence about a video doorbell, this is the one to buy!",Totally worth every penny!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2018,Eric Yunginger,"We bought this as our home is not wired for doorbells, and past wireless doorbell units (purchased from a big-box home improvement store) had frequent problems with interference from the neighbor's system.  Purchased after getting an Echo Show, and deciding to take the plunge into ""smart home"" accessories. First things first, as a doorbell, it works fairly well.  Except...it won't ring on Alexa devices.  (Even with the supposed update to the Echo app, we still cannot get notifications through Echo).  It does, however, provide nearly  instant notification to both my phone and my wife's, as well as the Ring Chime Pro unit inside the house (More on that later).  So to that end, as a doorbell, it does its job. Except it's not just a doorbell.  It's supposed to be a motion-activated camera, and compatible with Alexa devices.  Out of the box, it basically did not work for us - our wireless access point is in the basement towards the back of our (small) house.  Mounting the Ring next to the garage walk-out door, it lost all connection and would not work at all - no notifications, no video, nothing.  I suspect the aluminum alloy siding on the house has something to do with that - I can get wifi in my driveway, but apparently not a strong enough signal for the Ring.  So we needed to boost the signal.  Instead of just buying a wifi booster/extender (which should be completely unnecessary in an 875 sq ft house), we purchased the Chime Pro.  This has the benefit of being a dedicated chime device for the Ring, as it still isn't working with Alexa the way it's supposed to, and also boosts the wifi signal for  Ring devices.  But ONLY Ring devices.  Doesn't do jack for our phones, etc.  The Chime Pro is plugged into a wall outlet literally 4' away from where the Ring is mounted outside, and we still get marginal at best signal at the Ring as reported in the app. When the Ring detects motion, it will automatically record 30 seconds.  In theory.  Probably half the time, ours records 30 seconds of blank video.  On-demand live view has to be enabled in the app, and works about the same...half the time.  We haven't really used the two-way communication feature that much, on account that the times we've tried, it took so long (or failed) to connect, rendering it useless. Battery life, I've got no complaints.  They advertise several months, but do warn that life will be shorter if live view is enabled, as that leaves the camera active 24/7.  This was a choice we made, so we could 'check up' via our phones (in theory).  Even still, the battery has lasted over a month.  I can deal with pulling the battery and charging it monthly, even if it does take several hours to recharge. As a wireless doorbell, it does it's job fairly well.  As anything more, it leaves a lot to be desired - and I certainly wouldn't call it a security system (as Ring tends to try and imply).",It's.....okay.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Oct 2017,Michigan Amazon Customer,"I really hoped this would be the solution we were looking for.  After a night of too many motion alerts, I pulled back the zones to what has been the appropriate distance.  It no longer sets off alerts from cars passing by but the issue of late alerts or no alerts have come to the forefront.  No amount of further adjustments have helped. A couple days back the mailman left a package on the front porch.  No alerts came through until after he was driving away in his vehicle.  If he had been a thief he would have been long gone before the video started recording and an alert sent.  Just now I got an alert and it showed me taking the garbage out...something I had done 15 minutes prior. Internet connection is good to marginal even with the chime pro we purchased along with the doorbell.  Interesting concept but not $200 interesting.  Packing it all up and sending it back and hope to find a workable solution to the issues I had hoped Ring would solve.",Just now I got an alert and it showed me taking the garbage out.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Mar 2018,Ryan Pugh,"First off the quality of the device and the amazing job they did with packaging and setup is amazing. They provide everything you need right out-of-the-box. Installation is EASY! Amazing job creating an item like this that anyone could install. bravo! Unfortunately,  I can only give it 3 stars due to the quality of service. The unit is so amazing and I love it when it works seamlessly.  However, we only get video 1 out 4 or 1 out of times when there is a ring or motion. Also, sometimes the historical motion videos are just a black background. I have incredible broadband with 100+ Down and 15-20 Up over wireless (using 2Ghz). The doorbell has Good connectivity or better. Our devices (ipads, phones, even a laptop) will show a long spin from the Ring app when trying to connect from responding to doorbell events and on-demand live view. Painfully slow connection time if it works, but usually an error about trouble connecting. Again, even with HUGE bandwidth availability.  It's just quirky. I plan on getting the Chime Pro to see if that will help.",Amazing Unit but inconsistent service
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Mar 2018,JenWurtz,"I was so excited to install a Ring Video Doorbell, for the convenience of knowing when packages are left and also seeing who is approaching our door before they even ring the bell. So far it is working almost up to those expectations. First, while installation is ideally very simple, I have had a hard time getting the placement just right. This is mostly due to the fact that where my current doorbell is (and i am not looking to wire Ring to my existing bell) is not a flat surface, it is a molding that has curves, making it very difficult to properly mount the Ring unit. What I’m doing right now is holding it only by two screws and leaving the right side of the unit not attached to anything. It seems to be holding fine. I love the video - the clarity is really remarkable and it’s fun to speak to someone as they approach the door, like my husband or kids :) The ability to change the ring sound on the app is great and being able to set times for the motion detector to not be “on” is perfect for when my kids have to leave for an early Saturday morning practice and I don’t need to be woken up and told “there is motion at my front door” because i know it’s them. But some of the negatives I’ve found so far are as follows: even if I make the motion detection zone as small as the app allows, the camera is still picking up too much activity on my actual street and telling me there is motion every time someone walks or drives down the street. But not every single time, just about 80% of those times. So as a result every time it alerts me, I go to the live feed only to see nothing. I’ve also tried setting the motion sensitivity to the lighter mode but it is not really making a difference. Second, while the camera gives a great view of my front path, driveway, street, and the approach to the doorbell, if a delivery man leaves a box right at the front door, it is not seen on the screen. I wish there were a way to point the camera down more. I know there is a wedge attachment that comes with it but for my situation it made no difference and i found it impossible to install on my doorframe. Also the doorbell is VERY loud outside no matter how i control it on the app, it’s like the whole neighborhood will know if someone is at my door. I”m not sure why or how to fix that. However, that being said, all in all, it’s a fun and very useful device. I’ve even installed an additional chime in our basement so that if i don’t have my phone on me while i’m Doing laundry or something down there, I can still hear if someone rings the bell, better than i could with our old traditional doorbell.",SO FAR SO VERY GOOD

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Feb 2019,StuE,"I received our Ring 2 doorbell in November so we've had 90 days use at the time of this review. Our house is older and without a pre-wired doorbell, so the Ring 2 is a workable solution for our house. Initial installation took 15 minutes from screwing the external housing to the door jamb to connecting it to our Wi-Fi. However our included battery was at 30% so it took several hours to charge to full before I considered installation complete. We have the Ring 2 integrated with our house's network of Echo devices (four total, one of which is a Show), FireTV sticks on three TVs, two smart phones with Ring apps, and two desktop computers (1 PC, 1 Mac). Using the app to control motion alerts took some doing. At first it seemed leaves blowing across the yard set it off, but over time we have the motion zones better defined and limited to about 5 feet in range. Still, every morning at about 8:15 while sitting in my office at work I get a motion alert on my phone (""Motion detected at the Front Door"") when the school bus drives by in the street 30 feet away. Apparently each device type and associated app must have ring / motion alerts turned on or off, one setting doesn't manage this behavior across all devices. As a doorbell it works great. The guest hears a ring through the external unit and inside we here an announcement through all Echo devices. On the Echo Show, the Fire TVs, and the phone apps we can ask Alexa to show us video as well as choose to talk to the guest. On Echo Dots or other non-video Echos you only get an announcement, you have to get up and answer your door... just like any other doorbell. Sometimes when requesting Live View we get only a black screen, often an indication of weak Wi-Fi signal. We notice a lag between the doorbell ring and getting the notification on our phone apps - enough lag that the guest is often walking away and halfway down the drive before we are able to access video or audio. Again, this could be due to weak Wi-Fi but this isn't too likely since we have a mesh network with a transceiver less than 10 feet from the exterior doorbell. The Ring app suggests that our Wi-Fi signal is moderate at best. That said, this same mesh network works well in covering our backyard with devices able to watch streaming video 60 feet away from the nearest mesh transceiver. Maybe it's the Ring video codec / compression that needs to be optimized? Don't know, it could even be the round trip from doorbell to Ring video server back to the requesting device. The point is, sometimes the system can be less than responsive. In the end, I find the Ring 2 to be worth the effort. I will be buying a second unit for our backdoor too. I'm banking on improved performance over time as the various apps and device firmware are updated. If that doesn't happen, we still have basic doorbells and motion detection where none existed before.","A Good Idea, Well Executed. Minor Connectivity Issues"

But, if you have a busy life (like most of us) then this isn't for you. There ARE other options out there. You are probably getting this one because you do NOT have the original wiring at your door for a doorbell. And calling an electrification to add those lines will be a few hundred dollars. I get it.

For a multi person household, all using cell phones, i would give this 3 stars.  The problem is, so that everybody can be notified when somebody is at the door, that the app has to be installed on everybody's phone, with notifications turned on, all of the time.  This adds other issues, is anybody in the house, has somebody answered the door and this doesn't include the amount of video being sent around the cellular system and being saved to every  family members phone. To get around the these issues i also bought a new Echo show, believing the advertising, that when the door bell rings, echo will notify the occupants inside the house and the show, would display the camera view on the screen.  now I thought, i wont need notifications turned on on my phone and not everybody has to have the app installed on their phone, plus when my parents stay, or the babysitter is here, they are notified when somebody is at the door, even if i am not in.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Feb 2018,%HUSKYHIDDN%,"The Ring 2 doorbell is an outstanding product that I am extremely happy with. It arrived a day after ordering it, although in fact I had only selected two-day Prime shipping. Setup was simple. I did have a very helpful agent walk me through connecting it on the phone, but that was because I had called about something else and she offered to. I think it would have been easy just following the instructions. Mounting is also simple, especially given the choice of angled plates to use (I chose the side-angled plate to give a better view of our front door and front yard) and the extremely comprehensive installation kit, which includes a masonry drill bit, a screwdriver, a level and all screws and accessories. The battery takes about two hours to charge, maybe a little longer, but lasts well over a week, which is excellent. We have had no connection issues, either at home or while out, and it works with our VPN just fine. I love the wind chimes alert I get on my iPhone when there is motion. We live in a quiet neighborhood and got the Ring mostly to answer the door for packages and to check on our dogs on the front patio. Sometimes I talk to my wife using the intercom as she is leaving or arriving. It’s very useful just to keep an eye on things, especially our pets! The Ring is clearly an excellent security device (and I have no objection to subscribing to the annual video backup service for $30), but its uses extend far beyond security to household management. If you have a large house, in particular, and children or pets, a series of Ring doorbells would be useful as a simple-to-set-up network of video cameras and intercoms. The UX on the app is nicely designed and easy to navigate. Live View is a great way to check on your door and surroundings. I’m hoping to view some raccoons on it at some point! Night vision is excellent, too. Highly recommended, no reservations.",Great security device and for household management

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Apr 2020,Butterfly Lady,"When we remodeled out kitchen a year ago, we ditched the ugly 1920s chime, effectively eliminating a doorbell. T  We bought the Ring 2 during 1919's prime days, but with one thing and another didn't get around to installing it until this past week. Although the directions for installation and activation that came with the doorbell werere sketchy at best, we only needed one call to figure out how to add my husband's phone as a shared user. Then came the issue of how to have it ""ring"" so we could hear it inside!  I went through the installation process several times, thinking I was doing something wrong. Then I called Customer Service (800-656-1918). The representative told me I would need to buy and install a Ring Chime ($30) for that to happen. Nowhere in any of the menus I searched or the small installation booklet did it state that this doorbell (battery powered) needed a separate accessory. So I ordered it and it arrived yesterday. Then the really annoying installation problem arose. I have to say both of the Customer Service reps (Keith and Megan) were very frieindly and helpful, and Keith was incredibly patient with me, After running a series of diagnostic tests, we ended up activating the Chime using my husband's phone. My Samsung Galaxy Note 5 was not communicating with the Chime at the crucial point in the installation. Unfortunately, the Chime ended up registered as belonging to him while the doorbell belongs to me. So the Chime and the Ring 2 wouldn't talk to each other. Today I used my husband's phone to sign him out of our Ring account, sign me in, and set up the Chime. Finally they talk to each other! Finding the page to select our doorbell tone was another case of trial and error, but I did eventuallly find it. Now that everything is installed and activated, I'm very happy with the end result, but the time spent and hassle required to get here has left me wondering if I would have bought this had I known all the headaches it would induce. PROS: o  Provides a good fisheye view of the front porch and most of the yard and the ability to speak to whoever is a t the door. o  Distance from front door and angle of view can be adjusted to suit your own property. o  Works with Alexa devices. Ours is connected to three Dots and a Show. o  Settings can be changed so house can be monitored while we're away from home and even speak to whoever is at the front door. o  Customer Service representatives were friendly, patient, and helpful. CONS: o Battery-operated version requires a separate accessory for a bell to ring inside the house. Neither the description on Amazon nor the written installation instructions mention this. o  Written installation and use instructions are sketchy at best. o In app instructions are not intuitive and require much trial and error, or a call to Customer Service o Required several hours on each of four days to finally get it installed and functioning as we wanted (and as the promotional materials show)!",Easy Installation? Not so much! Battery-operated? Buy a Chime too!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2019,Deb S,"Bought this because after seeing the reviews.  It works great and we can see when packages are delivered or when someone comes to our door.  I even got notifications when I was over 1200 miles away on business.  I was able to talk to the person at my door, and I didn't have internet access where I was.  This was a nice feature of the Ring Doorbell.  The video quality is amazing.  The night vision is great.  I went ahead and paid the $30/year for the subscription even though you don't have to.  Installation of the Ring doorbell 2 was easy and took about 20 minutes from out of the box to getting it adjusted.  I recommend this product.",Great security doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Feb 2019,S. King,"We wanted to replace our non-working doorbell at the front door of our home. A friend at work lives in a home of similar architecture and shared our disappointment at how hard it was to fix the doorbells provided in our mid-century houses. She and her husband had installed an older version of ring. They loved it. She recommended getting the Pro 2 model which we did. We were a little baffled at the installation process but got through it with the help of some YouTube videos. Once we saw how, installation was pretty easy. A benefit we had not expected, but that we love, is that we see when someone comes on our property. I knew the exact moment our yard waste got picked up even though I was at work. I feel less worried now about ordering online for delivery to my home since now I will see all activity in my front porch. I am less concerned about someone stealing packages off of our porch. If they do I at least have high quality video to add to a police report. I hope my neighbors decide to get the ring.",Love it! Don’t want to be without it!

Changing the settings is confusing...Every time a truck drives by, the motion sensor goes off.  Even after narrowing the sensor range to 4 ft it still chirps.  It must be the vibration that makes it activate.  I disabled the motion sensor alerts.  2.  Goes through batteries fast.  If you can, have it hardwired if you have an existing wired doorbell.  I had to buy a back-up battery.  More money, of course.  I like the concept of a Smart Doorbell and all, and Ring is probably the most marketed one.  I wish I had done more research before I bought.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Aug 2019,Douglas,"Yes, the documentation says you don't need a subscription but without it the device is a real expensive doorbell with crappy motion detection. The subscription gives all the useful recordings, without it, you notifications but see nothing. You can go ""live"" at anytime but by the time you do, the person that triggered the alert is already gone or almost out of view. For example, the mailman that comes everyday obvious triggers the motion detection and when I click live view and wait for it to connect, it rarely gets the mailman in the picture at all. (Some times it gets just a glimpse of him walking out of view.) And even if you did, you get no recording of it, even of the live feeds you just watched. So good luck using this as a security device unless you have a photographic memory. At least when I had the free recording trial it recorded things and that was nice but that should be included in the price like other doorbell cams. At least a 24 hr or even 12hr time frame with the ability to download videos as needed. During the trial, and after multiple adjustments, I was able to get the motion detection to go off somewhat regularly. The issue is it took way too long to start recording. I have a 4 stairs leading up to door so I use the included wedge on my device. I get people walking on sidewalk triggering and even some cars that drive a little closer than others. So I know it works. But... the mailman, recordings are always of him putting mail in my mail box which is literally 3 inches below the ring doorbell. So the recording doesn't start recording until they are already at my door. If someone wanted to steal packages they would just have to run to door and I wouldn't even get them on camera. I have a 200meg connection. so network speed is not the issue.",Subscrition required to be useful.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Joe S.,"I've had the Ring Video Doorbell 2 for a couple of years now. We got it right after purchasing our house. Instead of seeing any improvement from initial lackluster performance, it's instead gotten markably *worse* over time. Motion Sensing: I can't count on one hand how often the sensor pulls someone as they're heading to the house. Instead, it's usually after something's been dropped off / as they're leaving. I can open the door, go to my car, close it, and only then will a notification pop off. What's worse, it takes *forever* for it to open up on your phone. And if you don't have Live View enabled (and even then) it'll slowly pop off, give an error, or a glitchy-looking view. WiFi: Maybe this impacts the above, but even when it says there's a good signal.. the connecting can be visibly slow. This is with 300 MBS WiFi. Their response was, despite having good Internet Connection outside my home in my front yard, ""Buy a Chime."" Well, I bought one. A year or so in, that Chime's made almost no difference. Customer Service: I'll say that for the most part, the CSR team was decent - even if frustrating. I appreciate their efforts. But I don't appreciate their ability to correct issues. On a similar note, I think it's odd how the Ring FB page sort of hides negative comments or issues (maybe that's stopped?). Video Quality: Not great. And we're not looking for great, but it seems like even on others' (who may not be the highlighted ones promo'd by Ring) you see all these screen pops and issues. We'll be replacing Ring this holiday season. Thought I'd give it to my folks, but especially with the delays - it may not be the safest bet. Especially when I'm seeing now how well others are competing. The Cloud subscription model doesn't add much value outside of video storage.",Disappointing - not a great value.

The good stuff first - it was easy to install - the app is well designed - for 2 weeks it worked So now the not so good. After about 2 weeks I checked the device and found it was offline.

I did read up on issues. But like many folks I simple do not want to spend a second of my life on a customer service line trying to work out why the unit does not power up any more, then come to the conclusion that it is not working and that I need a new one.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2018,Amazon Junkie,"I bought the Ring Video Doorbell 2 because I travel a lot and liked the idea of being able to see who was at my door -- and communicate with them -- even when I was halfway around the world. Alas, this was too good to be true! I am disappointed by the very long lag time from when the bell is rung until I am notified on my Smartphone. 99% of the time, I am not even able to answer in time and the person simply leaves before I even know who was at my front gate (if it wasn't for the video recording, I wouldn't have been able to see who was there!). I even ordered a Chime Pro Extender, but it did not improve the connection whatsoever. Second, the audio on the doorbell is very low and there is no way to adjust this. Friends have told me that it is very hard to hear me when I answer, even if I am in close proximity to my router (when answering from a remote location, it is even worse!). As for the motion detection, it is way too sensitive and there is no way to effectively block out unwanted triggers such as cars passing by or even a cat running across the road. I live on a cul-de-sac so cars routinely turn around or back out and this triggers the motion sensors even on the least sensitive setting. I have even installed special brackets to angle the doorbell device away from the roadway as much as possible, but that did not help at all. In the end, I decided to turn off the motion detection entirely. Last, as others have commented, the free recording and uploading to the Cloud is only offered for a very limited time, after which you have to pay a monthly fee. Given the poor performance of the device, it is almost a necessity. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a service just to know who was at my door....something I should have been able to do in the first place -- for free -- if the doorbell worked as advertised! I have tried troubleshooting the issue with Ring Tech Support, but there is no real solution to these problems. I am not even sure if there is a way to update the device software should a fix be developed in the future.",Long lag time and poor sound make for a DISAPPOINTING experience
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2019,J. Tan,"I would say this device takes much longer than I expected to install. I might want some youtube video which could shorten the process. First is the connection. They need you to press a button inside of that unit. But this is not mentioned in the manual. Although they put a tag in the unit, but no one knows that’s required for set up. So after you installed the cover and figured out the unit cannot be connected, you need to reopen it and do the connection. Then there is issue to enable the microphone on your cell phone. There’s zero instruction on this and I just search online to resolve. Then when I try to connect to Alexa Echo show, it need me to sign in to Ring account. I don’t think I set up any account during the installation process. Just simply provide the phone number and name, no password set up. But now it ask me to log in with password, how can I know that? Try to set up new password but it doesn’t work too. Because it ask you to enter current password. There is no something like “forgot password “ for you to click. Anyway, taking a lot time to fix all these pain in the ass. Apparently they can do it better but they just too lady to do it",Not that easy to set up
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Aug 2018,Paolo DLR,"I went with the Ring Video Doorbell 2 because it went on sale and I got 20% off that price. If I could do it over, I'd probably spend a bit more and go with the Nest Hello. My reason is because the Nest records 24/7 whereas the Ring 2 records based on motion detection. The issue is that the Ring 2 sometimes starts its recording a bit late and ends too early. Otherwise, it's a good enough product. It's nice to be able to live view what's going on at my front door whenever I want. UPDATE (Aug 22, 2018): After owning this for barely 2 months, I'll say it's not worth it. I received an email from Ring yesterday that I should charge my battery soon. The thing is, it's hardwired so why is the battery draining? I removed the battery, checked the connections. Even the app confirms it's hardwired. I even tried reversing the wires. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to charge the battery every month or so (and wow does it take hours to charge).",Not Worth It

Within a week after installation, I was alerted to  movement at my front door. I watched the stream that was recorded while I slept.  What an uneasy feeling watch some creepy stranger rattle your door knob, stick something between the door, and take pics of the door with their camera.  I posted it on a neighborhood watch website.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2019,J. Goodman,Finally got my Ring 2 Doorbell installed. Thoughts: 1. Installation sucks. I hardwired it to our existing doorbell so that it would gain power from the house instead of having to pull the battery out every few days to charge. The battery is held in by a horrible little screw that I would have had to have taken out and put back in every single time I needed to remove the battery to charge it. So obviously hardwiring was the best option. Unfortunately that's easier said than done. The wires that came with it were nowhere near long enough so I had to crimp and connect new wires to be able to install it. Because our door is a few steps up I also had to use these different brackets to angle the camera the correct way so that it would work in the first place. I'm happy to say that it is installed and is apparently gaining charge from the house. 2. The software is amazing. You can tell a lot of money went into development of it. It's very crisp and incredibly easy to use. 3. Motion detection is very fast and very accurate. So far it has not picked up vehicles driving by because I was able to set the exact area that motion will be alerted. 4. When the doorbell is pushed there's only about a two to three second delay before I get the notification on my phone. When I click said notification it instantly goes to a live view of the video of the person at the front door. At that point I can speak to them and they can speak to me and I have HD video showing they were there. 5. In order to upload video to a cloud you have to pay a monthly subscription. It is incredibly cheap and at whopping $3 a month. If we were to add extra cameras and motion detectors outside that cost goes up to only $10 a month and allows a huge backlog of video in case anything happens. 6. The coolest thing I've noticed is the neighborhood feature. When clicking on that I saw numerous people in the area who have these doorbells that were able to upload pictures and videos of suspicious activity outside their homes. I have yet to figure out how I can do that if it happens on my end but I'm looking forward to being able to keep up with what's going on around here and contribute if any suspicious activity happens at our house. All in all based on my first impressions I think it's absolutely worth the money especially since we got it $70 off for Black Friday. Time will tell!,First impressions
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2018,Penny,"My neighbor has a Ring Doorbell and has been singing its praises for months. With the excellent value Amazon was offering for Black Friday, I decided it was time. The video activates when a vehicle passes in front of my house on my side of the street, and sometimes on the other side as well. Pedestrians and cyclers do not seem to activate it unless they approach pretty close. I haven't played with settings yet, but having video of anyone who accesses my mailbox or driveway would be a goal. I am in the 30-day free trial of the cloud service, and think I will likely continue with the paid service since my neighborhood has experienced a lot of car break-ins and mailbox theft recently. $30/year doesn't seem that expensive if it helps capture a thief. Now for the negative: I expected installation to be quick and easy based on reviews, but mine took hours. The instructions want to look easy, so they give steps for the simplest installation then refer you to troubleshooting when installation fails. I went through a long cycle of trying to connect the Ring Doorbell to my network/phone with failure after failure. I knew I had a good signal, so when the troubleshooting wanted me to download an app to check my bandwidth, I got out of there. Accessing the Internet on my phone for detailed troubleshooting is not my idea of a picnic. What the Ring was doing was creating its own Ring network on my phone then repeating over and over that it had no internet. I couldn't figure what it wanted since the phone was connected to Wi-Fi if I went back to it, until I had to switch to this other Ring network. Finally it occurred to me that my VPN might be interfering, and sure enough, turning it off made the connection easy. TIP 1) If you have a VPN, turn it off to set up doorbell. The second problem was getting the Ring Doorbell to connect and ring my existing wired doorbell. I connected the wires and did the installation as described, then took the battery out to store since I was using the wired connection. Seemed logical: choose battery or wired. No. You have to leave the battery in. I figured that out after several installs and removes when I kept thinking I must have gotten the wires wrong. This was confirmed in one of the reviews that I read later. So TIP 2) You need the battery, even if you wire the doorbell. The hours it took to connect and install are the reason I gave 4 stars. If Ring wants to send simplified instructions, fine. But they should consider also sending a tip sheet including some of the things to try when things don’t go smoothly. Of course, I could have called their number for help…","WIth crime on the increase, seemd a good investment, but installation was a bear: See 2 tips."

Not so! From start to finish (not counting time to charge the batteries) it took about 20 minutes to get this mounted and synced with the app! I was very pleased with ease of setup. I was also concerned about the sensitivity, worrying that I would be notified any time my flag in the yard flapped or a bunny scampered by. That also hasn't been the case: every notification has been for just cause. More importantly, I believe I have gotten EVERY notification: packages or visitors haven't shown up without receiving the alert. The camera quality is very crisp, and the battery life has surprised me! We have had this installed since 12/4, and as of today (12/27) we still have 59% battery life with Live Feed turned on. To enhance our package, we did buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries and 2 chime extenders. I recommend doing the same, or at the very least getting the battery pack so that you are not without your ring while charging. Overall, I'm very satisfied and have recommended this to several friends!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Sep 2019,T. Bell,"Update: Battery life is TERRIBLE!  Lasted < 1 month before needing to be charged. I’ve decreased the sensitivity several times (still pick up cars going by) and still only getting about one month before having to recharge. One HUGE issue that I’ve noticed is you can not customize your notifications of motion/doorbell with your Echo devices in that you either get notifications to all of your devices or none of them. My son moved into a dorm this year and took his Echo dot with him but left it tied to my Amazon account. I had to turn off all the notifications because he kept getting them at his dorm so now I don’t even get notified if someone e is at my door! I know this is a pretty unique situation but could also apply to you for instance if you have an Echo in a baby’s room. You are not going to want it announced on that Echo whenever there is motion at your door or for a doorbell. They need to make it to where you can choose which devices announce these things. Because of this (which I think is a pretty major issue for our family) and the sucky battery life, I am downgrading my rating of this from 3 to 2 stars. Had LOTS of trouble getting it to work properly. Wouldn’t send me ANY notifications of motion detection for over a week! Went back and forth getting tech support via email (also a big pain!). Finally started sending notifications but then was missing motion detection most of the time! Not sure what finally got it to work, but it’s working now. I get WAY too many notifications of cars driving by though and I’ve lowered the sensitivity multiple times. I feel like if I lower it much more, it’s not going to pick people up until they are on my doorstep. I’m relatively happy with it now, but overall I’m somewhat disappointed. I would recommend it, I mean now that it finally is working, I like being able to see who comes to my door, when packages are delivered, etc. But only 3 stars due to the major hassle it was took to get it to this point.",Disappointed ☹️
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2019,Kickinit,"I bought this Ring Video Doorbell on Prime Day. I mainly bought it for the obvious reasons of watching my house when I wasn't home and to track my front door after packages are delivered. So far I am happy with it. The battery life is good and lasts plenty long from what I can tell. The video quality is also good and connectivity to wifi has been great. Two problems I've noticed. The ""security screw"" is nearly impossible to install in some situations. I have a mid-century house with a brick ledge wall that runs along the front. The top of the ledge is about an inch or less from the ""ideal install height"" of the Ring doorbell. Because of this it can be very difficult to remove and reinstall the screw. I also wish the motion detection range was more configurable on this model. The motion range is basically an adjustable half circle that increases equally as you ""slide"" the adjustment zone. You can turn off the zones but there are only 3 zones to choose from. With the configuration of my house, if I drag the circle back to avoid the street, my driveway is no longer monitored by the side zone. If I have my whole driveway monitored then I either have to turn off the entire front zone or live with multiple false motion alarms from cars.",Great except a few minor inconveniences

Pros: The battery life is really good. The motion detection is pretty good. I like that they allow you to setup motion sections but would be nice if you could draw the region. The video quality is decent, not great but not terrible. Cons: the app is horribly slow. They just updated it and now it's even slower. Once I receive a notification of motion and click to open the video it takes anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. It's the same if I click to view a post from a neighborhood alert. I just added the Stickup Camera from Ring and it's the same... slow. Another downside is that you have to pay for cloud storage. Many others have mentioned this as well. I paid for a year and it said I can have 2 devices. After adding the stick cam and trying to add it to the ""protection plan"" I'm faced with disappointment again because I can't add it to the plan. I called customer support and asked them how to add the new camera to the plan and they say I'll have to buy another plan. That's just a rip off. I should be able to use my own cloud storage.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Oct 2019,See Jee,"Decent camera, but only if you're desperate to avoid wiring. I have three Nest Outdoor Cams around a property, and decided to monitor a fourth door with the Ring Doorbell Cam. Here's my review after a couple of weeks: PROS: + Absolutely no wires or power cables; easy to install + Battery life is acceptable; I'm averaging ~3% loss per day + Looks good, records 30 second clips of movement CONS + Routinely MISSES recordings (events are shown as black video and no audio) + Buzzing noise from unit overpowers recorded audio, masking a lot of the conversations + App is a mess Overall, not satisfied as I wanted to be. The biggest issue for me is that recordings are sometimes logged as purely black video and no audio. For example, something involving police activity occurred on our property, but 2 of the 4 videos from that event were BLANK! The one time Ring was supposed to perform, it let me down. So, as I said earlier, I'd avoid this unless you absolutely MUST go wireless. I recommend going through as much pain and trouble to get something hardwired like a Nest cam instead. After all, we all get cameras to monitor and improve our safety, but what's the use if the recordings occasionally fail?",Don't buy this if you're looking for guaranteed video surveillance.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2019,Sanjay Aggarwal,"Overall ecxellent product. Installation went smoothly-I placed on a brick surface. I'm using the battery and bought an additional battery to swap in when the first needs recharching. Setup had a couple hiccups, requiring the help of the customer support: they were very helpful. The other issue in my house was wifi: the Ring requires a very robust wifi signal and they sell a wifi booster to help with this. My original wifi configuration was not good enough but since I have a mesh wifi system, I just moved one of the nodes much closer to the front door (where the Ring is) and it worked very well. Overall I'm very happy with the Ring: video and sound quality are good. I'm very willing to pay $30/year for the level of additional security it provides. I did get the RVD2 at the time of the amazingly good Black Friday sale, so saved alot there!

Motion detection is spotty. Sometimes it goes off over and over from any little movement, and other times it picks up motion 10 seconds or so later.  Just enough time for your intruder to stroll past it. If you try to pick up a motion or ring, there's always a delay, so it can't really be used to answer the doorbell unless someone will stand around and wait a long time. I've worked with tech support (3 different folks: chat, phone, email) and the issue was not resolved. Finally, they told me my download speed did not meet the minimum requirements for the device which is apparently 2.0 Mbps. They will tell you it's displayed on the box.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Mar 2018,EGeekDr,Was excited to order. Bought mainly because I don't have the required low voltage AC supply at the doorstep. Disabling motion alerts or reducing the range helps battery survive nearly a month. Cloud storage is expensive though cheaper than Nest cam. Alerts are mostly delayed and often cannot see anyone in the recorded video clip which defeats the purpose of installing this. Customer care is very good but they keep telling it is the bandwidth issue and the internet speed etc. Maybe next is 100MBPS and with ORBI Mesh router! All other demanding WiFi devices work perfectly. Ring need upgrade their servers and the response to the alerts.,Good but has issues

After watching these videos we wonder what else has happened in front of our home in the past twenty years.  We even saw a car drive by slow once it was driving by our home in the middle of the night.  That felt suspicious. I also love that I could see reports shared of things that have happened in the neighborhood from other people who also have the Ring Doorbell. Further, we installed the security system.  We now have much more protection at a savings of $33 per month over ADT.  We just need to recoup the $450 initial cost of the equipment.  That’s about 14 months.  We’re very happy with the system. We’ve had several nights where we were beat and ready to go to sleep and were not sure If anyone had turned on the alarm and we have to drag our tired body down the stairs.  Now we can turn it on right from bed. The other night I busted my husband because he forgot to close the door on the upper deck.  The app wouldn’t allow me to turn on the alarm and told me the door was open.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2019,Joe,"I really wanted to love the Ring Doorbell, but it has one major flaw.  Apparently most new phones, either android or apple, do not work well with the Ring Doorbell when it comes to communicating with anyone who comes up to your door.  For some reason, the speaker on the doorbell is so quiet that the person on the outside can't hear you.  It's not a hardware problem, but rather some kind of software problem in the Ring Doorbell System.  If you read through the Tech Help Forums, it is a known issue, and you will be told by the Ring Forum Moderators that you can correct this by disabling certain features, but often times that doesn't fix the problem, and I shouldn't have to reduce the capabilities of my device just to use something that is one of the biggest selling points. I really love how the rest of the device works, but if I can't communicate with the person who pushed my doorbell, or just ran up to try and steal my latest amazon delivery, then I might as well return it and go back to my old security camera system.",Voice Communication with visitors doesn't work.

Hutton,"I'm still (luckily) in the trial phase of the Ring Doorbell before purchasing a cloud plan.  This thing is terrible!  I installed it right next to my front door, set up everything properly.  Suckola.  I get motion detection all the time (even when I lowered the settings), but the worst part is when I go to open it to see what the motion is, about 98% of the time, it just spins ""thinking"" and attempting to connect and show me.  When I wake up in the morning and notice that I had a few motion detections during the night, I open the Event History to view and I get nothing but pitch black - one to two second video.  I don't know if their video recording sucks or if their night vision sucks.  When I go to just look at Live View, the same thing - 98% of the time, it just spins thinking about whether or not it wants to do its job.  It's definitely not my wifi because I still have signal from my router down the street. So the reality for me, is I have a stupid ridiculously expensive doorbell.  That's it.  No video or live view awesomeness.  Just lame piece of junkness.  At least I found this out before installing the second one I bought, and before signing up for the cloud service.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Dec 2018,Daniel,"Another reviewer mentioned these issues, but I was impulsive and bought it anyways. They are all true. - I spend a good deal of time adjusting the sensibility settings and using the brackets (both V and H) to reduce false positives, but they are still too many.  My door is about 25-30' from the road and if a truck passes, even small cars, ""motion detected"".  You stop giving importance for the sensor. - I try to answer motion but it takes so long to load (I have an S8, with good wifi) and I got a connection problem way too often. If wasn't another false positive (as usually is), I would have missed the person lurking. - The recording starts too late. when you go see the recorded video (because you were not able to answer the false positive motion), the video starts way too long after the movement started. - regarding payments: I have a Piper camera that records up to 1,000 24s videos for free, overwriting after that. It works great. It always worked. Why Ring enforce additional payment is mind-blowing considering what is available on the market. - I have installed with battery, that was really good because it was easy to install, but on the current pace (75% after 25 days) there is no way it will last the suggested 6 months on the website. UPDATE: had to completely disable the motion sensor, the false positives were driving me crazy. Not paying the monthly fee. It's too many clicks to get to the screen when somebody actually pushes the button. Avoid this product and wait for competitors to come up with something better.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jun 2019,Alex,"Have had this for a year and a half. It works for live view for when I want to view the camera remotely, but it NEVER works when someone rings the bell. It goes into a loop of loading video and the person is gone before it ever loads. Then it glitches and doesn't save the video so I can't go back and see who it was. Bottom line: Ring is a crummy company selling shoddy products. I can whip up a more reliable product using a Webcam, a button, and a raspberry pi for half the cost (i have done so indoors for security purposes). If you care about privacy, you'll stay away from Ring. They don't even bother with encryption on their devices and all of your comings and goings are stored on their cloud servers and there's no ability to simply save to a network storage device instead of the cloud.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Aug 2019,El Gordo Tejano,"I received the camera, and proceeded to install it. The instructions are great for install, but take your time and read through them as you will need to refer back to them a few times to make sure you got everything correctly. The setup of the camera was actually super easy. It took longer to create an account than to setup the camera. There is a delay between the time someone rings the door bell and it notifying you on your phone. So it is slow on that perspective by about 2 to 4 seconds. Processing of videos is also slow. That can take 5 to 20 seconds. It has to do with it uploading the video to the cloud. Would be great if it had a memory card slot and it would record to that then upload the video for quicker access times of videos. I do recommend it as it is great, and the subscription is cheap and worth it. The video quality is unmatched!",Great Camera
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jun 2019,Banjo Benny,"There are at least two fundamental problems with the motion detection: 1. If I set up the camera in the yard and walk directly toward it, it will not detect me. Whereas if I set it up to the side of my path and walk past it, it has no problem. 2. when it does detect motion, it tends to capture the end of the motion event and not the start of it. Good cameras will give you a couple of seconds prior to the motion and the entire motion event. To try to quantify #2, I slowly backed my car out of the driveway and parked on the street and waited for the motion event. One of my two rings is mounted on a front gate with a direct view of the driveway. The start of the motion video shows my bright red car in the MIDDLE of my driveway, and then it takes me about 5 seconds to back out the rest of it, trying to maintain constant speed. So it is dropping about the first 5 seconds of me backing out of the garage - in a red car against a green hedge in the background. You wouldn't think such a thing would be so challenging to detect... So...I talked to a Ring guy and he basically said I bought the wrong Ring, I needed to buy one with ""advanced motion detection"" which is generally speaking the ones that are meant to be wired. Now, as we were speaking, he noticed that mine is wired (to the doorbell power), so wouldn't it have been nice if he could have just reconfigured my Ring to do more buffering and use more power. No such luck.  Maybe the version I bought doesn't have enough RAM to buffer the extra 5 seconds of video. Or maybe their business model is simply to sell you absolute crap and then when you are disappointed, try to upsell you into something more expensive, and your existing Ring will make a nice looking paperweight. In fairness, the Ring is primarily designed to monitor your front door, so you can see someone walk up to it (maybe), ring the doorbell, and wait around for an answer. If the person does not walk directly to your door, the Ring can probably accomplish that feat. I have an amazon cloud cam also, which mostly monitors the back door and the coming and going of my dogs via a dog door, and that works about as you would expect: for example, I just watched one motion event video where one of my dogs is staring out the window, and then another dog comes barging through the doggy door and runs up to the first dog. I seem to have a couple of seconds of no motion, then the motion happens, then the clip ends when the motion ends. That is the way I think most cameras should work, especially ones as expensive as a Ring. So to make up for the ""missing motion"" that the Ring doesn't give me, I will probably mount another camera that captures the same area, albeit from a different angle. To sum, I think if you want a Ring that strictly monitors your front door, it will probably work fine for you. If you want to use it more as a cloud camera, because you like the app and the power interface is simple, then just be aware the motion detection will drop the first part of the motion, unless you get the unit that explicitly says ""advanced motion detection.""",the motion detection is horrible

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2019,sdnelson11,"Ring’s products, including this one, really hit their mark. They work out of the box, easy to install, everything’s right there in the kit. The only drawback is if you run this on it’s rechargeable battery, it’s prone to discharging within a couple of months, but that’s to be expected (I’d hardwire it, if I could do so conveniently but don’t have wiring to doorbell at my door). The features are great and Ring’s app does everything you’d want it too. Another downside of Ring vs. Arlo is having to pay Ring’s monthly subscription package if you want the stored videos, but overall the Ring stuff works far better than Arlo (I have some of both product lineups and use them both regularly and prefer Ring). The ability to set different door chimes, volumes, motion alerts, etc - the flexibility of features is awesome. Motion detection by camera monitoring in the Ring products is tough to get right. It simply casts too wide of a net even if you tune down the motion zone or focus it on a small area, you constantly get alerts. I have not figured out how to refine that (or perhaps it’s just a product limitation - in any case the motion detection works REALLY well, actually almost too well — too sensitive).

It's really weak. If I run the ""improve your wifi"" it says it's fine, but when I open the camera it says poor signal and shows red signal while trying to load. Sometimes it won't load at all. I moved my internet box right near the ring and I'm still having the same issue. Right now it just says loading live view and won't even load. I tried everything to fix it and nothing worked.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Apr 2018,Laurie Pitman,"This was my only choice in the smart doorbell space, which I researched thoroughly -- there's no power at the gate where I installed this, so I needed the battery option. Don't be fooled by the marketing schma -- the battery charge lasts at the most 2 months. Just buy that 2nd battery when you buy the doorbell, because you'll need it. The video quality is sometimes sketchy, and sometimes video doesn't work at all, but it's on the edge of WiFi range, and the access point is behind a wood gate and a glass garage door, plus it's mounted on a steel post. The doorbell always rings on my phone, even if the video is wobbly, and the audio works pretty well, a lot better than the August doorbell I have at my front door (less than 6 feet from an access point), which never works and rings my phone sometimes 60 seconds after the bell at the door). I wish there was a way to tell it to ignore my neighbor's driveway, which runs right by my gate, because I get hits from their cars constantly. The smallest wedge-of-interest you can set also by default includes things 6'-12' past the area just in front of the doorbell, and that pulls in all the car traffic from my neighbors. But I have learned to ignore that. I'm hoping for better integration with Google Home. Amazon's announcement that they had bought Ring came 2 days after I installed. I confess I might have had second thoughts about the purchase if I had known that was coming. Unfortunately Google's Nest doorbell has to be hard-wired, which wasn't an option for this location. In general, I'd rate the Ring as ""pretty good"" and definitely an improvement over the August doorbell cam.",Buy the 2nd battery when you purchase

Every thing is labels so you know what to do with it.  The most difficult thing for me was drilling into brick.  I could only drill about half of the length of the insert.  It took about 30 minutes to drill 1/2 inch into the brick, for one hole.  I trimmed the insert to fit the hole length of each hole and that worked like a champ.  A word of warning, the brick attenuates a lot of the WiFi signal.  The Ring App has WiFi Speed tests, you might want to run that twice close to your router and also where the Ring 2 will be located to make sure there is enough signal strength.  You can get a Ring Chime Pro that is a door bell chime and also WiFi range extender if the signal strength is really bad.  The device is easy to set up.  The picture is in color and is very clean.

However, there have been several instances where people have come to my door, such as to place a flyer, and the doorbell missed this entirely.

If you have a Nest device then setting up the Ring will be a breeze. The instructions, though not many steps, are well detailed. I replaced an existing doorbell with electric chimes so I was able to connect the Ring to the existing wires. The Ring includes wire extensions which were very welcome to allow room to connect the doorbell once the adapter was in place. Software set up of the device was easy. Download the software, create and account and then follow the steps to set up the device you are setting up, in this case a Ring Doorbell. The video is of good quality. I have a flag off my porch and the advanced setting allow you to change which sectors the camera monitors as well as how far out. The setup wizard worked fine but with the flag always waving the advance setting really helped minimize the notifications. If I could change one thing it would be receiving the notice that someone is approaching the door sooner. Some times when I get the notice the person is already at the door and not just walking up to it. This is a small issue as the Ring records the video which appears to start earlier than when you are notified. Network lag the cause, perhaps.

Ring support offered me a few different options, one of which was to upgrade to the Pro device, which has much better motion detection parameters. The Ring Pro was on sale at the time of our discussion and Ring was willing to match the sale price on a new unit, so my Ring 2 was swapped out for a Ring Pro at no cost. I have not had a chance to set up the Ring Pro yet, but I appreciate Ring's dedication to customer service and support.","Great, if you're not near a road. UPDATE 06/13/2019: Excellent Ring Support"

The additional costs of $3.00 per month per Ring device for Basic Monitoring or $10.00 for the house is inexpensive but I think it should be included in Prime Membership for free, especially considering the membership continues to increase as Amazon maintains record profits. Update 2/24/19: I was not able to get my in home digital chime to work, with the diode installed both ways, and last night my home doorbell started going off on it's own constantly, I had to turn off the circuit breaker and dealt with it this morning, still no luck on getting the interior door chime to not ring with the Ring 2 installed.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2019,DBurk,"Several problems with the Ring doorbell. 1.  Response of the camera is extremely slow.  When someone is immediately at your door, the app on your phone will take forever to open and by then, the visitor at your door is gone. 2.  There are no free plans to view your videos. The lack of a response time nullifies its use, then you can't go back and see who was there.  Camera is almost useless.... Funny how Amazon isn't even reaching out to give the canned response ""this is not what you should expect""....I'll be trying to recoup my investment soon or throw it in the garbage.","Response so slow, visitor has left before you can answer with the app...."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2018,motees,"Well, after trying and failing to install my Skybell, which I bought and used successfully in Holland, I thought I’d give Ring 2 a try. Glad I did. Fairly easy to install, replacing my existing 18V doorbell button. Installed the resistor to get my digital doorbell to ring properly; OK. Both my regular doorbell and the Ring 2 doorbell ring fine when the button is pushed. Installed the angle wedge with the thickest part at the bottom so my low wall positioned Ring 2 tilts up a bit; nice. Tip: watch the Installation Videos, located in the app wheel menu, before installing for clarifications. With the set screw on the bottom, it would not be easy to pull device off wall; but it would be easy to smash the device off the wall with a hammer. I subscribed to the $30/year subscription so my videos (rings, motion and Live Views) would all be saved at the Ring cloud service (good for security) and my Ring 2 would be replaced if it is stolen; a very reasonable fee. I really like the Live View feature, allowing me to see my front door area from anywhere in the world that I have internet access. Being able to listen and talk is a really great feature—-in fact, one big reason I bought it. Sound quality is adequate. I had hoped I could turn off the Live View and just easily activate it whenever I needed it, especially remotely by cell access, but this is not possible: when you try to turn Live View on, a message appears saying that “Live View will be enabled after your next motion event.” So I just always leave it on now, Motion detection with iPhone message alerts is great, with nearby wifi, or remote cell. The image quality is very good in the daylight; fair at night. I thought it would be better though. The image is a bit dark at night even with 3 porch lights on. There should be a way to adjust the brightness. I had a concern in the first few days with the battery level dropping about 1% per day, and never increasing—-even though it is hard-wired. Maybe I should have followed the recommendation to fully charge the battery first. So I did that, and the battery level still kept droppng for about 4 days and then it finally started to increase (for the first time) and has stayed at 99-100% ever since. Seems OK now. I bought and installed 2 wireless Chimes (tech support corrected advised me that I did not need the extender feature of the Chime Pro); one for downstairs and one for the basement. Fairly easy to link both to the Ring 2. The Chimes can also be programed with different alert sounds, both ring and motion. So, I have 6 different ring sounds for Ring 2 and the 2 Chimes (ring and motion for each). Volume can also be adjusted for all 3 separately; very handy. And there are snooze options for doorbell and chimes, though unlikely I will use those much. Not surprising, I am quite glad I bought this Doorbell 2. I can now answer my doorbell remotely if I want to, communicate, and monitor my front porch live and with alerts. Suits me. Overall, better than I thought it would be, and no significant problems. So, 5 stars.","So far, so good"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Mar 2020,Chuck,"With my original doorbell wiring having failed and it not being practical to replace, without extreme measures, I decided to go with a battery powered doorbell. At first I looked at simple doorbells only but decided to step up to Ring Doorbell 2, with it being battery powered. It was easy to get it set up and install and I even bought a second battery, to make sure I always had power. I liked it at first. The daytime shots were great and even the night time shots were pretty good. I integrated it with my Amazon Echos, so whenever someone pressed the button, all my Echos would notify me of someone being at the door and I could view it with my Echo Show 8. I really thought this was great. Where it began to drop the ball was on notifications. It would notify me quickly of movement, which was good. However, the first problem was the lack of being able to really customize the notification zone, other than a sphere pattern from the front of the camera. It would pick up cars driving by but when I reduced it, to avoid the road, the sphere coverage would also reduce the effect in areas I wanted coverage. so while I now wouldn't get notified of cars driving by, I also wasn't getting notified of cars coming up my own driveway. it was one or the other. The other issue was that when it did notify me of movement, because of the wake up time, that it uses to save battery, when I would look at the video clip, I would maybe catch the last few seconds of whatever triggered it. If something moved quickly enough through the zone, the camera wouldn't even pick it up. The next issue was battery life, it says the battery with last MONTHS, but if you actually use any of the setting that can help with the detection, it would chew through battery. I think I would end up getting a few weeks at most per charge. Just about every setting I picked, it would warn me about battery life. Not so good. So, after considerations, I decided to go with the Ring Pro instead and use the Ring Plug in adapter and ran that under my front shingles and into the garage and plugged it in there. Being powered all the time, the Ring Pro is much better are motion detection. It has customizable detection zones, so I can set the zone to avoid the road out front while still paying attention to my own driveway. It also records internally on a loop, so when an even does happen, the recording it save, starts several seconds before the event happened, so you get a complete recording of the event, not just the tail end. Pros Easy to set up Very good daytime picture Good nighttime picture Can run on batteries only Cons Detection zones are an expanding/contracting sphere only, so you are limited in what can be covered/ignored Because of wake up, it is slow to record motion, so recordings only catch tail end of event or miss them completely Battery life was nowhere near what they say it is. They say close to 6 months, but that it ridiculously inaccurate. It's more like a month, if you use any of the available options All in all, if you have no other option at all, other than battery, this will do OK. But if you have the ability to hard wire via house wiring or a plug in adapter, go with the Ring Pro instead, it is much more advanced and will do a better job. If you are not locked into the Amazon ecosystem like I am(Echos around the house), i would also check out the Nest Hello from Google. It has continuous recording and face detection, things the Ring Pro doesn't have but would benefit greatly from.","The ""wakeup"" time makes this not so great..."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2019,Jay,"Update: updating the review after the trial 30 days period is over. Note that Amazon return policy is 30 days. Ring also made their free trial 30 days. This way customers will not experience how the product work before the Amazon return policy expire. What happened now that the 30 days free trial is over is that the app is requiring me to subscribe. The subscription is $3 per device per month. This subscription is only to keep the videos on the cloud storage. Saying it again, to have cloud storage, you need subscription. Google provides 15 GB of free storage. Aren't  Ring (and Amazon) supposed to provide at least 1GB of free storage with a device that they sell? I find this as a minimum requirement for people to be satisfied from this product. For me, I have the choice either: 1- Pay Ring $3 per device a month indefinitely. 2- Use it as a regular bell or maybe throw it away. What I have done is that I installed an outdoor Samsung camera. The camera has SD card. It also supports sending prompt alerts (with images) to my own Google Account. So, technically, I am getting a much higher quality camera with local storage and free Cloud Storage for 15G. And the camera is about $80 less than the Ring bell. I would not recommend the bell unless it is only for the fancy look. During the first 30 days trial: In its best, I would say it is Beta product. I bought two of this bell for two properties. I connected them to the existing wires. What I don’t understand is that why does the battery drain even though the camera is wired. Overall, waiting for their app to get better. I was considering the full security system and cameras for my property. But now that I tested this, I would have to search for another provider for home security and cams.",Updated review after 30 days
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2018,FUSIONCHA0S,"Back in 2016, I was getting into the Video Doorbells for extra security for packages.  After much review of Ring, Skybell, Nest, and August doorbells, I decided to purchase the Skybell.  I instantly enjoyed being able to get notifications when there was motion and when the button would be pressed.  The advantage with Skybell was that it came with free subscription.  Well... after 2 years of using the Skybell, i ran into many issues where the motion would not notify me or even pickup, wireless trying to connect to my network at home, and many other headaches which you would think be fixed after many patches.  I have my own server room and network system which I ran network throughout my house and even have a business hotspot near the Skybell, still had many issues with the Skybell doorbell. Moving forward...... I reviewed my options again as I was fed up with Skybell and still only had the same options today as they were 2 years ago.  After much consideration i decided to choose the Ring Doorbell 2.  They do offer a free subscription now, which is great, but you cannot review any motion or button press history events.  Of course this is just due to needing to purchase the basic plan for the cloud storage.  Even for $30 annually, the basic plan is still cost effective.  After using the doorbell in the trial version of the plus plan, I am planning on paying the $30 just because its cheap cost and I would rather have the events to review rather than just seeing the live view. Setup was easy (easier than Skybell).  The app loads quick and can edit motion detection's, alerts, and much more.  I connected the doorbell via hardwired to an analog doorbell.  The box comes with many customization options, tools, and took only 10 minutes to install. Testing the Ring doorbell worked perfectly and better than Skybell.  I installed my Ring doorbell with the provided wedges that came in the box.  I have a 20 foot driveway and the detection works so great that cars driving by alert me.  You can decrease the range of the motion in the app.  When there is motion, I can open the app from my lock-screen and only takes about 2 to 3 seconds before i can see the event.  The load times are very quick and faster than Skybell. Overall, I am day 15 in my trial and I am glad I decided on Ring.  The product is great, and far better than competitors.  Cost is ideal for those that do not want to pay hundreds each year on cloud storage like nest.  I would highly recommend Ring to others.",Best Video Doorbell

Battery life - 6 weeks after install the battery was dead.  6 WEEKS!!!  An additional battery sold WITH this package would have helped. I'm charging the battery today so.... yeah. Gotta keep the front door open because I don't have a door bell today and I'm expected a few people to come by. 2.  Too sensitive. - My phone was chirping, beeping and chiming ALL freaking day notifying me of every mosquito within two miles of my door (gross exaggeration of course but that is what it felt like). So much so, that when someone was REALLY at my door, I didn't even look at the notification, assuming it was just another car driving by. 3. Recharging the battery takes a million zillon hours (seriously - 24). That's just too freaking long. 4.  Does not connect well with my WIFI.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jul 2019,Will S.,"It was a fairly straight forward set up/install and no need to contact Tech Support, and they proudly proclaim how they are available for assistance which is a good thing.  It does all it is advertised to do, but remember that there will be a subscription fee of either $3 or $10 per month.  ($3 is for the basic, $10 for more features and if you want to add more Ring brand items.)  I opted for the $3 basic plan and I am fine with it so far, be sure to read what is covered in the two plans.  Depending on your Internet & wi-fi speed there will be a slight delay from the device to your smartphone, and you should definitely download the App to your phone.  For the most part the delay is minimal, not quite ""real time"" but pretty close.  The motion detect works very well and starts the video recording, I like the speaker/microphone built in so I can hear as well as speak to whomever is at the door.  (All recorded of course.)  After looking at several reviews of brands, including a very positive review for this one on CNET I opted for the Ring 2 and have not been disappointed.","Works very well, I would recommend this item"

All hardware was there, special brackets to fix the angle and position for our weird inlet porch, everything! The mounting options are incredible. Beyond that, it *just* works. We charged it, plugged it in, and it went.  We get fast notifications when there is motion, we see our packages get delivered. The remote doorbell from anywhere is an awesome thing, and the ring community alerts through the app are one of the best uses of social networking I’ve come across yet.

I am still underwhelmed with the responsiveness of the system and the fact that some of the fixes require you to drill holes and put shims in place. Disappointed that their app doesn't show the area where the motion detectors are looking. Also disappointed in how expensive it is to store/view  video files.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Sep 2019,Charles B.,"If you are like me, you probably often skip the one star reviews on the assumption that a lot of them, knowingly or not, were written about defective products. My unit worked fine for over a year (with occasional connection problems, but nothing to get worked up about). Sometime around the time the Neighbors app came out, though, things started to change. Let's back up a moment. Amazon has owned Ring for a while now. For a while, they mainly didn't get involved. Eventually though they jumped in, with the biggest marker being the release of the Neighbors app, an app that allows you to see and share neighborhood alerts. It's free, and doesn't require a ring doorbell or account, and worth taking a look at. But what came with was much worse. Consistent delays (often more than a minute) consistent trouble connecting to the live feed, and even occasional delays on the doorbell phone notification. You would think Amazon could handle it, but... it seems like it can't. If you read some other reviews, my experience isn't singular or even particularly rare. This doorbell has a lot of features, and when they work it's a great product, though at a fairly high price. When core features don't respond until more than a minute too late if at all, though, this product fails to be useful for its core function, or anything really.","Good when it works, but all too often useless"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2020,Physics Teacher,"UPDATE: 1) The Ring 2 listing claims HDR capability. This is not true. After struggling for 2 months attempting to get the HDR option to function Ring 2 support finally told us the the RING 2 does NOT support HDR. 2) Unit returned: After being elevated to a supervisor (Michael) we informed him that the RING 2 listing on Amazon is misleading. The listing claims that the RING 2 supports HDR when in fact it does not. After some back-and-forth Micheal, he sent us an RMA# and a prepaid UPS label. Once we get the refund we shall update to that fact. We were so excited the day the RING 2 Doorbell arrived. Our neighbor has a RING doorbell and that had a substantial influence upon our decision.  If we had to do this from scratch we would get the eufy Doorbell. No hidden iCloud fees. [Once our 1 year subscription expires we will cancel and order the eufy Doorbell] Installation was a snap. Since we were replacing an existing doorbell the power supply was there. There have been many questions as to sufficient voltage to power the RING 2: Do not worry about that. The power sourced from the preexisting doorbell wiring only charges the batteries. Any trickle voltage will suffice. 1) The wire extensions supplied in the kit are very helpful when replacing an existing doorbell . 2) The wedge system is definitely helpful especially when the front door is four steps above walkway. 3) The easily adjusted Zone System is (should be) especially useful if your front door faces the street. However, we have been tweaking the RING 2 for over 2.5 months. We have yet to find the sweet spot. The Zone System seems to have negligible effect upon false alerts. Yes, it is an easy Zone System to adjust but unfortunately we have found virtually no difference in those adjustments. SLOW response time: By the time we get an alert the person(s) are already headed down the steps. We have a lightening fast WiFi system coupled to an extremely fast modem. The signal to the RING is Excellent. However, the response time is far too slow. Customer support is excellent. UPDATE: New software update just downloaded which only makes matters far worse. New update offers “People Only” recognition. An USPS postman was just here. The Ring 2 using the People Only recognition option did not “see” him even though he was standing directly in front of the camera. We immediately disabled the People Only option.",Disappointing!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2020,Lizz + Michael,"Listen to Beyonce. Buy this doorbell. We hemmed and hawed about buying a video doorbell. Do we really NEED one? We weren't sure. But now that we have it...we can't imagine not having it now. We chose to get this one instead of the wired one, because we didn't have a wired doorbell already at our house. It is a little sensitive, and picks up a lot of motion. However, that setting can be altered, but we like keeping an eye on things. We like it! It wasn't difficult to set up. Plus, we got the whole Ring security system, and we pay for the service, so it works well with the whole integrated system. The BATTERY LIFE could be better. And we could change settings to make it better, but it's not that bad. Here are some PRO-TIPS (after 1.5 years of using this) 1) Customize it as much as possible. Don't be afraid to mess with settings and notifications, and use some tape or command strips to test out the angle before you put it in the wall. 2) When the battery is low, it needs to charge overnight. So if you don't want interrupted use, then invest in a 2nd battery. 3) It does NOT come with a chime. Which doesn't usually bug us because it's just my wife & I, and it's connected to our phones, and makes them ring. But if your phones aren't accessible, or are shut off or in airplane mode, you won't hear anyone ringing the bell.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Mar 2020,516-Andrew,"Was just about to review this, and the app locked up my phone? Reboot. Works fine. Without a subscription, it's basically a web-cam plus a smart door-bell trigger.  (It's a door-bell button that announces on every Alexa device in the house, when it is pressed.) Are you ready to pay $30 a year? If not, it's just a camera. Unless you subscribe, this does not record anything for you. Without recordings, if you do get a movement notification, by the time you turn on the app and request to view the camera, too much time has passed. (Hopefully, your 'visitor' is waiting at the door. Thieves do not.) I haven't heard a movement alert recently, but I have received some previously... Let's see if some system adjustments today will fix that. I'll assume 'device status' at 100% means it's not due to battery issues, but I'll check that anyway, also. Bell rings? After you hear the bell you can say ""Show me (or hide) the front door"" and see the cam on an Alexa Show (or turn it off) if you are sitting next to one, or you can open the ring app and open the camera to view it. (You could view any ~other~ camera the same way, as well.) You can talk to/hear visitors through the device, as well. Have not tried it with people. Just listening, I have only heard the wind. Ring saves a snap-shot only of what you view when you open up the camera from the app. I assume at the moment the camera was opened? Or I thought it did. I see none from today, while checking things and writing this. The one from the other day is no longer visible, either. So, without subscribing, it does not record ANYTHING, and you then obviously cannot review, save or share that which is not recorded. It has not helped me see when the mailman came, even during the first free month. I can take and text someone a video from my phone. This system should do the same. At least record (or give an option to record) video directly onto my phone/device directly, when I have the app running and i view a camera. There is too much greed attached to this system... Unless you understand it's also $30/year while you own it, or you know and accept the limitations it has, this may not be for you.","You basically have to subscribe... I have not, yet."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Apr 2020,Stephen Russell,"The first problem you are going to run into is battery charging takes 5 hours.  No mention of using your fast charger.  The initial software setup was fairly easy and quick.  The next problem you will have is the most difficult; mounting.  Until you actually put it on the wall you have no idea what the camera covers.  It's all trial and error.  The biggest caution I can give you is DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN ANY OF THE SCREWS!  All the plastic pieces are very soft, if you use a bracket, the tiny screws will strip and loosen if you give them an extra half-turn.  The screw heads for the angle brackets bearly cover the opening and there are only two very thin screws that secure the entire bracket(s) to the wall.  I couldn't believe how flimsy the mounting is of such an expensive device. After mounting two angle brackets I still could not see the entire face of someone standing at the door.  Ring claims that's not really a problem.  REALLY! The next complex software issue is linking to Alexa.  I went to the Ring app on my phone and the first thing it asked for is a password.  Now you would think it was the Alexa password because it does not tell you what the hell password it wants.  Turns out, even though you are already in the Ring app, it wants you to re-enter your RING password, then your Alexa password. After I got past that issue, it said it was linked to Alexa.  NO!  I went to my Echo and asked who was at the front door.  Alexa says I don't know what the front door is, and it's not in the device list.  Turns out there is a not so clear task to add RING as a SKILL on Alexa. Took about three hours to install and link after the 5-hour battery charge.  After all that it works pretty well, but remember it's also $30/year for online access.",Not as easy as they advertise.

Get the Ring Doorbell Pro.  It is much more useful.  This model has PIR motion detection.  The Pro model has video motion detection which has two important features this one does not: 1.  The motion detection is more customizable.  With the Pro model you draw on the screen the area you want to cover. 2.  Most importantly, with the Pro model the recorded clips start about five seconds before the motion is detected.  The camera has a buffer that is constantly keeping a few seconds in memory.  Then when it detects motion, it adds the previously recorded few seconds of video to the clip.  If you have never had a video camera this may not seem like a big thing.  It is.  This is absolutely important.  Makes your clips much more useful. The Pro model also has dual band WiFi which may or may not be useful to you.",This one works but get the Pro model instead.

Ive heard great things but it just doesn't work well for us. Installation was easy enough. But it frequently misses movements I've messed with the settings several times. I can get all the way into my house with no notification. I've had packages delivered and no notification. The tip on the iceberg was when the doorbell failed to connect to WiFi for 24hrs. With no notification. I would've liked to know there was an issue with the connection. I no longer feel like it's providing a layer of protection since it doesn't say anything when there is an issue. I also will add I don't have an issue with WiFi anywhere else in my home and have tested the wifi using the ring app and it had good numbers.

Try to contact tech support......It s a joke. I usually have great experiences with Amazon products. The software needs to be improved. Most of the time I want to see a live view of my front door, I get a black screen.  Also, I wanted to be able to shut off the Alexa notifications when I am home. I was able to shut off the notifications on that show up on my cell phone but not Alexa. So I contacted Tech support and after 15 minutes in a chat, the guy told me to read the instructions on my Alexa app and i should be able to figure it out on my own. He did not know how the Alexa portion worked. (But I am supposed to) Very poor tech support. I would think I would be able to go to the ring app and with a simple swipe, suspend the alarms until I choose to turn the back on. (Like I want to take a nap or sleep in) I can suspend the motion portion for up to two hours, but not the ring portion, but again, I think that is only for the cell phone and not for Alexa. There should be a simple command to Alexa to suspend alerts until I tell it to start them again. Maybe you can do this, but tech support was unaware of it, so I just don't know.  I wish I had purchased a different brand and it is now too late to return it. Maybe they can update the software to fix the black screen and to be able to turn off the Alexa notifications with one swipe or command.",Lots of issues and tech support is hard to reach.

I had previously installed my regular doorbell and had the required power, so I was happy I would not need use battery. I did the measuring of current and no matter what I set it to, it would not work. The unit works with battery, but I do not want battery. I cannot send it back because I have had it too long. I waited to install because I doing some work in that area, and did not want to risk damaging it. I Decided to set it using the battery option. However, the quality of the material is so poor. I was using the angle bracket. I was amazed that the screws that came with it barely hold it on there, in one area of the plastic the screw can fall right threw. I thought there must be washers or something to keep it secure, nothing. I did get it attached. However, I can't get the unit attached. The srews keep popping out. I cannot get one to go in. The quility of material used is very poor. I wanted to contact Ring, but the one manual I have had no phone number. I am not a fan of their products or service. Ring is not a company I plan on doing business with. I do not understand why they make it so hard to contact them for service. I have been setting up other video devices around my house.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Apr 2020,Kaktovik,"Why do they make these so wide?  The only option that is narrow as my door jam is the 2nd gen pro for $199 as opposed to this for $139 at the time of my purchase.  All the newest gen 3 doorbells are even wider and so are a non starter. Biggest problem:  Almost always when I go to check or it detects something it can not connect to my WiFi until much later.  Boy, I hope I never have an emergency which is the only reason I bought it.  My router is about 7 years old or so, but it was the top of the line at the time with its accompanying expander and is capable of hundreds of Mb/s WiFi.  I take my cell phone to the doorbell, outside my house and can watch a full stream movie.  When I run the test requested by Ring I measure 10+ Mb/s up and down when they only need 1.5.  There own test says I have a strong signal.  As I read how to resolve this about the only thing left is to replace my routers with a new set that is designed to better handle many simultaneous connections.  I am assuming and hoping this is the problem and so I just today ordered the newest top of the line Netgear Mesh WiFi router (MK2).  When it becomes available I will add another expander as well.  This is designed to handle modern homes with up to 25 simultaneous smart phones, tablets, smart TVs, etc. I will provide an update if this did or did not resolve this problem. Other than that I have a 1/2 acre lot and am well off of the street but it will pick up every big truck going by.  Luckily I am in a somewhat rural neighborhood with little traffic on my street with no through traffic so I can deal with that.

I enabled the ring software and linked it as a skill to my alexa network. I was able ot enable the doorbell ring and motion detection on the page for the doorbell. It did not work. I talked to the ring people, and the first guy first said echo/ring communication was 'problematic', said the echo was not on their list of devices that work with the ring2. I then talked to a second tier ring rep who was clearly not at all familiar with the issue, but said she had seen the doorbell chime work on the dot, but that you cannot yet use the dot as an intercom station for the doorbell (that it is 'planned for the future, but not yet working). Now couple that with the fact that unless you pay ring a monthly fee to see the video from the bell, its a pretty useless product - with Amazon owning ring and pushing this product (and bundling the two) you'd think they could easily give you a free account to save the last month of video on one of their servers. So in short, Amazon seems to have oversold the ring2/ Alexa connection, without getting the Ring (owned by amazon) staff familiar with what it can and can not do. So, DO NOT BUY THE RING 2 unless you only want to get doorbell announcements on your cell phone.

BUT I've learned some things which will HELP YOU 1) Those commercials where the homeowner yells at someone before they even get to the front door are BS.  This thing isn't fast enough for that.  For instance, by the time you get an alarm, and a picture, you'll just see the mailman go around the corner. - Don't expect that early warning kind of functionality. 2) The pictures from the camera on your phone are poor.  No matter what Wifi access point I install, no matter how close it's not really useful on the phone . BUT - long in to your RING account online you can use filters and see much better pictures. 3) You're probably going to have to add a wifi extender.  I don't like these much because they rob bandwidth to talk to each other but, you won't get good pictures without it. 4). There IS a way to get good customer service.  My call was going south fast talking to someone who's first language wasn't English and, apparently, only had basic checklists.  Each time I said something she'd try a different checklist.

DIdn't realize you need a subscription after you buy the unit. That was annoying 2. That commercial where you can talk to someone who is at your door? Nah. Half the time the thing tells me there's someone at my door AFTER they've walked away. There's no way you could yell ""Hey! Put that package down!"" in realtime, EVEN IF you're ACTUALLY at home.  We have good wifi but the lag time can be up to a minute if I'm down the street at the school 3.

If you're overworked and distracted like me, that could take 3 days, maybe more. Not kidding. 4. The instructions to take the front cover off to GET to the battery? BAD design.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,Hydrad,"Apparently you can buy a device for about 20 dollars that will take the Ring system down.  It’s a small transmitter that interrupts your WiFi signal.  All the Ring devices communicate through your WiFi.  Since the Ring company forces us to store all our videos in the cloud, by interrupting the WiFi signal, the video can’t be sent up to the cloud, so it eventually gets recorded as a blank video once WiFi is restored. Porch thieves just carry the transmitter with them as they walk down the block stealing packages.  All ring devices (or any WiFi connected devices) within a 200 foot radius of them are automatically disabled.  The Ring devices will still detect motion, but since WiFi is disabled, they can’t save the video to the cloud. This came to my attention recently when I had a package stolen from my porch.  The ring video doorbell 2 just showed a 30 second blank video with no sound.  A video 10 minutes prior to the blank video show the package being delivered.  Another video about 15 minutes after the blank video show the package gone.  The ring device was not covered, or It would still have the background noise which is quite noticeable in all other videos.  The blank video is totally silent.  I have reported this to customer support and they reviewed the videos from my doorbell and concur with my assessment.  They said they would pass the problem over to their programming section. This now makes the ring devices totally worthless for any kind of security purposes.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2018,MCStro,"This is a great product, but I'm not even sure it will work for my situation. Two situations that are problematic for this: One- if you have an intercom doorbell system.  Two if you have a front door opening right onto a sidewalk. I wish they would mention more upfront information on installation and best placement scenarios.  People who want the wired-to-existing doorbell scenario need to know that anyone with intercom systems will have install issues. Also, people with front doors that open right onto a sidewalk may have tricky (at best) install & operation issues with many"" false positive"" triggering because the smallest perimeter is 5 feet- which takes up almost a whole sidewalk width.  I thought the product package said it would have 3 wedges inside, that can lower the ""eye""  by 5-10- or a total 15 degrees when all 3 are combined.  My package had only one 5 degree (lowering eye) wedge and 1 corner (angle sideways) wedge.  I probably need all 15 degrees (combining all 3 wedges) to avoid false positives on motion that can seriously wear down battery and unnecessarily alert you. Since I ordered it from Amazon site, I guess I now have to go to the actual Ring site to order more wedges.  What a pain, and further delay on install- and it may not even work for my situation.","Great product, but missing pieces & shd have better install info upfront b4 buying"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2018,Justin,"I've wanted a Ring for quite a while, and this last Cyber Monday sale essentially screamed out ""if you don't order it today, you're dumb."" First, let me take you through why it took me so long to get one. It wasn't because of the price, it's because my existing doorbell is a hard 90 degrees to my front door. I didn't know angled wedges were a thing, and I wanted to keep the bell hardwired, so I was afraid of the angle, not being able to see everything I wanted to. Because ideally to keep it hardwired, I'd want someone to re-wire the doorbell to next to my front door so I had a straight-on view. Considering how this wouldn't be a traditional wire relocation like moving a network cable, but rather using brick, I was a bit scared of even asking for a quote to do this. But then I saw that the Ring came with 2 angle brackets, so I took the plunge. As you'll see from my photo, using the corner angle bracket completely eliminated my concerns while keeping it in the existing hardwired location. There are a couple of things I don't like about this, however. First, it's 2.4 GHz WiFi only. That's quite a bit 'in the past' in my opinion. If your doorbell is a significant distance from your WiFi router, you may have connectivity issues. I don't have this issue, but the video quality definitely is sub-par compared to what is advertised. Next, you have 30 days of a free trial to be able to see your previous video alerts before you have to...yes...buy a subscription. I already have a subscription for Nest for a camera on my house, now I have to subscribe to another ecosystem to access old videos? Not cool... That being said, if Ring's security cameras have 5 GHz capability, I'd consider killing my Nest subscription and replacing it with Ring's. Have you ever installed one of Nest's outdoor cams (not the IQ)? It's absolutely absurd with multiple built-in potential points of failure. There's a reason why I only installed 1 of the 2 Nest cams I got as a gift. If Ring beats them in this regard, I'll happily replace it and go 100% with them.","Impressive, but could definitely be improved upon"

I have mesh network and about 50 years from the access point to the bell (a door between). Still, often I cannot connect. So when I get ""motion detected at your front door"", I need to go to the door, to check. Often the app just won't open the camera. Restarting the (windows) app sometimes works. 3) No constant viewing. When connected (and since I don't dare relying on the ""live view"" to succeed), it only shows 10 minutes. Then I'm blind.

Due to constant disconnections, I spent several hours on the phone with Ring support (which used to be good) and we figured out that our frequent power fluctuations were like the cause.  So on their suggestion I purchased the Ring 2 as it is battery powered and since I have it live wired, the battery is always charged.  It worked well for about a year, then on the last firmware update it became totally unreliable.  Back to hours on the phone with Ring support.  This time they were not so good.

Only when I disconnected it from the doorbell wires and took out the battery and reinstalled it as totally new did it work again.  Now 2 weeks later it is back to not catching motion or even someone ringing the bell.  It has full power and a strong WiFi signal but will not connect to live view or even catch motion.

I like the video log of former motion events as the video is very clear in both daytime and night when I review my “motion log”. (There is an outside light at night.) I turned off motion alerts. My neighbor works different hours and the alerts kept waking me up.  But the reason I purchased ithis was to see who was at the door before opening it.  And talking to that person before I open the door. Sadly, the app takes way too long to open for that to happen. Seriously too long. They are gone before the app works. I added the Chime Pro. It has done nothing to boost my signal or speed of access. So it is useless to decide about opening my door. I have decided to keep it for awhile but I’m not a “dedicated happy user”.  If the video log is what you need, this does a great job. But those ads of real time scaring off crooks?  Not gonna happen.",Good clear video record of former images but cannot do real time imaging
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jun 2019,Ryan Brown,"Ring sells itself as being a way for you to answer the door using your phone rather than in person. But it's not actually any good at that.  If I'm at home and on the same wifi, it generally takes about 15 seconds to come up. If I'm out and on mobile data, it can easily be double that. If I'm on someone else's wifi it's completely hit or miss; frequently Ring's servers just don't load. That's likely due to firewall rules, but it still makes the service useless. Which leads to the real issue: you get 0 history if you don't pay the $3 per month per device subscription fee. There's no ""view the last 3 videos"" or ""store videos for a few days without a subscription."" It's all or nothing. What's even more infuriating is that you can't direct the recording to a local storage option. That makes sense from a business perspective (they need their $3) but absolutely no sense from a technical perspective. Similarly, you can't patch in a local home automation system like Home Assistant without paying the $3 a month fee. This might work fine for someone who wants a single device and doesn't mind paying someone else to do the maintenance. But if you want to actually own your own system, I'd avoid it.",Not actually useful as a real time video link.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jun 2020,Ramon Borquez,"This is a great doorbell camera and intercom system. I have had no issues with WiFi connection or using the app. The set up was completely easy and the all directions came in the box and on the app. The motion detection is great IF you manage to put it in the right spot. The only issue I have is that I live in an apartment and have a stairwell going down. I accidentally placed it a smidge too high so the motion detection does not catch movement if someone ducks really low or if someone is short like my wife. Granted, it will still record them standing up or when they get close enough to the camera. The main reason I got this is because there has been a huge increase in package thefts in my area. I have had multiple packages stolen and the same goes for my neighbor across the hall. Since putting this camera up, we have had no issues. The only problem I have is delivery men or women tend to like putting my packages at the very edge of the steps or a few steps down...why you might ask? I don't know. BUT I am still hopeful that my ring may one day manage to capture some footage just in case I do have another package stolen. I recommend getting some really strong duct tape or 3m strips to first test out the view your camera will be getting upon your placement. I do not have a doorbell so I had to drill holes into the wall. Dry wall is a breeze..but stone? Not so easy and management wouldn't like seeing multiple holes in the walls so I am stuck with my placement. Definitely find a way to test everything out yourself before drilling any holes. The screws that came with it are strong but the ring can be torn off. Warranty covers it though and whoever does manage to steal it would be unwise. It has GPS and a serial number so yeah..not really an issue I would worry about. The intercom system is great too. Sound comes through very clear and the view is real time. The night vision and view it gets even with sunlight directly facing it is great. You do have to sign up for a subscription service if you want to have footage saved otherwise you just a motion sensor camera that will notify you of movement. I think it is 30 dollars a year. Very cheap and well worth it in my opinion. To each their own though. The battery life depends on your settings and usage. Mine is set on very sensitive for motion detection and I get a lot of activity but the battery still lasts me 3 weeks or so. I highly suggest you buy an extra battery and store the special screwdriver tip in a place you won't lose it. Overall, this camera has done its job and has helped me feel more relaxed with getting packages dropped off. This does serve more than just protecting mail. You are welcomed to a community watch group in your area of other fellow ring owners where you can post suspicious activity that was caught on camera. At first I did not care, but I check what is going on in my area almost every day. If I had to ask for something to make it better, it would be for more bumpers so you can change the angle of the Ring's view. It came with one that helped changing the angle of my Ring but it isn't enough for my stairwell. If I had just one more or possibly one that had a higher angle it would be perfect.",It's almost perfect!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2017,Vince Neil,"Very good build quality. You can tell the company is very serious about quality based on everything you find in the box and it's presentation. Very good app. Excellent video quality. The length of time between getting the notification of a doorbell press and you being able to converse with the person is a little bit too long - the biggest annoyance of the doorbell. The doorbell tells me that it's wifi connection is weak even though the system works fine. The motion detection is absolutely useless. Even with the detection zone set to minimum and set to ""light"", we get a notification when a car goes by. Oddly, it doesn't always report a person approaching the door. We had to turn off motion detection. The technology to do this is simply not in this doorbell. Overall, a very good doorbell. I would probably buy it again. I bought mine at a warehouse-type store for a much better price and it included a ring chime (doorbell) to plug in wherever you want to hear the ring as well as a free year of saving videos. Now that the year is up, I can't save any videos including the video that was just recorded a minute ago when someone rang my doorbell. So, being at work, I can't see who's at the door when they ring the doorbell unless I answer the ring in realtime with my phone - which I never do because I'm at work. To view any video, you have to subscribe to their service, with ""basic"" running at $3 a month. Without that, it's more of a glorified doorbell. Just keep in mind that you need to be a monthly subscriber to really utilize this doorbell.",Great doorbell with a couple of issues

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2020,MICHAEL W.,"I wasn't sure I wanted a video doorbell, so I decided to limit my investment and buy a Ring Doorbell during the holiday discounts, and I couldn't be happier.  Due to the shape and height of my front porch, I needed to use both 'wedges' to aim the Ring camera down and right, and yet the installation was still very simple.  I also needed to adjust the detection area (using the app) to prevent cars on the road and people on the sidewalk from causing alerts to be sent.  All of this was easily accomplished, and now I have complete peace of mind when I am away from home and/or have something delivered and sitting on the porch.  I did not previously have a powered doorbell at my front door, and so I had some concerns about battery life and how often I was going to need to recharge the Ring battery.  But I am happy to report that after operating continuously for over 6 weeks (with motion detection on and getting one or two alerts per day), the Ring battery level is still at 81%.  One day I might decide to run power to the Ring device, but in the meantime, the battery life is exceeding my expectations by far, and it is not turning out to be any sort of inconvenience whatsoever. PS - I bought a refurbished model for my backdoor to save some money, and it is working equally as well as the new unit on my front door (including picture quality, motion detection, and battery life).  So if you want to save a little money, I also highly recommend the refurbished model.",Easy Installation and Total Peace of Mind
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,IT Admin,Doesn't work in a useful way with Alexa Show 5 package. Doesn't ring on the device. Doesn't display notifications on the device. Can't be setup without a cell phone or tablet. Pages you are directed to for setup display the wrong instructions for the Alexa model I had. This is after the device updates for 20 minutes. My $25 wireless doorbell works every time when you push the button. The ring is intermittent on all devices. It's not because of Wi-Fi as you can open the live view and it pops up right away. Away from the device live view takes a longer time to load but it loads. The motion sensing alerts you quickly on the phone and computer. Not sure you are able to view anything but live view on the Alexa device because I see nothing that indicates you can. So to view the Ring on the Alexa 5 I have to use my psychic abilities or randomly assume someone is at the door and say Alexa show Ring. There is no way to know anyone is there without a cell phone or computer as far as I can tell. The microphone and speaker are not that great. Video severely degrades in the dark. Even with a porch light above the camera. My cheap security cameras would display clear color video under the same lighting conditions. Especially when your 3 feet away. Facial features were not clear when the sun went down. Reminded me of some of the very early cell phone cameras. I will mess around with this a bit more but most likely its going back. Expected a bit more based on the reviews. and quite frankly I was a bit embarrassed giving this to my mom as a gift.,Requires a cell phone or tablet. Does not give Alerts or Rings on Alexa
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2019,Donald Fuller,"Seriously, I love this doorbell.  I work from home in my basement and could never hear the doorbell.  We had an existing chime with one ringer and a wireless battery operated button on the front porch.  No idea why it never got wired, but the estimate to run the wiring is nearly $300 so I looked at battery operated bells.  I have Amazon Echo's throughout the house, and decided to give this a shot.  It takes 4-6 hours to fully charge the battery so I recommend getting an extra battery (WORTH IT!).  It took me a few hours to figure it out, remove the old one, install the new one and configure the Alexa skill so it's a mini-project.  Now when someone so much as steps on our porch, 8 Alexas all around the house say ""Motion detected at the front door"".  And it rings everywhere, so we always hear it.  I have successfully answered the door a few times while away, and I subscribed to the affordable video storage service.  With all that said - I can't quite give it 5 stars because I'm still struggling with network connectivity issues.  The problem is most likely my home network which may not be fair, but sometimes when I try to stream the camera it won't connect.  Despite that, I would absolutely buy this product again.  If you don't have an Echo, you probably would want the smart chime that they offer.",I love this doorbell (who says that?)
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jun 2019,Elizabeth K.,"I had a Pro that I hardwired to my existing doorbell for about 2 years now. We had trouble after trouble with it, but once Ring replaced it (it was a dud) we haven't had any issues. So, we decided to invest in another one on our side door. We didn't have the capacity to install another doorbell transformer. We already have a Ring Chime, so we decided to go with a battery powered Ring doorbell and just link it to the Chime. It's been installed for about two weeks now. The battery is only 1/4 empty and it works so much better compared to my Pro minus the ability to customize motion detection. We're right next to a busy street, so I assume that's why our battery doesn't last as long as others, but I'm satisfied that a full charge will last about a month. I purchased another replacement battery so that I can charge that one before the other dies and swap them out. I'd recommend this over a Pro any day as long as you don't need to customize motion zones.",I actually like this one better compared to my Pro
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 May 2020,Augie,"I'm really disappointed in this doorbell.  It is often random as far as how it picks up motion outside of about 5 feet of the doorbell.  Sometimes it will detect a person outside that range but more often not.  I've adjusted the range in the app several times with no luck.  The only thing increasing the range seems to do is detect more cars even if I set the range well short of the street.  As far as detecting human motion, at best about 5 feet directly in front of the camera, and none detected from the side angles even though the app shows those areas being monitored.  Even though the detection zone and camera in the app clearly shows my driveway it doesn't even detect my car when I enter the driveway.  But it picks up cars directly in front of the camera on the street unless I turn detection down way past what the app shows.  So it seems the detection really only works in a forward field and not so much left and right despite what the camera and app shows. Even worse when I go live view or watch recordings when it is night there is this loud screeching feedback type sound. It is the only thing you can hear.  It doesn't do that during daylight.  So I think there is something wrong with the night vision mode. I give it 2 stars because it was easy to set up and I can at least use it, sort of.  Not what I expected at all though. I only bought this because I use Ring Alarm and wanted something to easily integrate with that.  Maybe I got a bad unit, I don't know.","Very disappointed.

The video is good quality, but doesn't actually load up quickly enough that I can see who is at the door unless they are standing there for awhile.  Also, notifications frequently do not actually work, which isn't helpful.  Even more annoying is that I've discovered that when looking at the history, the most recent videos are not consistently available without quitting the app and opening it again to get a refresh.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2020,Robert J,"It's on me for not researching this more carefully before buying it, but I will say that the advertising, marketing, and on-the-box product descriptions (and the Amazon description*) do not clearly communicate what the consumer must do to make this product functional--and frankly, useful.  I have a very fast, mesh-supported Wifi setup (300 mbps) and the doorbell is less than15 feet from a satellite repeater in this system.  When someone rings the doorbell, it takes approximately 30 seconds for the Ring to signal me on my phone that someone is there--and by the time I get the signal, they are usually gone.  This is important, because I didn't realize that if I don't pay $3/mon indefinitely (until the price goes up someday) to subscribe (there is a 30-day ""free trial""), I will not even have the ability to get information or video on who was there--which essentially means this product becomes a very expensive, $200 doorbell if I don't become a permanent subscriber.  The reality is that this doorbell will work (sort of--the 30-second delay for video notice is inevitable, apparently) for 30 days--and then you have to pay more to keep it working. *The Amazon description says (at the bottom) that a subscription is needed ""to access stored videos.""  I did not understand, as I now realize, that this actually means that a subscription is needed to access ANY of the videos.",definitely not what I expected
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2018,Traci P.,"I was hesitant to order it because I read all of the negative reviews about having to buy a chime for it (to get the wifi to the door) and the video quality being poor. Also, I read about some people experiencing poor battery life. Charging the battery too about 7 hours from a wall plug. I was able to program it and set it up before charging it. There is so much you can do with it. You can set it so you can just watch a live feed whenever you want. I was playing with that feature a lot before turning it off. As much as we messed with it yesterday the battery went down to 93%, but it has stayed at 93% for the last 12 hours so I'm sure it was because we were testing it out, watching the live feed, etc. I did just order a spare battery for it so I will be able to just swap it out immediately instead of waiting for it to charge. I happened to wake up at 5 am because my dog needed to go out and decided to check the live feed. I kept hearing a light knocking through the audio. It creeped me out. My husband said it was probably the storm door tapping against the frame due to the wind. My 20 year old has a curfew and now I know exactly what time he gets home (after I'm asleep). Needless to say, he doesn't like the Ring Doorbell 2. The picture quality serves it purpose so no complaints there. Another cool feature is that a lot of other people have the system so you can see a map and different things that happen within a 5 mile radius of your home. I can see where packages have been stolen from neighbors porches and a lot of other things (only if they choose to share it). I am so glad I bought it, for sure!",I really like it!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jun 2020,D. Houston,"I should have done a better job of researching this device before I purchased it. There was nothing stated in the description or write-up regarding the need to have a faster internet speed and that is important for my application. I live in a rural area where there are few options for internet access providers. We decided that we would go with Centurylink here which was a lower cost and most common in our neighborhood. Little did I know that the very slow speeds of centurylink makes a difference with the Ring device in its' functionality. I tried Wifi extenders and then even bought a separate router to get better coverage which was beneficial to everything else but discovered that, no matter how strong the signal was/is it doesn't make a difference if the internet speeds are not fast. So now if I want this Ring device to work even a little bit, I need to buy faster internet access which will effectively cost me  $300 a year more over what I am currently paying just to have a Ring doorbell plus the cost of the service to get the video to work at another $30 per year. It was stupid of me to buy this even if I was able to do all the wiring and installation myself which would have cost me even more additionally had I not had that capability. Bottom line is that this device does not work on centurylink's slow internet speed in my rural area.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Mar 2020,Alyssa,"This thing picks up every single car that drives by. So we decided to turn down the sensitivity. The day after we turned down the sensitivity there were a group of people going through unlocked cars in our neighborhood driveways. It didn’t record multiple people in our driveway searching through one of our cars. We forgot to lock one of our cars that night. Luckily for us there was nothing worth stealing in there. Our neighbor across the street has cameras that did pick it up so we were able to see that there were at least 4 people walking all around our driveway and in front of our house and neighbor’s houses. So we turned the sensitivity back up. Well it still picks up EVERY car that drives by but doesn’t pick up people walking in front of our house. So if a neighbor has guests and they park in front of our house it will show the car leaving but not someone getting into the car. It has missed several deliveries too. It will show the delivery vehicle leaving but not the driver coming up to the door (Unless they ring the bell). Then tonight it didn’t pick up my family arriving home, parking in the driveway, getting items out of the car, then unlocking the front door until 2 of our 4 family members had already made it into the house. There was also no sound for at least the first 15 seconds of the recording. So, basically it doesn’t actually pick up the things we would actually like it to pick up but it picks up at least 30 cars driving by everyday. I’m really not impressed with it. I’ve talked to other people who have a Ring doorbell who have had similar issues with theirs. I’m thinking about getting a different device that continually records.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2019,S Quentin Quale,"I will likely keep this product as it will still provide a good deterrent while still capturing video on some level even though immediate motion detection is really key in a trustworthy surveillance camera. And usually I wait before I comment on products through Amazon so I can have a well tested purchase. But I have to say no matter what other bells and whistles come with this doorbell camera, it will never offset the complete failure of the camera to delay 3-5 seconds before it actually records the motion in front of the door. Someone could literally run by your home and toss a brick through the window and walk off without getting it on camera. Still I suppose if someone is breaking in, it will take enough time to likely get them on cam facing towards it. And it will still be a deterrence for mischief altogether. The delay will never make me rate it higher than 3 stars. If there are motion cameras that can trigger at less than half a second, I have to believe the technology is there to implement that into this doorbell camera. Perhaps a built in backup snapshot that is more instantaneous that might actually go off before full internet signal is achieved. So I took a part of this post down explaining how the battery was draining even when hardwired and the battery fully charged. Even when i had all the settings to use the least amount of battery.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Sep 2019,Kdogg,"Before I bought it, many people told me how great the Ring doorbell is.  Many more have told me the same thing since I bought it. The problem is that none of these people actually have one. It seems to be one of those products whose greatness people agree on before ever actually living with one. So, did it meet my expectations? No, it's just an improvement on the old doorbell. Very easy install, clever implementation that makes it harder to steal than you'd imagine. The ringer works, you can hear it on your phone whether you're running the app or not. The default alert tone is the first three notes from the great song ‘It Takes Two To Tango.” A few weeks into my life with Ring I googled for advice on how to change the alert tone, so that that song doesn't run through my head for an hour after I get a visitor.  The Ring video tutorial on changing the ring tone presumed that I knew how to reach a certain page, so they skipped over that part. But since I hadn't spent long hours surfing through the app it took far too much time to find the page they pointed me to.  I found a ringtone that does not annoy me and now I like the ringer. (I used to write interfaces. The interface for the Ring app is a work in progress.) I have not yet figured out how to have a video of my new visitor pop up on my phone instantly when I get a notification. So far I DO hear my doorbell if I'm near my phone, but if I want video I have to go to my home screen, access the Ring icon and wait for the video to pop up, and by that time I've reached my door to get a live view of what's what. If a delivery person has rung your Ring, they will often be gone by the time you access the video. Nobody there? That's actually a pretty good indication that you have a package waiting when you open the door. No package? Perhaps a sales person has given up on finding you home. You'll get loads of neighborhood security alerts on your phone via the 'Ring community'. However, I'm not all that gripped by coyote sightings five miles from my house, nor by alerts about suspicious lurkers in neighborhoods I pay good money to not have to live in. I'm sure I'll figure out how to turn neighborhood alerts off after a while, hopefully before the Ring community turns me into a full-blown paranoid. Creepy guy looking at cars on your street?  Leave me out of it. I don't mind learning curves in modern devices. If you do, why on earth would you buy a high tech doorbell? One thing I'd LOVE to turn off are all the sales pitches for the feature that records and saves your videos. ($3 per month! Great if you need it, which I do not.) I have gotten far too many sales emails from Ring, and popup ads on the app, and I've barely owned the device for a month. I have opted to not buy this feature, though it's likely that some people will find this to be the whole reason for buying a Ring.  I just wish to heck that the company would stop trying to push it on me.",Pretty good.

It is also perfect for me since I do not use the front door much because I almost always drive off and I get to my garage from the inner door. The Ring will let me know when someone leaves something by the door unannounced. If I should be traveling, I can ask a neighbor to remove it so the house does not look unoccupied or if I catch them, I can ask them to leave it in the lenai. I am very impressed with the package because the box brings mounting hardware for just about any application. No trip to the hardware store for more supplies with the Ring. Well done! The software download, account and device setup really take 5 to 10 minutes. Hardware installation took me a while because I have a side mounted doorbell ringer and considered placing the Ring front-facing and using it on battery only. But I tested the side mount, which required both of the included adapter mounts to adjust to the angled siding of my house and the corner mount to get a better camera angle. This replaced my existing door bell ringer and it works fine with the existing doorbell for when I am home. I am considering returning the second battery. If the wired installation provides good power and extended battery life or backup use of the battery only, a second battery is not really necessary.",Great product comes with all the installation hardware

But don’t expect to have a real time conversation with someone at your door. Even with a strong WiFi connection, there is a significant lag from notification to actually having a video to see. Maybe that’s typical of these types of systems? Technical support was friendly and helpful. I seriously considered returning. Ended up adding the Chime Pro extender to increase the WiFi strength.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Stuart E. Johnson,"Installing and setting up the camera device was easy and quite convenient. However, when trying to sign up for one of the Ring Service plans, it became evident that something was wrong. Amazon has my street address; they deliver a constant stream of products to my door (with only an occasional error). The Ring App has, however, created a new address for me, across the street. I refuse to sign up for a plan based upon the wrong address. I contacted Amazon CS who responded as well and as nicely as they could, but they have no ability to provide much help. So, onto Ring CS. What a mistake that was. Their responses (likely produced by AI, with very little effort expended on the I) was downright insulting. They set me up with a text link to Carla, and it is anybodies guess as to who or what she is, but that conversation rapidly went further downhill and I terminated the comm link without resolving anything. I am amazed and rather (actually very) disappointed in the lack of involvement in the support coming from Amazon. Not sure if I will rip the camera off the wall and send it back to Amazon or if I should keep it as a memento (rather like a stuffed animal). Anyway, I suggest you spend a few pennies on improving the Ring CS and provide your hard working Amazon CS operatives with a way of gracefully handing off a Ring problem to an appropriate source.",Too little I in the AI support.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jan 2020,David,"I bought this after seeing a friend's video on their phone. I must admit, the video quality on this is incredible. Better video quality than I expected for sure. Night time video is amazing. The clarity even without light is far more than I expected. No issue at all in seeing faces, no blurry vision whatsoever. However, the sensitivity settings, at least on this one, make the alert's on my phone go off every time a vehicle goes by my house. I live on the main street in our town and have traffic going by constantly. The settings on mine are set for the street to be 30 feet away from the house, actually the street is more than that, but I only have three choices and that is the furthest it will go. The motion settings, according to the device, should only be detecting motion to about 15 feet from the Ring 2. I have the wedge to where the device points more upward. If I were to turn the wedge over the device would not capture faces in the video. Contacted Ring about this and really did not get a good answer as to why it was so sensitive or how to change it. With that being said, I give it a 3.5 because the alerts are good, but now it's a little ""The Ring that cried wolf"" syndrome. Is there really someone there and do I need to check the video. I know that this is probably a small annoyance that I am leaving a not so great review for, however I don't need to know every time a vehicle drives past my house. If I could get that setting changed, it would be 4.5 star review!","Ring 2 great video quality, but"

I bought the Ring because of it's remote notification features and thought the video function would be an added bonus. So far, that part hasn't worked out great. It does a good job of catching the back of the UPS guy's head as he walks away, and while the motion notification may be fairly immediate, the video is delayed 10-20 seconds . It does do a good job of picking up moths that like the lights, deer strolling across the sidewalk, shadows of tree limbs moving in the afternoon breeze....The Ring device health meter says I have a weak Wifi signal, so I ordered a Chime Pro, as the info on it alludes to the fact that it's a signal booster. That would be a yes and ""no"". The yes is it sounds off when the Ring sends a signal (quicker than my phone notification), but it doesn't boost the wifi signal to the Ring device. I located the Chime Pro halfway between the router and Ring unit. The Chime Pro gets' a great signal - the Ring still shows the same weak signal rating. I called Ring Tech to see how to determine if the CP was actually rebroadcasting the signal. Apparently that question was not on the tech's ""cheat sheet"", as he had no clue as to wat I was asking. Going to have to put in a wifi extender, I guess. Will further evaluate this device's usefulness after that...",Not really thrilled with this device.

Comes with everything you need! Tools, wedges to attach for the best angle and a walk through setup for the best view/record. The fee is so inexpensive ($30 a yr) and well worth it.

I can check the battery life on the app and will get a notification when it needs charging. Charging is so easy! I just use the little screwdriver that was included, remove 1 discreet screw remove the cover and click out the battery.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2019,Sid Z,"I've had the opportunity of having both the first gen of ring and currently the second gen Ring 2. There's a big difference in the two straight out of the box. - You get a wedge and better mount plate for your ring so that you can set it up to the preffered angle - the new batteries hold charge much better and last longer and they're replaceable - you now have motion detection zones which honestly are not really good - video quality is much better and so is night vision - finally the biggest change is build quality. My last ring was a nice premium metal finish. This one though is very much plastic all around and feels cheaply made. Set up for the bell is super easy, I did buy a chime to use it as a real bell at my house but that's optional at $30. The motion detection works flawlessly and the 30 second clips it saves are good enough for me. I do not subscribe to the ring protect service. Now for people complaining about accessing their video clips when it detects motion. It's not instant and there's a reason for that. It alerts you to motion almost immediately but the clip it records is 30 seconds long and takes time to upload to the cloud from where you retrive it for viewing. Hence why you need to use live view most of the time. This is normal but I believe easily fixable if ring defaulted the motion detection to live view. Secondly this ring requires a good internet connection. I feel their diagnostics tool believes a 5 Mbps connection is sufficient but it's a one time test. If you're investing in any wifi enabled security you need to have a good internet connection and a router. I have a mesh router that's able to handle my 5 cameras and other smart home devices well. You need to have the right amount of network bandwidth to handle all of these connections or else you're going to have alot lag and that's not something ring can fix.",The almost perfect doorbell with security in mind
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Feb 2019,Sunshine4Life,"Installation: I had planned to install the unit without the angled bracket but realized that would require me to drill 3 holes (reusing 1 from original doorbell) vs 1 hole using the bracket (reusing 1).  Hardest part was figuring out which circuit the doorbell was on (it's low voltage but better safe than sorry).  Lessons learned:  You need a drill gun, use a butter knife if you're struggling to remove the cover plate, charge the battery before installing, use one or both of the angled brackets to save on holes. Functionality: I've read a lot of complaints about motion sensitivity, connectivity issues, etc. and was expecting the worst.  After 24 hours I have to say I'm pretty satisfied.  My doorbell is pointed towards the road (~60' away) and with motion detection maxed, notifies me when traffic passes; this is fine as I live on a dead-end road with only 12 homes.  As for connectivity, I tested how quickly I was notified on movement.  I got 1-2 steps into the field of vision before a phone notification.  On average getting from the notification to live feed is about 5-10 seconds.  More than acceptable in my opinion. I had no intention to pay for their service but I'm already considering the 30/year basic subscription as reviewing stored footage is pretty nice.",Initial Review after 24 hours

The technology itself is incredible, and does exactly what it says well. The issues is with the signal. I can put a wireless mesh on the other side of the window to where the Ring is at, and it sometimes takes a long time to pull up the live view on my phone. I can also move the mesh device further away and sometimes get better results. It's really a mystery to where the Ring want it's wifi signal located. I've been playing around with this for almost 2 years. It almost seems like the best results are when the signal is further away from the device.

The material of outside your house may cause wifi interfence so Google it for yourself.

Before you buy this or other ring products (I also have the ring spotlight) use your phone to check the wifi by closing the door then looking at how many bars you have. Even if it drops one bar..your ring product may not work as well. Use a good wifi extender near your chosen spot to see if it works better.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jul 2018,Ion,"Bought a Ring Video Door Bell 2 and chime a little over 30 days ago and have been working on trying to get it to be useful nearly every day. The primary problem with it is the ""motion"" detection performance renders it useless. For one thing it doesn't really detect motion, it detects changes in infra red (IR) returns. For another thing the sensitivity slider for detections is useless. On a smart phone you can't adjust it in incremental steps, in fact until I installed Ring software on a Win 10 PC (Ring's App is incompatible with a Win 7 PC) I didn't know it had 10 steps to adjust the sensitivity. The smart phone usually just jumped from min to max. However; after spending about a week attempting to get the motion detection usable I decided the sensitivity slider is useless Because: At a setting of 9 or 10 it will detect ""motion"" (changes in IR) out to about 100', which picks up every car going by resulting in a false motion trigger about every 15 minutes. During a 10 hour period 40 videos are produced. Looking through the videos in an attempt to find someone actually approaching the front door would take a couple of hours - making these settings useless. At a setting of 8 no ""motion"" is detected until a body is directly in front of the camera at a distance of 3' - making it useless since the video isn't usable for 2-3 seconds after the camera is triggered in which time a person could move to the side of the camera out of view or in the case of a delivery person they've dropped the package and all you see is their back as they depart. All settings less than 8 just reduce the 3' detection distance. My installation has a light colored stucco garage wall well to the the left of the camera. During the day the north facing camers picks up heat (IR) changes from the sun off the wall and causes probably 1/2 of the false triggers - this after enabling only the center sensing sector - indicating the enabling or disabling of the sectors is also useless (inoperative). Unfortunately I spent to much time trying to get this useless device to work so I'm outside the Amazon 30 day return window. ...the chime works, but unfortunately only with a ring door bell.",... been working on trying to get it to be useful nearly every day

The one thing that you want a video doorbell for is so you can have some sort of security. You can see when packages are dropped off or if someone is trying to steal your packages. Well when you first buy the doorbell it works awesome you get to see everything that goes on because they give you a free trial. After the free trial (unless you buy their subscription) the doorbell is useless. I feel like the company is ripping off people who don't realize the full extent of their purchase. The doorbell is $199 up front but then you have to pay $3 a month in order to see any of the video. The only thing it is good for is live view. By the time you get an alert and try to view the video (burglar, vandals) it tells you that you have to pay to see the video. Like I said it's useless unless you want to pay there fee. This system uses my Wi-Fi that I pay for, my cellphone that I pay for and a number of Amazon Echos that I have also paid for. Why should I have to pay them to view video on devices that I own or pay for. There are many other video doorbells on the market that let you record for free.

I wish I'd returned this within the 30 day period so I could have bought a more useful product. The basic problem is paying Ring for a subscription just to be able to review video generated by an alert that happened a minute ago. Why the heck should this require a subscription? Cache the recorded video in the camera and show it to me when it detects motion!  There are doorbells out there that will give you this basic feature without requiring a subscription.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2019,mustardchips,"Decided to get on the bandwagon. It has some features I like and some I think it should. First - the install: I have a relatively narrow molding to install device and was caught off guard on how physically big it was. I’ve been to homes that have Ring, but holding it surprised me. The screw holes on the Ring are on the outside edges meaning I would need to mount the left side into brick and the right side at a sketchy angle into the moulding. Luckily, the included angle plate mount in the center, so I decided to have my Ring have a slight downward angle and install was a breeze. I have a mechanical chime, so only had to connect two wires and use 6 screws. Second - Functionality: Picture and sound quality are better than expedited. I’m fortunate to have my router in the guest bedroom adjacent to front door so signal is strong. This ring requires a battery, which worries me, but luckily the mechanical chime power powers the unit and is there for considered “hardwired” (really didn’t want to have to mess with charging batteries). My favorite thing was later in the day after install, I solicitor came to door and alerted me while working in office. I pulled up Ring app and saw guy at door while he and I both waited for my wife to answer. Heard and saw entire conversation perfectly (wife did great job of getting him gone!) What I really DON’T LIKE is that “live view” times out after 10 minutes. I believe this is due to recording being uploaded to cloud and Ring not wanting to be left on continuously. Would be great if “live view” could be continuous and there was an option to initiate recording. Example: on Halloween to be able to have a tablet running with real time view of door with out it timing out. Overall, this is nice addition to home.","Nice unit, though no continuous Live View"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,JMMorton,"I picked up the ring doorbell 2 on sale. I figured it may help keep an eye out around the house and couldnt hurt. I think it generally does what's advertised. The video and sound quality are pretty good. Night vision isn't amazing, but considering the size and power consumption it's better than expected. The app is where I think most of the problems are. Once the doorbell detects motion, every phone and smart device hooked up to it start to go off. If you've got multiple Alexas set up, it gets very PeeWees Playhouse very quickly. To view the video of whatever set it off, you'll need to wait until that segment uploads. If you open the notification, it'll bring up the live feed after loading for a while. I can't really imagine a busy household with people coming and going all the time. You'd really have to set up timeframes for when motion alerts go off and when they don't. I think that by turning them off, you're ultimately turning off a big reason for these type of devices. The app also has a sharing feature for other ring users around you. So randomly you'll get notifications about things going on around you. Some of these are good clips of suspicious type behavior. The other 75% is often hilariously paranoid or otherwise useless information. Today at 4pm someone decided to alert the neighborhood that a man was trying to disarm her alarm with her cellphone and had his pen ready to attack her. It was clearly just a salesman texting while he waited for her to open the door. Hopefully your neighbors are as entertaining. The installation wasn't bad and the instructions were clear. It even included a drill bit for stucco. I like the product overall. I wish the actually load times to bring up the live feed were much shorter and that motion detection clips could be viewed prior to them saving to the cloud.",Not bad

WOW. I’ve owned RINGS since they started. The first product would fail after long term exposure to elements as the mounting plate was not water proof. I’d send in for replacement and customer service without fail would over night a new one. I purchased this one for my back yard garage to monitor my tool shed. I have the Eero net WiFi. This is my first “new” mode RING. Wow. Packaging was almost Apple quality, the further I dug into the box the more impressed I became. Sealed RING case! Two wedges for RING motion alleviation. An old RING mount to assist with new RING. It actually made me feel good! Amazon really did a good job keeping a life long customer without over complicating things. CON: My concern is....the NEED for the battery. The point of running 24v to the unit is to ensure longevity. I do not need the inconvenience of a damaged battery only to have to replace it in 5 years. That being said.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Oct 2020,Texas Irish,"Amazon needs to get serious about Ring getting their act together. I've had multiple Ring products about 2 years now, and had high hopes for their success and for my experience with Ring security products.  I'm letting you know that I'm increasingly dissatisfied with my Ring product experience.  The first year or so was very good, the last 6+ months have been absolutely terrible. I'm a retired IT consultant with extensive experience with all sizes of companies in many different industries. I'm very dissappointed that a company such as Amazon, which is a leader in it's field due to easy to use, functional software running on a robust architecture, coupled with continuously refined processes, has allowed Ring to meander in a completely different direction. Ring continues to prioritize both hardware and software new product development at the expense of current product functionality, reliability and ease of use. This has resulted in hardware that doesn't work as well now as it previously did (or as well as its competitors), software bloated by advertisements and overly complex bells and whistles, and an infrastructure that can't support the primary purpose of its products. The end result is Ring not delivering the product experience that most customers want out of a security product, which is the fast, reliable, accurate notification of and video of the security incidents which their cameras capture. That's the bottom line. Ring's product philosophy seems to mirror Microsoft's from years ago....develop complex products with lots of bells and whistles that will do everything anyone could ever want, but not the reliable, easy to use products that have the core features that 90% of customers are looking for. Ring doesn't seem to understand that software update reliability and useability depends on thorough regression testing (making sure that today's update doesn't break something that worked yesterday) and comprehensive IT and user QC (quality control) via IT and user beta testing (putting new updates in the hands of selected IT and actual users, prior to general rollout, so beta-testers can give feedback about ease of use, functionality vs requirements, unexpected consequences, etc.), to further refine and improve the proposed updates. I'm explaining within parentheses the terms preceding the parentheses, because I don't think Ring in their haste to deliver more and more products and changes quickly, thoroughly understands or comprehensively utilizes these quality processes. So in closing I'll just say that while Amazon's tagline is 'Earth's most customer-centric company', Ring's might be paraphrased as 'Earth's most un-customer friendly security product company'. Amazon....take control or 'Ring security products' will become a term used only in the past tense.",Amazon - you own Ring so take control and fix them

We have been wanting this ring doorbell for quite some  time and prime days made it possible to purchase. The picture is very clear and the night vision is quite nice too. We have found that there is a slight delay in notifying us on our phone of any motion but otherwise it works just like the instructions says. It was easy to install and set up on both our phones. I love that you can set the range for motion, since we live on a busy street. I found that when the hubby is mowing the yard, I can snooze the motion for the time he's mowing.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2020,Tripp,"Pretty underwhelmed by this product. My Ring doorbell is no more than 10 ft. from my router, with very fast speeds (200 down, 20 up) yet when I get a notification, it still takes about 6 or 7 seconds for the camera to activate. By this time, whatever motion was occurring has already gone or I catch the tail end of it. Part of this is also due to the bad motion detection. It does not begin recording until someone has walked all the way up all 15 of my steps and knocked the door/rang my doorbell. My front yard is wide open with a about 100 ft to the road where delivery vehicles park. My Ring doorbell does not catch anyone walking up to the door directly in front of the camera even though the motion detection is almost maxed out. If I have the motion maxed out, it picks up vehicles driving by, but still not people walking up, and kills the battery in no time. The recording time never seems long enough to sufficiently capture whatever motion has occurred. I'm very disappointed in this product and plan to get rid of it and just go with a video surveillance system.",Waste of money
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2019,Madman With A Camera,"Pros - Does not need to be hardwired - Works with Alexa - Fairly easy to install and setup - Pretty good image quality Cons - Biggest peeve is that the motion detection is flakey. I have it set to detect only motion from the right as that's where people would approach, and only if they are fairly close to the door.  I still get false positives when large vehicles go past the house (my front door is about 20-25 feet from street. - When I go to live view when someone is at the door it takes a bit for the camera to sometimes connect.  That is extremely annoying as people will keep ringing because I can't see them an talk so I need to go to the door anyway.  This might be because I don't have it hardwired, but defeats the purpose as I live on a second floor and that was the whole purpose of getting the Ring. - Wifi distance is not very good.  While I connects to mine it's just on the edge of it's limit which may be part of the issue above. - You need to pay if you want to view your past alerts and access it remotely.  Not a huge sum but something you need to be aware of that I was not.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2018,Jay Koontz,"Absolutely fantastic.  It's simple and clean. I bought this primarily because in my two bedroom apartment (yes apartment), I'm using one of the bedrooms as a den and that's where my soundbar and system is and when I'm watch TV, it fills the entire room and I was not able to hear people tapping on the door.  With the Ring Doorbell, I have attached it using command velcro strips (because apartment rules and damage blah blah), with the srips i was able to place it over the existing peephole and it's front and center when people approach my door. There are many features tagged with the Doorbell. I have motion alerts setup so anytime there's movement outside my door, I get notified via a app notification. That does get a bit annoying since I have neighbors, but, I just ignore the notifications and then the device will silently record for about 30 seconds and then I'm able to playback what it captured should i need to (free 30-day trial with RING then to do the aforementioned you need to subscribe to a protect plan with Ring, like 30 bucks a year for one device). So how does it work? For me, when there's movement outside my door, i get notified and if someone pushes the button on the doorbell, it rings of course from the doorbell and also on any device that you have the RING app installed on (for me, my Mac, iPad and Iphone) (there's an attachment you can get called CHIME/CHIME PRO, that will allow you to actually hear the ring inside the house but I have not purchased yet) SO, one the doorbell is rang, if your phone (iOS at least) is unlocked, the screen will automatically open to a live view of whatever is outside the door. You can answer the ring and speak directly to that person OR you can unmute the microphone to listen if you were wanting to do a little eavesdrop.  (NOTE: If you have home automation, you can connect smart locks to the app and then trigger for the door to unlock as well if it's a friend/family member/whomever) Now, the cost is a bit high, but, as my first video doorbell, i believe it gets the job done, the picture when you're viewing a live view or speaking with someone is 1080P HD CRYSTAL CLEAR, as is the audio!  There's a night vision mode so that if your doorbell is mounted in a spot not lighted at night, you can still see the person whose at your door! Now the downside is that the doorbell is battery operated with a rechargable battery, it will come partially charged but you will NEED TO CHARGE IT FULLY BEFORE USING FOR THE FIRST TIME. It took about 7hrs to charge initially and i just went to bed and installed the battery the following day.  I've read that there is an A/C adapter sold online so you could theoretically ""hardwire"" it in if your someone like me living in an apartment and that would make the battery inside become a backup battery.  You CAN use this with your existing doorbell configuration.  It came with all the tools and things needed to install. The best part is that should your RING device get stolen, as long as you notified the police and have a police report and submit a claim to RING, they'll replace the device free of charge. All in: It's a wonderful device, I installed it and it works as it supposed to.  It does freak some people out because they're not expecting someone to respond from the doorbell and most don't even know there's A/V capabilities if it's like a delivery person, but, I've told them about the doorbell and they thought it was the coolest thing ever.  It was easy install for me, the app is free and within the app you can also become part of a community watch where you can share videos and other RING users can do the same and then you can of course, be on the lookout when suspicious stuff goes down. Definitely worth the money and I refuse to return it.  I've had it for roughly a month now and I have no issues.",Best video doorbell if you need something simple and easy

When the doorbell is rung, I instantly see who it is, so that really shouldn't be an issue. It is pretty sensitive to motion, such as when someone is mowing the front yard. Those first couple of passes by the front door set it off. There is a large shrub that needs to be trimmed again close to the front door. When it got very windy a couple weeks ago, I believe it was the motion of the shrub setting it off.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,LaZaa,"With all the hype around Ring (except for the lame security concerns that are more of a user fault) I'm struggling to understand how is this meant to be one of the best of its kind. * Echo Show integration (0/5) I purchased an echo show because I wanted to see who is at the door and expected it to show that automatically when someone is ringing. Instead, this stupid doorbell is sending the recording to the cloud and echo show just tells me someone is ringing. What's the point? I need to tell Alexa to show me the front door but by then, I could just walk to the door and see myself. Why showing that automatically is not even an option (even thru routines)? How is this adding any convenience? * Motion Detection (1/5) Despite all the wizards and fine adjustments available in the app, the motion detection is horrible. My door is facing an intersection and the closest street is 40 feet away. I played around a lot with all the calibration options but it is still turning on for every single car but since it is not buffered and has a decent delay, i usually just see the car zapping out of the screen in the first second and then watch the nothing. The same goes with delivery people coming up to my door. By the time the camera is on, the person is already heading out from my door and i can see only his/her back. I bet the same will happen if someone takes those same packages. * Night vision (2/5) I have a lit front porch (that is really common in my area). Oddly, with my holiday decoration on, Ring goes into night vision mode, but as soon as the decoration is off, Ring is back to normal mode. Really frustrating. Isn't it supposed to turn on night vision when there is less light? I cannot wrap my head around this. So even though I like the details/clarity of the night vision mode, I could not find any adjustment option to make it work for my porch. Without night vision, it is needless to say that the recording from the night is useless. Considering all the security concerns floating around recently, I assume Amazon/Ring is focusing on fire fighting and I do not expect they would fix my problems any time soon. With its current maturity, this is just a dumb outdoor wifi camera powered from your doorbell wire. Nothing more. I just need to find some time to install back my old doorbell and send this crap back to Amazon/Ring.",Extremely disappointing

Don't expect to talk to anyone after they ring the Ring 2. They will not be there by the time your Ring 2 gets up and running on your smartphone.  Also I can not tell you how many times my smartphone alerts me someone is at the front door when it was me and I am already in the house. Just a little slow. Don't expect to see the persons face that steals your package off the front porch either. The Ring 2 is so slow that all you see (if anything) is their back leaving with your package. And it is so choppy there are big gaps in the video. One second they are 15 feet away then they are either 30 feet away or gone. And the audion i8s a joke also.

After the last software update the camera works much better and I have high hopes that it’s going to get even better. Review updated 9/11/2019 I have been contacted a few times by ""Ring"" support people regarding issues with this device.  I'll try to update with some videos and pictures. I think my biggest frustration with the device is its lack of continuity.  A few times it will connect, and you can have a live view, and an hour later you can't get a connection no matter how many times you try. My setup:  I moved my Arris router downstairs so that I could have wireless roughly 30 fee from the Ring device.  Although I have never any issues with other devices by having my router upstairs, the Ring refused to connect.  The app showed on the device health that there was plenty of signal level, but live view would not work. Operating systems:  I have tried the app with my Windows 10 computer, a macbook pro 15, a pixel 3, and an iphone 8. The system that connected more than the others was the Macbook.  Probably 3 out of 10 times.  The pixel was next with 2 out of 10.  The iphone was dead last.  It connected maybe once out of a hundred. The Ring device has updated once.  I did not notice any performance updates. I have about two weeks left to decide to keep it.  I purchased my through the Warehouse and got a discount.  For $70, I still don't think it is a good deal, and you certainly don't want to pin the safety of your house on it. I'll keep fiddling with it and upgrade as I go.  If I can get my hands on a google mesh system, and put one of the orbs a few feet from the device, I'll try it, but I am hesitant to shell out another $200 to make this device work.

UPDATE JUNE 2019, In addition to requiring a monthly subscription, I have come to the conclusion that this product is VERY useless.  This product starts recording when it detects a motion, therefore it is sleep to save battery until a motion is detected. This means that there is NO RECORDING of what happened just before it detected a motion. Go walk in front of the camera and walk away fast. The camera will tell you that someone is at the door, then you look who it was and you will see no one.  What I want to know is why am I forced to give it even one star... Let's say you are in the bathroom and someone rings your doorbell.  You come out within a minute and the person is gone and you are now wondering who was at your door.  This product doesn't even save the most recent recording and it wants you to signup for a subscription in order to see the most recent recording.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Oct 2019,Toolman Tim,"This was pretty easy to install using the battery and I had it up and going in under a hour. I decided after a few days to hardwire it to my old doorbell wires when I learned that it replaces the old door bell, so when it is pushed it will ring my existing doorbell and I will never have to take the battery out to recharge it. Plus, it was then less clutter as I didn't like the doorbell and this being next to each other by my front door. The old doorbell was also at a better height than having this just above it. The motion sensor only seems to pick up motion that goes horizontal, and does not pick up a person when they are walking directly towards it, until they are maybe 10-15 feet away. But, will pick up the garbage truck on the street 30-40 feet away, even though I have the motion zones set to not detect motion on the street. For some reason only large trucks like the garbage truck set the motion sensor off, cars and trucks do not. I have the motion zones set so that they do not cover the street, so nothing on the street should set it off. The wifi signal on this has to be very close to your router or you will have to setup a repeater very near it, which is what I had to do, I plugged in a wi-fi repeater inside about 5 feet away, and even still it doesn't get a 100% signal strength, but it is over 50% to give it a good signal. The lower the strength the better, I thought at first the larger number is better, but it measures the loss, so a lower loss percent is better. I gained a 30-40% improvement in using a repeater inside the house, as the router is on the other side, so the repeater for the wifi works good. There is a bit of a delay when you go to view or click to load the recorded videos from the motion sensor or the doorbell being rang. It seems to depend a lot on the device you are using the app on, as older phones have a longer load time.  That wasn't a huge negative, but it is slower than I expected it to be. The primary thing that needs to be fixed on this is the motion sensor, as people walking directly to it, are not captured. Even when driving a car in on the drive, of which I have set to be in the motion zone, it will not set it off. It may be because it is not directly in front of it, but the zone is set to cover it, so I don't understand why it does not pick up the motion. It works every time though when someone comes on to the porch and records them, so for that aspect it works perfect, every time. I just wish that it would start the recording before they get on to the porch, and I don't know why it always picks up large trucks on the street that are not in the motion zone.",Near Perfect - For The Average Home's First Video & Doorbell (and what's lacking)

When I started working from home, my conference calls would drop when the door had motion. The packaging and install experience was excellent.  It even came with a little screwdriver.  I had it up and going pretty quickly.  It took a little time to configure to my WiFi, but pretty easy to follow.  The mobile App (iOS) worked most of the time.  However, often, I would be alerted as people were walking away.  The other half the time, the motion notice would alert me, but it could not connect to the camera.  Maybe my work WiFi was blocking a certain frequency? I have SO many $5.99 to $10.99 Subscriptions that adds up to $100s a month. I had purchased an extra Chime, but the dogs bark and the baby cries every time it goes off, so it's sitting on a shelf.  It worked great. I ended up disconnecting all the alerts, because it was constantly disruptive to the other devices on the WiFi.

I'd read through the reviews, both good and bad, and did research on video doorbells.  Once this one was discounted as a newer product came out, I decided to go ahead and order. I received it timely and, at first, was a bit overwhelmed when opening the box and seeing all the hardware.  I am about the least handy, put together type person you can imagine.  I watched the videos and read the instructions.  I had it on and working, without the wedge, in about 15 minutes.  After looking at the picture I was getting, I decided I did need the wedge (I'd talked myself into thinking I didn't need it) I took the ring down and reinstalled with the wedge.  The picture is perfect both day and night. I am still in my non-subscription free month but I knew the subscription was needed for best use.  Given the level of security I now feel, it will be well worth the cost of the ring and the subscription. I can't speak to durability as I've only had it for a few weeks.

If someone is at the door, it’s way faster to go see who it is, even if I’m upstairs or in the basement. Don’t fall for this junk. Don’t waste your money. Buy a better system from another company. Also, I thought it recorded all the time. It doesn’t, only when motion is detected, meaning all the criminals have to do is stay out of its limited range. The police came to my door asking to look at the video because a crime had occurred practically in front of my house. No video of that, of course. We originally thought this would be the start of a video security system for the whole house. No way! As soon as we can spare the money, we’ll buy a good system.",NEVER shows who is at the door.

We even hooked up a 24 v transformer and added a Cutequeen  50w 25ohm resistor to the transformer (which was a piece of cake to hook up).  It ran as 'hardwire' beautifully.  The problem was with the motion sensor - we could never get the motion sensor to work farther than 8 feet no matter where we placed it on the wall (outside).  We used EVERY setting offered, we moved the unit up and down the wall, with and without the included wedges - no luck.  (We currently use a Moultrie Cam which will capture a gecko climbing up the gutter spout and that works way better than this Ring 2 worked.  We assumed that is was defected so it was returned today and replacement ordered.  We see videos on what this unit can do so we will install a 2nd one and write another review. I am updating this review because I ended up returning the second one.  Apparently these are not defective but they are made not to start motion less than 8 feet.  I want the motion to start at the end of our drive which is approx. 20 feet.  I really didn't need the 'doorbell' feature but the motion feature was a must for us.  From what I could tell some of the posted videos of the doorbell were in fact motion cameras.  I returned this item and got the BLINK camera instead and so far the motion range is excellent for what we want it for.",Returned Item but re-ordered - updated

The picture should send back to my cell phone via wifi or date either way, there is setting problem but the agent only think about wifi and blame my home wifi which works perfect for my computer. Agent does not understand tech very clearly. No one design a alarm system depend on home wifi only. Maybe I was wrong that the Ring is only works with wifi and it only works with your home wifi. The alarm banner appeared very short time(may be 1 second) I think you have to ignore it practically whether you like it or not,. To catch  banner you have to stare your cell phone all time. Ring only cares about money that  Ring's ad appeared long time. Also very poor manual, e.g. on p.15 about external wire to charge battery but did not tell you what voltage and AC or DC, etc.  I have not set up correctly yet but will install it anyway because I can't return it both Amazon and Ring refuse, bought less than 6 months and has one year warranty, and mounting whole already done.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2020,QuizBot,"This was easy to install and set up.  We didn't hardwire it because our current doorbell is in too narrow of a space, but that seemed simple enough if we would have done it. The battery is still around 35% after one month of use, which is better than I expected. Sometimes the video is choppy. I'm not sure if this is my sucky Wi-Fi or if it's the camera/program. It will detect motion, but then start recording a second or two too late sometimes so you can't go back to see what set it off. That's not really useful if someone was taking something off your porch.  Maybe I need to adjust my settings, but it alerts to motion, then records for however many seconds, sometimes completely missing us entering the house. For example, a car pulled up, but the driver didn't get out right away, the camera registers the motion and alerts, but several seconds go by, the camera is finished with the 30 seconds,  person exits the car and comes in the house, but that's completely missed. Or sometimes it'll stall during recording so you see someone step off the porch, it glitches so you see them stand still for 5 seconds, then vanish. Anyway, we still enjoy the camera and the live view is very clear. Sound is ok when talking through the doorbell. We've purchased the recording extension for the year.","Some glitches, but overall ok"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jul 2019,Jenna,"I just moved to a new house.  I've been excited to get out of an apartment and really get into some of the cool home automation type products, including Ring.  I bought this on prime day.  I was a bit disappointed bc of the setup of my entryway, sort of like a hallway almost with the doorbell on the wall (so doorbell isn't facing the street).  I didn't really like the idea of using a bunch of wedges and having this sticking out (thinking someone will walk into it or it would be more easily damaged).  So I opted to use the battery and put this up by the door (where imo the doorbell should be anyhow).  I guess mainly because of the hallway type entry, I don't get a great view.  Where the entryway ends, the brightness of the sun is so much you really can't see anything at all (can't make out driveway or yard, it's just bright light).  OK, not really ring's fault that's just how cameras and light work.  What I am super disappointed with however is the motion detection.  I have messed around with the settings on motion detection SO much trying to get it to work.  Occassionally it will randomly pick up what I assume is just a car going by, although you can't see anything in the video (def no one on the porch).  But when I tested it, no matter what I did - walk fast, slow, jump, wave my hand in front of the camera - it just will not pick up the motion of a person.  That was a huge reason I bought this!  Hoping to get notified if someone was at my front door (package dropoff, random stranger, etc).  It works ok when the doorbell is pressed and I was able to connect it to my Echo Dot to announce someone is at the door.  Overall, I'm disappointed.  I'll keep it because I do think it is a deterrent (maybe not, but I would hope).  Pretty much every house in my neighborhood has one, in addition to monitored security.  So it's a great concept, but unfortunately it's just not working as well as I had hoped for.  Maybe the motion detection works better when it's hardwired.  Given the location of my existing doorbell though, it seemed like I wouldn't get a very good view of anything except a brick wall.  And due to the light and poor motion detection, I'm not able to see anywhere near what I had hoped.",not as cool as I expected

Most of this review is purely information and not wholly criticism. The video quality is lacking.  My device is located 10-15ft away from my router, which is supplying 100+mbps down and 20+mbps up, even so the recording and streaming is a bit choppy. I would not call it high definition. It picks up motion accurately for the setting I have it on, which is standard. After two weeks of use the battery has consumed ~10%, that's with live streaming turned off and around 6 events a day. I would recommend if you plan to mount this to masonry then purchase a nice masonry bit and don't use the one supplied in the packaging. It's useless. Save yourself the agony of spending hours drilling a couple holes. A good DeWalt bit will do the job in 1/10th of the time compared to using the bit provided. It's very convenient that this device pairs with my Echo set up. I can view who's at my door through my Spot or Show. I can also answer my door through my Dots.",Gets the job done

They claim a 6 month battery life, but we made several selections that ""would reduce battery life"", we are not disappointed.  Realistically it hard to imagine that you could get longer between recharging then that with what we are getting. The attached video is while I was at work and my wife called to say there was a truck running out front.  I have the it set so a truck on the road does not activate it, but I was able to use the ""live view"" to see what was going on. We have opted for capturing the most video and it will start recording from the steam of the dryer vent on a cold day, I agree with other reviews that realistically you need to plan on spending the 3 dollars a month for the video saving.  Even with my phone not locked, the mail man is usually at the neighbors before I can get to live view, but it does do a good job of recording him every day. In nearly 2 months we have not had someone in the camera range that was not recorded. We got the first one as test, then we liked it so much we got more, we have put them on our rental properties.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jun 2019,FCW,"My son kept bugging me to buy a Ring doorbell.  I told him that I didn't see a need for a video doorbell.  I finally gave in and got one when we installed our new vestibule.  This was necessary since our original doorbell would be inside the screened enclosure.  I must say that I have changed my mind completely on this product.  I really like notifications when people are at my door.  I've even conversed with people who rung my doorbell while I was away from home.  There is a $30 per year optional charge if you want the captured videos archived.  Well worth the cost, but you don't need this service to see the videos in real time.  Since I could not connect to the old doorbell, I am running the unit from the battery.  After a month and a half of use, the battery is down to 37%.  I'll need to charge the battery in a couple of weeks.  This doesn't seem to be a big deal.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,CN in the Sun,"So far not impressed. I have other wifi cameras that have their own SD cards that do better. In fact, it recorded a truck entering my driveway, but the video did not start until it was pulling away. My other camera (Japanese brand) recorded the truck pulling in and pulling back out, and recorded it to a card and my phone. Also, I hooked it up for the doorbell and it apparently made the old doorbell transformer angry which started buzzing and wouldn’t stop even when I took the Ring out of the circuit. I had to disconnect the doorbell and will probably have to replace the transformer. Not sure why that happened but I wish I had installed it without my doorbell in the circuit now. And the app continually gets stuck in processes as there is no back button, so you have to close the app and reopen it if you don’t want to “add a chime” once you hit that button, or to get into settings if you entered the side bar menu (I can’t seem to exit the side bar menu).  I waited a long time to buy a Ring from all the advertising and now I wish I had not. And adding to this review: you have to pay a monthly fee to keep the videos in their cloud, apparently no other way to look at the videos. Waste of money, go buy a camera with two way communication and an Sd card to avoid the fees every month.",Not impressive at all- would never buy it again

The night vision setup is poorly designed. It stopped working about 3-4 months ago. Let me give you some history. I procrastinated for about a year before I finally switched Out my original ring doorbell and put this in its place.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jun 2019,Josh,"I've never been able to trust this thing to actually work. It will tell me every time when the mailman drops off a letter, as long as I'm within two miles of the device. Otherwise, it's either out of battery, has no connection, or just can't tell me what's going on because the app is a PoS. It's as if the thing knows when it's an inconvenient time to just crap out. All the other reviews seem to be about how you have to pay money to get this thing to agree to do its job. Let me tell you about what happens when you actually pay that money. (1) The first time I was away from home, my internet mysteriously stopped working, and so it told me that it had switched to its emergency-only cellular backup service. When in this mode, it gives no indication whatsoever that it's still functioning. The Ring app promises that all is fine, though. I don't trust it as far as I can throw it, because... (2) The second time I was out, the doorbell reported that it was low on power and the batteries should be replaced. It kept reporting that it was around 5% power until I got home. The problem? It had already died. It was completely out of power, not functioning at all, and lying to me about it through the app. As if I wouldn't notice. (3) The fourth time I was away is right now. I'm in SWITZERLAND. The app won't open, probably because I'm in Switzerland. Good work, Ring team. If only you had ever thought that maybe your users would want you to keep working while they're away from home, and that sometimes, that will mean OUT OF THE COUNTRY. I had also bought a unit for my parents without the Ring station, for use in monitoring my elderly grandfather if he tried to leave his apartment on his own. It would faithfully notify them of their every visit. But when he finally wandered outside and fell, no one noticed until the next morning. I don't trust this thing as far as I can throw it. Look into a less commercialized, more honest and transparent system, like all the other reviews are telling you. Edit: Another interesting missing feature: letting you know when the battery is low. What a concept, right? Main base station will lose communication with the doorbell, and silently assume that there's a wifi problem while reporting that the unit is alive and well at 2% battery. For weeks, or however long it takes you to notice that the thing's just dead and replace the battery on your own. This is one of the most laughably useless products I've ever owned. Buy something else. Other products won't even charge you to download the information they record for you.",Functionally useless; cannot be relied on.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Feb 2019,p-bass5,"This device does what it claims and is easy to install. I hooked it up to my existing door bell wires with no issues and no modifications needed. Be sure to check your mounting location before unpacking it all to see if the device will fit, because it is much bigger than a traditional doorbell button. In my case (see photo) it actually is a little too wide for the door casing and sticks out a bit, but I’m ok with it. And you don’t have to wire it to your doorbell, it can function as a stand alone device since it connects to your WiFi. So you could mount it anywhere you want. The advantage of connecting it to your existing wiring is that it also charges the battery. If not wired you will need to periodically charge it, although it appears to be a long lasting lithium pack that is easy to remove and charge by USB when needed. I’m satisfied with the product but I am not satisfied with the fact that you must pay a small monthly fee to retain video history storage after the first 30 free days. Without the video storage it serves no purpose in my opinion, so be prepared to start paying $10 a month if you want to see the video event history. So... It’s not just about the purchase price, there is also that service fee! Small monthly fees like this are a popular strategy with many companies and, again this is my personal opinion only, a part of “the fleecing of America”. Before you know it, you have all these small monthly fees with different companies that add up to hundreds of dollars a month.","Good product, but a monthly fee is involved"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2020,J. Sheppard,"First of all I have a full set of ring cameras and can say the quality of the video is decent and the motion detection is accurate on the ring floodlight camera and somewhat on this camera. It doesn't record constantly so it misses some things that may be important. Example, it shows it can catch motion to protect a car parked in front of your house but it misses a lot of the people walking around the car at night time. Also after 30 days now you have to pay $100 a year which was not made clear before I started purchasing these cameras and spent days installing. Pro - The neighbors app, easy to use and share ring app, image quality is decent. CONS - Like I stated before it doesn't record continuously meaning it only records when it thinks there is motion. Bait and switch subscription service. Motion detection, It ALWAYS catches the mail main but only sometimes catch people walking around parked cars infant of the home maybe 20ft away.  Also its hardwired but I still have to disassemble it to charge the battery occasionally because it drains?????",Its not a great solution. Just decent.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jul 2019,Ashley H.,"I just purchased the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and installation service through Amazon during the 2019 Prime Days! The technician just left and the service was fantastic! Not only did I get a phone call the day before the appointment to confirm it, but the actual technician called me when he was 30 minutes away to tell me he was coming. My window for the appointment was 2-5 pm; he showed up just after 2:00 and took only 45 minutes to complete the job, leaving the rest of my day to be productive!! I am over the moon with this new upgrade to my home. The Ring Video Doorbell 2 has an accompanying app that is very user friendly and adds a level of instant security to my home without a monthly fee! Yes, you can purchase monthly monitoring services for your Ring devices, but I find the included features to be enough for me for now. No matter where I am, as long as the wi-fi is on at home (the one my Ring Video Doorbell 2 is connected to), I will get a notification on my cell phone if there is movement at my front door or if someone rings the bell. This notification specifies if someone is ringing or if there is motion and you have the option to ""answer"" either and speak through the doorbell to the person(s) standing there - what a great deterrent for break-ins/theft!! The picture/image in the notification is incredibly clear and easy to see details of the person(s) standing there. I was worried about how the Ring Video Doorbell 2 would fit in the space where my existing/non-smart doorbell was, but the technician suggested using the wedge backplate (included with the Ring Video Doorbell 2) to put the bell on more of an angle to fit better. I'm glad to say that the new bell fits and, with the turn from the wedge backplate, the video actually picks up our entire front porch now, which is great for that security I was talking about. In fact, I love it so much that I'm thinking of getting another for our back door! Once the technician had wired up the Ring Video Doorbell 2, he tested it and it worked beautifully, ringing our normal bell chime in the home to alert us, and showing up on my cell phone to alert me there as well! If you are like I was, with a plain ol' doorbell, consider upgrading this small part of your home to a smarter option; I don't think you'll regret it!!",The technician was fantastic!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2019,Adrianne,"I bought the Ring Doorbell 2 in mid-February, so I've been using it for three and a half months. I also bought an extra battery so there would not be any downtime while waiting for the battery to be charged. I had high hopes for the Doorbell 2 because of many glowing reviews. The install was very easy. I used one of the wedge things that was included so it angles down since the doorbell is up two steps. Install directions were clear. However using it is a disappointment as mine fails to deliver as shown on advertising videos  First of all, let me say that there is a Ring Community with answers to usage questions, etc on the Ring website. I have used that resource for the problems we have had, and my searches have returned pages and pages of answers, most of which do not apply to my questions. I have rephrased my questions a number of times and have had the same results. So put on a pot of coffee and be prepared to search long and hard through the responses if you should look for answers on the website. So now to the usage problems: 1. If you've watched videos of this product, you may have seen the conversations between the homeowner from inside the house as he or she speaks with the person at the doorbell. The owner gets an alert that someone either rang the doorbell or set off the motion. The advertising videos and audios are flawless. Unfortunately in real life at my home, though the video is pretty good, the audio is horrendous. It is about 99% static with the other 1% being PARTS of words sprinkled throughout the static. It is impossible to understand anything spoken from inside or outside. In searching how to troubleshoot this issue, among answers to many unrelated questions, I read that this problem is actually a bug and Ring has been working to solve it, but has not succeeded yet. 2. Motion seems to have a mind of it's own. I have adjusted the motion settings a number of times. At first, it alerted me to every car, truck, bicycle, bird, or mosquito that went by, so I must have had it on super-sonic-sensitive. As the troubleshooting indicated I moved the slider various times to adjust the motion sensitivity. I have it adjusted to a tolerable setting now, with fewer alerts, but sometimes it doesn't even pick up the UPS delivery person walking right up to it and leaving a package. 3. Connectivity: Since I had the problems listed above,  I read about how to improve the network signal. I placed a Wi-Fi range extender in a socket on the inside wall closest to the doorbell. According to the Ring documentation, the lower the network signal displayed in the doorbell's health report in the app, the better the network signal is for the device. The report showed that the received signal strength indication (RSSI) decreased to -45.0, which they state is better than most. Unfortunately that did not help any of the above problems. Considering I bought this doorbell so I would be aware of motion near my door and also to speak to an unknown  visitor near the door, I say the Ring Doorbell 2 is a FAIL At this point, I am hoping that updates come along that will improve the performance of my Ring Doorbell 2. Until then, I'll keep it as it is and admire how nice it looks.",Disappointed in This Product

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Apr 2019,SunshineAlways,"I bought my ring doorbell and the  security system. I love the intercom capabilities. But my biggest complaint is the lag time to connect for me to answer the doorbell. It takes like 20 -30 seconds for connectivity to the doorbell. By that time, a package could be stolen, or the delivery person is back in their car. My internet connectivy is great and my cell phone reception/speed is decent. I feel the night vision is subpar for 2019. Ive seen plenty of videos on the ring app of perpetrators and it may be hard to identify them even without a mask. Skintones are har to distinguish with the night vision. So you will want to have flood lights. The ring app/neighborhood community is very informative. They used to have a referal program, where they give you $10 for each referral. However, i got the referral credit and still was not able to use it to purchase ring products....",It lags in connectivity about 20 seconds
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2019,Oriskany,"I originally purchased this doorbell and had some issues.  After several detailed communications through emails and phone calls with my Ring representative, every issue was completely resolved. I had the outstanding support of Kikki, an Executive Community Support Representative. On my first day of communicating with her she made a commitment that she would work me to make sure that I was totally satisfied with my purchase. I can say I am 100% pleased with the Ring products I have, their functionality, and the dedicated support that I received. My doorbell location was a bit unique as I had more of a ""tunnel view"" since I have walls located on both sides of our entrance.  My expectations were higher than what the equipment could provide for my situation. It turned out not to be the fault of the equipment, but the location of my doorbell. Bottom line was I could not make any adjustments to the settings to make this work. It always worked perfectly if someone approached our door, but I expected it to pick up the motion of someone walking on the sidewalk too. I learned that since I had a limited ""tunnel view"" people walking by might trip it, but often would be out of the view by the time it started recording. Increasing the sensitivity helped, but it caused another issue because now it picked up all the cars passing by in the street too. I ended up getting a stick up camera in addition to the doorbell. I needed both devices to cover the areas I wanted. Both devices I now have are wired. In my situation the wired devices worked better for me. I can't say enough for my representative Kikki, and with Ring and their commitment to ensure you are pleased with your purchase. It took a while but I am 100% pleased. Great product and their ""above and beyond"" support that I received!",UPDATED Review 10/5/19

The doorbell worked decently well until the free subscription (that’s in the fine print and you don’t realize is a paid service until it’s over and you call for support on why your doorbell stopped working) ended.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2019,Diane L. Welty,"I tried the Ring 2 doorbell.  Was planning on getting several cameras, if it worked. I am returning the doorbell. I have a brick wall on either side of my front door. Knew this would make for some tunnel vision. As I stand where I installed, I can easily see half my front yard and most of the driveway approach to the house. Somehow, the camera basically shows brick walls and only the sidewalk directly infant of it. I have two light fixtures on the side walls (4 lightbulbs). I read that they had fixed the problem of it not recognizing night time, under those circumstances. It did not seem that way. The motion detection did not pick me up until I was but a few feet from the porch (where the walls begin). It barely caught me entering the house on the next try.  This is NOT useful to me. Thankfully the easy return to Amazon, is available. The rechargeable battery takes 5 house to charge, but is very easy to remove from the doorbell.  I had high hopes for this device. I chose the Ring 2 over the original Ring... thinking I was getting a better product. It is hard to image how this could be worse.  Under the right circumstances, it may be OK.  But for may usage, it is worthless. I really wanted it to work.",NOT recommending....
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Mar 2019,grouticus,"We have had our home security system in our house with dozens of sensors, three cameras, a garage door opener and more.  I recently decided to add the Ring 2 Video Doorbell after hearing all our friends with them saying they love theirs.  After using it for a few months, I'm disappointed in myself that I hadn't added this device sooner as it is now our favorite part of our home security system.  It took about 10-15 minutes total to install on the wall and set up through the app, much quicker than I expected.  Once it was set up, I immediately started getting notifications of any movement approaching our front door which is located in a courtyard.  This is great because I can see when packages are being delivered, when friends and family are arriving/departing, or whether it's just another solicitor and I can ignore the door or answer the Ring through my phone to ask them why they are at my house.  It typically does take a few seconds to load the audio/video if someone rings the doorbell however that hasn't had any adverse effect.  The picture and sound are great and I really like the fisheye look because it captures more of the area being monitored.  I even talked our new neighbor into buying one herself and told her I would install it if she did buy one because of how simple and quick it was to put in and provide more security.",Best part of my home security system
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2020,Holley,"Bought this for Hubby because he really wanted one. It works better on a higher end smart phone versus a cheaper one. When motion detection goes off and you click on answer it takes a while to open up because it has to upload to a server before you can view it in the app. By the time the person gets to the door they could have left and drove off before you could open the app. Room for improvement there.We have a high-speed Internet connection but I think we’re going to need to get a Wi-Fi extender in hopes this will improve its performance and picture. Currently picture very Skippy, so is the sound and does not show much and when it’s dark. If it does OK when the flood light is on. Also keep an eye on your router activity. our Average streaming doubled from what we normally use on the average. It was also creating interference in the network. Some improvements needed there as well. If your cable or Internet provider has a cap on your data streaming this could be a problem. The app is interesting I do like the neighborhood information that people share. It does help bring the neighborhood watch closer and Communication. When we get a Wi-Fi extender I will update the review and let you know if it actually helped or not.",It’s OK. But could be better
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2018,Michael C.,"The problem is that it often doesn't work.  There are a couple of issues: 1.  Even when the range is set to the lowest setting, there are still a lot of false alarms.  The garbage truck out in the street sets it off.  A passing car will set it off.  Absolutely nothing will also set it off. 2.  The paid subscription is deceptive.  It wasn't clear that without the paid subscription, you really aren't able to use it to see who was at your door.  I understand not keeping video for a long time period, but only for a couple of seconds?  And then it's gone, unless you pay a monthly ransom fee? There are better options-you should consider them. Update:  After dealing with the Ring doorbell for a couple months, I've removed it and put it into the trash.  On occasion it connects quickly, but for the most part it can take a minute or so to actually connect to get a live view.  I tried contacting Ring, but their customer service is even more useless than their product.","When it works, it's great"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2018,jl9988,"We had our bikes stolen from our fenced in patio, so I bought this. I am in love. Because we are fenced in, the ft to activation doesn't really matter, and it only goes off when someone really is there. The app on the phone is so easy to use. Just note- it is $3 a month to use the cloud storage. Anyways, we used the handy guide to install and had no problems. We did lose one of the security bottom screws that make it so no one can steal it like 2 seconds into the process, but luckily they send an additional one. The directions are easy to follow, and they give you everything you would ever need and more! Screws, drill bit, the works. The video it takes it really good quality, but it is fisheye, so know that. The sound is great too. My dog has learned the app noise and barks because he knows someone is at the door. The battery lasted about a month and a half before I needed to charge it, and that is with pretty normal use (2 times going off in AM, 2 PM, maybe 4 additional throughout the day for packages and dog walks). We turned off the function to see the camera at any time, which saves the battery.",LOVE this. Best purchase ever.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Oct 2018,Dan Durig,"With demo mode this is a 5 star product. Once you are forced to pay the monthly charge it is much less functional and does not really meet what I see as advertised features. I have two of these. I received one as a gift and gave one as a gift. For the first month everything is great until they want to collect $3-10 a month. then the only thing that is still functional is the ability to answer the door.  All the remaining functionality is gone unless you pay $3-10 a month. I want motion notifications when not home and be able to pull up live video from my home without having to pay for it. I installed a DVR and can do this just fine with that so no need to pay for it here. Installation is easy assuming that your doorbell works. If it does not then you are likely going to need to either fix it or pull the battery to charge it every month or two. I broke two of the screws to mount it using an hand screwdriver so the mounting hardware is a bit lacking, but it did work fine for a different installation. I know that Amazon recently purchased them. My HOPE is amazon will include the video storage and advanced features as part of Prime in the future rather than charge and MRC on top of the service. In many installations you likely may need to get some sort of wedge to aim the camera correctly. Newer versions of ring come with this but are also 2x more expensive so this works fine. The ring neighborhood also is a nice feature allowing to see what neighbors are uploading and dealing with. I removed stars for each piece of functionality that I lost when I would not pay the MRC. There is no reason I should have to pay to stream video live from my doorbell. I understand video storage costs and could see that as a justified expense to charge consumers for. If they have setup streaming to require their servers then they made some architectural mistakes when building the platform and need to be careful how this is marketed.",Great demo mode limited functionality without monthly fee
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2018,PhotgraphicLee,The doorbell seems good so far. I only had it for about a week. I like how easy it was to connect to the rest of my Ring system. The ease of use is great and I think as the system is updated it will get better. I can also use the video doorbell with Alexa. All I have to say is Alexa show me the front door and the camera will show up on my Tv with the Firestick connected. I read that if you have an Echo show or Echo Spot you can see it on those devices as well. I'm not to sure about the battery life since I only had the device for a week. I will report back with that info. I did read on a few reviews that the doorbell has a delay. I am here to say that there is a delay. It's only a few seconds but it's noticeable. Overall I like it so far. I'm just waiting to see how it will hold up in the weather.,A little lag in the connection.

And no, it doesn't actually work with alexa.  Just a cheap piece of S# running on old 2.4ghz wireless technology without the ability to stream even the poorest video quality it begrudgingly attempts to display. Ring also doesn't mention that they don't actually ring any echo device.  One would assume that once the skill was enabled and the doorbell rang, an echo would chime and the echo show would display the video from the doorbell.  Nope.  No chime.  No notification.  No alert whatsoever.  And if you just so happen to want to see the video from the doorbell on your echo, you have to ask echo to show the video, and then the video attempts to load and by then people have left and all you are shows is either a black ""attempting to connect"" display or a video that looks like it was from a camera that was dropped under water.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2019,Jason,"Pros: Very clear 1080p images day or night. Easy to mount and set up. Speaker, so you can talk to people who ring the doorbell. Cons: Does not pick up people walking up to the door but picks up cars no problems. Videos stored on your phone but after ""free"" 2 week period you can't view non-live videos anymore on your phone. 2.5Ghz only wifi Will not work with wifi extenders Summary: I have always wanted to buy one of these for years. Finally bought one on super sale. It was a breeze to set up after charging the battery for 12 hours (only got to 80%). Installation took about 10 minutes. The system works ok. It was great for the first two weeks having the videos for playback to see who was at my door that the camera never picked up even when they were standing by it delivering a package but it is more than happy to pick up the 8 busses that drive by in the street every day m-f plus the 4 trash trucks and daily UPS/Fed ex trucks. Notifications take forever to get to your phone if on mobile so if there is a UPS delivery where they run up to the door and ring the bell then run away because UPS never waits, you won't get it in time and then you can't view who rang the bell because they want you to pay $15/mo to view your videos on your phone (not the cloud). Totally worthless in my opinion after the free introductory period. Pretty much a lawsuit waiting to happen. The camera only works on 2.5Ghz wifi networks which is odd for being a 1080p camera that pretty much requires 5ghz for direct streaming quality, no wonder it's so choppy all the time. The camera absolutely does not work with wifi extenders even on 2.5ghz networks. It fails to connect but works ok direct to the router on a 2.5ghz network. Tried at multiple locations for these issues and they are consistent on multiple devices, I have installed some for friends, it is a device limitation. Don't even bother if you use a 4g hotspot for a remote location, might as well throw it in the trash. You would be better off with a $40 trail camera from Cabellas or a $100 HD camera that stores video on a SD card and connects to your local network for mobile use. At least then you can view prior videos for free 24/7 for as long as you like. I really hope this doorbell does not fail this winter. It says nowhere the operating temps for the device until you open the box and it says -5f in the instructions. It's usually -20 to -30 for weeks in the winter here so it will be put to the test. I hope the battery does not explode, that will be fun in mid January trying to clean that up. Would not have bought if I knew that up front.",High quality camera that needs updates

The last person I spoke to suggested if the wi-fi extender didn't work, the product may be defective, so I am trying to get someone to exchange it but so far they just want to tell me to try the same stuff that they already had me do.

I was contacted by a community support representative who worked with me to try to determine the problem, without me going through everything that was tried before.

I have Alexas and Smart Home Devices all over my home.  For the past year, I have had a different brand video doorbell (AlfaWise).  It came with online software that had no directions, and it lost connectivity to our smartphones shortly after we installed it.  The fix was to detach the doorbell and set up a hard-wired connection to the network, connect the smartphones, and then install it back on the house.  So mostly it was an expensive doorbell chime. Anyway, this Ring Doorbell 2 is LIGHT YEARS ahead of the other brand!  I installed it with a battery and have had it for about a week.  I have fine-tuned the motion sensor to our liking, and we are notified by Alexa whenever motion or a ring is detected.  We can see the front door at anytime on my Echo Show, and we can review the videos right from our smartphones, tablets, etc.  I understand there is a subscription price of $30 per year to store our videos.

Now, I have zero issues. Don’t get me wrong, I have four other cameras around the exterior of my home, and the combination of them all is a deterrent to those who aren’t respectful of their neighbors. The Ring wireless doorbell was extremely easy to install due to the provided materials, and the written as well as included video instructions. It’s as easy as charging the battery, determining where you’re going to place the doorbell, installing any adapters, installing the Ring app, connecting the doorbell to your wi-fi, and placing the doorbell in the pre-determined location. I’ve noticed that some postal service workers and delivery people won’t ring the doorbell, because they think that activates the recording. Little do they know that the motion sensors start the recording regardless if they ring the doorbell or not.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2018,Medieval lady,"If you plan to wire this to your existing bell, you will need to install a transformer and resistor that don't come with it. It may not be clear up front. If you're not an electrician, you may not feel comfortable hunting in a basement, crawlspace or attic for your old transformer (this new must replace what you already have). In this case, I recommend getting a spare battery pack to charge while the other is in use. It can be hard to get the cover off to access the battery pack: look for a YouTube video online to help with this, need a thin putty knife (or similar) to pry it off. Documentation could also be better. Once installed, it's impressive. Wide field of vision and easily adjustable sensitivity for road traffic and distance. Saves a 30 sec or so video snippet. YouTube can also help linking to Echo devices. Must download yourself to keep or buy a maintenance plan, also not included. Ring App is needed and is sizeable.

I setup the motion activation/recording for anything within 10 ft. This thing does not record until the person is already on the porch and even then it is only recording for 1 second sometimes even when someone is still moving around on the porch. This seems like a major problem with the product that needs to be fixed. I will not buy any other ring products until they can fix the current issues. Update: I worked with Ring customer support, they were awesome. They shipped me a replacement device. I installed the replacement device and it had the exact same problem as the original doorbell of only recording 1 second of video. Update 2: Product is now working after spending more time on the phone with advanced support. Turns out my firewall was blocking the ring from uploading its videos. So none of this was the fault of the device itself. Update 3: After over a year of use I cannot recommend this product at all. It is severely lacking and does not so the job it was built for well at all. I have people dropping packages at my porch that never get recorded at all. If it does start recording it is normally as the person is walking away. I have this thing set to start recording if there is motion anywhere in my front yard, yet is fails miserably.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2019,Eyal S2K,"I have 2 Ring doorbells. The original and I Ring 2. I bought a Ring doorbell and after about a year it failed. Support sent out a replacement (and made me ship back the failed unit) and a few months later the battery now won't hold a charge for more than a week (on the lowest motion settings). I now have to uninstall it with the special tool, charge it up for 2-3 hours, then go out and reinstall it weekly. Even when the battery is in its best condition you get maybe 4-5 weeks out of it on limited motion settings. The Ring 2 lasts about 3-6 weeks depending on how much motion. The worst is I've had more than one package disappear from my front door and I always ended up with a nice video of the persons back as they walk away because the Ring doesn't start up quick enough to capture a face. That video is also terrible quality. I had the ring on my doorbell and moved it to my front gate ( and added a ring 2 to my other gate) as soon as the Nest Doorbell came out as I have Nest Outdoor cameras on the house and know how much better Nest is. The performance of the Nest is in a different hemisphere. If you have a wired doorbell move on from considering Ring and get the Nest. Picture quality in a different league, Person alerts not just motion alerts, no overwhelming amount of useless motion alerts that take 10 seconds to get launched in the app to see when a leaf blew in the wind, and best of all, the whole event is captured and a 24/7 history is saved, not just the back of someone walking away with your cat food from amazon.

But it would be better if it was the adjustable one as sold by ""QIBOX or HOMONO"". Certainly more adaptable to customer needs, and would only be ""pennies"" for Ring.

This product was great at first. The wi-fi signal was not strong at the door it was assigned so I purchased a wi-fi extender. Initially it detected any type of motion, even wind, which was annoying. We thought it might have been the motion of the wind chimes, so we took them down. It didn't make any difference. It still detected wind. We changed the settings to detect only people. That it did for a few weeks. Now I get a notification that someone is at the door, but not in real time. Someone may have come to the door, and half an hour later I might get notification. Lately, on one instance, I received a notification that someone was at the door, and when I checked the video, and it was black. The video was recording, but the entire clip was black. Before and after that segment you could see the outside, but when someone was there - nothing. I'm done with this device. It's useless, and not helpful. I'll look into other brands that may work as intended.","Started out great, then problems started"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2019,Yolanda Cohen,"Overall, I really like the concept and the features of the Ring 2. I just wish the motion detection could be adjusted more accurately. The concept of alarming for motion detection and the doorbell is a great one. Often, I like to know if someone is approaching my door before I hear the doorbell. But even with the supplied slanted down attachment, I'm still getting false alarms from passing large trucks on my busy street, even when I've adjusted the ""alarmed"" area to about 5 feet (the road is 30 feet away). I've tried reducing the motion zone to near zero, but then don't pick up people walking on my porch until they're at the door. And I've reduced the frequency of motion to ""light"" from ""normal,"" but have experienced the same issue. So I've comprised, accepting some false positives for motion in return for picking up people at least a few feet from my door. The other negative is that if I'm outside of my home, I don't hear the motion or doorbell alarm for a minute or two, which means I've missed someone at my house. Even in my home, I can't always get a live view on my phone before that person has left. On the positive side, even with these issues, I am overall happier that I can hear the doorbell in my home and on my phone when I'm out, so even if I can't answer the door I can at least see who was there. This is great for when a delivery person drops off a package on my porch; I can then call a neighbor to move it out of sight if I am out of town, etc. So ... it's not perfect, but I am more pleased than not regarding my awareness of visitors and am living with the occassional false positive.",Some great features but motion detection may be an issue on a busy street
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jan 2020,J. DFW,I've been using for over a month and I really like the motion detection. It would be better if you could do more fine tuning of the detection but that part of the app is a little clunky. I get an alert on my phone when the motion detector is triggered and that's very nice especially when you're expecting a package because most of the time the delivery folks do not knock or ring the bell. The video doorbell works well and I get a different kind of alert on my phone when someone pushes the doorbell button. I've not tried the talk feature yet but the sound on the video comes out fairly clear and is nice to have. Install was very simple and I'm using mine with battery and not direct wired. Looks like I'm going to get 9 to 10 weeks on a charge but I'm not that far out yet so it could be little less or more (I have motion detection on the sensitive side and the feature to take pictures through out the day turned on).  I bought a backup battery so when the current one needs to be recharged I won't have any gaps in coverage.,So far I like it and nice to have the video
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Apr 2019,J. Engelhardt,"Don't waste your money or time --- this product is flawed in design and software/firmware. Purchased Ring Doorbell 2 in June 2017.  It worked without any issues until late-2018.  The core problem was constant disconnection from 2.4Ghz WiFi -- regardless of 20 hours of troubleshoot with Ring support staff and me.  Bottom line -  Ring's firmware updates are likely causing the problem --  since unit failed to work with 3 different WiFi routers tried. Even when the Ring Doorbell 2 attached to my 2.4Ghz network... it was unable to show Live Video or any form of video.  Only the doorbell (audio) worked. Ring support said I needed to open dozens of firewall ports (TCP/UDP) -- which is unacceptable and opens my home network to other issues (since these ports are well known publicly!). Bottom Line -  I am disposing of the Ring Doorbell 2 and will never use Ring products again -- they don't know what they are doing with product design that WORKS in a production, home security environment.",Not ready for Production use in Wi-Fi Environment
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Aug 2018,W. Tersch,"If you live in a place where cars drive by, the Ring Video Doorbell 2 will be constantly triggered by them, even at its lowest motion sensitivity setting. I've worked closely with Ring customer support, and tried every setting over the past six months. TIP: Unlike the wired Ring Doorbell PRO, this one has no ability to define areas where motion will be ignored. So you get dozens of battery-draining false alarms per day. It also either (a) fails to record people actually coming up right to the door; or (b) has a long delay before recording kicks in, resulting in a worthless video of the back of the person's head. This defeats the purpose of a security camera. Finally, note that if your house is brick, wi-fi signals have trouble going through the wall, which can make recordings choppy. I cannot, and do not, recommend the Ring Video Doorbell 2. The wired version is a better bet, for people with doorbell wiring, because it allows you to define areas where motion will be ignored, versus recorded. PROs: inconspicuous design, and serves its doorbell function OK. Just fails as a security camera.",Awful motion sensing - avoid
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2018,B. D. McGee,"Just installed this morning so this is more a first look review. It took a few hours to charge the battery for the first time, so let it charge overnight. Comes with everything I needed to install and more. Pretty deluxe, but expensive. I went with a battery powered Ring Doorbell because my house didn't have a traditional doorbell to replace. Instead it has an old whole home alarm and intercom system. It didn't take long to install the app on my phone and connect the Ring to my network. I tested it indoors before installing to ensure the best wireless connection. Once tested, it took about 10 minutes to install the wedge mounting plate, screw the Ring to the plate, install the battery and security screw and ring the bell! Works great, so I'm going to add some Ring cameras outside. A Ring Stick Up, and maybe a Ring Floodlight. I also ordered an Alexa Show to use as a camera monitor. Will report on this later.",So far its working great

But even with that, the peace of mind that it provides far outweigh any of the little negatives about the device. The motion detection seems to be a bit slow as well it doesn't start recording most of the time until after somebody has turned their back and started walking away from my doorstep, but there are some times where it does start recording as they walk up so it's kind of hit-or-miss.",Peace of mind
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Mar 2019,Rocky Moutain Gal,"This doorbell works well wirelessly. I am notified if someone is at my door and can see videos of the doorway. It works well both day and night. There is a short time lag before notification on my cell phone so it is not instantaneous. A few times, I have missed the person at the doorway due to this lag but they do show up on video. (Mostly delivery people who ring the bell and leave quickly) I have it attached to a ring chime and my echo dots so I get a ringing sound in the house when someone is at the door. You cannot talk with the visitor over the echo dots - just on your cell phone. I wish that feature was available Ring! It was very easy to install. Just drill 2 holes for the mounting screws using a household level, install the charged battery, and mount it. I’ve had it up for 3 months and no recharge required yet.

Took some restarts of the iPhone, my network, and the Ring itself and it was finally happy. The app repeatedly kept reporting that it couldn't find the network....so one star off for that. I think a lot of people would have got frustrated with this part of the installation. Once it was up and running, it was a breeze to customize to the area of my front porch area. Impressive was how accurate the ""auto-range"" set-up is for the motion sensing. I then linked the camera to my Alexa Show inside the house as well. Easy enough. One thing I think that could be improved is the actual securing to the wall. I needed to use the wedge to point the camera down. Between the tiny screws mounting it to the wedge and only two small screws securing it (the plastic wedge) to the stucco, it wouldn't take much to knock it off the wall and walk away with it!!!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2018,Terry Ball,"Physically installing this was tedious as I had to use wedges. But, I took my time and was patient. Hooking it up to WIFI has been a nightmare. I live in a 3 bedroom rambler. I have WIFI routers hooked up to Comcast cable at each end of the house. I get 3 out of 3 bars throughout the house on my cell phone. When I step outside the front door, which is no more than 40 feet from a router I get two out of three bars which apparently isn't enough.  I even moved my bedroom router up to the window placing it within 40 feet of the doorbell. No improvement.  I get 2 bars out of 4 on the Ring app and the doorbell can't operate with that weak a signal. I did notice that when setting up the WIFI you first connect to the Bell Network WIFI, then the setup software allows you to  pick your own WIFI network. This might part of the problem. So I call customer service. They confirm that my WIFI is too weak. They suggest moving my router closer which is impractical without running cable all over the house. Then immediately suggest that I buy a Ring Doorbell Pro as it has more powerful WIFI. Fat chance. So, I ordered a WIFI extender that I can plug into the wall directly behind the doorbell. If that doesn't work, It gets shipped back to Amazon.I'm very disappointed that this thing can't pick up a WIFI signal 40 feet away from the router. After all, my Amazon echo dot works just fine standing next to the doorbell. Update: Okay, I rebooted my modem and the doorbell linked through WIFI. I get notifications, and it records video. But when I ask ""Alexa, show me the front door"" it repeats, ""The front door isn't responding. Please check you network connection and your power."" I'll figure this out yet. Why is it so difficult. Update: Third day into the install. I got the WIFI extender installed on the wall in the house directly behind the doorbell. And I got it to install. This time it worked but i couldn't get video on my Alexa Show. 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and after factory resetting the doorbell, uninstalling and re-installing the Ring skill for Alexa, re-installing the doorbell and turning on the live video, we finally got the damn thing to work. Whew. Now, if it only keeps working. I just got a motion alert from my Alexa that my wife went out to her car. I had to ask Alexa to show me the front door. DOn't know why the video doesn't come on automatically. Nothing came up on my phone other than a message. I was under the impression that when a motion alert or dorr bell ring was detected, the video appeared automatically. I'll have to call back about that.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 May 2020,Paul S,"When you buy the Ring Doorbells or Cameras, you are also dealing with the glitchy app.  That is the major drawback for these devices.  I have the Doorbell 2 and 2 cameras.  I had a cheaper brand before and wanted to get something from a major company that I knew I could trust- especially for something like security cameras.  The Doorbell itself is fine. - Video clarity is good.  Not great, but good - Well built - Like that it includes both silver and rubbed bronze covers - Motion detection is good, not great.  Maybe I need to adjust the settings more but I've fiddled with them quite a bit already Again, the major drawback it the app.  Seriously?  The layout is intuitive and easy to use but it is absolutely TERRIBLE at connecting with the Doorbell.  I have super fast fiber optic internet and even with that, it probably takes 30 seconds-1 minute to load live mode on the app.  ????!!!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 May 2019,Cornelius Qualley,"So, I've owned two Ring first generation doorbells and I have the security system as well. I upgraded to the Ring Doorbell 2 when I moved to my new house and really can't say much good about it. I've given it about 5 months with constant adjustment of the settings, ensuring the camera is clean, keeping the battery charged, etc. It's honestly more of an annoyance than a benefit. Here are my pros and cons: Pros: • The Ring Protect plan is a good deal if you use the security system - $10/mo. for unlimited cameras and security monitoring really can't be beat. It's probably the one reason I've kept it this long. • The push notifications are pretty responsive, you get an alert within 5-10 seconds of someone arriving, usually before they get to the door (depending on location of course). • The app interface is pretty good...I don't know, I'm really reaching for a third ""pro"" Con (#1 Worst Issue): • Unable to connect or slow connecting. This is literally the worst thing about this device. I'd say more often than not, I get a notification, click to open the app, and it just spins...and spins...and spins ""trying to connect"". Sometimes it'll connect, sometimes it won't, you just never know. On one occasion, my wife was meeting someone from Craigslist at our house and said they were acting a little weird, so I tried to watch in on the Ring. The first time I opened it up it connected right away in live view, within 1-2 seconds. I tried to switch back to the app after texting her and literally tried to connect to the Ring for 10 STRAIGHT MINUTES and could never connect. Honestly, what's the point of a motion notification if when you click on it it just sits and tries to connect for the next minute. I literally have to wait and watch the recorded event half the time. Cons (Doorbell): • The new removable battery is probably worse than the original design. The cover is so fragile that I broke it the first time removing it to get to the battery. Sure, you could keep two batteries I guess, but who wants to spend an extra $30 just so they can have a spare battery for their doorbell. • The video quality isn't good. By today's standards, the video quality is just bad, especially for a second generation product. I honestly can't see any difference in the quality over the first gen doorbell. • The night vision is bad. I purchased the Ring 2 because they claimed an improved night vision, I'd honestly say it's worse. I have sub $100 security cameras that are FAR superior in night vision and quality. • It's really expensive. I mean, come on, we're talking $200 for a doorbell. The cost of HD video cameras nowadays is next to nothing, the only advantage of the Ring is that it has a button on it and nicer looking software. Cons (iOS App): • Motion detection has a SUPER annoying flaw. Every week or so, my wife and I get CONSTANT notifications (every 5 minutes or so) of motion, forcing us to just turn off the notifications. It eventually starts to work correctly again, but it happens regularly. I've tried adjusting the settings dozens of times (e.g. frequency, distance, zones, etc.), nothing helps. It's honestly so annoying I'd rather not have it. I'll watch the recordings and not a single thing is moving, yet I'll have dozens of recordings (see photo). • Recording is delayed. As has been discussed many times on here, there's a lag before recording start. • The app has an annoying thing where opening the app triggers a motion alert on everyone's device. Open the app = everyone gets a notification. Also super annoying. All in all, would I buy another Ring? No, I would not.","Tried to like it, but it's surprisingly bad"

Its like the people who developed this product were intentionally trying to frustrate their consumers when they designed these damn things. More on why I feel this way below: 1. Connectivity issues, making your purchase useless. If you have a modern wifi gateway with two channels, forget it. Your “first in class” Ring system will disconnect from your long range channel every other day and cease to feed your phone live video or record anything. I’ve modified my gateway settings to dedicate the Ring devices to the long range channel...still disconnects every 2-3 days and I have to reset every one of them. 2. INANE device settings. The Ring app provides device features that allow you to “snooze” the device or disallow light triggers if you are, lets say, trying to enjoy a quiet dinner on your back porch. I’ve tried every configuration to stop the outdoor camera from interrupting dinner with its intense bright light, but no matter what settings I adjust, it STILL illuminates every time a damn shadow passes in front of it. I now take the battery out of the damn thing when we eat on the back porch. Super convenient. Thanks, Ring. 3. Cost-to-value ratio. These are supposed to be premium products. Ring is supposedly the industry leader (not sure why), and they claim to offer a user-friendly product and service, but if you buy this package you are paying for a garbage product from a garbage company. The devices themselves are flimsy plastic pieces of crap and they rarely work. Then they want you to pay an additional subscription fee in order to save your videos? My Ring devices don’t even record anything 80% of the time because they’re disconnected. What videos would I be paying to save? Save yourself a lot of money and frustration. Invest in a wired home security system. I 100% regret purchasing this company’s overvalued junk.",DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. PRODUCT.

I’ve lived in this house for about a month and the battery has died twice. I own two so I can switch them out, but it’s just another thing I didn’t want to have to worry about. Something else I dislike is that it just shows you “motion.” The Nest would differentiate between a person or other motion and it would say “motion at the front door” or “person at the front door” or even “sound at the front door.” You could customize further to have it only notify you when it saw a person, which is all I cared about anyway. The Ring does not differentiate and dies quickly because it notifies of every passing car. The Nest is far superior.

Super simple to use through the app and setup the zones you want it to pickup movement (see pic of UPS truck, My setting only picks up bigger vehicles that drive by as my settings are right at the curb). Also notifies me when someone is near the front door before they even ring (if they do). One door to door knocked on the door and it picked him up while we were taking a drive.

We have seen a small spike in vehicle break ins around the area since the start of the pandemic so that’s what makes me want to get ahead of this. Lastly, the app gives notifications from other Ring users as to what’s happening around us (breaking, suspicious vehicles, etc) so we can be more vigilant. It also allows me to rewind when my boys are fighting in the front yard to see who started the fight and who needs to be yelled at!",Great product that gives me peace of mind and feel in control of my home security

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2020,Patrick Von Maryland,"Before you purchase this ,I recommend taking a Wi-fi connected device outside to check on your signal strength.It is best if you are at full strength,my Ring connected very well but I had full strength.The battery in the unit holds up great.I lose about 1% strength a day so I can go almost 3 months before having to recharge.I had no problems hooking up to my Alexa devices and get motion/bell notifications fairly quickly.The picture is great and the app works very well.The $30 subscriber charge for a year is well worth it.My prior security system was more expensive but had no charge internet support with motion notifications,that is until they updated their systems and stopped supporting the web.So now I have an expensive video recording system that I can’t check on.But Ring is inexpensive to start and the subscription model insurances against just abandoning the product after a few years.Highly recommend this doorbell.",So far a very impressive unit
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Oct 2017,Gregory M. Bruening,Loved the idea of a video doorbell but my outer walls are preventing a full-strength WiFi signal from getting out. I can connect and use my phone on the porch well enough but the Ring is constantly losing/dropping connection which leads to immensely delayed notifications followed by (if I answer the Ring) a .5-1 frame per second view of the person leaving. I'd hope the internal antennae would be a bit strong knowing that these are installed outside where I'm sure a majority of people have weaker WiFi signals but that's not the case. Additionally getting settings to go through has been an immensely frustrating experience. I've yet to successfully change the motion settings despite following every suggestion on their forums. I eventually turned them off as I got tired of cars driving by triggering motion but not USPS carriers on my actual porch. The neighborhood feature is really nice in smaller neighborhoods and with sharing to Nextdoor it can help inform everyone if someones lurking around for packages.,"Fun experiment, probably wouldn't buy again but good app experience and solid feeling hardware"

Their product is more of a 3.5 or so. Definitely has potential, but also seems to have some shortcomings. I’m still happy I purchased it however. Set up is relatively simple. Install went a lot faster and easier than I imagined. This is where one of my issues began. WiFi signal...or lack thereof. It’s pretty bad. Yes I have an older home with brick and stucco and solid walls. But the doorbell is less than 12ft from my router! We have cable WiFi dual band 500mbps the whole works. The Ring has a moderate to decent signal, it was really bad before I relocated the router from 20ft to 12ft. This is a shortcoming of their product. You’ll see numerous reviews online of signal issues. Thankfully mine was resolved relatively easily without needing to buy their WiFi extender etc. The camera is good, but not great. Would really like to see them step it up a notch. Guess we gotta wait for the next version. Night video is ok, it’s what I expected. Motion capture can be a little slow in its capture. Sometimes you won’t even see what caused it to pickup if it went by quickly. Customer service was top notch. I had an issue with a defect on the angle mount plate. They were really nice about the whole thing. I sent a photo and they sent me out a whole new install kit. We’re apologetic and just overall very pleasant. I installed two angle mounts and the tilt mount on mine. Had to make my own screw holes on one of the angle plates. Since it wasn’t meant for so many to stack. But I didn’t want to relocate and re-wire my doorbell and I definitely didn’t want it to run off of battery. Overall I am happy with the purchase. But I’m betting the next gen doorbell will be even better. And most  likely closer to my expectations.",Good customer support. Decent product.

Installation was pretty easy and the night vision works very well. With “live mode” turned off, the battery easily lasts 2-3 months for us since we don’t live in a super busy area. I will say the recording some times has a delayed start and I’m not sure if that’s from the mediocre WiFi connection or a problem with the motion detection itself. We don’t have a huge house but the modem is in the back while the doorbell is out front, so for now we deal with that inadequate connection - not feeling like shelling out another $50 for a “WiFi extender” or what have you.","Very good, despite some connectivity issues"

One plus is that the battery life has been pretty decent for us, but it is an all night or all day event to recharge it. Someone just rang the doorbell but it was not recorded, not even the doorbell button press is showing on the website or the phone app. We pay $3 a month to get access to these doorbell recordings, but the device can't even be counted on to save them.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Dec 2019,MH,"I’ve had this doorbell for over a year now and it gives me a great sense of security knowing I can see who’s at my door even when I’m not home. This doorbell is very easy to install and even comes with an included multifunctional screwdriver. It took me about 5 minutes to install and add the camera to the ring app. Remember to scan the QR code on the back of the doorbell before installing it since it is necessary to activate the doorbell. One downside of this doorbell is that is a bit of a fishbowl view meaning that the footage it takes is round on the edges and distorted slightly. It also takes a while for it to go live depending on your internet connection. I would recommend hardwiring this doorbell if you are installing it in place of an existing doorbell since it will ensure that the doorbell doesn’t run out of battery. The included battery has decent battery life but it certainly could be better. The 1080P resolution is good and makes it very easy to spot disturbances. Unlike most users, motion is detected very quickly for me and it only takes a few seconds to get to live feed. One gripe I have with this doorbell is that no chime is included. I do need to mention that since most people problem will own an echo device to connect to ring, this might not be a problem since you can setup the echo as a chime. This would’ve been five stars if it loaded faster, didn’t have such a distorted view, and came with an included chime since this product is worthless without one. I didn’t have any problems with the chime myself since I received a free echo dot with my purchase but since this was a limited time offer it isn’t always included. I do think this product is worth it but if you have existing doorbell wiring, I would recommend purchasing the ring doorbell pro instead. If you have poor connectivity, I would recommend going with a WiFi access point over their ring chime pro since that device only supports Ring products and transmits 2.4G signal. I am very impressed with the battery life of this video doorbell. 10% of battery has lasted me more than a week and a full charge lasts 2.5-3 months for me even with frequent detected motion.","Good security, wish they included a chime"

Encountered only one snag with the installation, which was not this product's fault, and it was quickly resolved by Ring's technical support.  That technical support service is the best I've ever encountered. Easy to reach on a Saturday afternoon, and they quickly pinpointed the problem (the video would not appear on the smartphone we installed the app on) as a setting on our wireless router that needed to be changed.  Once that was done, everything worked great.  We can see and talk to whoever is at the door from anywhere so long as our phone is connected to the internet.  We can turn on the camera any time and see what's going on by the front door. The motion sensor nicely notices any movement by the front door and turns on the camera and records it.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2020,william juaire,"Update: I have installed my second replacement Ring2 because the first two failed. This one is not working properly so i will probably be replacing this one. Ring product quality control is very, very poor. I would never again purchase a Ring product. I installed a Ring2 on an existing electro-mechanical doorbell system with a 16 vac transformer. It worked great for over 5 weeks, charge level staying between 98% and 100%.  Now the charge goes down 5% per day requiring me to remove the battery pack to charge it. There have been no changes in the ring environment to account for the charge problem. The battery is not being charged internally. Voltage at the transformer is 17.1 volts. Voltage at the Ring2 rear terminals is 17.1 vac. Lack of a voltage drop at the ring terminals means that there is no charge current flowing into the Ring2. The Ring2 is not charging even though there is 17.1 vac at the terminals. I think there must be an internal failure of the charging circuit. I called the Ring help line (800-656-1918 ). They replaced the Ring2. This did not correct the problem.  I even replaced my 16 volt transformer with a 24 volt transformer.  I tested voltage and current at the Ring2 terminals. Voltage is at 24 vac, Current flow at the Ring2 terminals is 9 mA. There are many similar problems posted here on the Ring Forum, A similar post here on the Forum stated that his charging problem occurred after a firmware upgrade. His issue was not temperature related as he lived in Southern Florida. As mine worked great for the first 5 weeks, And now I have the same problem, even with the new Ring2, and nothing in the environment is any different than the first 5 week, I am wondering if this is a firmware problem. Ring is replacing my Ring2 a second time If this is a quality issue, I would suggest other providers as the Ring products may have quality control or firmware issues. My question to Ring technicians:  Do you have a firmware issue causing this problem? That is the reason for the very low overall rating",FAILED AFTER 5 WEEKS

At first I had my motion sensativity way too high with live view enabled and since my front door faces a main street I would get notifications non-stop all day. Since I had the sensativity up too high the battery went from full to 50% in a matter of days. I readjusted the sensativity using the optimized questions within the app and the battery life is way better. Overall I love my ring 2 and love the ease of use of the app and the quality of the picture quality. Also I like that I was able to link the ring to my amazon alexas and since I have multiple alexas around the house it verbally tells me when motion is detected at the font door, i think this is helpful if I am home and dont have my phone right in front of me to check the notification.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2019,Christina M,"I like the Ring doorbell. A lot. I don't love it. The battery sucks unless you don't use it at all, the field of vision is just a tad too narrow due to the restricted activity zones.  The recording zone is a semicircle.  My house faces the street.  It won't allow me to record the side of the yard without also recoding every single car that goes by.  I have it set to a low sensitivity to get about 3 weeks out of the battery (instead of a few days due to high traffic), and because of that it doesn't pick up people walking up to my front door, but still records too many cars.  I would like to buy a second one, and I don't mind paying $30/year, but I don't want to pay that for multiple devices.  I will definitely be looking into different brands for additional coverage in the Ring's unfortunate blind spots.  If you don't have the street or can hardwire it immediately  (I have to hire someone to run some line), it can be a 5.  For a busy inner city location only on battery, it is going to be 3 or 4 depending on your distance from the street.  Also, the doorbell is slow to load on my phone, and the sound cuts out, but that could be due to a variety of other factors (wifi strength, phone battery, etc).

Of course, you have to wait for the event to pass completely before rewatching and see what the cam even caught. There is another caveat as well; should you want to KEEP any recordings, you have to pay for the Ring service.

At least provide a self-storing option in the form of some kind of SD card or data wiring into an in home storage unit.

We live on a cul-de-sac, and our front porch is approximately 50 ft from the street leading into our circle.  I am constantly getting alerts for cars entering and leaving via that street, despite repeated attempts to adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection to reduce the distant of motion detection.  I've found one setting that solved the car issue - setting it to the minimum.  Problem with that is it then detects NOTHING - I walked right up on my porch and stood inches from the Ring, and it didn't alert or detect.  Fantastic.  Using the automated settings haven't worked, either. The other issues I've noticed is that we have a covered porch, and on a sunny day if someone steps onto the porch, they are just a dark outline due to the brightness of the background.

So after playing around, I was on mobile for a few days, and watched the events come through.  I hired and fired someone who plainly wasn't there, when the camera detected that there were presence.  So I recorded another person that was invited by this person but I wasn't told about.  And then just not even there.  So at first I was frustrated because I had paid for someone to be the hand from the camera, and had no reach myself.  But then I have the photos.  I showed the photos, and fired.  I showed the photos and got answers that I needed.  So it definitely increases credibility. I also saw things that people don't think you'll know about even though they are on camera.  So that was great and goes a long way. Well at some point the fun is over and its on the wifi right?  Freeze yes, plus I have no neighbors, it asks for my address.  Except ours is a rural location, so we don't have physical addresses.  And it did let me apply it although it didn't want to accept it.  And I wanted to post to the neighborhood that I had one, and is anyone out there, won't let me.  I have to be committing a crime to post so my neighbors can respond.  So its a little non relevant for our area, as we communicate very well with each other, but it would be nice to branch to a dedicated area for just security issues. Now for the downloading it says you can do it, but its definitely in the app itself.  Not the browser not the mobile.  Never did I see anyone address this issue.  So now I know, BUT THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO DOWNLOAD MULTIPLE FILES AT ONCE.  You have to download each event, each and every event, as a separate action, wait for the one file to download, and then delete it.  And if you try and preview first, you get a spinning ball in an area like ours. So there's an option to Star?  But I'd have to review everything.  Its that limit your wifi, and then everything works only on unlimited wifi, that I'm sure there's a man in a grey suit, in a business office closet laughing hysterically about making money off of this internet fraud, like the TV fraud.  Oh no commercials and then there are commercials. This is one place where there's no commercials.  But I have to sit with the app open all day just to get the relevant files to view.  I mean really, can't they dedicate a place on the drive for it to DVR to?  I'd pay for that. I did actually.  200$ plus accessories. But what I didn't expect is while previewing, downloading and saving to disk those files, it eats the battery all the way down to nothing.  Why?  Because its storing the video on the camera?  I see, that is pretty messed up.  So the file is actually on my camera, and to access it, I have to go through you, to get to my camera, to get it up to your site, and then back to mine, and then again and again, and you are hogging all this useless internet that we don't have, those of us who are not in commercial areas where wifi is actually provided to customers who pay for it. That's what they think of us, fools.","Rural Area Low WiFi and works, but...."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2019,Faye Mobilia,"I've had the Ring Doorbell installed for a week now and I can say that it performs as well as the adds say it does.  The images are clear.  The night images are also good.  The doorbell assembly is easy to assemble and set up. The only negative I have is that the sound is not as good as I would like.  I don't know if it's the fault of the product or of my wifi.  I purchased a wifi boaster to install near the doorbell hoping that this will resolve the problem. The product is made well and seems to be very durable. It includes excellent assembly and set-up instructions.  I'm please to have this as another security system option for my home. UPDATE; It's now winter ( I live in northern Minnesota) and the Ring Doorbell is useless.  As soon as the temperatures dropped below zero the doorbell quits working.  I would take the battery out and warm it up but that would only be good for a couple of hours before it would go out again/.  If you live in an area where sub-below temperatures are common, be aware that your doorbell camera will stop working.  Something Ring should disclose right on the box.  I would change my rating from five stars to two stars because of this.",Quality Product -But cold weather is a factor
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jul 2019,A. Rizo,"So good we've purchased a second one. We love our ring camera and it's already paid for itself by keeping someone from taking a $300 bumper cover package off our porch. The motion detection is great, albeit sometimes flawed. Sometimes it will not detect the motion until the person is so close to the camera so some of the action isn't recorded. However, most of the time it's pretty good. The delay to go to the live view on my phone's app is virtually non-existent, which is a MAJOR problem with my ARLO cameras (so much so that I am getting rid of them). The app is also pretty user friendly, which is a plus. Oh! And the ability to share videos with your neighborhood and areas nearby is fantastic.",Get one. Now.

Update: These are awful. Watch the attached video. The post lady got to drop 3 packages, and the camera only captured her when she pressed the ring button. So she had to come and go 3 times for 3 large packages and the camera didn’t catch that. She rang the bell and the doorbell chimed 1 minute after she was gone. These are awful doorbell. No reliability. My home internet speed is 80Mbps and all ring does is they blame the internet. I have a ring doorbell at my shop in a nearby city. We have a 100Mbps service there. The same exact problem. Update: These are awful. Even with a paid membership, it only records 30s. We hust had two packages stolen and the video stopped just before the guy comes. Thieves know this. They walk closeby to trigger the recording, and when it gets close to 30s, they come knowing that it will stop recording at 30s. So when they are just by the door, there will be no recording. Update: We measure an often upward delay of 10 minutes between the ringings and the app notifying us at two locations (at least once a week) One location has an internet speed of 100 Mpbs and the other has 80 Mbps. Update: We have two of these. They have no “communication” functionality as no one can her what I say on the app. I can hear them but the sound quality on the doorbell is so bad that no one can hear anything. Also, even with my 100 Mbps connection, it takes 1 minute for it to connect. I have several 4k cameras that connect instantly. But this device is very very slow. Original: This has many issues. First, the video is 720p not 1080p. I have several cameras including 4k cameras and this is not full HD. I have issues with its privacy.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2020,J. King,"I owned the first generation Ring doorbell for years and decided it was time to upgrade. Because of how our doorbell is wired, I decided to purchase a Ring 2 because it claims to have up to a 6 month battery life and I can't wire it into my doorbell based on where the wiring is located. The installation was easy. We installed it onto the old bracket that was already there for the original Ring. We charged the battery, and set up everything correctly. It was working fine, but the battery died after about three weeks. This kept happening, so after a few months I contacted customer support and told them that our battery life was nowhere near the six month range. Customer support was very helpful and said that our wifi signal was not very strong so they would send us a free chime pro to help boost the signal. This should have boosted the signal so the battery ran longer. We installed the chime pro and made sure our doorbell was using it, then waited. The battery life actually went down. It started needing to be charged every two weeks. As my life was very busy at the time, a few months passed before it was so annoying I contacted customer support again, and they said the doorbell was not actually connected to the chime pro. I figured this was user error, but we had a huge blackout a few weeks earlier, so I figured this was user error on my part and customer support showed me again how to hook the doorbell up to the chime pro. They also sent me an email from someone above the first tier of customer support who I should contact in case there was an issue again. Well... cleaning out my email at the end of the year I deleted that email by accident. The battery life continued to degrade. So I tried contacting customer support again, who quite flatly replied the doorbell was out of warranty and the best they could do was offer me a discount on a new doorbell. I said that I had been sent an email from someone who wanted me to contact them about the battery life, and he said he had no record of that and all he would do is give me a discount on a new doorbell. I was very discouraged. So rather than throw away everything I bought a new battery and am waiting to see if it will do any better. I'm not sure if they strung me along long enough for the doorbell to be out of warranty, but based on the email from the higher level of support I would say this is a common issue. However, after reading lots of Amazon reviews, it sounds like three weeks is about what most people get out of the supposed ""six month battery life"". Also - the motion detection only picks up people as they are leaving even on the highest settings, so the most I ever see is someone's back. If you choose to purchase one of these make sure you buy two batteries at least, the six month thing is a fabrication.",Terrible Battery Life

The problem with Amazon Show is that once someone walks up my walkway the Ring Doorbell camera sets of an alert. I walk over to my Show and say ‘Alexa show me the front door’ I then see a spinning symbol indicating that the link is being established. Meanwhile, when the person at the door actually pushes the button to ring the bell. no screen view of who is at the door has appeared. I have to let them wait a good 2 minutes before I see a live view of who is at the door. Meanwhile, the person can see my car in the driveway and hear my dogs barking incessantly. However still no video. I end up answering the door anyway rather than keep them waiting not knowing if its the mailman or some door to door solicitor. Ideally,  Ring (who is owned by Amazon now) should have the ""Alexa Skil for Ring""l initiate the video live view link as soon as the camera sees a person in the field of view.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2019,Weston,"Just as described and pictured. Easy install. Customer support was fantastic. Heads up, if you have a wired doorbell, the battery needed for the doorbell needs to be charged first and then installed. Yes you need a battery even with wired setup, however that's the end of it. the motion and sounds of doorbell run off of battery only, NOT your phones power, BUT the battery trickle charges off of your wires n the interim between actual uses. I've had it up for a month now and the (easy to use) app always shows full power. It records great, app is great, and setup was easy and simple. ONE CON... the speaker (for communication to guests at the bell) is severely disappointing. It is low quality and regardless of volume spoken through the phone, sounds crackling and distorted. You cannot clearly hear from the doorbell side.","Pretty satisfied. Though for the price, I expected more from the sound quality."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Apr 2019,Tim,"Had this camera for almost a year now and I would not buy it again. The motion isn't too bad, though sometimes misses people coming up to the door when they don't ring, such as a courier delivering a package and just dropping it off.  It almost never gets people walking on the sidewalk in front of the house, which is about 15 feet away. I played around with the motion settings all I can, including the new motion wizard, but can't improve the results. It doesn't always pick up people on the doorstep and 15 or so feet away, but seem to get just about every car 30 or so feet away. In addition, it commonly just stops being available at random. I will see that it hasn't detected any motion for several hours, even though it normally picks up just about every car that passes. Before (from when I checked and is reported in the device help, which hasn't been updated for several hours) and after it stops responding, the battery is always around 98-100% (it's hardwired) and the WiFi signal is around -45 - -50. Sometimes going to the device and pressing the ring will back it come back and sometimes you just have to wait and it will come back after a few hours more, usually sometime overnight. Happens during the summer, fall, winter, and spring. Hot or cold or just right. In addition to it not responding, it will sometimes just pull up a black screen when you go to live view. This includes when I have heard the doorbell go off in the house, but didn't receive a ""ring"" notification on any of my devices. I pull up the live view and just get a black screen with no audio. I have also noted that there hadn't been any recent motion events, so I suspect that it is not responding again. Both issues happen with the Android, iOS and Windows store app (3 different devices). Finally, the cloud service. It actually is fairly decent and the app for Android and iOS are pretty good. I do wish you could set for the events for record longer, specifically ring events. If the device is hardwired, this shouldn't be a problem. I do like the neighborhood feature to be able to see other issues around. I don't like the new feed for motion and ring events, but that is more of a personal preference. The device health does provide good information about the device, including battery, WiFi strength firmware status, and MAC address, though not IP address. I would like to be able to connect directly to the device instead of only through Ring's cloud based service. All in all, I would look around for something a bit cheaper as I feel with the issues and features, this is overpriced.",Not that great for the price

One significant downside: There is no local access to the video stream, ring events or anything else.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 May 2019,JLovesBooks,"UPDATE 6/8/19: Customer service is terrible and now notifications are 2 minutes delayed. In the last few days the notifications have gone from being just a few seconds delayed to coming a full 2 MINUTES after motion is detected. I'm now getting notifications that I'm walking down the steps when I'm already a mile down the road in the car. I'm not sure what changed, but the home screen looks different now in the app as of a few days ago and I'm guessing an update has caused this issue. Customer service is also terrible. For a while there they were really nice and when I was just a week away from returning the item (within 30 days), they offered me 6 months of service for free while we wait on the Android fix (since there is no two-way communication on Android phones). Well, I replied back, said I accepted and then didn't hear anything. So when all my videos disappeared and my trial expired, I emailed Nicole (the local rep) back and asked what the hold up was with honoring the offer when I gave them a full week to update the account (I ended up paying for service out of pocket). I received a reply from someone who was handling things while Nicole was out of office and this person also offered the same thing and said I had to reply back to accept or they'd help process a return as a last resort. Well, it's now been weeks since that initial email came and even though I've replied at least 4 times (even offering to send a message to them via a Raven since email obviously isn't working), I've yet to hear anything back from either Nicole or her stand-in while she was out. So I'm guessing they really make all these empty promises to get you to not return the device during the return period and then when you think they'll honor their offer, they go radio silent and all of a sudden apparently forget how to check email. We're now looking at our other options for devices and should have just gone with another company to begin with. The idea of a video doorbell is nice, but I'm finding the Ring video doorbell execution is terrible. ORIGINAL REVIEW: There is currently only one-way communication right out of the box if you're using Android (works fine on iOS, but for my Samsung Galaxy S9+, they can't hear me, but I can hear them). I was told 3 weeks ago that they were aware and can usually fix these things quickly (Maury has determined that is a lie). Today I was told there's still no fix. Ours also doesn't pick up motion until someone is standing at the doorbell. We now have 3 mounting plates to fix the motion detection issues at their insistence and it's still not working any better. I mean it's either get every car passing on the road 30 ft away or get someone when they're already ringing the bell. There is no in between. It's missed picking up 3 deliveries to our porch so far. Even if the person tossed the packages, they should still be in the zones. There's just a 3-5 second delay in the notifications, which is nice, but it does take the history a good minute to update, which sucks if you missed the notification. I'm super frustrated. Support tries to help, but it just seems the problems are both with the Android app and the hardware itself. I now have 10 more days to decide if I want to return...","Android only has one way communication, only picks up motion when right in front of doorbell"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jun 2019,RBrylawski,"I finally got the Ring for my home.  This is the Ring Video Doorbell 2.  It offers 1080P HD Video with Live View, Motion Activated Alerts, Two Way Talk and it also integrates easily with Alexa.  It comes packaged very nicely and includes every single thing you could need to install it, including a level, two plates to choose from for angle, and two face plates to better compliment your house color. I chose to install this in place of my home doorbell, and if connected to the same wiring (two simple wires, unless your doorbell is digital, which mine wasn't) the battery will constantly be charged.  Otherwise, you can install it anywhere, but if you install it unwired, you will need to remove the rechargeable battery periodically to charge it.  Ring recommends charging the battery before you do anything with the doorbell.  It can take anywhere from 5 - 10 hours.  Mine took a full 6 hours to become fully charged.  And it charges via a simple Micro-USB, plugged into a charging brick like a cell phone brick. Installation was very easy.  I have a stucco block home, living in Florida, and the thoughtful folks at Ring even included a masonry bit in the box.  I do recommend doing the setup before you permanently install the Ring.  Just download the Ring App to your smartphone, use the QR code on the back of the Ring to scan your specific device and follow the steps to connect to your network and get everything set up to your needs.  It takes literally a couple minutes to set up and configure the Ring. Included with your purchase is a free 30 day trial of Ring Protect Plus.  After that ends, you can choose no plan (and get no recorded videos if you're violated - so, not good TBH) or a simpler plan for $3/month (actually, they offer a full year of this plan for $30) or the full Protect Plus for $10/month.  For $30/year, buying the Video Recording and sharing to me seemed a no brainer.  I've read many review here where people seem a bit angry they don't get video recording for free.  I didn't expect this and have no problem paying a bit more for the comfort in knowing should someone try to intrude, they will be recorded and the recording will be accessible via the app to provide to the authorities.  Honestly, I spend more at Starbucks every month.  I bet many of you do as well. Overall, I'm really impressed with the Ring Doorbell 2.  I was at the grocery store this afternoon when my ring app alerted me to someone unfamiliar to me at my front door.  It was fantastic being able to ask who they were and why they were there.  Anyone who values safety, should seriously consider getting something like the Ring.  I chose the RIng because I'm invested in the Amazon Alexa eco-system.

Motion detection works great, and the quality of daylight images are pretty good.  You can see faces really well when people are ringing your doorbell. The camera has a wide-angle, fish-eye lense.  So it can capture wide area.  Wide angle isn’t really needed with the design of my house, but it might be a bigger deal for you. The battery has been lasting about 4 weeks for me, but I bet it will last a shorter period if you have a lot of stuff going on in front of your house.  I'd still recommend picking up a 2nd battery, so you always can be charging one, while you're using the other.",Works great.  Nice Upgrade.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2018,R Warrier,"I recently installed a Ring door bell. This helps me keep an eye on the entry way. It gets triggered when a packet is (Amazon shipment!!) left outside the door etc. For a product this good it seems flimsy and fragile. May be it is because of the thin plastic cover over the batter.  I wish it were more sturdy even though no harm has happened so far. I am someone used to the quality of Apple products and Nest thermostat etc. Sorry for this small gripe! Update Jan 25 2019 I have had this product for several weeks by now. The product appears to fit m requirement. In fact I am considering installing another ring (2 or higher) in another of my residences. I become a snow bird and go to Florida when the weather turns cold.  I have not yet subscribed to the monthly service. I am not even sure I am missing something so far except for the fact that I don't seem to get the ring tone on my phone. I do seem to get notification on my Apple Watch. Does the ring tone on the phone cease after the promotional period? I suspect it does. I purchased a power adapter which keeps the battery charged.  Since I installed this in a high rise building this was quite a challenge. I am glad it became a successful project. To any one contemplating purchasing Ring door bell 2  I strongly recommend the power adapter. The one I purchased was specially marketed for Ring. I suspect any 12 to 24 volt charger will do, but the one I bought came with a 25' power cord. I used a higher gauge bell wire from Lowes since I was a little worried about the thin gauge of the wire that came with the power adapter. I installed a Ring Chime also since there was no doorbell in this condo. Overall I am a satisfied customer.",For a product this good it appears flimsy
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2020,Southern Made Designs,"Ring doorbell 2 is using subpar technology on its camera vision. It is only good for short range detection right in front of it. It should also be able to draw the detection zone like the pro, that would solve the range issue at daytime. The night vision is beyond horrible. ONLY good at less than 10 ft  to see a face. To me that is almost useless as a night vision. I would not recommend ring doorbell 2 due to horrible night vision and horrible zone distance feature. Game cameras are wayyy better at night and day vision. Ring should use game cameras vision technology for day and night vision. I called and they told me to see better, get more lights further out. Uhh no. Don’t need to in pitch black with a game camera. Battery life is a complete lie!!! Mine only lasted 1 month and 10 days before it said to charge at 6%. 6 months to a year is BS! Also it told me to charge after the fact it wouldn’t let me see live view anymore to see anyone is currently at door. Should not tell you at 6%. Should tell you at 10% or greater. They should send 2 batteries if they are going to lie about battery life. I would be satisfied having a backup on hand. With all that said, It is called a ring camera and it does a good job seeing people at my front door. That is main purpose, however it would be nice to see people trying to walk on the side of my house at night. Impossible with this camera technology. Ring, Please upgrade camera technology night vision distance quality and update to everyone stuck with it currently and change detection to draw zone feature like pro. Thanks!",Horrible night vision/battery life but works good enough to not return...yet.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2018,Lamarsh,"This doorbell was easy to install.  Ring made that very intuitive and simple.  I have also enjoyed the app for the most part.  It's intuitive and user friendly, and the ways it interfaces with the doorbell hardware is solid and offers tons of different configurations and settings that allow you to really customize the doorbell to fit your needs. But it's wireless connection is horrible.  Ring cleverly notes that the doorbell may not work as designed unless it has a strong wireless signal.  My wireless signal is very strong, my wireless router is about 12 feet from the doorbell and only separated by one wall (the actual door it services).  Nonetheless, I get very poor reception and video on my Ring.  My Arlo Pro 2s are about 5x farther away in my BACKYARD, and have 3 walls between them and my wireless router, but they still work way better than my Ring doorbell.  When we wish to view who is at our door, it is so slow to connect we can rarely get it on in time.  The videos it does record almost never are without freezing frames and HUGE holes in the clips. I've had it up for about 2 weeks now, and the battery is already down to 70%.  At that rate, I'll be having to recharge this thing about every other month.  And I have it set on very strict motion settings, and only record about 3-6 videos per day. The fact that you have to buy a stupid doorbell ringer to plug in is just stupid.  I have a Ring alarm, which has a very loud speaker on the base station.  It's mind numbing to wonder why Ring won't let me tie the darn doorbell into the Ring base station. I have a week or so to decide, but I am leaning towards sending this back!  Really want it to work though!","Very imperfect, slow"

It DOES NOT.  Don't listen to other reviews that say it does.  You have to subscribe for it to work.  It does an okay job with the subscription, however, when I had to change the batteries, it stopped working as efficiently and catches very little unless someone is right at my door.  The wifi signal is week despite nothing being in the way and a Chime to extend my modem even though the modem is not very far away.  It was also not easy to install.  When someone comes to my door, they are usually gone by the time my phone lets me know, so I have not been able to talk to them through the speaker or answer my door that way at all.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Aug 2019,Average Guy,"This is not a good product if you have a moderately deep porch with a bright background. Back-lighting issues are so bad you cannot make out the faces of people you know let alone those you don't. I bought the whole Ring system including home alarm system and this is the weak link. Our walkway is about 50-feet long. The camera doesn't start recording until the person (usually a delivery person) is on the porch and nothing more than a silhouette. And yet, at other times it triggers when a car drives by. Go figure. If you have a shallow porch and no overhang, it would probably work just fine. THE RING FOLKS KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE AND HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. There are reviews all over the net with replies from Ring employees with responses like ""We'll have a fix shortly."" and ""We're working on it."" and ""Send us a video so we know what you're talking about.""

I gave it 3 stars cause it is great idea. Was also easy to install but the lag makes it useless.  Now if someone rings the doorbell and stands there then it’s ok. But if its amazon or UPS delivering where they ring and run then it’s if no use.  The video recording is delayed about 5 seconds so by the time they drop the package on your doorstep and your notified they are gone so you don’t see them.  The night vision works fine and the video quality is perfect.  I have a great Wifi connection so no issues there.

Our house is 24 years old, so not sure what I would face in hardwiring, but it was easy.  The install amounted to drilling four holes with anchors in the ubiquitous Phoenix-area stucco surface, and connecting the two wires used for the existing standard doorbell.  20 minutes later - voila! Great images of the front, and working well in the phone app.  I had to tweak the movement alert settings to tone down some front yard plant movement, but it's working great now.

I haven't wanted to spend the money to install a fancy system or pay monthly monitoring fees.  Even spending the $200 for this Ring bell hurt some, but I am so glad I did. I feel so much more safe in my home with this! I also felt it was worth spending a little more on the Ring that you can hardwire where your existing doorbell is vs. using using the battery (do that if you can). It doesn't mater where I am, I get a ""ring"" on my phone (can choose from many sounds) and a banner notification that tells me when someone is near or on my front porch or rings the doorbell. I can open the app and immediately see who is there, even talk to them.  There are numerous ways to set up the Ring, including the distance you want the movement monitoring to work. You can easily turn the notifications on and off if you are expecting a lot of activity out front. You can easily share photos and video captured from your Ring if there is suspicious activity you want to alert others too, even share with the police if ever needed.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,AmazonCustomer,"Installation was so easy, I even hard wired it. As a result, my regular doorbell chime works and the battery is being charged. It even came with an extra bronze faceplate that matches the door handle.  Now about the bads: Ring app has a way to adjust the areas of motion sensing but I can not completely hand-select the areas, it is just the blue curved area that moves up and down.  In addition to this, the light poles from far away cause glares (or halos), i think it is because of the protective layer over the lense.  Other than that, I think it is doing the work. press the button, the bell chimes, phone rings, etc. And, when I open the ring up, curiously trying to see who is at the door or the reason of the motion sensor, the app loads and loads and loads. Then the live video shows up: the delivery man is getting back on his truck and etc.  which I miss the main thing, because, the delayed app load.  Then I try to see the recorder video, and it is unavailable, it says 'processing'. It takes another couple of hours.  Great product, great ideas, improved safety etc. but ring needs a better server, for faster app execusion and user interaction with the app, may be these could be fixed with an easy firmware update.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Apr 2018,William,"I am overall very disappointed with my Ring 2.  I have 3 big issues with it. 1.  The wifi receiver is extremely weak.  The Ring 2 is 12 feet from my router and the connection is weak.  However, my cell phone shows full bars in the same location and speed tests to 80-100mbs. 2.  The motion detection is extremely spotty and intermittent.  Because I live in the city, I have it set a at the lowest sensitivity (5 ft).  However, it will pickup cars driving by at 15-20 feet away, while not engaging and showing me walk past it and into my door.  If someone can walk up to this, stand in front of it for 20 seconds opening the door, and walk in the house - and it records nothing - what good is it! UPDATE:  I CAN COME AND GO FROM MY HOUSE, WALKING RIGHT PAST THE RING DOORBELL AND AT LEAST 50% OF THE TIME IT RECORDS NOTHING!  CHANGED TO 1 STAR. 3.  When a delivery person comes and stands in front of my door, the device will often record for only 30 seconds.  So even though there is still someone standing in front of it, swaying back and forth, it stops recording.  Not a big deal when its only a delivery person, but what if this was someone waiting to see if anyone answers before breaking in?  It would have stopped recording before catching them in the act!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Feb 2019,Raul E. Zayas,"For this review I have to make two distinctions. One is the Ring video Doorbell 2 and the other, the battery operated, Wi-Fi camera. If the doorbell is hardwired, you should not have any problems with signal strength even if there are many Wi-Fi signals in your area. My doorbell 2 is hardwired and is working perfectly well. Now the camera is a whole different story. When I purchased my camera directly from Ring, nobody told me about potential interference problems if there were many Wi-Fi signals in my area. The camera needs a certain amount of download and upload speeds to be able to operate correctly. You also need to have a minimum RSSI number for your camera to work correctly. If you live in an area that is ""infested"" with other Wi-Fi users so I had a lot of problems getting my camera to work correctly because it was competing with the signal of other users in the area to work correctly. My dowload/upload speeds were very low so the camera did not work at all. The excuse Ring Support technicians always gave was the interference from other users. I purchased a Wi-Fi extender. Do not even bother to buy the Chime Pro from Ring. It is good for nothing! I ended up buying a Linksys Wi-Fi extender but that barely helped. I called Ring Support again. Now the problem was not the signal strength but the distance of the camera from the router! I got sick and tired of Ring Support and called an IT friend of mine and we installed a Mesh Point. Now I have more than enough signal strength and my cameras are operating OK. All of this after HUNDREDS of dollars spent buying additional equipment. I could go on and on but we'll leave it there. Before you buy the Wi-Fi camera, please run speed tests in your area. I would suggest getting a professional to do all the work. In total, I spent OVER $700.00 in labor, two technicians and extra equipment to get the darn (that is not the word I wanted to use), camera to work but I got that camera to work!",Watch out with the battery operated Wi-Fi!!!

Which I then had to visually check using my mobile data up! Only to discover there was nothing there. I'm talking every few minutes it would record and have to be checked! I could use live feed fairly quickly to see alerts as they happened if I wasn't busy.  Once the free period was over, you can no longer see any alert footage after the fact.

The motion detector is overly sensitive in that I was initially getting lots of false positives. Following the instructions to desensitize the motion detector toward street traffic was helpful, but I still get several false positives a day. Some may be related to a small shrub near the porch that can move with the wind, but not all of them. If you have shrubs, tree branches, or vehicle traffic outside your door, be prepared. I was not aware when I purchased this that in order to record video you must have at least a minimum contract with Ring to store video on the cloud. Video is NOT stored locally on the device or on your phone, nor can it be stored to a cloud account you may already have.

I feel Ring has been “the name” in video doorbell.  They were one of the first companies and it feels like anyone I know who has a video doorbell, has a Ring. Here is why I am not as pleased.  First, the night vision is beyond horrible and it’s nearly useless.  The video quality at night is so horrible, I cannot make out any features.  Everything is a blur even with my front porch light on and landscaping lights.  Second, the motion sensor zone is limited to your front yard and any wall, column, tree, or bush.  Since I have 2 columns on each side of my door, the motion sensor does not pick up until someone appears right in front of the camera (or center-most motion sensor).  Therefore, I normally only see people as they are leaving and not coming.  Based on some of the neighborhood watch videos, I think package thieves know the limitations of the motion sensors and are getting away without their face being shown.  I am disappointed.

Ring has updated their software a few times since I bought my unit last year, and for a few months last winter, the motion detection worked perfectly.  However, starting this spring, it went back to being terrible.  It is an unfortunate result of buying hardware that depends on cloud software, because even if something works when you buy it, it can easily stop working months later when you are out of the return window due to a cloud-side software change.  I have still kept the device, because any camera is a crime deterrent, and because I like the live view.  Sometimes you hear a loud noise outside at night, and it lets you check what is going on without calling attention to yourself by opening your door or curtains.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2019,Lauren T,"This is a great video doorbell system.  Don't listen to the people complaining about subscription costs, those people are just morons.  You can use this doorbell with out a subscription.  The subscription is only needed if you want to record your videos, so if something is stolen off of your porch you have a video of it to show the cops and your neighbors.  To just use this as a normal video doorbell with live feed capabilities only you do not need a subscription... but if something comes up missing... well you are just out of luck.  I personally, will pay $30 for the yearly subscription fee for this, as I think it is a wonderful deal. The video feed is very clear, even at night when there isn't the best of light.  Audio could be better, but it isn't horrible.",Great Doorbell with OR without the extra recording subscription
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Aug 2019,Dena C.,"I upgraded from another brand of smart doorbell because I had heard of so many people using it, because I expected more features for the price, and because we could watch on my echo. First of all, it is a massive doorbell. It came with angles mounting brackets which I tried, but will probably remove because I don't think they help minimize false detection. I liked the features to set zones and I think it may work sightly better than my old one. The picture and sound quality are good. I have yet to be near the echo when the doorbell rings so I don't know how useful that ended up being. While I like all the things it is, I am disappointed that the only way to save video is by paying a monthly fee for use. Otherwise you only get live views. Other brands I have had allowed me to save video on my phone at no charge. I might buy it but I would find it reasonable to pay for actual monitoring, not to save video on my own device. Overall I like the doorbell but may not have upgraded if I had understood the pricing plan. It did not occur to me to research that part. No money lost, but no saved images either.",Almost a great upgrade

The camera is fantastic, day or night, and provides a clear view of anyone near your door. The microphone picks up sound extremely well, allowing for clear conversions between you and anyone at the door. Motion alerts work well and are easily adjusted to fine tune the unit to your particular needs. Two issues why I gave the product 4 instead of 5 stars. #1 - There is a significant time lag between the time the doorbell button is pushed & notification on your phone. Often, by the time you actually get the video up & are ready to talk, the person has already left or you catch their backside as they are walking away. #2 - long term durability. This purchase was made to replace a 2 year old model #1 that just stopped working. I am hopeful this unit, which appears to be better made, will last longer.

But the it was too good a deal to pass up on Prime Day! I have absolutely no complaints about this device.  Easy enough to install, but the provided drill bit is woefully inept at penetrating brick.  Nearly destroyed one drill and needed my neighbor to help me with both of us pushing on his drill! I'm sure it's easier on non-brick surfaces, but this thing was a bear to install by drilling holes into the brick where the doorbell was. Aside from that, setup in the app was a breeze and - drum roll please - WiFi works as advertised.  Signal is strong and I've had no issues whatsoever in getting real-time alerts.  Both the motion sensor and doorbell alerts pop up on my phone immediately - missing events is a non-issue for me.  Now, I'm going to chalk this up to having a mesh network in my house, giving the device a great WiFi connection via 2 APs that are within 20 feet of it.

It took to long to show a live feed whenever I received a notification about motion so I would miss it. Then to go back and review the saved footage took an extra minute or two for me to even be able to access that clip. Next thing which was a deal breaker for me was the motion detection. In order to not get notified about every car that passed, I had to have the zone so low that it only started recording when someone was actually on my porch often missing the whole thing so I can't see their face. If someone would have ran up and stole a package, it wouldn't have caught their face just then running away. Ended up returning it and spending a little more on the nest hello. That one is better in every aspect.

I set my range, set it to recognize people (so no unwanted extra footage of cats and squirrels).  So I get cars DRIVING by my house, BUT it does NOT even record me pulling up to my curb (technically closer to the house than the car driving by), records NONE of my movement toward the house until I’m physically stepping into my door.  So visitors can park and walk all the way to my door, nothing records until they are AT my door after they knock and are standing for a bit.  But had they simply driven by, I’d have all that footage.  I turned off all those SMART features and still gets cars going by, but nothing of a person coming all the way up to my house from a car that moved in front of my house to park.  WHY???  I’m shopping other options.  I had a gentleman walk all the way up today to try my doorknob, the recording I got was him for a split second then turning to walk away.  The footage was not good enough to even see his face.

I know, this price is off limits most of the times so paying more does not make sense in my opinion...Main reason: motion detection. Why can it detect cars moving more than 60’ away but not detect a person until it is 5 feet from the door? 2 weeks I played with the motion sensor settings to give up after realizing that I cannot set it up to my liking. My Ring is hardwired and it seems that I will never have a battery issue since the battery stayed charged fully since first use. No issues with the WiFi connection as I have seen in other reviews and the distance to the router is about 20 to 30 ft. Pretty fast when it comes to seeing who’s at the door in Live mode. I like that it saves all the events and you can always go back and see what happened. The yearly subscription is not too bad either for $30.

I purchased this to see people entering my property and for the security of my packages. I have three steps leading up to my door and about a 15 foot walkway to the street. I positioned the camera 3.5 feet from the floor of the top step by my door. I have played with every sensitivity level including the highest one. I followed the setup for steps and changed distance from the roadway multiple times to try and ""adjust"". However this camera has a terrible range for downward motion. Packages delivered aren't even picked up by this camera unless the guy walks up to the second of third top step and proceeds to drop which none ever do. Essentially this camera is useless for my needs. Per my testing I can wall up my entire path, across my lawn or even to my side driveway and mailbox without ever being detected, what a freaking joke.

BTW the camera is about 6 ft  away from the wireless access point. Bought the chime pro to see if it would help which did nothing more than produce an audible chime in the house.  This does help to know if someone is ringing the doorbell because I would never know from the phone alerts.

As often it feels like the individual customer isn't important to these giant companies, I found that touching. Also, a word of advice.

This really does render the device to be no more than an over priced camera. 3. Forget it.. there really are too many points I could list. Look, I understand if you want to charge folks a monthly fee for certain services such as the Ring Neighborhood, but there should be an option to save to a local network. I do feel it's ok to offer, and charge people to save to Rings cloud.

Bastug,"I originally got the Ring Pro as a gift, but found out after installation my existing doorbell transformer wasn't putting out enough voltage.  No big deal to replace it, if I knew where it was. Looked everywhere.  Builders put them wherever they feel like, and I couldn't find mine.  Did some research and saw that the Ring 2 only needs 8v minimum, not 16v like the Pro because it has a built in battery that apparently trickle charges.  Installation was a breeze.  No wiring changes needed at the doorbell chime like the Pro, just hook it up to existing doorbell wiring by my front door.  They give everything needed, including small wire extensions with wire lugs to connect to doorbell wires, as well as a screwdriver.  I also like the angled bracket that was included. I did have an issue at first with my Netgear Orbi mesh wifi network.  When first installed it connected to my wifi, but didn't stay so when I checked the live view there was no connection.  A simple reboot of my Orbi router and I saw that the Ring was now listed as something on my network and it has worked since.  I might get another for my side door just because it was so easy to install plus I like the ability to do a live look remotely.","Easy install, so far works well."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Feb 2019,Whitekn3,"I am updating this after a year of use.  I consider it pretty much worthless for security.  The motion detector is the worst I have ever encountered. I have tried different settings over the past year and none have even been close to satisfactory.  I do not know how much real motion is missed, but comparing to two other security cameras on the site, it seems like a lot.  I would say over 90% of the events are false alarms. i.e. a bug flying 30 feet away that can't be seen. I have the Ring Video Doorbell 2 for about 2 months, and like other reviewers I have found that it is ""ok"", but you can't rely on it to catch all the activity at the door where you mount it. Unlike the other security cameras I have, there is no way to make this capture anything before the trigger.  Thus, action that trigger ring may be gone before it starts recording, like a fast walking delivery man.  I realize the trade off would be shorter battery life for some, but I am powering mine via the old doorbell transformer.)  Plus, some events never trigger at all, for no obvious reason.  Based on the number of events that do get captured while I am home, which is most of the time, and the number of events that I know it misses, I would say it misses 20% of the events. I have had two ""false"" someone is at your door when no one was around in the two months.  Both of those were in the first week. The first one was really disturbing as we didn't realize what was going on.  After looking around outside, then googling it, I am convinced both were the ghost rings others have reported.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2018,Maryland Techy,"I had friends using this doorbell who were absolutely thrilled with it. Setup - The setup for this device could not be easier or better detailed in the instructions.  Everything is clearly labeled, even on the device itself there are small stickers showing you where things are located.  Getting it set up on your WiFi and getting the battery charged and installed can be done by anyone regardless of how technically proficient they are! Installation - I was worried I would have to attach this to wires...if you look at other smart doorbells (and I have), how you install it depends on how your current doorbell is installed.  And a LOT of them recommend you hire an electrician to do it correctly and safely.  Who wants to hire someone for a doorbell? The Ring avoids all of that.  It's like hanging a picture!  Just screw in the mount, attach the doorbell, screw that in and you're done!  It's literally, 1-2-3! Usage - The same app that helps you install, configure, and get your Ring installed is also what you'll use to monitor it.  And here's where you find out the resolution and framerate of the camera is INCREDIBLE!!!  You'll be able to see the images pretty quickly, they are saved to the cloud (which has a small fee attached), and you can even see where other Ring installations are throughout your area (for blocks and blocks around you!) and what incidents they've encountered.  I don't know if that last part is more helpful than scary, but there it is. Summary - I am SO glad I bought my Ring!  I'm moving soon and this is coming with me!

Homan,"The Ring is extremely easy to install and it works even better than I expected.  I like to be able to see what is happening at the front door from my phone anywhere in the world at any time.  I also like to be able see videos of whatever has happened on the porch that day or night. I am the computer tech in the family and I try hard not to call support, but I called Ring support because some things that need to be done in Setup are not clear in the instructions.  The hold time was not more than a minute or two, which is very good.  I spoke to Scott, who is one of the most competent and friendly customer support people I've ever talked to.  We had a few things to solve and he led me through them one by one and then gave me the credit, which I found amusing.  This product and company have it together!

However don't bother with it unless you have unlimited time to mess with hoping to make it work. I'm on my second one, and support has been decent, but it just isn't reliable in motion detection. I have set the motion settings every which way, and so it didn't pick up someone walking up to my door until they are right at the door, yet as I type this, it's going off every few minutes because there is a squirrel playing in the front yard, 15 to 20 feet away, and I have the range set to about 5 feet currently so I don't get every car passing by. (and people still don't set it off until they are on top of it) I feel like A Beta tester for this thing and I'm over it.  I have great wifi signal to it, so that's not an issue. It seems when something does set it off, it takes a few seconds for it to 'wake up' and start recording, though I can stand any distance away for several seconds at varying distances and wave my arms and move around and nothing...

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Dec 2018,Ravin' Maven,"I got this doorbell because it had a battery and was much less expensive than running power.  The video capture was also attractive for security purposes but I am not yet willing to pay $3 or $10 per month to have the videos saved. There are a zillion videos.  Two every time I go down the driveway, four every time I use my car and return.  I suppose I don't  need to keep deleting them but it is still annoying.  I did manage to integrate the Ring with Alexa  to ask Alexa to turn off the motion capture however the skill can not do this.  Looking at the reviews of the Google skill it is just as bad. This doorbell sends the ring (and video) to the internet which then sends it back to your phone and, in my case, the Ring doorbell chime.  There is a delay of seconds to a minute while this occurs.  They are on the same LAN so they could work immediately - but that would deprive Ring of the money from their storage service. Pros: OK as a doorbell without wiring Good motion detect, sensitivity capabilities, zone capabilities High definition video capture during day Cons: Poor integration with Alexa and Google Variable delays in actually getting the ring on your phone or wireless chime Night capture (IR) not so good - even though I have a porch light that is on Fisheye lens is so-so for security",Sort of good

I must say that I do like the clear camera, the distance that it covers and that it interacts with my amazon echo. However, I’m not impressed with the constant lag when trying to retrieve the live footage. My internet speed is great so I know that’s not the issue so I’m sure the issue is with the doorbell. I received a notification on my phone that I had packages delivered but there’s no video footage or motion notification whatsoever for the time that the package was dropped off.

It looks nice on the house and may deter package thieves. That is all. Now for the not so great. The app is too slow to pull up the live feed, so there is no point as I can walk to the door and open it before the feed would show. I can’t keep live view on because it drains the the battery faster than it charges with wires from a powered doorbell. Without service, no videos are saved for any period of time. So if someone robs your house you better hope you paid for service. I understand they don’t want to host your videos on the cloud for free, but I have 8 Yi Home cameras around my house, they load faster, require no service plan, and with 32GB memory cards installed give me several days of recorded motion event history, for free. Fortunately I bought this on a cyber Monday deal or I would be a bit more put out that my $20 cameras run circles around this doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2020,Purchase Person,"Review of Ring Doorbell 2/Echo Show 8 Amazon combo: The doorbell motion detection signal and audio/video is routed to your device via the internet, making motion detection delayed, sometimes so much so that a quick source of motion never triggers it.  The motion range settings are confusing and unreliable.  Recently, after viewing camera images via my Echo Show 8, the sound becomes highly degraded from all others sound sources (e.g. audio streaming) until I unplug the Echo Show for a short time, then reconnecting the power.  One more newly discovered annoying feature on the Echo Show:  I used to be able to resume stopped audio streaming by asking the device to “resume”.  Now, after having watched my first video on the Show days ago, it responds “OK, tell me what you want to watch” whenever I ask to resume an audio stream.","Delayed, poor motion detection, doesn’t work well with Echo Show 8"

Two of the hours were on the phone with Ring Tech Support. Hard to understand the person, sounded like a Phillipino. She was not good at her job. She keep telling me my router is bad. I kept telling her I can see on my router panel that it recognized the Ring connection, but the Ring unit would not link. Again, she insisted my router was bad....really????

He had the smarts to ask me if I had another devise, such as a laptop to connect thru a cell network. I do, my Ipad and thru my MiFi. Finally, after all the other Ring Techies insisted that I had a bad Wi-fi, I finally convinced a Techie at Ring, that indeed, they are sending me bad units & it is not my Wi-fi networks. There is definitely a bunch of bad units that Ring is shipping out. It gets more painful everyday. I think Ring needs to send me a 3rd unit for free, for all the hassel I've gone thru.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2020,chemflyer,"I really wish I could be more positive about this device, but I have frankly been quite disappointed, and would not recommend it to others. It was fairly easy to install, but was more difficult to set up than it should be. I had a hard time establishing the WiFi connection, and then it complained that it was not a good enough signal. Even though I get a fine WiFi signal at the front door with my phone or iPad, it was not good enough for the Ring. So I had to install another WiFi access point in the room near the front door to get it to work well. The next major issue I have is the delay between motion detection and beginning of video recording. I went through the wizard for setting up motion detection, and  that seemed to work well. But when motion is detected, there is a 2 or 3 second delay before video recording begins. If there was a package on my porch, it would really be possible for someone to run up, grab it, and leave and all I would get on the recording is their back as they are walking away. The first second or so of video is also often of very poor quality. It often begins with a bright screen flare as if the aperture of the camera is wide open, and it takes about a second to adjust to the right light level. Another annoyance is the delay for the app to connect to the device. If someone rings my doorbell when I am away and I want to speak with them through the app, there is often a delay of as long as 10-15 seconds while the app is ""establishing a connection"" to the doorbell. By this time, the person has often given up and walked away. Finally there is the issue of video and audio quality. Even with the closer WiFi access point, there are often gaps and cutouts in the audio, and occasional gaps in the video where the app just says ""video not available"". It is not easy to have a conversation with someone at the door through the app because of the poor audio quality. This Ring doorbell is a great concept and it has nice features, but the implementation still leaves a lot to be desired.","Disappointed in the performance - video delay, weak Wifi, poor quality video and audio"

I shopped for cameras for months before deciding on this one. It's easy to install. Has great detection abilities and great night vision. My only complaint is that sometimes at work I can't get the live view to work. A lot of people complain about the subscription fee. It's $3.00 a month. Most of you pay  more than that for a coffee or pack of cigarettes every single day. The fee is for storing motion events. Storing data costs money. There are alternatives that are free but I would not trust them to have my data saved when I really needed it. I like to know that if I get an alert but don't have the chance to view it right away I can do so later. Totally worth $3.00. Or maybe they are right and I should buy scratch off tickets and energy drinks instead.,$3.00 subscription fee is worth it.

When I first got it, the battery would last about 6 weeks, then about 4 so I order another battery.  Now, 1 year later the charges on them are lasting less than 1 week.  I have no features turned on except the camera when the doorbell rings and it is still draining the batteries in a week's time. I'm really disappointed and not sure how I'm going to solve this.  Hardwiring is not an option for me. This was my original review. This is working out so well! It was very easy to install and comes with absolutely everything you could possibly need, even a drill bit, not necessary in most installations, but it's there!.  Very clear picture and so handy for me as I am upstairs a lot of the day and can now let someone know I'm on my way, or, if it's someone I don't care to see, either ignore them or tell them to ""go away"" without rushing through the house and down the stairs to the front door when I don't want to answer it.

Looking back in the “history” of videos is descent (glitches once in a while), but trying to look at the live picture (like when someone is at the door or you want to see it quickly) never works for at least 2-5 minutes until it “connects”. Like it for what it is in general, but they could define make some improvements! The doorbell itself rarely works...usually only goes off when we lose power, which is so weird so we bought the one you plug in to hook to our account in the app and it works nice. I do like that you can move it around to any plug. So if I’m in the basement or somewhere far away from the unit it’s great to be able to easily move.

Sadly, I was told the price could not be honored; therefore, I will not be buying a Ring...I will not be signing up for a Ring monthly subscription...or buying additional Ring devices, which means the company losses money in the long run.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Charles R. Young,"Easy instalation, though I didn't put it in the same place as the old doorbell because I wanted to angle it more toward the sidewalk. To avoid charging the battery, I used an external power supply since I had a power outlet nearby. As others have mentioned here, when delivery people come set down a box on the porch and leave quickly I will usually miss seeing them by the time I get a visual. When away from home it takes a minute or two to get the phone and activate the camera, so they are usually gone by then. It does record the event though (if you pay the monthly fee). The only thing about that is that it takes a few minutes for the recording to be available, so I can't quickly determine who was there. Alexa integration: I have the Alexa Show 8 which works well to see the camera video. When motion is detected, it emitts a chime sound and states motion is detected or someone is at the door if they push the ring doorbell. The main issue is that I have to command ""Alexa, show me the front door."" It then takes about 3 seconds for the video to come on the screen. One would think that once the camera announced movement it would automatically show the camera view; but it doesn't. Looking on Google for a solution, I found many people had complained of this for a couple of years.","Good picture, a bit of a delay to see video."

I don’t know why I am reading so many bad reviews on this doorbell. It does what it says . I have a vacation home in the Bahamas and mine works great. Even when I am in the states . I have attached a video of my best friend going in the apartment yesterday and sound and video quality is great. That house is on a very busy road and near an airport. But rarely do I get any alert that is just traffic and I have it set for motions right at the end of my driveway. I use it because it is a vacation home and I am not always there . This way I can monitor it 24/7 . I live in a four Plex there my only complaint would be it works to good and I get a lot of updates I don’t need. I set this up myself . I am a woman even though this is my husbands amazon . I set this up myself in less than half an hour . Most of that was screwing the screws into concrete walls . I didn’t have a drill. I choose not to wire it to the existing doorbell . Since if anyone rings the other bell I can still see them on camera.  I get no lagging delay and have actually talked to my friend as she was unlocking the door . And I am all the way here in the states . And the internet in Nassau Bahamas is not the best quality but my doorbell has never had an issue . Since I didn’t hardwire it I just use the battery I can tell you even on a very busy road the battery life is fantastic. Only have had to charge twice since November. And as I said I live in a 4 Plex there so I am always getting the neighbors on it . I think for the price to know my vacation home is safe it is great. I wouldn’t use another product. Clear view clear audio . And I can speak to anyone at my door from the states and just say we can’t answer you right now we are busy. With that being said I don’t understand what people are expecting this product to do, and yes you have to sign up for a monthly or yearly subscription but I pay only 10 dollars a month and it is worth it .

I added the wedge downward and that fixed my issues to where i could actually increase the motion a bit more. It is now perfect and catches just the right amount of movement.

Motion detection was slow to catch sometimes. If you're trying to see your front door remotely but have only 3 bars (out of 5) or less on your phone.. Forget it. The worst part was that there were regular occurrences of the video freezing during recording for up to 8-9 seconds. Doesn't seem like a big deal? That's enough time for someone to come into and out of recognizable distance (with your package that just got delivered).

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jul 2019,J.T.  Harrod,"I purchased three of the ring doorbell, and I really feel it was worth every penny I paid. This product is great! The picture is extremely clear both day and night vision. The sound is very clear as well, so I'm able to understand what people are saying when they're within range. I was able to adjust the distance the camera picked up motion before it activated. This is nice because some of the areas I have the doorbell are a lot more active than the other two.  I'm looking forward to getting a camera to go with the doorbells. If you find the batteries draining too fast, you might want to adjust the range under the ""motion zone"" setting. I purchased the extra battery packs with charger. I'm happy I did because it took about 12 hours to charge the batteries before I could use it. The extra batteries are nice because I have charged them and was able to simply pop them in right away once I saw the one on the back door draining because it's more active. The extra batteries really was worth it because of this. I'm able to always see whose around my back area.",Ring is a BOSS!
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2018,Ingrid Clark,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I got this doorbell as a bundle with the Echo dot for Black Friday.  Mainly got it because of some recent warnings of packages being stolen and cars being broken into in the neighborhood. Connecting it to the wifi from my phone was a little complicated.  The calibration was also a bit of a pain, but once I figured out the right sensitivity and amount of notifications I wanted, I now know when someone steps on my property. The battery lasts even through the constant live camera viewing I was doing on my phone.  Since having it for about 2 weeks the battery percentage has only gone down by 5%. As you can see from the video and picture, the image quality is superb and gives a wide view of my front yard.  Even the night vision mode is clear. Pairing with the Echo was simple. A yearly subscription to the cloud for videos will run you about $30 for 1 device, which I believe is worth it.",Better than expected.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Aug 2019,Peter Latvis,"Changing this review from 1 star to 4 stars.  While the original install process was a nightmare and I still don't understand what enabled another person to use my email address to create an account, Ring's customer service has been very persistent in communicating with me until my issue was resolved.  Ultimately I signed  up under a different email address and it worked.  Then customer service worked with me to reactivate my original email address.  While I wish that had been an option from the start, I certainly think there customer service is top notch. ---------- Just got a Ring Video Doorbell 2 for my birthday.  Excitedly I opened the box, and went right to the installation instructions.  The first step was to download the app. I used my iphone 6 to go to the app store, and downloaded ""Ring - Always Home"".  So far so good.  Right? Nope. I opened the app and it prompted me to choose sign in or create an account.  Having never had a Ring before I opted to create an account.  I entered my email 2x and chose a password, only to be told that the email I was using was already used.  Funny - that has been my personal email for 15 years and I've never had an account with Ring. So I went back an opted for the sign in option, choosing ""forgot password"".  Sure enough a forgot password email was delivered to my personal email account, and I was able to change the password. My next surprise came when I attempted to log in. Apparently the account already had a name and it wasn't even mine. This tells me that Ring does not verify the email address of its user by sending confirmation with a click through verification.  This is pretty unsafe and not a good security practice, especially for a company that provides home security. While this would be bad enough, its just the start of the problem. After finally logging in - there was no opportunity to add my new doorbell.  I checked all the menus, went through all the settings - no opportunity to add my device. So off we go - time to call their support. I called and spent 56 minutes with their support team (like I have an hour to burn on the first step of device setup).  I learned the following: Uninstalling the App Reinstalling the App Uninstalling the App Reinstalling the App Uninstalling the App, and Reinstalling the App Surprisingly did't fix the problem. I confirmed 3 times that I had downloaded the right app. Emailed 6 screenshots. Confirmed that I'm using a supported phone. Was sent to ""tier 2"" customer service - no luck Was sent to advanced customer service - no luck. Finally found out that despite downloading the correct app, that it was directing me to Ring's Neighborhood App. I was told there was no immediate fix and that they had no idea how to get me set up since setup is app dependent. Next I was told that they would escalate the issue - finally maybe a solution is near. Nope. Instead the customer service rep mentioned casually that it would be at least 48 hours before the advanced solution team would respond.  That sure made me feel important. So I'm sitting here, looking at the Ring Doorbell still sitting in the box, because I wasn't able to get any further than the first installation instruction.  I'll be waiting a minimum of 2 days for the next possible step. At this pace I'll be another year older before I'm able to install this. Can't recommend this product, it offers really bad security practices, and terrible installation experience.",REVISED - Installation NOT EASY - But GREAT Customer Service
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2020,Walter L.,I like to start of with my dislikes. Battery life. I didnt have a pre existing doorbell so I had to just use the battery. I got about 3 weeks out of it before I had to recharge it. Keep in mind i had it set to motion and had lots of motion. The camera quality is way better than my Samsung 1080P cameras I have worked into my house. The lens is somewhat like a fisheye Lens. It covers my entire front yard and more! The motion is adjustable. Motion detection is great. The app is great. I have recently purchased a new home and haven't installed it here yet. Luckily I have doorbells here that I can wire into. All in all this is a great camera system and notifications are quick.,Awesome camera quality.

Only complaints about the product are 1) Battery Life and 2) Paying the monthly fee for playback. Since we have the system setup to record based on motion the battery needs to be recharged monthly.

I have tried several solutions, including spending an extra $50 for the Chime pro, switched my internet over for higher speed, changed router and modem.  I have talked to Ring, and they sent me a link to router port settings.  That didn't help, so Ring told me that the problem is with my internet provider and their signal (Xfinity 250 mbps plus).  I have had Xfinity check my internet, they can't find a problem and says it problem is with Ring.  Neither Ring nor Xfinity have been of any help.  I am going to contact Xfinity and Ring again to see if we can get this solved.  I also made the mistake of spending the $30 for the video recording plan.  So far, no videos to save because the damn thing doesn't work!!!  Update 1/13/19.  After spending more time with the Ring people, they decided the device may be at fault.  They sent me a new unit.

We have the battery powered one. If you get that, I strongly suggest to get an additional battery & charger. It does take a while for the battery to charge.

I was lucky to have a friend to help me diagnose the problem and splice a piece if wire in the attic to create a working environment.  Then all I had to do was instal a new bell and then the Ring door bell button.  There was a point of confusion  for me created in one of the videos.  A call to the help line put that to rest and I mounted the button.  In my case, my door doesn't face down the walkway, so I used one of the included angle Pieces and it  covers the walkway.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,MorganR,"The concept is wonderful - have a camera (as well as a doorbell) that can notify you on your phone of any motion (as in people approaching your front door), no matter where you are in the world. In practice, it has some limitations: 1) the motion detection easily picks up background motions (cars moving), but adjusting the sensitivity down often blocks detection of people coming to the door -- it took lots of tweaking 2) the lens is very wide angle -- gets a lot in, but that means the detail of an intruder's face (or a package delivery or friend) is limited 3) Requires a subscription service to save the video - so this isn't a purchase, but rather a purchase plus a monthly fee All in all, a good thing, but it could be refined to be better.",A video camera accessible over the internet - with motion notifications

Even after subscribing, I’m getting messages telling me my trial is about to end with no indication that my subscription is recognized. Customer service is not great. The chatbots are annoying. Getting a real person to help is not easy. For a company that’s part of Amazon, I’m surprised at how poor the customer experience is. Also, if you give a Ring doorbell as a gift, they don’t have an option to gift a subscription with it. The gift recipient will need to pay to take advantage of basic features.

The camera recorded everything (birds, leaves blowing in the wind etc) but PEOPLE walking up to my door...wtf?!? Lol...I don't fault the device for that because its a universal setting for all the products...but that minimal option doesn't do any good if it doesn't record what matters...lol.

It DOES not work as advertised.  It does pick-up motion and you can ""slightly"" adjust the range, however you can not adjust it by zones as described in the advertising. I spent two hours on the Ring chat line trying to get it to adjust with no solution.  At the end of the conversation they said the developers made ""adjustments"" and that's how it works now.......very deceptive! Basically the only adjustment you can make it a wide area motion range that covers the entire wide angle range.  So if you want one side to have a more depth motion sensing than the other ""zones"" you can not do that.  So then what happens is that the unit will consistently be triggered which is VERY annoying. If I had to do this again I think I would purchase another companies unit.

I don’t even use the little screw. When I need to charge the battery, I have to get a knife or something to pry the battery door open. They could improve the battery door. As for functionality, the Ring 2 takes far too long to show the live picture. I set the motion detection to include my front yard, so that I could have time to see who is coming. The app said motion detected in my front yard. I tried to go to live view. The working icon or buffering icon or whatever kept spinning. It announced again motion detected in my front yard. The picture finally came up, and I saw the mailman going out of the gate. So it actually announced that the mailman was in my front yard both coming and going, but I saw nothing but the back of him leaving the gate. This is far too long for this “security” product to be taking. If it hadn’t been the mailman but a thief stealing my mail or packages, this would be a huge problem. And yes I did subscribe to the service, so in such a case I might have a video of the likely masked person who was able to get away with my stuff. I’m sure that will be very helpful to the police. But sometimes I’m waiting for UPS or FedEx and need to actually give them a package. This Ring 2 just allows me to see them driving away. While the icon is spinning, I can’t even access the microphone to tell whomever it may be to wait. And yes the battery is good, signal strength is good, and the firmware is up to date.

I have used it now for about 3 months and I like the alerts letting me know someone is near my door.  Also being able to talk to them without having to open the door is great.  My only recommendation to Ring would be to try and make it a bit easier to install.  It took me a total of about 2 hours, 1 hr for the upgraded transformer for the doorbell and another 1hr to get the Ring doorbell itself mounted.  Not sure there is anything they can do, maybe more clear instructions.  For both items I had to youtube videos of others mounting the Ring to get an understanding of which wires go to what.  It's not just white + and black -.  Its 2 reds and a black and then I got the Ring instructions saying something to the effect of 'don't connect positive', what does that mean and then 'don't connect the diode if low voltage', what does all that mean?  There was no explanation.  I mount my own ceiling fans, change recessed lighting, rewired my outside lights and that was easy  compared to wiring this doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2019,mgramz,"Was super excited to get this and install, only to discover that there is apparently a known issue online with Ring 2 microphones not working with many newer Samsung smartphones.  Video works great, signal is perfect and I can even chat with people from other devices like my echo show 5.  However, I don't have an echo show 5 in my pocket, I pull out my smartphone and go to chat with who is at the door, and all they hear is some mickey mouse static.  I can either buy a new thousand dollar smart phone or a different brand video doorbell if I wish to chat with the person at the door.  Called Ring, and they were of no help and pretty clueless, even though many people online seem to be very aware of this exact issue.  Reviews tend to be the best way to get known issues fixed, here's hoping; because I just got my phone a little before the Ring video doorbell 2",Voice feature doesn't work with Samsung phones S10e
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2019,Casey Sullivan,Had for 44 days before returning through amazon. Ring consistently disconnected from WiFi and then wouldn’t connect for a few days after resetting the router. Called the Ring helpline who tried to blame my WiFi so I called my internet provider who ran several tests and said WiFi was running fine. I then called the rain hotline back and they decided that it was not the Wi-Fi device it’s self so they sent me a new refurbished one. That arrived and did the same thing. When I called to complain about this they said that the device just some time does not work with certain Internet providers. I have Comcast Xfinity which is one of the largest Internet providers in the country so I think it should be a disclaimer before buying ring if it doesn’t work with normal providers. The customer service was absolutely useless and would not help at all since I did not buy it through them. Amazon was great in excepting to turn in giving me a partial refund for things over the 30 day return window. I would never buy this product or recommend this product to anyone.,"Poor WiFi connection, crappy customer service"

This thing does work worth a darn. Pros - the doorbell still rings when someone pushes the button, it could be a mild deterrent to thieves that don't know how bad it is. Cons - expensive, video is choppy even with a solid wifi and internet connection, the resolution is terrible beyond about 5 feet, Android app crashes constantly, couldn't get Windows app to even install, there are no options to have any video or pictures other than live without a current subscription, live connection attempts take 30 secs to several minutes to connect when it works at all, the motion detection picks up every little thing at long distances no matter what setting is used, video recording takes too long to start (it usually starts in time to see a delivery driver halfway back to the truck)",Junk

The instructions were clear and easy to understand. Installation was a breeze. Now on to software issues. I am a tech savvy guy and I could not get the doorbell to connect to my network. I called technical support and they determined there was a software update they needed to push to the unit.  Once they sent the update over the internet it connected just fine. I was really frustrated at first but glad they could resolve the issue quickly over the phone. I have had no issues since (4 months). The only other thing I wish is the doorbell was an actual doorbell. You have to purchase an optional chime module. It does “ring” through your phone though.

While my WIFI download speed is pretty good at around 30 Mbps, my upload speed is only around 2 Mbps (I live in a pretty rural area and it's the best I can get with DSL).  While Ring states that a 2 Mbps upload speed is the minimum speed necessary to have the doorbell function properly, the sound was always breaking up (no one could understand anything being said inside or outside) and the video would occasionally freeze or pixelate.  I was told by a Ring technician (BTW, very good customer service!) that the doorbell audio and video could not work properly with my low upload speed.  I wish they would have made that known. On the other hand, the Ring App worked very well and is pretty user-friendly.  Set up was pretty simple. Motion/doorbell alerts immediately showed up on our phones (and the Ring Chime Pro).  Other than the intermittent video issues, the video was very sharp (day or night).  I could have actually dealt with the video issues, but the terrible audio was the deal breaker.  If you can't talk to someone at your door with it, it's pretty useless.  If it worked with my WIFI, I would have given this 5 stars.  It seems to be a pretty good little product. My wife and I are very disappointed as the Ring security system would have been perfect for us.  (I also purchased 3 outdoor security cam lights to complete the system).

The Ring seems to be better in every way measurable. The product packaging, what is included, build quality and software are all superior. The only selling point that SkyBell has over Ring is the free cloud storage. The set up was easy and there are several accessories and tools included. The battery powered bell can be used wired to the existing doorbell in your house or not so it can be mounted pretty much anywhere. The picture quality is great and the unit had low latency when sending audio/video. On all products that use WiFi I recommend brushing up on how your router works and routing in general. Most routers use a dual band and for now manufacturers are still sticking with the 2Ghz band. Make sure your phone or device you use to set up the Ring is only on the 2Ghz band and can not switch to 5Ghz.",RealReview Recommeded!

Perhaps the people that like the Ring have hard-wired devices.  I have spent hours on the phone with Ring support, my broadband provider support and my wifi router support.  Each blame one of the other two--I am reasonably technical, but not able to troubleshoot this on my own.  I have done everything everyone has advised.  Ring supplied me a range extender since their final determination was my wifi signal is not strong enough (because I have a brick house?) to read the device at my front door.  My wifi-router itself is within 20-25 ft. of the Ring device.  The range extender has not solved the problem, which is that I can get the device set up and working correctly and it will do so for 2-3 weeks, then I will realize it has again stopped functioning.  I have to completely reinstall it--this has been going on for 6 months now, I give up.  it is not dependable enough to depend upon--on a couple of occasions when I needed to see what had happened at my front door, I logged onto the device only to find I had no video recording.  Very disappointing.  I have read comments in forums advising to request level 2 support if you contact Ring, I would agree with that as level 1 is frustrating, especially the fourth and fifth time you speak with them.

UPDATE - After posting my unhappy review, I received an email from a Ring customer rep named ""Dasia.""  Dasia was persistent and patient as we tried several times to troubleshoot my problem.  Bottom line--she was able to determine that even though I had installed the range extender, my doorbell was still making the bad connection directly to my router--probably my fault!  Once connected to the extender it has been working satisfactorily, so I am changing my status to ""happy"" and wanted to set the record straight and express appreciation for Dasia's persistence and patience!",Connectivity issues resolved thanks to Dasia
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jul 2018,Denis Kiriaev,"First of all, it is a video doorbell. So someone rings the door, and you hope to see the video on your phone? It takes me less time to come downstairs and see through the window than it takes for the app to connect and show me the video (and in most cases it just shows error message instead). So as a VIDEO doorbell it is garbage. Motion detection is a total joke. It takes it several seconds to start recording when it detects motion (or to detect motion, whatever). Videos with delivery guys usually start when the guy is already leaving. On other hand, no matter how close I configure motion detection zones to be, it still records every car passing by near my home (well, the tail of the car if it doesn't drive too fast - remember the delayed recording). So 90% of my motion notifications are false alarms. And it records only 30 seconds, even if motion is still there. So as a motion detection camera it is useless, too. The only useful feature is having notification on the phone/smart watch when someone rings the bell - I'm giving it a star for this.","Motion detection is a joke, and super slow app"

The problem is that unless you PAY A MONTHLY FEE IN PERPETUITY, you cannot see the recorded videos of people coming to your house. They don't tell you that up front. So if you don't pay the extorted monthly charge, the system is useless as far as I'm concerned. Yes, you can remotely view a live cams of house on your phone at any time but who has time to constantly monitor their premises like a security firm. And, if some trips your doorbell or other security cams, you will get an alert on you phone, BUT by the time you go to the live cam view to see who's there and interact with them like they show on TV, they are long gone.

Don’t expect lightning speed or clearity if internet speed is marginal or if the router is obstructed or a good distance from the doorbell. A better choice might be a usb cabled system. I misunderstood the “vertical view” being stated as “90 degrees” as I was hoping to be able to see a package on the door step below the doorbell.  Not the case however, “90 degrees” means 45 degrees up and 45 degrees down.  Adding the down-wedge base that came in the package didn’t improve that condition much.

Tied in with an echo show (I have the 5, but wish I would've got atleast the 8"") and this is such an awesome feature to be able to ask alexa to ""show me my front door"" and it pops right up!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2019,Trever Furnish,"Works well enough for the price tag, just has a much higher false alarm rate than the pro version due to the difference in technology.  Ring could really decrease customer frustration by being more active in helping customers understand why the false alarms are happening — they could even probably filter them out with software. The false alarms happen when a sudden bright light reflects onto the sensor — and that in turn happens quite frequently when a car with a slightly curved side window passes by slowly on the street on a sunny day, because the sun reflects off that side windo onto every house on the street. This is enough to set off the infrared detection system. It took a long time for me to understand what was happening — I should have immediately understood just by noticing that all of the false alarm video clips start with a completely whited out screen. That’s because even the visible light ccd sensor in the camera is flooded briefly by the sunlight as soon as it turns on. Software could filter this out for customers easily — the pattern would be very recognizable by AI or even a traditional bit of computer code. I only realized this is what was happening when I. Priced that my Wyze cameras also would go off inside the garage — they were detecting the “motion” of a bright reflection shining off the side window of a passing car into a relatively dark garage through a window facing the street — and a second later the ring doorbell goes off. Note that before we had this version of the doorbell we had the more expensive pro version installed in exactly the same spot for several years with no such false alarms. Adjusting the sensitivity settings in the run app does nothing to prevent these.",Way more false alarms than with the pro version.

Good quality video and good enough audio. Easily adjustable motion detection. Good infrared for night vision. Our doorbell isn't in a good spot to wire it to doorbell power. We ended up using some adhesive strips to stick it to the door rather than drilling. Holds well and has good battery life. Keep in mind that you need to pay a subscription plan for the full benefits ($30/year for 1 device or entire household for $100/year). You'll get 1 month for free though. It still works without the subscription but it looks like it only alerts you if someone presses the button on the device (doesn't look like it alerts you for motion but I've always had the protection plan). You can still do live view whenever you want but it won't save any footage for you to review later. With the plan, you can view all clips within past 60 days from people pushing the button, motion alerts, or even the times you opened up live view.",Don't Worry About Stolen Packages Anymore

I must say it does the job for me. Though it does delay sometimes but not enough for me to complain about it. They do give you a 30 day free trial and after that you would have to pay either a monthly fee or an annual fee. Which im fine with. If its 1 ring camera which in my case its either $3 a month or $30 one time payment. Its not expensive at all. You can adjust the motion detection to as you like. Battery is great so far.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2020,Teresa K,"So far it has been fine. But it detects a little too much car traffic that doesn't seem to be fixable without reducing the ""person"" detection area also. Also people, especially couriers, don't utilize it's function as a doorbell because ""I believe"" they know it is a camera and they will just leave packages anywhere they want near my front door and don't ring the bell as instructed to do so that I will know immediately there has been a delivery. The notification on my phone through the app gets missed most of the time and so I will be having a Chime delivered to hopefully remedy that problem. I do recommend purchasing a Chime at the same time as the Ring is purchased. It will save you a lot of headache in the long run. They don't cost that much and will probably give you more of what you are expecting from purchasing the Ring as a doorbell for notication purposes.",I Recommend Purchase the Ring and a Chime Together
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2018,Greg Wendland,"This was my first smart device for my home, so I've been paying close attention to it. When I first installed it, the doorbell seemed to function well and alerts were easily heard. The volume of the doorbell's speaker is not very loud, however. I cared less about the volume, though and more about being able to see who has been to my door, especially when Im away. One thing I noticed is that this device intermittently captures proper video.  What I mean by this is, for example, today the USPS mail truck drove up in front of my house (full view of the doorbell/camera). The mailman got out, approached the house, dropped two packages on my porch, and then turned around and walked back to his truck and got inside. What did the camera/recording catch? None except the mailman walking back to his truck. I see no point in having a doorbell with a camera that catches people leaving instead of approaching. However, and this is the frustrating part, throughout my day, the camera will catch and record a person walking by on the street or a car passing by. (i.e. Videos that don't matter to me). The video quality is clear and audible alerts are clear. I intended to purchase the additional chime that goes with this product, but first I have to decide whether I want to continue using this device or find another one that functions better in the area of recording motion approaching the house/property.",Intermittently Acceptable Recordings

I purchased this because I kept having random people knocking on my door after moving to a new house. Due to the way the house was built (and the lack of a peep hole) I had no way of seeing who was at my door. I live in a sketchy neighborhood so opening the door would not be smart. I bought the ring and I am so glad I did. It was really easy to install and set up. I am using the 30 free trial you get for the access to the videos online but I am going to pay for the yearly subscription.  I also bought a backup battery and I have had the ring for a little over a month and had to switch out the battery once so far. It seems as though it lasts about 3 to 4 weeks based on how active your house is. I have been at work and been alerted that someone was at my door, even with poor wifi reception at my job I was still able to see who it was and speak to them. I would and have recommended this to my friends and fam. The battery is easy to remove and replace. If you cant hardwire into an active doorbell I would recommend getting a backup battery to install while recharging. It takes about 6-8 hours to fully charge.",Easy to install and use!

Our house faces the street and even though I have the sensitivity down as far as it will go and have the mounting wedge installed we are bombarded daily with videos are cars driving by or just the sun shining. The Ring, however, does not pick up people who actually come to the front door to deliver something. It is very delayed in notifying us when there is motion at the door, by the time we are alerted there is nothing at the door anymore, and the app is slow to pull up video even when we have a quality WiFi extension right by the door on the inside of our house. When I called customer service the person was condescending and rude.

But, my experience is consistent with a bunch of comments on Reddit. Poor wifi connectivity. I have 2 RIng doorbells, the regular model and the Ring Doorbell 2. Both suffer from weak wifi signals, even though there's just flat nothing wrong with the signal where these two units are located. I've tested the signal and both locations and there's no reason for it be weak. Whether it's a problem with the doorbells being weak in receiving or sending to the router--I'm not sure. A second problem is that that by the time you get an alert of motion at the door, the delay in the video starting means that whatever it is that triggered it is gone. Now I'm trying to decide to risk throwing good money after bad by upgrading to Google WIFI or a similar wifi distribution system in my home.

The video and picture quality are pretty good, but it gets pixelated at times. The sound quality is also pretty good when it works. Also I have never been able to have ""Live View"" work.

Working in conjunction with WiFi can be useless due to the fact that if I get an alert, message indicates video processing available shortly (or similar verbiage). That is unacceptable for security purposes. I will try boosting my WiFi. That may solve that issue. I was under the impression that there are no additional costs associated with this product. WRONG.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jan 2019,James Gunzel,"I am disappointed whit this unit and company policy to make the unit 'whole'. There is NO or very little/unclear mention of requiring a monthly/yearly subscription to store and view video. They do not even give you a courtesy minute, hour, day, or week. I would not be reviewing this as 2 stars if it gave the customer a small cloud storage limit or onboard sd card option. Heck, even if it saved to a home network drive that would allow users some options. I understand long term storage and viewing remotely could be a paid service; but not to make the unit continue to operate as advertised. Basically, the company took a good product and want continual residuals by offering/mandating a service that should be inherent in its design/make up especially for the initial price. It is advertised as being a security video doorbell. But to get that level of 'security' you HAVE to subscribe/pay to view/save videos. Even if you instantly check the alert for motion you will already be viewing future events and not the event that triggered the doorbell. Dont know if anyone read the terms and conditions; but there was some verbiage that stated you cannot have a class action suit against the company and all claims have to be settled without judge/jury, which means you deal direct with them and without the law involved to resolve any issues.

At first I adjusted the motion range to cover up to the curb but it was picking up every car the drove by. I tried to decrease the alert frequency but that didn't help.  Next I changed the angle and location several times with negative results. Finally I Re-adjusted the motion range back even further so the sensor would only pick up bottom of the steps and the sidewalk but when I did that the Ring 2 was unable to detect anything at all. My family was going in and out of the house, even standing in front of it and it could no longer detect us. My opinion is that the Ring 2 would work great if I had a home with a longer pathway to the street. The range seemed to work good if it was set at 20 feet out but in my case that was the street. I don't know if the angle of the 8 steps is effecting it or not but the Ring 2 definitely needs some space to detect something moving.

Since there is no electrical to wire into at my location, I have to rely on the battery for use. I was told it would hold a charge for 6 months, this is not true! I am going on my third month and I'll be charging the battery a third time this weekend. This involves me having to remove the battery, charging and reinstalling.

ADDITIONALLY ALL FIVE OF THESE NEW FEATURES HAVE DISABLED SWITCHES IN FIVE SEPARATE PLACES, SOME OF WHICH MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! HOW ABOUT PUTTING ALL THE CONTROLS IN ONE PLACE, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

IT'S THE GIFT THAT NEVER QUITS...TAKING! Installation is not as straightforward as it would have you believe & the instructions are a little lacking. Also it's not so secure, mounted on the wall with a plastic base, that could be easily pried off . And be careful and not tighten the screws too much, because you'll strip out the plastic!  And that drill bit they send you is a joke, that would have a hard time with a stick of butter, let alone a brick wall! And the tiny hard to reach security star screw on the bottom of the battery, HA, that slows me down more than it would a thief, who would just pry off the entire plastic base from the wall! Now that it's set up it tells me I have a poor Wi-Fi connection and I need to buy an extender chime. Seriously!! Why is it then that I can walk out the door where the Ring is installed and walk another 50+ feet to my mailbox with my phone in my hand, and my Wi-Fi is still strong enough to watch a movie on Netflix?? I give it 2 Stars, only because I'm impressed by the concept! The reality, not so much! UPDATE2: I have discovered that the motion detection is either feast or famine and they really need more zones to set than they have. Also the Zone chooser should be an overlay over an actual live image, but it's not, so it's just guess work! Also if you use both the angle & the wedge mounting plates to get things just right, even though they say they belong together, they don't and they could have given that part of the concept quite a bit more thought! Most anyone who's ever held a tool in their hand could have figured this out toot-sweet! I could have drilled through one to the other or epoxy them together, and it would have been far superior to what they allow you, but then I couldn't send it back within 30 days like I am anticipating at this point! Bottom line... Don't waste your time or money as I have. I will likely keep this because I already wasted a lot of time on it and I don't know what I will replace it with except a hardwired system which I don't feel like tackling at this point, but I really recommend wholeheartedly that you do not waste your time and money on this! There's got to be something better out there, because this is a laughable piece of junk that might be worth almost $50? The monthly per camera charge is the most ridiculous part, there are a lot cheaper and probably just as crappy systems, but they generally don't charge you a monthly cloud charge, unless you want to store your videos long-term! Why would you, when you can just download them? do I really need all that many videos of bugs crawling on my doorbell or cats and squirrels scampering across the porch?",Even less impressed the more I learn!!

It alerts me all day when a car drives by but won’t detect someone walking right up to it a good 30-40% of the time (I have adjusted the sensitivity). If someone actually rings the doorbell I only get notified maybe 5 out of 10 times. I have it networked with 3 devices and somehow none of them get notified when the bell has rung. If a large truck drives by I will definitely get a video after waiting like 10 minutes for it to process. I should have returned it. Update. Less than 3 months on the house and it already completely died. Disconnected from the WiFi and would not reconnect. Spent an hour on the phone with them just to find out the junk was broken and they recommended a new one. No thanks this was a huge waste of money.,Buy the nest hello

We decided to try it battery-operated to the right of the door, where it fit better, and I'm so glad we stuck with it. It was SO easy to install, much easier than I expected, and I love being able to monitor our door even when I'm not home. It helped us realize that our pet sitter forget to come by one day, and it enables us scoop up packages before the porch pirates. It's even notified us of nearby criminal activity. The only downside is that it alerts us every time a car drives by, even though I've adjusted the motion detector settings, but perhaps I need to adjust them a bit more.

I've been notified of motion at my door after I have left my home and driven 3 blocks away before Ring notifies me of the event. So as far as I can tell it is great at videoing people as they leave your property. I was under the impression that the idea was to video the bad guys as they approach not after the crime has happened. 2. The doorbell sends an event(motion at your front door) you open the app and it takes me to a time prior to even purchasing the Ring 2 doorbell, by the time you get to the correct date the event is long over. 3. Let's talk night vision now if you don't have lighting outside I guess that gray dimly lit video is better than nothing, however when you have plenty of outdoor lighting and still get gray dimly lit video, because you can't turn off the night vision on the Ring 2 video doorbell, I'd say there is a problem! I am seriously thinking about returning this and getting another brand of video doorbell. Also let me point out that Amazon, who owns the Ring video doorbell system also falls short by not having tech support available on the website to voice these issues and get some resolution of some sort.

They are not perfect but nothing is. Really, you are much better off having a Ring than not having one. Crime is never going to decrease... Just buy one, you'll like it a lot. In general it's wonderful technology but my only complaint is battery life when not hardwired. I only receive 5-6 motion alerts a day. No doorbell pushes and no video/audio conversations. Yet the battery is draining at approx. 7% per day. Therefore I can expect about 14 days before the battery is fully drained. This is hardly the 6-12 months Ring advertises. I won't return the Ring but I did buy a second battery pack. I strongly suggest do all you can to hardwire the device. Even if you don't have an existing doorbell, buy a 8-24vac transformer and a 25ohm resistor, and run the wires if possible. In my case, hardwired was not an option. Oh, and I wish they'd support an internal SD card for local recording. WiFi is mostly reliable but not at all guaranteed to be available 100% of the time. Heaven help the people of Earth if (when) the Internet goes down or is destroyed...",Very nice but needs to be hardwired

Overall, I really do like it, but there are some things that really could be improved. PROS: The install was a breeze. The fit and finish is also pretty good (not great...just pretty good). It's nice to be able to see who is at your door before you open it -- even if you're not home. CONS: The video quality is ok, but is still nothing like any of the demos I've seen.  I have a router 10' away from the doorbell with 1 wall separating it. The speaker quality is atrocious.  I don't know how anyone uses this thing to communicate with anyone at their front door.  I've used the ""talk"" feature a few times and both me and the person at my door struggled to understand each other. The video takes way too long to load.  My UPS or USPS carrier waits for up to about 30 seconds before leaving.  From the time I get a notification to the time I actually answer, I could just walk to the door and open it and greet the person.

First, you have the video and camera that you can configure the degree of motion activation.  B, you have the ability to talk to visitors over your cell phone no matter where you are.  It is easy to install and the networking connectivity is extremely simple.  Hell, you don't even have to wire on your front door as it comes with a rechargeable battery that is very effective and long lasting.  In fact, I am not just amazed by the longevity of the battery, but curious technically how they managed such a small battery to be this effective for such a long period of time.

I have pretty much given up improving the gap between motion detection and notification.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jun 2019,Dylan,"I got this and installed it. Very easy installation. Setup was pretty easy as well. I had no signal problems, but my router is fairly close to my doorbell. The first time I setup the doorbell, I told the app that I had a street in front of my house, which I do, and set the range. I wanted to be able to pick up someone turning into my driveway, but not cars on the road. After some testing, the motion detection seemed to pick up most cars on the road. I dialed the range back a bit and it fixed the problem with cars on the street, but it made it so that you literally had to step up onto the porch to trigger it. After a few days of playing around with it, I told the app that I didn't have a street in front of my house and set my range again. This seemed to be the best configuration for me, as it detected only about 25% of passing cars, but even on the max range distance, more than half the time, it would only detect a person when they stepped on the porch, which is only 3 feet from the door. Ended up returning it. I can deal with it not picking up until a person gets to a certain point of my property, but I can't deal with it sometimes picking up a person from the road or waiting to pick them up on the porch, or maybe picking them up from the driveway. If it was consistent, I could atleast know what to expect.","It's ok, but the motion detection needs to improve."

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jan 2018,Radio Guy,"I've had the Ring Video Doorbell for a couple of months now. Here's what you need to know. First as a security device it just OK. There is no local video storage so if the internet is down for any reason you have no video. Connection time across the internet varies and while usually notifications from the Ring are within seconds times do vary. This is probably not the fault of the Ring but the communication medium which is the internet. Also if you receive alerts on your cell phone you can have additional delays and signal issues with the cell signal. Unless you are in an area with good cell signal you may get slow notification, grainy video, etc. I will say that even when the video was not very good I have been able to speak to someone at the door. The Ring is due to it's location subject to physical damage and relatively easy to defeat. Also you must purchase a video storage subscription after the trial period or you have no video storage so there a ongoing costs with the Ring. Video quality from the Ring is OK but due to the wide angle of the lens the image has some distortion. This is not a defect but simply due to a very wide angle lens and gives a bit of a ""fish eye"" look to the video. Night video works but is grainy and quality varies. It's also important to realize that the video from the camera will vary due to lighting conditions around the camera, just like any camera if there are poor lighting conditions video may have problems. So take into consideration the lighting conditions when choosing a location for the Ring. The Ring uses WiFi to connect to your internet. The performance of the Ring for WiFi in my opinion is just OK. Other devices we have seem to have better WiFi than the Ring when the signal strength is the same. Bottom line you need to have very good WiFi coverage in the location of the Ring or you will have connection problems at times. I think Ring should try to improve the WiFi performance of this device. The Motion detection of the Ring works pretty well. I did find that we had a flag that cast a shadow of the sidewalk in front of our porch and the waving of the flag and change in the shadow would cause false alarms. Moving the flag solved the problem. We have a road around 60 feet or so from the Ring and passing vehicles do not cause false alarms. Animals that pass in front of the Ring will of course set it off too. We know when the neighbors cat is around. The plastic case of the Ring is pretty good quality. I don't know how long it will last outdoors but personally I am expecting a few years or so until the case shows signs of wear. One thing I do like about the Ring is that it is powered by the wired doorbell connection and keeps is battery charged without any problem.Packaging for the Ring is very good. They have tried to cover just about all installation issues and this has been well done. Overall the Ring does work as advertised but communications conditions (internet, WiFi, and cell) need to be good. I think the Ring can be a good part of a home security system but to secure my home I added other items so supplement the Ring.",Unless you are in an area with good cell signal you may get slow notification

After securing the doorbell using an alternative method, it has worked perfectly. The picture quality is very good, and the app works well and is easy to use. The only thing I wish would be improved is the motion detection adjustments. Due to the location of my front door and doorbell, the setting that would work best for me seems to be between two of the available settings, so I am stuck either getting an alert every time a car drives up the street or not getting any alerts, even when a car pulls in my driveway. I assume this wont be changed since the Ring Pro allows for custom adjustments, but that alone isn't worth the extra money they charge for it.

And often it will stall, then immediately jump forward like 10 seconds. I've tried removing and uninstalling, and that doesn't help.  I have the same issues with it on all my devices: my MotoE phone, Kindle Fire HD 10, and high-performance Windows 10 desktop .

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 May 2020,M.V.,"The hd quality is better than expected and much less pixelated than the 1st generation. I returned the first generation after it started showing a weird blue dot in the images. So, I decided to give this one ago instead and realized soon enough the upgrade in quality of the video is much clearer. The install is easy, it comes with several back plates to adjust angles if needed. The battery life is really good. I only need to charge it once a month and it's sensitivity is set high. I have deliveries and pick ups at the house daily, usually from ups and fedex, we run a business, so I was expecting to have to recharge the battery more frequently. Overall, I think the features are great on the app. I would recommend trying this ring doorbell for a few extra bucks over the first generation.",Video quality is better than expected
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2018,Jagroo,"It has been fun to see who comes to my door during the day, and the behavior of the delivery people.  My doorbell was on a perpendicular wall to my door - which is goofy, but I was able to install using the wedge to get a better picture.  Motion trips when people clear the side of my garage - and that's good. The one thing I don't like is when it tells you that you have a live motion alert, you can't stop it to rewind and see what's going on until it's stopped. It will just give you live feed. The other problem with the perpendicular wall is that if I installed this directly on my vinyl siding, there would have been a gap behind it as it straddled two planks. I resided an area of my house with a vinyl board to mount everything to.  That was a pain in the butt, but it sure helped. 4 stars because it feels glitchy occasionally - but otherwise, I don't know what more to expect. My neighbor is ordering one, and I'll help him install. It's pretty easy to install to existing doorbell wires.",This has been fun - and revealing!!

My mistake. Installation was a breeze. I really like the thoughtful way they included everything you need including a masonry drill bit for drilling the anchor holes if you have an existing doorbell in a masonry wall as I did  They also included extension wires which I also ended up needing because my existing doorbell wires were very short. All in all a really easy install and set up. I also liked the choice of covers. I really didn't want the silver cover and was pleasantly surprised to have the more neutral brown color option.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Oct 2018,ZeroR2,"Ring implemented a feature called ""Motion Stop"" that stops recording after the Ring device no longer detects motion. The device stops after 30 seconds for battery-operated devices even if physically installed as hardwired. This sound good, but it doesn't work. This is a common complaint.  You can have a person walking up to the house and looking around in the first 30 seconds, the video stops recording and then the person can steal boxes. There would be no footage of the person stealing the boxes. No matter how much motion is detected, the camera stops recording. My guess is that they don't want to store too much data on their cloud (paid subscription) and hence limit to 30 seconds. How can this be useful? You would think that there would be a feature for the user to change the length of recording in the settings. There is also a large delay until the unit starts recording. I have a good router (Nighthawk) and extender (TP Link). When I test the signal strength with my phone next to the Ring, it is very good. I believe that Ring doesn't have a good WIFI hardware to send the signal. I would wait for further improvements until I would recommend this device.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,Joe D.,The doorbell 2 seems to work fine.  My complaint is with it's night mode.  There is a hum the is only present when the camera switching from day mode to night mode.  The sound seems to get louder if something gets closer tot the camera and the infra red light has more to pick up or reflect. This issue has been reported by a number users on the Ring forums.  I have tried all the things the Ring support team have suggested in the thread but the sound persist.  People have had their units replaced but the sound is in the replaced units as well.  You can hear the hum with your ear if you listen while the camera is in night mode and you put the doorbell next to ear.  Others in the forum say they hear it even when it is disconnected from the power transformer of the house and it is just running on its battery. It may be a bad batch or a design flaw that is not in a older version of the ring doorbell.  I am waiting to see if Ring fixes the issue and I am hoping to get mine replaced.  It seems senseless to replace it now with so many people reporting the same problem in the replacements.,I like it but noise flaw in night vision.

We were replacing a first generation ring and it came with a converter plate to avoid drilling new holes and some angle adjustment plates to get the best vantage point. Took me about 7 minutes to install. Charging the battery using USB took a lot longer than I expected, I hope to not have to do that often. So far the motion seems much better than the first product where we would get tons of false events from cars driving by, especially when it was hot.

I was hoping to be one of the success stories. I gave the product a fair chance (about 3 months) and tried several suggestions for improvement I found online. The long short of it is the motion sensor is flawed. Even at the closest setting of less than 5 feet cars over 30 feet away set off the sensor. The sensor is hit or miss when up close as well. It picks and chooses when to recognize a person standing directly in front of it. I have the doorbell hardwired so it has adequate power and a strong WiFi connection. The doorbell is also mounted at the proper height as recommended in the installation manual. The second issue I have is a useless speaker. I can hear people talking to me through the app but I cannot respond. No matter what I try all they hear is a muffled cracking noise.

This product is for you. However, if you live in 2019 and realize that security cameras have utilize a small SD card in them for about 10 years or more, this product does not have that. I also rate it two stars because,  more than half of the videos that alert you to motion at your door don’t show enough before footage, like where the person came from or if they were standing on the side of your house, office and then walk by the front door. You only see the video a few seconds after they are contacted by the camera. A few seconds is all a person needs to run by and do something shady. This is a serious flaw.  More than half my video show a person walking by and then disappearing out of the picture. If the camera were to record the before footage, you could at least have more information and determine whether it was relevant or not. Again, like other security cameras. It works great if you just want to use this device to see who is at your door for Amazon deliveries or the pizza guy/girl.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2019,Daryl,"Expensive rubbish. Avoid. Camera works well and provides excellent video quality, but, despite having fibre which Google WiFi is currently reporting as 102Mbps down and 20Mbps up, the concept of remotely intercepting and interacting with someone at your front door is absolute la-la land fantasy. I have a dedicated Google WiFi module within five (5) feet of my Ring2 and the Ring2 is showing as the only device on this module. Despite getting a doorbell ring promptly (although, on second thoughts, who knows how promptly if they're not at home and actually see the doorbell ringer arrive) it takes about 2 to 3 minutes to get the video ... by which time the guest/intruder (etc) has returned to their home country. Complete waste of time and money ... you can't record to your own device (computer storage) and their storage plan is irritatingly expensive when you have your own facilities. The motion detection sounds like a good idea but it's way too sensitive (even at minimum settings) if, like me, you have a front door close (about 12 feet) to a footpath and roadway. And the ""battery powered"" concept, although ""works well"" and with generous capacity, becomes an irritation after the first few removals to recharge. Easy to swap to a an online power supply but the product isn't worth the effort.

I I am excited to use my new Ring, but there were parts missing (wall anchors; template for drilling holes) and this item is billed as an ""easy installation""...except that it's not!  The drill bit included for installation may be suited to wood, but it does not work for brick. Even with the masonry bit I went and bought, I made very little progress toward drilling holes deep enough to anchor the Ring, and I install things electrical and plumbing-wise around my house all the time. And yes, they'll send a professional installer out if I'd like for another $92. It may be a good product, but getting to the point where I'll be able to use it seems problematic. Product itself would get 5 stars; the ease of getting to actually use the product gets 1 star.","Missing parts; NOT an ""easy installation""; poor customer care"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Msac,"***Edit / Update*** - Finally got it to work, by disabling Lookout security on my phone then enabling it again. Took 3 days since installation to get it going. Customer service still stinks but once they escalated it got much better. Subtracting 1 star for overall headache dealing with the below, and subtracting 1 star as I still don;t get all my alerts, just about every 3 out of 4. I would buy an improved version in the future, but holding off for now. 3/5 This was a bad purchase that I am now stuck with because I drilled holes into my concrete to hard wire it. The doorbell does not send notifications rendering this useless to view anyone live or while I am not home. I was on the phone with tech for 2 hours yesterday uninstalling, reinstalling, changing this, turning on that, blah blah and still do not get any notifications. They then email me asking me to reinstall the whole thing, which I do. Then they blame my wifi system, which is hilarious, because.. It Is an Amazon EERO mesh system! Once I told him that he was like oh no, its not your wifi system.. I respond back it does not work, and I have not heard from them again since. This is basically 100 dollar dumb doorbell. So after researching another hour or so on my own, it appears that everyone is having this issue on Android and yet they have done nothing to fix this issue. Look at the app ratings, it is in the 2 star range. Brutal. Do not buy, do not waste your money. I would totally return this if I didn't drill the template (which by the way is cheap plastic) already in concrete.",Problem solved but initial headache was dissapointing
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,Mark Sarria,"The doorbell video image is great. Very wide-angle POV. The audio is clear. The motion detection needs a lot of work. Shadows, trees, and cars cause the motion to trigger. I've lowered the sensitivity to its lowest setting and still reports a lot of false-positives. The motion detection in the ring is very basic. My suggestion to RING is to add a trip-wire analytic in conjunction with directional-flow to reduce false alarms. Trip-wire enables you to draw a virtual line in the image when someone crosses that line it triggers the alert. Direction-Flow enables the user to set parameters on the direction that must be crossed to trigger the alert. Just a thought.","Great Video, bad motion"

Unfortunately, it is basically useless if you do not subscribe to their monitoring. While we had the free trial, it worked perfectly fine--when we got notifications that there was motion at the door, we could activate it and see it immediately. There was a history that could be viewed as well. Now that the trial is over and I'm ""self-monitoring,"" the majority of the time it just never activates to let me see the live view when there's an alert of motion at the door. I was under the impression that we would be able to self-monitor and save any videos that we did a live view of. If/when I'm actually able to get the live view to work, I'm unable to save the video.

They said they would email us and send us a replacement, since it was still under warranty, but we never got either of them. Now our Ring only records and connects to live video occasionally.

Martinson,"Overall, I am happy with the Ring for my specific use.  I use it in conjunction with my Arlo system.  I really just wanted the Ring for a more visual theft deterrent as well as added visual angle with more natural way to communicate.  Arlo is more hidden and is harder to have conversations over.  I had issues with WiFi strength which required me to invest additional dollars into my WiFi setup.  Funny thing is that Arlo worked just fine and was even further away from my router than Ring.  Weird, but fixed.  The motion detection is not the best either.  However for me, Arlo picks up motion and is my primary.  So for my use case (to be a visual deterrent and to occasionally use as an intercom), it is fine.  If I didn't have my Arlo system, I would not be satisfied and would have returned the Ring.",Weak WiFi connection and spotty motion detection

Patrick,"I work at home and wanted a doorbell camera so I could see who was at the door so I could ignore Jehovah's Witnesses, Boy Scouts selling popcorn, etc.  The camera installed easily and I bought an angle kit as well as my door is on about a 40 degree angle to the sidewalk/street.  The video on the camera is good and the night vision is also very good.  However, the lag on the motion detection notification is 10 or 15 seconds from the router (which is 3 feet from the Ring) to my phone.  This is too long a delay.  And why can I not get the notifications to pop up on my computer where I am working all day instead of having to keep my cell phone on my desk.  Another irritation is I cannot get the motion detection to stop detecting cars driving by on the street in front of my house - the detection line is dragged almost to the foot of the steps, but I still get cars tripping the motion detector.  My last complaint, is the cost to save the video to the cloud.  I opted not to do this after using it for the free month.

But Ring 2 doorbell serves its purpose. It is great to have live video recording and thats why we got it. Works well during the day most times. Night time was missing a LOT of stuff. A bit bulky. Easy to install though  but no instructions on angle brackets. Plus angle brackets are way too expensive if u need more. Cheap $30/yr to record as opposed to a home security system, so cant complain too much. I may look into spotlight ring in addition because the left and right edges weren't catch anything even when my hubby walked across the lawn. And i wanted it especially for the cars but sometimes it wouldn't trigger. So we got the wifi extender cause it kept reloading and missing stuff and it didnt do much, but it is better. we will keep trying , but went thru all of the extensions in settings and all the faq's & suggestions; (hense the wifi extender)... so hoping that will help. Ring 2 so far is good for rings or close ups, but needs work, and could be a lot better especially for the hefty pricetag.",Ring 2 worth the recordjng & good for its purpose but could be better.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 May 2019,ArnBol,"I have had this up for around 1 week. It was relatively easy to install but heed other warnings if you will mount on brick as the included drill bit is not good enough to drill the 4 holes. Also, the security screw that is the final step to secure the faceplate was not in the bag of included hardware but was in a very small bag attached to the top of a card insert which was pushed into the doorbell!!  I almost threw it away before noticing it.After 1 week the battery is at 87% so by my math it should last 54 days. Not bad, but also not as long as advertised. The video picture is clear but the motion alerts do not activate until the person is almost right at the door and the motion zones are too broad so that there is always a trade-off where false alerts for vehicles also come through. It would have been nice if there was some sort of faint illumination on the unit because in a dark doorwell like mine, you really cannot see the Ring unit. However, I guess this would further reduce battery life. I paired it with the Ring chime which works well to give us audible alerts inside. Overall, I am happy and I would recommend this to others. I would give it 3.5 stars not 4 though, because of the issues I noted",Overall a good buy
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Toz,"I was very impressed with how amazingly well Ring placed product parts in the box. It is VERY WELL and thoughtfully done. The packaged instructions were better than average and their online video instructions were quite easy to follow.  I really like the look of the primary unit - the doorbell/camera. The quality of the product also seemed well manufactured.  I mounted the camera to two of the ‘angled’ boxes that help improve camera direction. I am a little concerned that stacking the boxes and then the camera is a little awkward looking and doesn’t seem as stable as it would be mounted to fewer boxes. There are some things I do not quite like. The Ring is mounted where my old doorbell was and hardwired, which saves having to charge the battery periodically, which seems like a minor hassle. The Ring is also mounted very close to a WiFi controlled switch for my outdoor lights, and Ring is causing the switch to malfunction. Ring is pretty clear with their online instructions to keep Ring away from smart devices. But in would be very impractical to move either the switch or Ring. But I guess I’ll have to , which will be another minor to moderate hassle. The ‘fisheye’ view is pretty OK, but I’m not thrilled with the night vision. The camera seems a little too sensitive.  Today was pretty windy with snow blowing around and outside holiday directions swaying around.  The unit detected motion about every hour two.  I don’t want to put Ring on snooze overnight, but may need to. I’m  That kind of defeats it’s most important function. My only ‘directions’ related complaint is that the instructions for hard wiring using the old doorbell’s low voltage supply is a bit confusing, and it’s very important to get it right because if you install the ‘diode’ when you’re not supposed to, the unit will supposedly be damaged. Ring should really amplify the warning and clarify how to wire correctly. Today is the first day of operation, so I’m not exactly sure how Ring will perform long term, but I’m pretty confident given the overall product quality and instructions. Oh - and their noted willingness to replace the unit for free if it is stolen tells me they REALLY will stand behind their product (hopefully I won’t need that service!). I’ll update my review in a month or so.","Pretty impressive overall, but a few issues"

The directions are easy to understand & it's easy to setup & install.

You can have multiple people get the alerts on their phones when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell. My wife & I both get the alerts.

It seems to pick up cars driving by the house better than people coming up to the door from the sidewalk.  More often than not, I see the person's back on the camera AFTER they rang the doorbell.  So I'll see a delivery person drop the box and ring the doorbell, but I won't see them walking up to the door, which kind of defeats the purpose of even having the Ring.  The picture is better than the original ring because it's 1080p, but that's the only thing better about the Ring 2 over the original.  Ring really needs to get their stuff together when it comes to the motion detection.  The Live View is also not that great, as sometimes it takes 30 seconds for it to load up.  My router and wi fi connections are about 15 feet from the ring, so the excuse of a bad internet connection does NOT apply.  Overall I'm disappointed with this and every Ring I've owned.  The best thing it serves as is a deterrent.  People see a camera looking at them and if they're up to no good, they turn and walk away.

Cons: the lag time is awful. My UPS guy is back in his truck by the time I get the motion sensor chime.  So if a guest rings the doorbell he/she must stand around waiting until the device loads the camera. If you’re in a place with fabulous WI-FI you can check to see whose at the door, if not it won’t load the camera. Every time my home WI-FI goes down I have to reset it. Really not worth the cost.

I had to use two of the mounting adapters to get it to fit well on my narrow door molding - that was a pain -- it would be nice if there was a narrow to wide adapter.","It works OK, but...."
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2018,Stephen Hannant,"Product does not work as advertised, specifically around the motion detection range.  Installed the unit with a corner wedge, and set motion to 5 feet.  My house faces onto a street, and the sidewalk is about 10-12 feet from the door, so didn't want to pick up foot traffic.  Unit still detected all the foot traffic.  Ring replaced the unit as defective after attempting to fix with firmware update. Was next advised to install an angle bracket (supplied), and this did not fix the issue. Was next advised to install 2 angle brackets (both supplied), and have been encountering issues still with the unit. It will now still detect people 12+ feet away, but won't capture people walking up to the door.  I've videos recorded of me leaving my house, but then no video of me ever coming back in.  Not really good for a security camera if it can't capture someone at your front door. The secondary issue is that the materials used for the brackets (both angle and corner) are extremely cheap.  If you're not careful during installation, the head of the screw will eat right through the plastic.  I've had them replace 2 brackets that this happened to. I liked the video quality and ease of use of the unit when I got it, but it is just plagued with basic detection issues.  Not sure why it can't register distance, but it's not worth having a $200 unit that can only function as a video doorbell.","Motion detection is flawed, cheap materials used for accessories"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2018,Gary Caluducan,"I cannot believe how much I actually am impressed with this device. I was weary at first because I have never purchased anything like this before. Also, I am terrible with all things handy so that at times stops me from taking leaps. However, honestly with installation it was a very simple task. The instruction videos are incredibly helpful and so is the customer service over the phone. I am not afraid to ask questions or for help. I was not on hold for long and everyone was easy to understand and resourceful. Quick story when I was replacing my existing doorbell and attaching the wires the screws on the back of the device are SUPER SMALL! I dropped one during the installation process and there are no extras provided so thats why I called. Customer service came to the rescue and sent me replacements immediately. Problem solved. Once installed our doorbell works great. I love the app and again just so impressed with the quality at the affordable price. I was shopping between this and nest security camera since I already am happy with my thermostat. However when price was similar it came down to wanting to be with a company fully dedicated to home security, not just trying to expand into the space. It also helps that its fully endorsed by amazon. Overall super happy with this device and I have been referring and showing everyone how cool it is. I already know we will be expanding our services with Ring in the future.",Impressive!

My first impression is the 1080 upgrade is drastically better than the older model. That alone made the change worth it. Secondly, I added two wedges for this one to point the camera down 10 degrees and my false motion alerts have stopped from the most part. The Ring Doorbell One without the wedge picked up just about every car that went down my street! Just checked my app and I have only gotten one alert today  in about 9 hours and it was a guy walking his dog past my house. I have also had the opportunity to direct deliveries to more secure locations other than my front porch via the intercom on about 4-5 occasions.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Mar 2019,Sheila Reeves,"We purchased the Ring 2 doorbell on the Black Friday sale in late Nov 2018.  It worked beautifully for about 3 months.  We did purchase the cloud subscription (which I didn’t realize was truly necessary for the device to be used effectively until after I purchased it). In early March of 2019, the device began to malfunction where it records back-to-back videos, nonstop.  It started this behavior at 4AM.  To date I have had 5 calls to tech help with each lasting a minimum of 1hr and each call with a different tech advisor -read lots of repetitive solution attempts. Some of which held no logic to me, I finally convinced them it was a defective device.  They offered to send me a replacement. I went with an upgraded model replacement that costs me $50 more.

It really is true that with a Ring Video Doorbell, ""you're always home.""  Even when I was in a foreign country, I was able to answer my mother's front door in the U.S. several times, and the people who rang the doorbell had no idea that I was actually thousands of miles away.  I did not particularly like to dismount the unit to charge it but the Ring Video Doorbell 2 solved that problem with the unit's new battery system which easily pops in and out.  I simply bought an extra/spare battery and as soon as I get the message (from RING) that the battery is running low, I charge the spare and and do the switch the next day.","Incredible Security, Incredible Peace of Mind!"
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Feb 2018,LOU,"UPDATED Original review: First, let me say that I have a Ring Pro and a Ring 2. In addition, I have 2 chimes. If you get a Ring, you will want the chime too. BUT there is a large caveat I'll discuss later. The Ring video seems to work well and if you did not know, you CANNOT get color any IR sensor used at night. The motion sensor and the bell work well especially through the chimes. The app (Apple) seems to work well though there is a small catch on using the setup that is included. And if I could stop here I would be giving a high rating. So what is wrong? - As someone else said, there is a time delay (yes, even if you store the image on the Ring cloud). And if you have phone in hand, the doorbell will ring long before the you check the motion. Even when you have your phone in your hand, when motion is detected at 2am, it hits you like the air raid siren going off on your first night in a battle zone, trying to get Ring to open. - you NEVER sit around with phone in hand. You are watching television or something else (Ring is NOT an app on your smart TV, Ring is not an app on your computer, Ring is not an app on your up-to-date auto, and Ring video does not pop up even on your closed iPhone.). That is why even though the Chime is great, there are many situations when it can be too late. - (picky) if you don't like the black & white Infrared, and therefore keep a light on outside, you will be awakened by a moth flying by, or a gecko staring into the lens. Even if the outdoor light is off, lighting flashes from a nearby storm may give you motion. - Setup. The app will walk you through all the steps you need to take. There are a few gotcha's. When it tells you to choose the network, does it mean your wifi network or the Ring doorbell network - no big thing. The problem is that almost every time you make some error (and I do) you have to go back to the beginning. And if you think the email address it wants is your wife's so you can share, but it turns out to be the owner's address, you are screwed. And if you become the shared user, there ain't nothing you can do. So, I worked out everything and finally got everything as I wanted it when I tried to add another Ring. That is when everything that could go wrong did go wrong. And now I am at square one. UPDATE: August 3, 2018 Thanks to Ring app updates, Ring support and Ring additions I updated my rating from 2 to 4 stars. Thanks to the app update, I no longer have to have my wife as an owner in order to allow her to see all or a few devices. I can set that up as the the owner myself and she (as a user) can see what she tells me to let her see. Ring support showed me how to make her a co-owner but now it is not necessary. Thanks. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Ring app for the PC/MAC. Works great and pops up as something happens. Wish Apple would let that happen with their iPhones. Two picky comments: can you put in the expand button that, say, youtube allows? This new app was in the app store, but it did not jump out at me (had to look around and then I lost sight of it and had to copy it from one computer to another). Can you get it so that it comes up in a ""security camera"" search? Um... can you get Comcast to add this app to Xfinity xi (hey, they have Facebook for instance)? Finally, the question of slowness. Ring support replied to my original review telling me I might need a WiFi upgrade. After some research (more devices on the WiFi means slower response) I am in the middle of upgrading my WiFi. THIS IS NOT EASY. On the other hand, I wonder if the number of users on the Ring cloud has any effect too. When two of us look on our phones to see what caused the alert, nothing is available. This happens on the cell also. It doesn't happen if we are both shopping on Amazon. With Amazon owning this company, will it now be on the Amazon cloud?",Great technology looking for smooth usefulness (update: and it is getting closer)

You have to subscribe to view them. It will only give you 5-7 seconds of live view after motion detection. So I go to click the links to subscribe to a plan. It then takes you to 10 different articles about subscribing with no obvious “click and subscribe” through the ring app. So I go to the ring website to find a plan to subscribe but the site seems to not be working. We also changed internet carriers since installing the ring doorbell and there is no where on the app to simply change the WiFi carrier...you have to physically take the doorbell off to change it.

I had even planned to eventually go to the Ring Security system. However, I and the Ring Support could never get the doorbell to work as intended. First, the good things: The notification of someone at the door was very fast, both from the motion sensor and the push of the button, the picture was great and had a nice wide angle, the video resolution was good but not good enough to read a car license plat at 25 feet. Now the problems: first the audio is so low that it is essentially impossible to hear the visitor nor can the visitor hear the person inside. Second, when someone is detected at the door, the notification screen pops up giving you a chance to either answer the door or not. The problem is that pop up only last 4 to 5 seconds; not enough time pick up the phone and respond. Ring Support said to just load the Ring app and go into Live mode. That takes too much time. Furthermore, when you go into Live mode it only takes effect after next button press. Either this product was brought to market before it was read or the support group cannot really support the product.

I have a porch roof, as most people do, over my door.  The RING doorbell automatically exposes for the daylight behind the person at the door resulting in the person at the door being a silhouette, black, no features.  HDR mode didn't not help this.  I was on the phone with customer service for over an hour resetting the RING all over again.  Apparently, they have a way to adjust exposure on THEIR end, but the image stayed exactly the same when we finished.  While I was on hold (numerous times) I went on-line to find a solution.  There were complaints to RING about this very issue THREE YEARS ago and their response was ""a solution is coming soon"".  I guess if you're selling enough of these doorbells, it doesn't matter if it works properly, they fly off the shelves anyway.  So RING, if you're reading this, a simple firmware update can fix this.

It does not work (out of the box. Unfortunately I did not realize this for months since I didn't use it much. So I looked up online to see if it was something I'd done wrong in the installation.

If the doorbell button is actually pushed the RING2 will actually notify us. The only way to really know if a package was delivered is to get it from the front porch when seen in person. We have a multiple camera Security DVR system that we have rewound and watched multiple deliveries where the person is right in front of the door bell and the RING2 never detects anything. I Definitely DO NOT Recommend - Big$$ waste of money - I would return it except it looks Good and works sometimes and keeps us busy checking our phones. Because of the trouble of demounting, patching holes, reconnecting old door bell and submitting a return, packing and taking to a UPS office is why it remains.

I bought it some 2 years ago and did not install until a month ago, just too busy and did not have a smart phone until 2 months ago.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Sep 2018,Me,"The Ring Video Doorbell 2 gives me peace of mind whether I’m home or away. The installation is free with the purchase. After my first installation appointment, I realized that it wasn’t the best spot because it was facing my neighbor’s door and I didn’t want to invade their privacy. I called Amazon and had no problem having them send someone again to move it for me.  The battery life is great, I had the doorbell indoors for about a week before the installation, with constant traffic then outdoors with less traffic, two weeks later the battery was at 80%. Left outdoors, it will most likely last for three months. I bought a spare battery just so I would not stay without the doorbell for a day when it dies. It takes about 7h to charge. The image quality is perfect. I snooze motion alerts during the day so as not to be alerted of my neighbors’ moves, that way I’m only notified when someone rings the doorbell. Ring gives me the extra peace of mind needed to sleep well. It comes with a lifetime theft warranty. If your doorbell is stolen and caught on camera, which it will as long as the battery is charged, Ring will replace it for free. I’m very satisfied with the product and service.",The peace of mind provided by Ring is priceless.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Oct 2018,LMR,"I've been using the Ring Bell for several months now and do not recommend.  First, the battery life is poor and requires recharging every two weeks or less.  Second, the response is very slow, so if the doorbell is rung, it can take up to a minute to view who is there.  Third, and most significantly, I have had packages placed at the door, and Ring did not record it.  Yet, it records passing cars on the street, but not when someone parks directly in front of the house.  The motion algorithm is poorly designed.  Fourth, it has no free feature for saving videos, so if you don't pay, you lose all functionality except for the doorbell function.  On the other hand, I have two Nest cams that I use indoors and out, which rarely miss events, have faster response time, send emails, have free video saving, and better detection algorithms.  Ring is definitely a poorly designed product and I will replace it.","Slow response, misses key events, false positives, poor battery life"

The only down side is the amount of time i takes to view the camera image.  When someone pushes the door bell it takes to long (for me) to open the app and do a live connection.  When movement is detected it takes around 45 seconds too see the video clip to see what activated it.  As strictly a door bell with two way communication it is great.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2020,Bill Carbin,We got Ring 2 doorbells for our back and front doors. We really like the ability to see who’s at our door both remotely and even when we’re in the house. We had a couple guys come and knock on the door and we could hear one of them say under his breath “Ring” we think they were casing our house and the Ring changed their minds. I think it would be a better device if you could set the length of time it records when motion is detected - or better yet an option to record until motion stops. As it is you get a 30 second snapshot and you can choose to view “Live” but it doesn’t record. Motion detection can be a bit tricky to set to your liking.

I have a hardwired application. The Ring 2 was $152.00 and worth the extra costs. It comes with several wedge brackets, two push-button cover plates and the mounting screws. The Ring doorbell has a cheesy back mounting bracket, with cheesy hanger tabs, that needs to be perfectly mounted to a very hard and to a very flat surface.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2017,Mark 321,"Let me start by saying, I probably received a defective item. It could not detect motion beyond 4 feet. Made several phone calls to Ring support (highest recommendation to Ring support! They are great!), we tried trouble shooting several options, finally Ring said item is probably defective and to return it. Ring did say this was the first he encountered this particular issue being caused by a defective device. I returned item and replaced it with a Ring Spot Light Cam. Few things worth noting about Ring. There are other products out there of equal quality and lower price that do almost everything Ring does. The one feature they don't offer is ability to record events and save them (this is a paid service offered by Ring for either $36 year for one device or $100 year for unlimited devices). This ability to record and save events is an necessary evil. I've learned it's great being able to instantly view events live as they happen, but that is not always an option. Ring, and other companies, are limited by your cell phone ability to get good reception to transmit the quantity of data necessary to view events live as they happen. If you are in a poor or dead cell reception area, you cannot view events live (true for Ring and all companies offering the same service). Hence, why the ability to record and save events for later viewing is a necessity if security is important. To the best of my knowledge, Ring is only company offering this option, or only company offering this option at an affordable price with reliable and quality platform. As for their products. They come very nicely packaged. Reality is, their quality is no different than most of the high end motion/security lights/cameras offered on the consumer market. What this means is they work good enough, but don't expect perfection. You MUST have decent wifi and the security devices need to be at closer range than many other wifi enable products due to the fact you need minimum 2 Mb speed with a good RSSI strength for the items to function as advertised. Don't believe the speeds you internet provider tells you they are providing, most of them lie. They might say you have 50 Mbs, reality is you are probably downloading at 4-5 Mbs. Internet providers use unrealistic benchmarks tested through a hardwire connection to provide their advertised speeds. Reality is, most consumers are using WiFi connection downloading data more demanding then the benchmarks. My point, if your residence has 10 Mbs speed and you are already using several devices on that wifi, check your speed first. If you do not have good wifi, these Ring devices will never work to expectations. Another thing, avoid buying battery operated devices if the device will be in an area that has lots of traffic. My kids going in and out the front door drained the battery down in one week. You cannot turn off these devices through the app, you can only change the settings to not sense motion, which is a pain. I bought some wifi smart outlets to flick the Ring devices on and off as needed. With all that being said, in my opinion Ring is the best option out there. Their customer service support is excellent, which is reason enough to choose Ring. The products as good as any other company out there. Setting up the sensitivity and zones on the devices might be a little challenging at first, as the zones are only approximate as is the sensitivity. Another little tidbit that might be of interest. The motion devices need motion to occur for a second or two. So if someone runs or walks past a motion zone, there is a possibility it might not be detected. Be aware of this when testing your motion areas, if you walk by an entrance way quickly that is supposedly being protected, it may not sense you unless you actually stand there for a second or two. It tends to be hit or miss. Overall, Ring devices (with exception of doorbell which I cannot recommend) are good at what they do. You can communicate through it, turn lights on and off through it, activate/deactivate siren at will, zoom in and limited panning (camera doesn't actually move but you can move within the viewing area). These devices do have very wide and large viewing areas, the advertised viewing areas are accurate. Again, I would recommend a wired spot light cam instead of the doorbell (it has better video quality, same communication ability, plus a light and siren option), both are same price. Overall, Ring is the best option out there and has excellent customer support backing their products. I would recommend Ring above most others.","Ring is best option available for certain needs, this particular item did not meet expectations"

If I can resolve all of the issues, I will raise this to 5 stars, as the device is good when it works. Audio is so horrible you can't even understand it most of the time.  I've been on the phone 3 times to tech support.  Last call I even talked to a supervisor.  Video pixelates, sometimes looks like a photographic negative, other times nothing but a black screen.  I have a tri-band router that is literally 5 steps away from the front door, yet they tell me it's my wifi causing the problem.  2 support people tell me my RSSI is very good, third says it's bad.  Even though their own app says the RSSI reading is better than most. Final straw came today.  In regards to the audio, for 3 weeks that I've had it the person on the outside has never been able to hear anything but static.  Today while I had support on the phone it was understandable for the first time since I've had the thing but the audio quality was still terrible and staticky.  The support person told me that's what it's supposed to sound like.  OK, even so, it's the first time it's even been understandable. Don't buy this garbage.  Not worth 2 dollars, much less 200.",0 stars to support

This product lets me know that fact by detecting motion and announcing it over Alexa, but by the time I get my phone powered up and the app running, it is way too late.  I've re-installed my old door camera which does not record but allows me to see who is there within seconds, not several minutes.  Since I did not subscribe to the Nest Aware program, the product does not record alerts......therefore it is a very expensive doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2019,Missy M.,I love the ring video 2. I have it in the most active setting for movement which means it detects everything and it was installed over 2 weeks ago and the battery is going strong. I will prob adjust the settings because most of my alerts are drive byes. I love knowing that if anyone approaches the front door I will know-so long as I have Internet. So far it’s been pretty boring which is a good thing! But what is nice is I know exactly when a package arrives and if I’m not home I can ask a neighbor to grab it for me.,Feel safer

Pros: The night vision works very well. The battery life is phenomenal. It was easy to set up and install. Cons: Twice I’ve had large items delivered and placed on the porch in direct view of the camera (less than 8 feet from the device) and the motion sensor was not activated (neither time was the device activated within the preceding hour).

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Mar 2020,Alan L Thompson,"I bought this after my original one just stopped working. First, there is constant noise feedback when trying to talk on the 2-way function. Second, it is very slow to connect when someone rings it and you try and answer it, very weak signal and it's only about 25 feet straight line from my router. I usually don't end up connecting until the person is already gone. Last, and worst, the motion detection really sucks. No matter the setting I put it on it, it often doesn't detect someone until they are right at the camera or walking away. My Arlo cameras perform much more reliably and I'll try their doorbell camera next. I'm done with Ring.

It has, over the last year, gotten slower detecting motion so I catch people when they're walking away from the camera instead of up the driveway.  However, I'll probably never buy another Ring product on account of their Customer Service, which seems good at first, but the agents read off a script and can't really help you. If the Ring notified me of motion when it occurred, and the Customer Service was better, I'd probably give a better rating, but when spending a bunch of money on technology, the subsequent support is as important as the product.","Ring 2, 3 stars.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Apr 2020,Kerra Hudson,"I bought this and installed it yesterday - here are my initial thoughts: Setup:  There are some important steps they really gloss over.  Ok, fine, just call their support.  The first support tech spoke very poor English, and we got disconnected.  He never called me back.  Not good.  The second support tech was much better, and explained the missing steps from the manual. Installation:  Excellent review on this - comes with everything needed, and it was a breeze to install.  It took *maybe* 5 minutes outside. ....then the reality set in.  This product (and I’ve read this includes most of the ring products) has an awful WiFi antenna(s).  Standing next to my new Ring device, my iPhone has full WiFi bars (at 5Ghz), and the Ring has poor signal (at 2.4Ghz).  Hmmm, that should be the other way around.  Thanks, Ring, now I have to spend even more money to upgrade my wifi setup.  Fortunately for me, I already have a mesh system, and can simply add another device closer to the Ring. More importantly, however, *should* I have to buy more hardware to make the Ring work, when every other WiFi device I hold next to it has perfect signal to the same AP? UPDATE:  Added a 2.4Ghz mesh to my system near the Ring, and it corrected my issues:  very slow notifications, inability to pull up video, etc.  SO... this is the fix, which is fine, if they would have been up front about the product's limitations.  Now that I've done this, I'm a happy owner.  I'm leaving my original review because they should be more transparent - shame on you for that, Ring.",Terrible WiFi Antenna Design - Plan on Additional Expenditures
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jan 2020,Alan Levy,The Ring 2 does the job.  Battery life in the east coast winter is at least 3 months in my location.  Packaging is excellent as are the  installation and set up instructions.  Works well with Alexa.  So what is not to like?  1.  No ability to save video or even photographs to local media of any type.  For this price it should be able to save to a local share.  2.  There are clearly privacy issues with the neighborhood app.  3.  As far as I can tell you can't use Alexa to make lights turn on in the house when the Ring spots movement at night.  4.  Alexa can't automatically show live view on an echo show or spot when the Ring spots movement.

Overall, I'm happy with it. The Wifi connection could be better, but its adequate, since my router is about 15' from the device. The motion detection works as needed. Even if notification tends to be delayed by a few seconds, I'm willing to deal with it. My big complaint is the audio from my Galaxy S9 to the doorbell. When trying to talk, the sound is echoed and sounds like I'm ""in a well"". Every time I've tried to speak to someone outside, they cannot hear me and just get a terrible reverberation sound. It means that answering the door remotely isn't an option for me. My wife's iPhone does not have this same issue.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2020,Cole Sandberg,"I would not spend the money again. I've found several features of the ring lacking. It does work as a doorbell, and alerts you when there is motion or a person at your door, but what I've found is the app is very slow to initialize the camera so you can see or talk to them. The app is also very clunky when trying to playback. I also am disappointed in Amazon's failure to make their products work together with ease. I bought the ring and an echo show together, thinking I could use the show to see who is at the door. Well they've failed to allow the echo show to automatically display the doorbell. It can automatically announce that there is someone at the door, but there is no setting or routine you can create to make the screen pop up the ring video stream. The only solution I've found is to have a separate echo tell the show to display the doorbell. Really frustrating, especially since they are both Amazon products. My last frustration is the method of aiming the camera. Instead of a pan and tilt on the camera lens, ring supplies 2 mounting plat wedges (one for left/right, one for up/down). Problem is you are locked into the supplied angles, and if you need to use both, your ring doorbell now looks weird sticking out away from the house. Most of the time when I get an alert of someone at my door I end up bypassing the doorbell and going straight to my wyze security camera.","A lot of room for improvement, very disappointed."

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2018,Emad,"I had the doorbell for more than 2 weeks, most of this period I was trying to have a proper connection between the device and my network. I live in an apartment, not too much distance between my door, where the device is mounted and my router. I have FIOS 200/200Mb fiber connection. but yet the door bell misses a lot of motions and few button presses. Even when motion sensor is triggered,  the camera start recording after anything between 15-60 seconds, and most of the time, voice will start to record after another 10-15 seconds, while most of the time I will get the notification delayed too. When I contacted their support their asked me to run few tests that involved removing the device, resetting it, speed tests...etc but nothing solved the problem. at the end they suggested a chime pro (their wifi extender) and left me on my own. Anyway, I'm not going to dash another $50 to help their device to connect my 10 feet away router, while I had a skybell that never had any of those problem. luckily I'm still in the return window and this what I will do.","Good concept, bad communication, poor customer service."

This thing is great. You cannot beat this product for what it does and how it performs. Especially at the affordable price it is at compared to other home security products. It feels great to be alerted of someone approaching my door. Especially when receiving my Amazon or other deliveries. People are more aware what this can do and the video it captures. I believe it discourages a lot of thieves from stealing your packages too. If they see the little lite up Halo I’m sure most people with think twice about coming close. The 2 way communication is good. Of course there is a small delay on the back and forth speaking but I have seen worse with other products out there. So far this product meets my expectations. What else is great is that there is a community on the app within your vicinity that are keeping a close eye on people up to no good. We can share videos to keep and eye out for them or just being aware that they are close. Also it helps with lost pets. You can post found pet wondering around.

I'm happy to finally have some kind of peace of mind that my property is secure.  However: I would really like to give this product 5 stars, but after a few weeks of tinkering, unfortunately I have to echo some of the complaints of others.  I just can't get the motion settings to work for me- I get constant ""false"" notifications from both this and my Spotlight cam- squirrels running around, cars passing by in the street far out of the alleged motion range I set, etc.  However, twice this week I've had packages delivered to my front door with zero notification/activation from either my Ring Doorbell 2 or the accompanying Spotlight Cam, meaning apparently there is a significant chance a package can be delivered or stolen without triggering either camera.  This is unacceptable. The blue sensitivity area in the motion settings menu is absolutely not a true representation of the real range of the unit, which is incredibly frustrating. When the camera/doorbell does sense motion, most of the time what I get is the back of the delivery driver/mailman- meaning it takes so long for the camera/doorbell to activate that if a thief were to move at a moderate to fast speed, it's likely he will be able to complete his mission without being caught on video in any significant way. The camera only records for 20-30 seconds so it's also common that you miss the beginning and end of the event. I've found that when paired/linked with a spotlight cam set at a higher motion sensitivity, the Doorbell works better because it is triggered earlier.  But why should we purchase additional products to compensate for poor software and slow reaction time? I imagine this works really well if you have a long driveway or a lot of space between the door and the street.  I don't. TL DR: the software needs a lot of work.  Either put up with constant false alarms at a higher motion sensitivity or risk missing the 1 in 1000 event you want to have on video.","Not great, but best when paired with other Ring cams"

Most of the time it will record about 30 seconds of video, which is suitable for most motion situations.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2020,Emerson Hevia,"I bought this product on Cyber-Monday for $100.18, about half the price Amazon is charging now, and after a month of use I found it not to be worth the money even though I paid half the price. Here are some of the highlights of my experience ring Doorbell 2: 1. The installation App refused to work with my android phone, a Samsung Galaxy 8. I called customer service and they did not have a solution. They said that I should try installing it with an iPhone or just return it. I took the bother to beg a relative who has an iPhone to do the installation with her phone. To my surprise, the installation worked fine with the iPhone, but no matter how many times I tried to install it again with any of the Android phones in our house, it failed. So if you have an Android phone, chances are that you will not be able to install this product. 2. I bought this product along with the Echo Show, as Alexa had an “Skill” for Ring. Even though Alexa’s audio notifications worked ok, they were broadcasted on every Echo speaker in the house. There was no way to select which Alexa’s device(s) I wanted to hear the notifications. Moreover, I expected Echo Show to display the video from the camera once an alert was received, but it did not. As a matter of fact, the camera’s video was not shown on any of the devices were I had the App installed, neither on the Echo Show. I had to ask Echo Show to display a live video in order to see who was at the door. 3.  When the “Cloud Subscription” was in the trial period you would be able to see a recorded video of every alert. There were too many False Alerts, and there was no way to manage which videos you wanted to keep. Once the Subscription was over, there were no videos at all and the video stopped working. In order to see what an alert was about, you have to go to “Live View” which takes at least 3 minutes to display the video from the camera. This product, at this price, should offer a memory card as an alternative store the videos, rather than forcing you pay in order to get the video functionality working. 4. I would not want my videos to be stored in a “Cloud”, especially when there have been reports of hackers intruding to your ring cameras. Let along to pay for exposing you to this danger. 5. When I got the product, it took me about 16 hours to charge the battery the first time. It lasted only a couple of weeks. After recharging it, I had to adjust the device’s sensitivity in order to save power. Even though I reduced every parameter to the minimum, the battery charge lasted only 3-4 weeks. 6. After the cloud subscription ended, it became very erratic on the motion alerts … about 50% missing motions, and a lot of false alerts. 7. This product was designed to keep you paying a subscription. It may not seem that much right now. But then there is the question that if they decide to double or triple de subscription price, you will be left with the trap of either pay as much as they demand or end up with a crippled device. On the positive side, I can say that I can buy from Amazon with the confidence that they guarantee returns and refunds of their products, should they not meet your expectations.",My “Ring Video Doorbell 2” evaluation: not worth it and way overpriced

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2017,Mike H.,"Ring really shines at their doorbells. I have 2 of the Ring Video Doorbell 2 series, a floodlight and a Spotlight Camera (which is changing to Hardwire, the Battery ones are not for me) Out of all their products I have, I especially love the doorbells the most. They make all the difference. What's sad is that during the night my Floodlight Camera by Ring sometimes doesn't pick up a person walking down our shared sidewalk with other neighbors. However, the Doorbell, if the decide to choose our path, catches them before they even get near the door. And consistently as well. I haven't had an issue where the Doorbells misses anyone, even at night. That's something that the Floodlight, while works perfectly during the day, can't say or do when up against the Doorbells. Probably the biggest thing that makes me happy is Ring's Customer Service. I had a doorbell that wasn't connecting to my router, which I found out later was my fault since I didn't allow random MAC's to connect if at a certain point. The lady on the phone still was amazing, doing everything she could to get it going, only eventually to send a replacement. Few hours later I found the problem, told them the issue, and sent the new one back to them. Morale of the story; I have not seen customer service as Ring does. They do care on their products, and they want you to be happy with it. That's something you don't see often these days. I am with Ring Protect $100/year service since I have more than 3 cameras. The story above was when I was on their Free Trial, so be as it may with your customer service. Because of the above, I bought more of their products. It does make a difference. My only gripe; if it is valid to be one is that the Battery life for these Doorbells are not even close to 6 months. I generally get at most 2 months for my one door, and 1 month on the other door that uses the shared sidewalk. While my settings are a little higher, I think even at light usage with Light frequency recordings will probably only yield 4 months of battery at most (Midwest/Great Lakes States area) However! I wouldn't gripe much on that, as 1-2 months to swap a battery is no big serious issue. When I first got these I thought max 14 days. Nice! Overall I recommend these Doorbells. They do have a longer range than it says in my opinion. It may not be suitable for someone's door at about 10 feet from a street. It might just catch everything. They do provide a mount that lowers the camera facing about 20 degrees downward to help alleviate that a little, but it still may not be perfect. I've noticed with any Ring product with anyone, your mileage and experience really varies on where your at (battery), location of your door(s) (sensitivity), and quality of video (Internet Speeds/Distance from Router to Device). I'd say; Go for it, and try them out. At least Ring backs their products from my experience.",Ring's Doorbells are nearly Perfect!

I've been using Ring doorbells for over a year now and I've never had an issue. Set up is easy and fast and the ability customize your motion settings is a real plus. Overall I'm very happy with the product, if I had to complain about anything it would be that it takes about 10 hours to fully charge the battery (not really a major issue considering the battery lasts for about 5 weeks) but if you have a hard wire set up its not a problem at all.",Great Doorbell

I live in Oregon so it's not like it's super bright and sunny here!  Also the lag time between the alert and when it shows you the motion seems long.

I tried the LaView doorbell first because of the reviews I read when I was shopping for a doorbell camera.  However, the setup was very difficult and once setup it lasted a day and disconnected from my app.  Unfortunately, logging in didn’t work and I had to start the install process over.  I also received over 50 notifications in one day.  LaView doesn’t have the ability to adjust motion sensitivity with only a doorbell camera.  If you have multiple cameras and a master control box it is my understanding that you can then adjust the sensitivity for motion.  I will say that the camera quality is better than the Ring camera but for what I need it to do the ring camera works just fine. Now, for the Ring setup.  This is where they shine!  The instructions were very easy to follow, the mounting hardware was comprehensive and I didn’t need any tools but what was provided by Ring.  The sync with the app was seamless and works well.  I am also able to log in with my iPad as well as my wife’s iPhone with no issues.  I’ve seen negative reviews on the Ring which made me shy away intitially.

The doorbell only registered motion in one test out of the many that I did. The wifi is equally poor, as it has an ""extremely weak"" signal despite being only about 12 feet from our wireless router.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Mar 2020,Andrew Soraci,"Very easy to self install. Works well, but my biggest complaint is the short video recordings. Any motion or doorbell ring results in a 30 second clip, though you miss the first couple seconds due to the video loading and after 30 seconds, the video ends even if there is still motion outside. I would have liked to have an option with retroactive video saving and constant recording while motion is still present. Also being able to adjust the motion zones a bit better would be nice. It would be great if I could increase the range in a specific direction and also decrease it in another. The app also takes a long time to load, meaning if there is motion or a doorbell ring, by the time you get into the app, the person may be gone.

However, contrary to what I expected, it takes a long time for the Ring info to show up on my phone, so I'm still getting to the door before Ring notifies me anyway. At one point, tech support suggested that the problem was that my wi-fi signal wasn't strong enough, so I invested more money in a wi-fi extender, but haven't seen any change. So the whole system has been expensive without providing any benefit. I'm sorry now that I got rid of my old doorbell. 2) Customer service: I recently changed my network name and password, so the Ring isn't working at all. I haven't been able to find any clear instructions about how to reset the info on the Ring, and tech support appears to be unavailable at this time (during Covid).

To start, I got the battery-powered version, and living in the city, there's lots of action outside of my home, so even though I turned the camera so it's parallel with the street, it picks up lots of motion, and the battery is dead in one week or less.  It's a big battery and charging takes 8+ hours.  Additionally, the idea of using my phone (via the app) with this product is unrealistic.  Someone rings the doorbell, I get a notification, need to unlock my phone, load the app, and wait for the video to load.  This process takes about 15 seconds, which doesn't sound like an eternity, but I've learned it's longer than any delivery person is ever willing to wait.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The Ring Doorbell 2 has such a slow response time to motion it is a useless piece of junk and the live view function in the iphone app often requires several tries (and sometimes minutes) to connect.  It does not work as advertised.  I have no idea how or why this is getting so many positive reviews. When the mailman delivers a package to my door, he parks his truck in front of the driveway, walks up the driveway and the walkway to the door (all of which are in the motion sensing region which is set to a hair below the max setting), delivers the package, then walks back out to his truck.  By the time I get the notification on my phone about 30 seconds later (after he’s gone!), all the recorded video captured is him getting back into his truck and driving away!  When I open the app and hit live view it often hangs and takes 2-4 tries to get it to connect.  Once it finally connects the video is nice and clear and not choppy or anything, but it takes 30-120 seconds and several tries to connect to live video in the first place!  It’s as if the doorbell goes to sleep and won’t wake up.  The performance of the Ring Doorbell 2 is absolutely terrible and so is the iphone app. Calling their tech support is a complete waste of time, the only thing they do is try to blame it on the internet connection and/or router.  I have a 160 Mbps connection and a nice high-end router which is only 20 feet from the doorbell (and I can pick up the same strong wifi signal inside my neighbor’s house about 100 feet away, and at the farthest corners of my yard).  Still, just for fun, I moved the router directly behind the front door to test it, maybe 2 or 3 ft from the doorbell, and the performance was the same. Next, it was not clear that without paying for their service, there is absolutely no video recording capability whatsoever.  None.  Not even temporarily for someone who was just at your door 2 min ago.

This should be in big bold text on the amazon sight.  I would not have purchased that if I knew that. The battery charge did not last as long as they said it would. Sometime the you review the film and nothing is there because it did not turn on at time. It might be better if there was electricity to it but I do not have that.

The ring will tell You when a car passes by but you can adjust the range, so that is a plus.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jun 2019,Betsy Horvath,"I purchased the Ring doorbell and installed it as instructed.  It really was easy to install!  Now for the testing..........my son came over and rang the doorbell, I tried to speak to him but it sounded like a jumbled mess of alien language that nobody has ever heard. Considering the device is OUTSIDE my house and my router is INSIDE, my signals were strong but hey, who doesn't want more.  I decided to take Rings suggestion and purchase the Chime Pro.  It was delivered the next day, thank you Amazon for notifying me that the package was left because the Ring Doorbell didn't.  In the meantime on Sunday I had contacted Customer Service, 19 minute wait time and a general response via email 5 hours later!  They offer no resolution just acknowledging that they got my request for speedy customer service. Next I contacted my internet provider and increased my speed, instant results on the speed test, thank you! I get another email from Ring - 06/17/2019 @ 2:12 pm in response to my original email sent 06/16/2019 @ 3:58 pm asking me for a verification code.  I was never sent one!  They ""re-send"" that code.  Keep in mind that per Ring's suggestion when you contact them, you should be near your device so they can assist you.  It's now been over 24 hours that they wanted me next to the device.  Sorry, I have a job. After moving the router, moving the Ring Chime Pro and multiple other attempts, there are 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.  It repeatedly said that it would connect to the wi-fi but not the internet.  Again, I'm thinking that if I use the Chime Pro it will increase the connection and make all systems work wonderfully.  I contact Customer service through chat, I write 3 messages to them - the last one was ""hello"" because I was not getting a response.  (this was at 6/18/2019 at 1:39 am) they must be in a really different time zone because it was about 630 pm my time. Now I get a message from them, thanking me for the code I sent to them 12 hours earlier.  They suggest I move the Ring device next to the router or the router next to the device.  Keep in mind I can't figure out how the heck I'm suppose to move the outside of my entry way (you know that place you normally attach a doorbell to) next to the router INSIDE my house without causing some major damage.  I also am at a loss as to how I can move the router to the door without disconnecting it. I'm not a rocket scientist, I admit that.  Yet even I can figure out that 1) in order to move the device next to the router it means uninstalling the doorbell or 2) moving the router next to the device means disconnecting the router. While I'm learning the product, I will keep the doorbell with the understanding that it is merely a nice light for people to see what button to push to ring the bell.  I understand that notifications of people at my front door will be few and far between, I did get one notification today after testing it out again - 15 minutes AFTER the motion was detected - better than not at all. I think the product MIGHT be ok, who knows.  In the meantime I am waiting for Customer Service to figure out how I can move my device that is hard wired to the outside of my house closer to the router that is 15 ft away",I'm not sure if the product works but I know the customer service doesn't

So it really feels like a late start. Also even though I set the motion detection zone outside of the street, it still picks up trucks going buy even though they are outside the zone. Irritating.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Mar 2018,Don D.,"I bought this camera as I wanted to have video feedback for deliveries and people coming onto my front porch.  I've had this for a month now and it's been next to worthless.  I have spent a lot of time trying to adjust the sensitivity to not alert me every time a car drives by.  Depending on the time of day, the angle of the sun, clouds, etc, I will either get a notice for every movement of vehicles or nothing.  Rarely is it in the middle.  The response time for the motion tracking when people actually come on my porch is horrible.  It is about 20 feet from the street to my door with a clear view.  I have never had it alert me to someone approaching my door, only alerting me when they are already at the door or even worse when they are already leaving my porch.  I'm a frequent Amazon purchaser and I have never seen the face of the delivery people when they leave packages, only their retreating backs.  What value does it provide to tell me someone was there with no face?  After a month of the ""free trial"" of ring +, today that ran out and I discovered that I can't even see what triggered a motion alert or door bell ring since I didn't want to pay to store pictures of cars driving by all day.  I completely regret this purchase as it is way overhyped and doesn't even perform its basic function very well.  I could have spent $10 for a button that would have provided me with more accurate information of if someone was at my door.  There is no option to integrate this doorbell with an existing security system so it's a one off, that performs poorly, and becomes useless if you don't sign up for monthly payments to store the videos you should be able to save wherever you want rather than being locked in to an overpriced service to review unnecessary alerts.  I would not recommend this product to anyone that wants it for the security aspect.  In testing I was able to get on my porch, take a box, and leave without any notice of the activity.","Over hyped, poorly performing product"

I am a parent with 2 small children so it was important to get something that WORKED and was able to send notifications when im out and about or not in my living room near the front door.  My Ring Doorbell experience is like this.  Extremely easy to install and set up.  Video quality is very very sub par.  I have very good wifi coverage and speed far above the recommended speed that Ring says is the minimum.  Yet my live video is slow to load, video stutters constantly and images tear.  A person can look like they transport on Star Trek in my front yard rather than walk or even run.  Its embarrassing how poorly this video works.  The motion alerts work pretty well, but since the video lags so badly and records so subpar even if the motion is set off, the person can be gone before video captures them.",So disappointed!

The picture is good except for the fish eye effect. I am able to hear people speaking clearly when they come to the door but the speaker volume is not that great.

For every ring- everyone’s phone in the house was going crazy- your WiFi information will be stored in cloud ( of course ) for the product to work properly. The battery can be unscrewed and taken out by anyone outside of your house, which disables the device if you don’t wanna mess with existing wiring. Audio is not really great ( it’s acceptable) .

In my case, my front door is recessed and up 3 steps, plus I have vinyl siding. The vinyl will cause a slight problem aiming it down. It comes with one vertical wedge (5 degree down) and one horizontal wedge. Not enough wedges and additional ones are $19 per pair (1 of each type).  My case, I need an additional 2 verticals to get it to see the landing. That’s $38 more and 2 useless side wedges. They also are needed since the street is around 15 feet so vehicles are tripping the sensor frequently. The recess causes the motion sensor to tunnel; the left and right sensors pick up the walls on either side; center is really all that will be of value. If your walkway is straight in front of your door, it might be ok. But if the walkway starts from the side you won’t get a notification until the person is standing at your door. As for the detection and the video quality - that is pretty good. You can try to modify the “cone” for the motion detection, so if you don’t have the obstacles noted above it should work fine for you.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,Michelle H.,"Ring is having serious manufacturing quality control issues with their doorbell 2.  I am returning my second one to amazon for the same issue as the first and don't know if I am giving them a third chance. A read through of some threads on the ring community message boards reveals many others with the same problems. 1. My ring doorbell 2 has issues with two way talk.  I get an echo of myself about 1/2 second later, it is hard for someone at the door to understand me and hard for me to understand someone at the door.  This is one of the primary features of the ring, one which they tout, so it really should work.  I had no issues with an older ring classic. 2. The device makes some kind of electronic hum when it switches to night mode.  This hum is completely hardware related, you can take it off the wall. hold it in your hand and run it on battery power.  Put it next to your ear and faintly hear the hum in night mode.  This hum is picked up and amplified by the microphone and makes night recordings and communication unusable. 3.  These issues seem prevalent recently which leads me to think they have a bad part from a supplier that has affected an entire recent manufacturing run.  Contacting ring only elicits the typical cookie cutter troubleshooting response of have you reset the device, have you checked wifi blah blah blah. By the time most tech people like myself contact support we are beyond tier 1 and 2, please don't insult our intelligence.  Yes, now what?  Silence, and try to delay past the return window. Until ring gets these issues sorted, I would strongly advise against purchasing one right now.

Karolak,"I have given the Ring Video Doorbell 2 an ENTIRE YEAR to prove itself.  I have tried everything possible to make this thing work.  NO LUCK.  Initially, I had the button mounted without the wedge.  Then I tried it with the wedge tilting up, then with the wedge tilting down.  Although we are 35 feet back from the street, I have motion detection set for 5 to 15 feet.  I got the Ring Chime Pro and have it placed within 4 feet of the front door, hoping to boost the wifi signal.  I even purchased an addition wifi extender from our internet provider and placed it within 6 feet of the Ring Chime Pro.  We still don't get worthwhile service from this thing. Quite often it will pick up cars going down the street, which should be well beyond where I have motion detection set.  Yet there a many, many times where it does not pick up our U. S.

We've been on the phone with support more times then I can believe and all my results come back as working perfectly......but there's still no video. Basically it's just a $200. door bell now.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Jon Powers,I upgraded from the  Blink XT motion system. The Ring doorbell 2 has many more features and is easier to control the motion. The rechargeable battery is wonderful ! No more buying expensive AA lithium batteries. The Ring system is very to set up and If you already own a amazon echo product you can interface the doorbell with it to allow you to receive alerts that someone is at the door. Because of this you don’t need to buy the indoor ringer. The cost to retain your videos from the doorbell is $30 a year but well worth the price. I’m very impressed with the features and flexibility of the Ring system.,High quality doorbell/motion security system  !

Also there is a 1-2-3 second distortion at the beginning of most videos when it appears that it's trying to convert up to 1080p quality even though I have gigabit internet speed with a router less than three feet away from the unit.

The 30 days FREE is designed to make you keep the product so that you don't realize how useless it is until after the 30 day return period. That’s why the subscription is PRE-ACTIVATED.  By time you realize you can’t see Motion, unless you answer the motion alert with 15 seconds, it’s too late to return because guess what Amazon 30 days return expired(as did the subscription). It is practically useless without the subscription because you can’t see Motion that happened unless you answer the ring RIGHT AWAY(within 15seconds)! If you answer after the 15 seconds it gives you an error or tells you need a subscription.

The video often does not pick up until the delivery man walks off the porch/stoop. It should pick him up as he approaches the door. It is as if there is a lag. We also have the same problem if someone rings the doorbell. If someone rings, you will get an alert on your phone. By the time you get the live camera activated, half the time they are walking off.

We have had issues with parcels being stolen from our porch. My first complaint is that the camera does a very poor job of motion detection.

Last, and why should this surprise me, there is a monthly fee, far more than I  would ever pay for a product that does not deliver. I opted for the minimum 3.00 a month service and if  I didn't pay that, this thing would be worthless.  I feel as though I  threw away 200.00.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2019,Scrappy,"I really want to like this product but after adjusting the motion zones so I don't detect every vehicles that drives down the street it doesn't detect people walking up to the front door on a regular basis. The doorbell is hardwired and  set for frequent motion capture (every motion). However, on two separate occasions, once for UPS and once for USPS, no motion was detected as the delivery was left on the front porch.  Deliveries is in the top 5 reasons for wanting this product.  For $200 plus monthly fees to capture and save the videos I would expect to detect every motion on the front steps and capture every video.  Expecting too much? Maybe, but I'm disappointed anyway. Not sure if I would get any more of the Ring products unless some improvement can be made to this one.",Disappointed
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2017,REB4,"Disappointing performance. It's ok, but it's one of those products that is more hype than reality. The idea is fine but it is overpriced for what it does, and still doesn't perform like promised. I bought two of these, one from Costco which included the Chime and 1 year free storage of video and one from Amazon. I was going to install one in the front door and one in the backyard. The one from Costco, never really worked. The Wi-Fi connection was spotty even when the device health monitor said it was a good signal. Just very unreliable and it certainly was nowhere near the 1080P resolution. Every time it lost the wi-fi connection, I had to go outside to unscrew the front and manually reset the wi-fi button to reconnect, then have to put it back together. I had to give it back. The one from Amazon wa more reliable but still under performed. Pros: - You can see who is at your front door...eventually - If you pay the $36 a year fee, it will record  video captured in case you have a problem and need to see who was in front of your house - Most of the time you can activate the lIve stream feature on it and see through your camera proactively...eventually, but sometimes it never connects - You can communicate with someone in your front door, eventually - You can control how far out you want to detect to avoid passing cars or pedestrians on the sidewalk. It is NOT controllable by zone as it claims. - You can control how sensitive the detection is so you don't get overwhelmed at work with every single motion it detects - Night vision camera - Good deterrence, gives you some peace of mind while you are away Cons: - If you noticed that I said eventually in most of the posts, that is because there is such a time lag between the actual motion detected or the doorbell ringing that most of the time the person has already moved or left by the time you respond. I have had 9 packages delivered since i bought this and I have yet to speak to the delivery person before they left. - The speaker is horrible, most of the time the person cannot understand a word I say unless they pay close attention - Poor wi-fi antenna and spotty reception. Comments say that you need to buy the $50 extender to fix these problems but I don't agree. I have very good wi-fi in my house and have no problem watching HD movies on my laptop outside in my patio, so it shouldn't make a difference. And if that were the case, then this SHOULD be sold with the extender included, and then it becomes a $240 product and for that price there are better options. - It is NOT 1080p resolution. Even when I have it right next to my router. Absolutely not 1080P, 720p on its best day. - The $36 yearly service fee. If you really want to use this as a surveillance camera, you need it to save video you are not there to see. Without the video saving service, someone can just break in or steal your package or even steal  the ring device itself and you wouldn't know who did it. - Price...when you add up price of the device, the $50 dollar extender/chime and the $36 yearly fee, this ends up being a $275 solution. It's not worth it. I was going to by one for my back yard and decided it wasn't worth it.","Disappointing performance. Great idea, mediocre execution. Bought two from different vendors.

I expected a more refined product given how long it has been on the market.  The microphone and speaker are not nearly as good as commercials would lead one to believe.  The mounting hardware is more suited for a protected environment in a computer case rather than outside exposed to the elements.  However, my biggest beef is that the audio speaker and microphone do not work at any real functional level with the newer Samsung phones, I have a S10+ and it is virtually unintelligible when trying to talk to someone at the door.  My wife's IPhone is fine although the speaker is not as loud as you would want and the microphone is not as sensitive as you would hope.

First, the packaging.  The attention to detail is impressive.  The package comes with all the tools necessary to mount/install the doorbell (it even comes with a drill bit and screwdriver).  The instructions for installation were simple and straightforward. The only issue that I had with the installation was that the quality of the screws that were included in the packaging, seemed to be of poor quality.  In trying to screw the doorbell onto the wooden frame of my door, I sheered off the heads of at least 5 screws once the screw got about half way in (so either the wood was too dense for the screws or the screws were poor quality; I even drilled pilot holes for the screws). Once I eventually got the doorbell mounted, the device was very easy to set up using the Ring app.  You can add multiple users who are notified when the doorbell is activated.  Setting up the sensitivity of the motion detection was also very easy in the app using a slider bar.  Picture clarity is also pretty good and field of view is very good (seems like almost 180 degrees) I have only had the doorbell for a couple of days, but it seems to be working very well.",Impressive product; would recommend

You can adjust how far out the device senses motion. To my experience, it seems to pick up all that it should. The app you have to get (free with doorbell) is average. Video quality is decent. The concerns: 1) You must use a multimeter to install safely to existing doorbell wiring, since you have to measure the voltage going through that wiring. Most people don't own a multimeter, so that's either finding a friend with one, or spending another $20. 2) To view any video history, you have to subscribe to Ring after the free 30 day trial ends.

Set up was also pretty simple once I scolded our router for not playing nice.  *password issue But anyway, the doorbell has been in place just a few days so we're still learning, but so far, so good.

It's slow to start. It could be my wifi, but my wifi router sits about ten feet from the Ring doorbell, so I'm not sure.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2020,Robert,Great detection perfect for home security and the deal for $30 more for saving videos is worth it. Plus they give you a network so you can really monitor the crime around the neighborhood. The only bad thing is the cops just don’t care in California anymore they should be on this network all the time looking for parole’s and get the thieves or worse criminals off the street because this camera clearly captures them. All you need is this and a gun and consider your place safe.,Great product battery last long.
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jan 2019,DFR,It was easy to install. It really works!  We were traveling. We were about 400 miles from home. Got a motion alert.  Saw that it was our pest control service. We “talked” via the doorbell. How cool is that. Added comment: I see negative comments among the reviews and am surprised.  Our Ring doorbell works great.  But I believe that may be the case because I purchased a new router.  Everything in my house on the new router works great.  My printer problems went away.  The Ring doorbell works as expected.  I used to think I needed a new printer -- but it was nothing but a router problem.  I bought the Amplifi router and my smart home became a lot smarter.,Love this doorbell setup

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2018,Elisa L.,"We received our Ring 2 in a timely manner and had it professionally installed, hardwired to the house  electrical system. The motion detector was amazing, and the video captured a wide range in good light. The Ring device was set up about 30 ft, from our router. All was good for a few months before the video failed, capturing only black.  I called Ring support twice and spent hours on the phone helping them perform all sorts of tests, to prove that it wasn't a wi-fi issue (one support agent said it was one of the strongest signals she's seen). Finally, the agent admitted it had to be an issue on the Ring  side, it was a known issue (!)  and I should wait a few hours for a firmware update. I gave them 5 hours and still no fix.  I called support again and the agent tried to take me through the exact same tests from square 1 but I dug my heels in and the agent read through the support history and conceded that the issue was on the Ring side. 12 hours later -- still no fix. Most companies would have sent a replacement unit by now.  Needless to say, I am disgusted with Ring and their level of service. The agents are super-nice but have to strictly follow a script for every call, which gets infuriating when you have already walked through every test. The droorbell motion detector and app continue to function well, so is a step up from a regular doorbell. But if like me video is a requirement, for you, save your money until the company works out their issues.",Bell works great - video failed within a few months of purchase

Then, after a lot of software updates, you can no longer view the video of an event that’s just been triggered - you get “Video is processing, please wait” for several minutes, making this video doorbell pretty much useless as a security device, since you can’t see if the skeet was legitimate threat or not until it’s possibly way too late.

It doesn't last more than a few days.  I have my motion alert off so it will last more than 2-3 days, making the product worthless.  If I wanted to go away for a week and turned motion alerts to the lowest setting, the device would be dead before I got home.  Ring claims the battery will last for months.  The device alerts to everything, even on the lowest setting.  I don't want to have an alert for every car that drives by. My front door is a good distance from the street but any motion sets it off, leading to the battery being dead in two days.  There are only 3 settings for motion: low, medium and high.  Just awful.

Would like to see one change however, a connection on the unit that would allow you to connect a charging cable directly to the unit! Right now you have to remove the security screw, remove the battery to charge it or replace it with another, this adds additional cost and is time consuming, a simple port would allow you to charge the existing battery without all the trouble or expense of buying additional charging station and or battery.

Spent an unmeasurable amount of time trying to get the thing to work. Only to have it say my phone or my Wi-Fi connection is the problem. So I went ahead and got the chime Pro. Thought it might solve the problem. Went outside to try to install it at the height and angle I wanted it to work at. Only have it work once.  Then it went right back to saying it cannot connect to my phone. Went through all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail. So I had enough of this huge waste of money and time..... I'm now back to getting off my butt to answer the door! Almost a month later.... I finally got it to work intermittently. Sometimes I get a spinning icon that says activating device, with a blurry background and nothing responding . And then there's times I just get a full black screen and nothing responding. And then there's are times when it works like it's supposed to..... Bottom line if you're happy with something works a tad better than half the time. Then this device is for you.

This Ring 2 does NOT sense motion. I walked up to the door bell, ran up then jumped up and down -> NOTHING on my phone as far as an alert to tell me someone is mucking around in front of my Ring 2. The door bell works and tells me someone is ringing - that is the only use i am getting from this. The live feed option DOES NOT WORK AT ALL and is infinitely on 'loading screen' trying to bring up a picture. The intercom to speak to the person is utter rubbish- i was ringing the bell and my husband had my phone- he was talking and the sound was cutting on and off like he was on the moon or something. It cut off whole words or had long gaps before another word was heard. I did not buy this to hear a sound on my phone so i know someone is at my door and see them -> A normal doorbell did this and looking out of the window would have given me get the visual! I wanted to see live feeds whenever i heard something wherever i was in my home without having to go to the front window. I also wanted to speak to the person to tell them to go away and read the 'no soliciting sign' or tell people i know i will only be a minute. I wanted to get alerts when in bed or during the day if someone was coming up to my front door to try and break in or to visit me to i knew in advance before they rang the bell!.

I contacted the customer support and got a Chime Pro. With the chime pro, it works perfectly. I'm giving it 5 stars because the customer support was so good, and there is no better alternative that I've found. That being said,I think it has an issue with consistency with some routers.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Apr 2019,Punjabi Munda,"I have never written a review for any products ever. However I cannot help myself but to write a review for Ring.Com and its products and tech support. BUYER BEWARE. Product works well inside the house however, Door Bells are supposed to work from the Outside. I really was amazed on the tech service rep to let me know that if the Door Bell works inside the house, that means the device is working fine.  I asked them How does that help if my guests or perpetrators are already inside the house. Why would they have to ring the Ring Doorbell.  I kept wondering what was the thought pattern of the person or persons that are managing the Tech Support and what kind of conversations and training goes on in the company.  The Door Bell is supposed to work from the outside. The comment that if the Door Bell works inside, then there is nothing wrong with the device still amazes me. I am wondering on the intelligence of the people working on the FAQ's and Tech Support manual. Sorry Jeff, you spend your hard earned money on buying on a really company with stupid solutions.  Hoping that you next purchase and venture are more intelligent and more consumer friendly. Just hope I don't lose faith in you. I have been with you when you started selling books. That is how long my relationship is with you and your company.  Hope you do better due diligence in your next venture. I now understand why many in the Shark Tank did not invest in the company. In spite of Mark Cuban's objection of not seeing the value and then understanding the limitation on the product, I bought the product, because I thought you would have your best guys do their due diligence.  Mark is the person who introduced the world to Video over the internet with broadcast.com and I should have listened to his objections more carefully. I am sorry for being disappointed with Ring Products.  . The worst $179.00 i have ever spent on Amazon.com in all these years. I thought of throwing the product in the garbage. But then it occurred to me that I need to smash the product into million pieces to protect myself and my family and my house, god forbid, that somebody finds the product in the landfill and uses the information stored in the product against me.

We recently purchased the Ring Doorbell 2, with the WiFi extender and additional battery pack. I do highly recommend purchasing the WiFi extender, more so if your house is older and the signal weakens, and if you don't already have any existing doorbell. We did not have a doorbell and selected this product for security and convenience. The app and installation instructions are easy-to-use, bug free. We are now considering extending range and purchasing the outdoor floodlight product, to cover our backyard.

There are so many mixed reviews both positive and negative about it. But let me add to the positive., this product is absolutely amazing.  The doorbell is easy to set up and comes with both video and manual instructions that help ensure you don't get lost or frustrated. The video quality is amazing. I am able to see everything from my front door to the street where my car is perfectly and can make out the faces of anyone who is on my porch. The night vision is perfect as well as I can make out everything I need even without turning on my porch light. Furthermore, the motion detection is responsive and quickly notifies you of anyone approaching your door depending on where you set your motion field. The chimes it comes with are amazing with a wide variety of normal ones and a plethora of holiday ones as well. The battery lasts for weeks on end depending on your settings (if you keep the sensitivity on high it will drain the battery faster). Lastly, this device paired seamlessly with my amazon Alexa devices and ring alarm system. If you are still on the fence about this doorbell let me help push you in the right direction.

Five phone calls and five different times trying to reset it they finally are going to send me another one but I have no confidence in that I’m so upset and disappointed we had her house broken into and if we could just have this one bit of peace of mind but I’m sitting here six days later with that camera that’s mounted on my doorbell and it doesn’t even work I’m so upset right now I will never buy another product from them again,Contines to lose signal

Mckendrick,"UPDATE: Ring keeps making it worse - introducing new features like “People only mode” which only work with a Ring protect plan.  REALLY WISH I HAD DONE MORE RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS HORSESH!T PRODUCT.  Its basically like gifting yourself a monthly bill for $5.  SERIOUSLY, I HATE THE GD RING DBELL. The subscription required to store any video in the cloud is ridiculous.  I should at least be able to review videos from the past 24 - 72 hours without paying a @#$!! monthly fee.  If I had known about this limitation, i would've bought another product.  Tired of buying products nerfed without buying into premium subscriptions - seeing this model everywhere. At least offer integration with other cloud storage so I can archive videos to my own storage.",Another monthly fee ...
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jul 2019,Eric Bartusch,"To preface this, I want to start by saying that I bought this really wanting to like it so I could justify expanding with more Ring cameras / lights. I travel modestly for work and although I live in a low traffic, low crime area, I wanted something simple that could just let me know if someone came to the house. Also, given that I started buying more and more through Prime, I wanted to deter any would-be porch pirates since my house is set back from the road enough that a would-be thief would have an opportunity to work out of view from the main road. That said, installation was a breeze. The included brown faceplate matched my exterior nicely and the included angle mounting hardware enabled me to set it up for an optimal view. Downloading and scanning the product was a easy and the initial set up was very intuitive. I was very impressed with the instructions, included hardware, and mounting options that were included. Alexa integration was simple too. Now all of my Alexa devices alert me when someone rings the doorbell. I turned it on and set my zones. I tried it out by walking around and seeing where it would trigger an alert. The push notification triggered immediately when I stepped into the zone. Again, I was very impressed. This is where things stopped being impressive. The first day, a UPS driver stopped at my house. I got the notification, opened the app, and saw a still shot of a driver and could hear the sound of him scanning packages. I figured it was a glitch, not aided by my meddling when it was activated. But this trend has since continued. I have since gotten still screen shots of people getting out of their car, halfway entering my house, or walking up the path. I never get a second still shot. Every visitor gets a single still shot depending on where the camera first decided to record them. I can hear the audio but the video just stalls. This has been true whether I click the notification to view the event live or if I try to recall an event that I missed. It's always a single still shot with a little audio. Sometimes, I don't even get the still shot and instead I get a zero second video. I tried to reach out to ring on the app. I initiated a chat but received no response from the person who ""would be with me shortly."" That was a little disappointing. I'm going to try maybe buying a wifi range extender and playing around with the zones a little more to do a little more playing. I'm hoping to update this review if I can get it to record streams of video. It's beyond returnable now so I'll mess with it and if nothing else, it'll be a talking piece for guests, but I won't count on it for any actual security. UPDATE: I bought the range extender and it works great. I'm looking into adding cameras now.","A neat parlor trick, but not particularly useful"

If it wasn't 200 bucks for this thing I'd have given it maybe two stars, but as it stands I just don't see the point in spending this much for something that is not reliable. There's about 6 feet between my router and the ring unit, and the health check says the signal is good. I googled issues related to the black screen and there doesn't appear to be a resolution to this problem. I might be able to work this out with tech support, but I'm more than likely just going to return this before it's too late and try another camera system.",Half the videos record great..
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Sep 2019,babs,"The installation process was painful and involved hours of phone conversations with the delightful Ring Support staff.  It wasn't until the fourth representative joined the process that we discovered why the Doorbell 2 and the Chime unit were not communicating with the internet through our wifi router.  The answer:  We have a very good Linksys router, but it taps into the Xfinity cable modem/router which was not properly configured for ""bridge"" mode.  Once rep #4 asked us to contact Xfinity, we discovered the problem and fixed it.  We have to admit that the Ring Support staff never gave up on trying to solve our problem and went out of their way to compensate us for the time we spent.  Since then, the Doorbell 2 and Chime units work as advertised, with occasional hiccups, such as delayed notifications.

We travel a lot and it’s nice to be able to get motion and ring events so we can see, hear and respond to notifications without anyone knowing we are gone! We can also keep track of deliveries and visitors without standing at our window to see what’s happening! They were both easy to install and getting them to communicate with our internet. For people having trouble with the internet part, they should make sure they have newer equipment that is capable of supporting multiple devices! We speak from experience because our first doorbell install was not as successful until we got new equipment (which we should have had anyway), and once we had the equipment up ang running, the Ring doorbell internet installation was straight forward. Also, because our back door did not have a previously wired doorbell, we got the Ring doorbell that had a rechargeable battery. Now that we’ve had it a while, we are going to get the wire and plug in transformer so we don’t have to recharge the battery and can increase the motion detection area! Our neighbors love that we can see what’s going on in their back yards!",Great picture and sound!

Our condo is 3,000 square feet so I purchased a Ring Chime Pro (to boost the Wi-Fi signal to the doorbell) and a Ring Chime to cover the other end of the condo.  Both work very well and the Wi-Fi signal to the doorbell is excellent.  The Ring App is also very well designed and works seamlessly.

Thankfully it wasn’t, but I still want to know someone is at my door. I have adjusted the settings. I have made it more sensitive. I have adjusted the zones to include the driveway, etc. sometimes it would say the wifi was weak, so I even bought a range extender and placed it on the inside of the front door, so I know our wifi isn’t tge issue. All around, I am extremely disappointed in the Ring 2. I have started researching wyze and other outdoor cameras. I wasted $169!",Extremely disappointed

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Feb 2019,Gabby,Purchased to add “eyes” to the side door where most guests enter. Our neighbor has a Ring doorbell and highly recommended this item. So far I’m actually a tad displeased with the moton sensitivity adjustment. Seems to detect motion better at some times and not so great at other times. Haven’t mapped out the inconsistencies well enough yet to tell if it’s a weather-related issue or defective product. Also whenever it detects motion I cannot access the device from my phone to see what it sees without multiple steps through the app to get to the live view feature. Resolution is not great with the basic $99 model. The extra $100 might be a worthwhile upgrade to get actual 1080p resolution. All in all still a dramatic improvement over a peep hole in the door.,The $99 version might not be so awesome

The audio volume is so low you cannot hear the caller and the caller cannot hear you. Spent time with their support to troubleshoot, rebooted routers, reinstalled the  application, had them access the unit remotely, they even sent me a new unit. Still, the audio is so low on my Galaxy s9+ that I cannot understand a single word. Same results on an iPhone and iPad. The only thing that does work is the Alexa devices, the audio is loud enough when asking Alexa to talk to the front door, but the audio quality is very very poor.  There was a fix (or workaround) in earlier releases of the software where you could disable the timeline event viewer and the audio would be usable, however newer releases have removed the ability to turn it off.  Those problems aside, there is also a lag between when motion is detected and the live view is displayed on my phone. By the time it connects the person at the door is walking away most of the time.

Can't deduct stars since that is not Ring's fault. We'll probably get some cameras in the future since this first product has worked well in the two months we've had it. Battery life seems fairly long though it does take quite a while to charge and doesn't show you when it's fully charged (despite saying that it is supposed to). It's nice to have a little added security around the house. We didn't even have a doorbell to begin with. We've used this already a couple of times due to some delivery issues we had been having.

A couple of years ago customer service was excellent, now, I cannot even talk to anybody. Last time I called, waited for over 20 minutes only to get disconnected.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2018,Norman,"I have been using Ring Doorbell 2 for at least 2 months.  Here are my good and bad experiences: 1) Good. Battery operated. I can mount Ring 2 right in the center of my door. So that I can see straight out who is in front of my front door. 2) Good. Battery life. It is at 73% after 2 months. My usage is not heavy neither light. I have daily mail delivery and weekly front yard work. 3) Good. Neighborhood community allows you to see incidences/warnings posted by neighbors. 4) Bad. It is not obvious as a doorbell. Other than my own testing, it was used only once by a mailwoman in the whole 2 months. Most people still rang my old doorbell or just knock. Somehow, I believe, to most people, it does not look like a doorbell and the word “RING” does not tell people that it is a doorbell. 5) Bad. Speaker won’t work if the Ring 2 wasn’t pressed firmly or long enough. You still can listen but not able to talk through the speaker. I will have to use the “LIVE VIEW” quickly in order to speak to the person who pressed the doorbell too lightly. Ring 2 button was not designed to make pressing it easily either, at least not as easily as the traditional doorbells. It is too big for the index finger. I used my thumb to press it most of the time during my testing. 6) Bad. Motion sensing is unreliable. Most of the time, Ring 2 can detect the motions within certain distance. But every once for a while it will miss completely. As an example: My wife was watering the front flowerbeds yesterday. As expected she triggered the motion sensor at least 4 to 5 times. She also triggered it when she walked through the front door into the house. But not all the times! Once, she walked through the front door and got inside the house completely without triggering Ring 2. No notification, no recording. At the same spot, I also have a motion sensor camera installed. It is part of my home security system. It uses the same wifi router. My security system motion sensor camera triggered every time including the events missed by Ring 2. 7) Bad. Cannot pre-record before the triggering event. My home security system camera can be programmed to record how much ahead of the triggering event. In summary, Ring 2 is not reliable and therefore cannot be relied upon as a security device. I use it only as a supplement to my existing security system. It does not fulfill as a doorbell either per problems listed above. The only positive thing about it is the neighborhood community feature to share warning videos and map locations with my neighbors",Neither a good security device nor a good dorrbell

However this item did not work as advertised. We received the notification for one day. After that I spent approximately 3 hours with tech support on the phone and on a web chat. We did system restores and it worked some of the time. The live feed option only works 25% of the time. With support we tested the internet speed and the system was receiving 16mbs download and 5mbps upload which is more than sufficient for the system. It just did not work properly. I tried it for 10 days and finally gave up. I'm returning it and buying  a set of Arlo cameras. Update so I returned my original ring 2 and received a new one just in case it was defective. The replacement also provides terrible signal and only works about 10% of the time. After spending countless hours on tech support calls, resetting the system several times, and even installing the chime extender, the system as of right now is not even registering doorbell button pushes. By the way, after installing the chime extender, the signal went from good to poor. I stand by my original review and say don't buy this product, it's a terrible rip off which does not work.

Moyer,"I purchased 2 of these doorbells, one for my back and front door.  I recently moved out to a remote area and wanted some peace of mind when I am not home and when home alone that I can see what is going on at my front and back doors.  What prompted me to look into it is that I recently came home to find tire marks in my grass and there was no packages or notes left, so it made me nervous that someone was at my house when I wasn't home.  I went on vacation after installing the doorbells and was comforted in getting notified and seeing who was at my door while I wasn't there.  Excelled product!!!  Easy to set up and a great peace of Mind!!!",Peace of Mind!!

Furthermore, even when it manages to stay logged in, the access and reporting latency is several minutes even with fast internet.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Oct 2020,PLW,"We’ve had this installed for nine months now and have had plenty of experience now. Most of the time, this works great. But there are a few problems that are either annoying or just undo any benefit this might device might bring. The camera will stop recording just 10 seconds after it detects a motion, and does not start recording again until whomever caused that motion is long gone.  We had a delivery van drive up last night, which triggered the camera to record.  Great! Except the driver didn’t get out of the van for 10 seconds, so the camera stopped recording.  We have no record of what happened to our package after that. There is no way to configure the camera timeout duration. My other nit is we are a multiOS family. You cannot configure the devices from a Windows PC, you need to use the IOS app. I’m glad we have this kind of doorbell camera now, but knowing what I know, I might have chosen a different option.","Nice, but with some real drawbacks"

The motion detection does pick up alot of car. as my house is 20 feet from the road.

If I have a weak cell signal I can miss the whole event and not be able to view at all. Like it charges right off my doorbells orginal wiring.

It is working great for capturing all the motion on our porch and is so nice to see who is at the door before answering.  I also like that you can use it to take a live look at what is outside at any given time.  I wasn't aware before ordering this device that Ring charges a monthly or yearly fee to save the recordings that the doorbell camera captures, but it is a reasonably small amount ($3/month or $30/year), so I think it is well worth it!",See who is at your door

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Feb 2019,Sonia,I received this last week and my son installed it over the weekend. So far so good. It is nice to see what is happening in front of my house. One video didn't work or it errors when I try to look at it so I will have to look into it but all the rest I can watch and they are pretty clear. I even saw the postman delivering a package! My dog started barking at the front door earlier so I looked at the live cam and didn't see anything. We have coyotes in our area so it was probably something outside our yard that made her bark. A peace a mind if you can go to live cam to see what is going on or not going on. I plan to get the Ring Flood Light to replace the one above my garage that doesn't work anymore. I am going to get the Ring Doorbell for my kids for their homes.,Awesome to feel more secure

I wanted to give it a few months before I wrote a review, but it's been essentially worthless since day one. It just doesn't work. Over the past two months I've had numerous packages delivered to my front door. Only twice has it picked up a delivery person, and most of the time it's as they're getting back into their vehicle. The ring is installed correctly, my wifi signal is strong, but it just doesn't pick anything up. I've adjusted the motion detection settings, testing a bunch of configurations and nothing helps. Not to mention the lag time between when someone presses the doorbell button and when I'm notified on my phone. I've been sitting on my couch, which is about 3 feet from the doorbell, (with a strong wifi signal) and had someone ring the doorbell, only to get the notification after they got tired of waiting and just knocked. I'm super disappointed with this product. If it worked the way Ring's marketing claims it works, it'd be great, but the technology just isn't up to par. I feel like I'm beta testing something vs using a fully realized product. If you're wanting a motion activated security camera, I'd look elsewhere.",Ding-dong disappointment

We were disappointed, however, to find the following two flaws: 1. there is a delay of a few seconds in motion detection, so that important information can be missed.  2. we had not expected to pay a monthly fee to see the stored video events.  A logical design would include CONTINUOUS video recording for installations that use transformer power to charge the battery.  The recording could be saved on the user's device.  A user-selectable amount of storage, say between 1 to 10 GB, could be used on a rotating basis.  The beginning of each event can also be stored, so that the user can jump to a specific event in the stored video.  (A more sophisticated software could periodically delete large segments of eventless video.)  A one-time charge of $30-$40 could be charged for this feature.  Keeping this information on the company's site and charging a monthly fee would still be far better than the present policy.",It is important to know that there is a delay of a few seconds in motion detection.

By the time you get the notification on your phone, unlock it, and get through the self promotion and fluff of the app, the person at the door is long gone.  However, after the first month the real trouble sets in.  Not advertised is the fact that after 30 days you must pay a monthly subscription fee to view any recorded video, pictures, or sound.  While I understand the need for 'premium' services, like storing video indefinitely - being able to see video 24 hours, or even 5 minutes, after it was taken is by all accounts assumed with the purchase of such an expensive product.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Aug 2018,SA,"The Ring is a great concept, but needs some work.  I am linked to Wi-fi and the connectivity is so poor.  I bought a booster and it sits within 4 feet of the door bell through a glass door.  It shows my connectivity as ""good"" and ""poor"" not excellent.  The codes I get say too much interference.  I live in a house and am not very close to neighbors.  Not sure what that interference is about.  It takes a long time to power up the image from the phone and on several occasions my door-ringer simply walked away before I could talk with them.  Maybe the hard wired version would be better.  I won't buy again.  Best feature (reason for 2 stars) is the neighborhood feature where you can post and see what is going on.

Never in my life have I encountered such a finicky and temperamental device. Signal is reduced if your house is made of brick- So essentially every home in every major city will have this issue. Camera feed at night is exclusively black and white no matter what they claim- The agent told me the only way to have color feed at night is to have a light close by. When I sent a pic of the light 6 inches above the doorbell she changed her story and claimed the light ""needs to be as bright as the sun."" As if that exists. Battery drains even when you are hardwired- This is the most infuriating issue. The booklet claims you would need to recharge the battery every 6-12 months even if hardwired. Not sure how that even makes sense with a power source. With that said, I have had to recharge it once a month. Their only ""solution"" was for me to buy a spare battery to use when charging the other. Device doesn't work in the cold- 50% of our country experiences a cold winter. Maybe you should only sell to people in the south. Even with a ""good"" charge the device does not activate consistently- With a full battery, the charge is ""Very Good"" and I can connect to the camera about 95% of the time. The moment it goes from ""Very Good"" to ""Good"" you immediately notice issues. The camera only connects about 50% of the time and half of those times it only puts out audio, and there is no picture. Even though I live in the city, it has stopped capturing motion events when it goes from Very Good to Good. Microphone is too sensitive- Even the slightest breeze will distort the sound and you cant make out what the person is trying to say.",What a finicky and temperamental device!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2018,Meyertopia,"PRO Very well thought-out unboxing and install/setup experience -- everything you need is included, except a power drill Nice mobile app (iPhone version in my case) Good video quality & night vision CON Very hard to get a good wifi signal through exterior wall @ 2.4 GHz. I was *very* disappointed when I realized I needed to use 5GHz but  it's only supported by the Pro. I would have bought the Pro if I had known how important this is (and the Pro looks better too). And yes, I have a high-end wireless extender right next to the front door. Mediocre wifi means videos that miss the first several seconds of motion, and that freeze after a few seconds of useful recording. And I don't mean the playback freezes, I mean the recording consists mostly of the same still image. All of this I presume is because the upload can't handle the camera's data stream, so those frames get dropped. Changing some settings from the mobile app requires you to physically press the doorbell button, meaning you can only change those settings when you are at home. CONCLUSION I hate regretting a purchase decision, especially at this price point. But I should have gotten the Ring Doorbell Pro. Before you buy the Ring Doorbell 2, make sure you have a solid wifi connection outside your home. If you have any doubt, spend the extra $50 and get the Pro. And make sure your wifi hardware supports 5GHz as well.

I called their 800 number twice and was told that the motion detector really only works when people walk across the path of the detector. That when someone walks directly straight to the Ring Bell there is a strong possibility that it will not set off the detector. So I returned the item. I don't know if this is an inherent problem with all motion detectors or just theirs. If they ever solve this problem I will definitely be a buyer. I gave two stars because of their tech. support, well packaged product.

Cool concept, but still seems like they’re years away from a viable product. I really regret spending the money on this thing. My internet is smoking fast and this thing functions maybe 50% of the time, both device and phones on solid WiFi. I think you wasted your $1.2 billion on buying this company, Amazon. Unless you plan on fully revamping the software, sensitivity and alert reaction times? We’ll see but I’m not so hopeful. Ring support sucks in my opinion, just want to review connection speeds and reset the thing endlessly. I just want it to do what it’s supposed to do by the description. Device health reads good, 77 mpbs down, 9.4 mbps up, 57 ms ping on a Nighthawk 5 gig router. I can only connect to live view intermittently, often takes a LONG time and often multiple tries. Alerts come through after people knock on my door or a split second before they push the Ring button. This is on both Android and iOS by the way.

Shelly,"I too was wooed by the possibility of being able to see who is at the door and see what may have happened over the course of the day. The lag from when you get a notification and to when the video pops up on your phone is the time it takes the UPS delivery person to drop off the package and all I see is them getting back into their truck... Ring needs to change their business model so that you have at least one day of past recordings or that you could store videos on your phone and delete as needed.  For the cost of the device, to then hold the customer hostage to a subscription for the very essence of the device is misleading.  Thus, be advised that if you want this doorbell to work as you think it should, multiply the list price by the annual subscription and that then is the real price to do what you thought it would do for the list price.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,Chip Crockett,"I'll confess that I haven't actually operated the product yet.  That's because I've run into several problems during installation.  The installation documents and videos are centered around the idea that your  existing doorbell switch is installed conveniently at 4ft on a outer flat wall.  But this is NOT where most door bell switches are installed.  Most are installed in the door frame at arm level (3ft - which is too low for the camera) or an appurtenant window frame, neither of which provide a wide enough surface for a stable installation of the Ring 2.  I don't think Ring does enough to prepare customers for the fact that many installations will require relocating the existing door bell switch, which could involve a lot of complicated modification to your home's exterior.  Suggest that before you buy a Ring 2, look at where your existing door bell switch is installed to determine if it will need to be moved, and how complicated and costly that will be.","May be a good product operationally, but the installation is not as easy as it sounds."

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Sep 2018,Dessie Wewers,"9-5-18 I have owned this for a little over a month.  I love the concept of it and when it works, i love being able to see who is at the door and able to communicate.  Another great feature is being able to see other people's posts in the neighborhood to determine if there is any issues around your home. Unfortunately, this unit has had issues from the very beginning.  I say this unit, because i am sure a lot work perfectly normal and this is one of the few. The issue i have is when the alert occurs, my phone has an issue with connecting to the device sometimes.  I feel that it goes to sleep and i have to wake it up and then it starts working fine. The first time it started showing black screens frequently, i contacted customer service and they walked me through a factory reset.  They advised that they noticed the unit was not functioning as well as it should, but it appeared to be working fine after the reset.  If it occurs again, to give them a call. The second time i called customer service, the same issue was occurring and there were times when motion would not register.  The gentleman walked through the reboot and found the multiple instances when a black screen would appear.  From the beginning, he was leading on that my bandwidth is the issue.  I ran a speed test and tested my bandwidth.  40mb D / 10mb U and currently using 400kb D / 40kb U.  Although the unit transfers video when it works perfectly, when it doesnt, it is due to my network. The gentleman called back after he discussed the issue with others and advised me that everyone feels the issue is with my internet.  The steps to correct this issue is to factory reset my router and if this does not work, contact my ISP to determine if they have an issue with the internet.  I advised there are multiple people around my neighborhood that has the same ISP and suggested to find out if others are calling in for the same issue around my area.  After a short time, no feedback.  In the end, I factory reset the router and initially worked.  I highly doubt it will continue to work. Next day update.  Multiple rings and motion events occured and the screen is still black.  This is after resetting my router, disconnecting the ring and sitting it on top of the router, factory resetting.  I was advised i would be receiving a follow up today, but to no avail. The concept of this device is great as long as it works.  Unfortunately, my return on Amazon has expired and when contacting Customer Service, they will put the blame on your network and not a defective unit. Purchase at your own risk.  If you do purchase and find issues, I would return it immediately before your return policy expires. Update 9/12/18 After posting this comment, I received notification from Ring and was assigned a specialist to handle the issue.  After a few tests with the unit, they replaced the unit. New unit arrived and installed. Unit appears to be more responsive and no black videos so far. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing the security package as once intended due to the CS as a security system will require a lot of interaction. I would increase the star rating to 3 for the unit as i do believe it is a good piece of electronics, but since everything relies on Ring cloud to use this (even if you do not use the subscription), I feel the CS needs improvement and not get special treatment when you finally write a honest but poor review.",Great concept unless it breaks and Customer Service doesn't help.

We only get the feed while on wi fi. We get most of the notifications, but can’t see who’s there if on data only. My family uses Verizon and AT&T with good signal strength in our area, and we have a strong wi fi system at our home, which is an office as well, so I think the issue is with the Ring software and devices. It works fine when we’re home. I called customer service and the non-caring “expert” told me to re-load the App and call my service providers.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Nov 2017,Texas Gal,"Good daytime picture when it worked, but sometimes the picture color was bad (blue tinge over the whole picture, other times blue and orange colors were reversed--so the sky was orange).  Night vision was terrible--very fuzzy and could only see about ten feet.  Ring's customer service said these were known problems that they were working on.  Motion detection was also intermittent--sometimes never got an indication and sometimes only got it when very close to the camera. Also, an upload speed of at least 2 MBPS is needed to get all the functionality of the system. This is the second security camera that I have had to return for quality problems.  Be sure to check out a camera for several hours before installing it so you get rid of the infant mortality issues.

Spend $200 to mount a doorbell?  Please make a double lap adapter! I had to reduce my rating. It looks like Ring has decided that they want to scare their users by sending out “crime reports” that you CANNOT OPT OUT OF.  I’ve also read that they are hiring a “crime editor”. Why? Probably to make it easier to sell other security products. If I could return the doorbell, I would. It just gets worse!

It should immediately display the live image as soon as it detects motion. But instead it pops up a notice and I have to tap it and then it opens the app and I have to wait and wait and wait for it to connect to the camera which in my case only works about half the time. My second complaint is that the motion detection takes so long the visitor usually rings the bell before the motion is detected. If I set it to detect further away then it picks up the cars driving by about 40 feet from my door. But it will probably deter thieves from taking my deliveries.

I get emails about deliveries and then go to the door to find packages from UPS, FedEX and USPS and the doorbell never once alerted me. Now, when a leaf blows by, we get constant notifications. Also, it has a poor connection to wifi. I have a $500 router sitting 5 feet away and it loses signal. Lastly, if your router is 5MHz and 2.4MHz in the same SSID, you will have issues. This door bell only receives 2.4 and will often lose connection. This was my issue with the EERO routers.

The Ring app can take forever to start up and connect to the camera, so if I don't walk over and answer the door there's a good chance they'll assume nobody's home.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Feb 2018,Snowball,"I will say that in hindsight I should never have purchased this device. It is an interesting concept; but comes up lacking. Pros: I gave it two stars; as opposed to one, because it actually works as a video doorbell. Cons: Yes, it does work as a doorbell; however, after 30 days, if you do not pay a subscription fee… basically all you have is a video doorbell. If you do not pay a yearly subscription (30 USD) then you have a very limited time to view the recording, and I am talking a matter of seconds… not minutes, not hours… seconds. I was in the kitchen, and the doorbell rang. I walked over to my desk, picked up my iPad, and tried to punch up the video, and it said it was a past event, and then directed me to a page to sign up for a yearly subscription. Apparently, videos are deemed “past events” after about 5 or so seconds. So, unless you are Johnny-on-the-spot, what you have is simply a live video doorbell. I can purchase a wireless video camera, and stick it on my front porch, for a lot less than a Ring doorbell. Why not give non-subscribers access to the last 24 hours, or the last hour… heck even the last ten minutes would be helpful. FYI: A workaround for the five-second problem on an iOS device is to, go to settings, look under the apps for Ring, and there you can change the notification to persistent. It will not go away until it's tapped on. False Rings When I first set it up, I was getting false rings every time a car or truck passed in front of the house, so I reduced the detection zone down to around 5 feet. That stopped it alerting me every time a car passed by, but still gives me false alerts when a UPS or FED EX truck passes, and that is several times a day. Slow to the Gate For example, when the ring alerts me to the postman, by the time it begins the video they have come up on the porch, dropped the mail and are gone. Most of the time, all the video shows me is an empty porch, and mail in the mailbox. The only exception to that is when the postman stops on the porch to do something, but if they come up, drop the mail, and leave, I never see them. When UPS or FED EX drops a package, the most I have seen is the back of the driver as he/she returns to the truck. If someone were to run up on my porch, and steal a package, I would never have a video of them… so, much for security (in my opinion). FYI: There is an option that allows the Ring to start up faster, but it consumes more battery power. I tried it… it did not help. Amazon Echo Show One of the reasons that I purchased the Ring is that it will work with the new video version of the Amazon Echo Show… So, when the doorbell rings, I can say: “Alexa, show me the front door.” The problem is that you cannot talk to the people at the door, just stare at them, and decide to, or not to, open the door. In all fairness I knew that the Ring had a subscription service; however, I did not realize that you only had a matter of seconds, before you had to pay to play. And, if I had done my homework, I would have known that the Ring only shows you the live video on you Echo Show. Ring even states that on their Website. The Good News I understand that in the future, the Ring will allow two-way conversations with the Echo Show. And, I am able to download my ring videos locally, through a Script, and Home Assistant. I am also working on a script through IFTTT to store them on my Google Drive.",Not what I expected...

Through written reviews and video reviews, I decided On the Ring 2. I also Bought an extra rechargeable battery pack and the ring chime for inside. I havent Had any problems with it connecting to the live view from home or away. It does seem to be about a few second delay when notifying me there is motion. I have Messed around with the sensitivity to see if it would alert me sooner, but honestly I think it’s the angle (we used the wedge) of the camera. I have Been very pleased with it so far. There has been a lot of package stealing in my town the past 6 months and I’m sure it’s going to get worse around the holidays.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2017,Davis,"I purchased a Ring 2 and experienced a problem with the audio emitted from the unit when talking to a visitor.  The audio level or volume is lower then a cell phone in speaker phone configuration.  If a delivery person leaves a truck idling in the background, it is unlikely that they will hear or understand you unless they place their ear next to the unit.  Unfortunately, by the time you are notified and respond to the APP, they have already returned to their vehicle.  As mentioned, I have a problem with an audio artifact, delayed feedback, that interferes with receiving people at the unit.  Customer service was very responsive, but failed to understand the problem until I provided a sound bite.  They had me conduct and repeat tests over and over again until, upon my insistence, they escalated my complaint to a higher level.  They finally acknowledged the problem but failed to offer a solution and gave up.  At that point, I had passed the 30 day return period at Amazon and am stuck with the unit and problem.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2017,Tim from Ohio,"The package comes with everyting you might need, and Ring anticipates a few common as well as odd, but realistic, scenarios.  A multi-use screwdriver is included, although I had to find my own micro phillips to remove the existing doorbelll.  The package even comes with spare screws in case you ""drop one in the bushes"".  The battery did take forever to charge (near the max stated of 8ish hours).  If the box had mentioned that, I would have opened it to start that process sooner while I did other things.  A USB cable is included as well, but no A/C adapter.  Once installed, it would not ""see"" me but it was dark (it is December...).  It must have ""learned"" overnight and during the day as it worked too well the next day, picking up passing cars well outside the stated range in the app.  The app is mostly great and allows adjustments.  Having to push the Ring button to sync makes sense, but is annoying when making changes away from your front door.  I created the app account with my email and added my wife, but cannot grant her the same access I have to a couple of items.  Hopefully this will be added in an update.",Very well thought out design and installation/guide
"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2019,Reviewer123,"Fun gadget allows me to watch live what’s happening outside my front door. Issues: despite being wired and having excellent wireless internet connection, I have found instances where I was alerted  that motion was detected but then it never recorded a video, or just a black (blank) video appears. Lots of lag/buffering at times with video which would be problematic if there were ever to be a crime at my door - not confident the Ring 2 would capture it but it’s fun and useful - more of a toy than something I can rely on for security.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2018,Steve Fishman,The Ring Video Doorbell 2 is very easy to install and configure. From what I can tell so far (about 2 weeks since install) the battery should last for 2 to 3 months. I did buy a second battery. I have it fully charged and ready to go. This will make it easy to do the battery swap. The app configuration is simple and setting up alerts on your phone is also simple. I also installed the Desktop app for MacOS. I also have a bunch of Amazon Echo devices sprinkled through out my house. I installed and configured the Alexa skill so now the Alexa devices announce when there is motion or when someone presses the doorbell. I am happy with the features and functionality.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2019,Kim P.,"I don't often write reviews for products, but this doorbell has frustrated me enough to begin. I purchased the Ring Doorbell 2 roughly a month ago. At first, it worked perfectly. It captured great video and there were no problems. One month later, in the same house with the same wifi router and conditions, it has suddenly decided that the signal strength is weak. I had my internet provider check the router and all is good, so I called Ring customer service. Their very helpful response was that my wifi must be struggling to reach the doorbell (which is less than 30 feet away from the router with nothing blocking it) and I would need to purchase a wifi extender which- SURPRISE- Ring sells for an additional $50 or so. Maybe I'm imagining things, but it seems a little crazy that it would work perfectly for a month then suddenly stop. Based on reviews, I'm not the only person with this experience. Hopefully it can be worked out, but it seems like a faulty product, by design or accident.","Worked for the first month, then failed"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2018,Martin Padilla,It works fine. But the company that makes it is trying to Rangel you into a monthly charge to allow you the ability to see previous video notifications. So if you don't answer or see emediatly what set off the motion you won't have proof of whom broke in to your house or stole your packages. I suggest purchasing YI cameras...they have mini USB disks to save all alerts.,It's ok but they want more money out of you.

(I received 45 such alerts today).  This is true even with the doorbell angled downward using one of the supplied wedges, and the motion detection radius set to less than 10 feet.  The vehicles are at least 40 feet away, so this shouldn't be the case. I guess the only choice is to use additional wedges (which makes the doorbell look a little peculiar), or to mount the doorbell on a different wall.  Anyway, it's pretty clear to me this product wasn't tested in a real-world environment.

It seems to only function either way to sensitively or not at all, with no in-between. Either my alarm is going off every few minutes every time a tree branch rustles in the wind or it doesn't start recording until I'm already through the door. Also, unless I already have my phone open and in use, I can't answer it in time because it requires I unlock my phone before booting the app, thus every single event becomes a ""missed"" event. I also apparently didn't get the memo that it requires a subscription to use. I have been advised of a fully wireless 4-camera continuously monitoring system for only $50 more, no subscription required, I will be trying that instead. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the video quality is undeniably excellent. I could actually recognize someone, even at night.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2017,E. Yang,"I have owned Ring Doorbell 2 for a couple of months now, and at least once a week the Ring 2 would get disconnected from Wifi signall. My router is only 4 feet away and it is working fine. The problem with the Ring 2 is that once it gets disconnected from Wifi, the only way to reset the device or reconnect it back is to remove the plastic cover and press down the little button inside.  The plastic cover is very hard to remove and is very poorly constructed. I had to use a screwdriver to remove it and it has been difficult every single time.  If you are away from home, and your Ring Doorbell 2 get disconnected, then there is nothing you can do to reconnect it apart from having to come home, remove cover, and reset the device. Very frustrating! The customer service is great and is available after hours. However, it  seems that all problems are to be fixed with resetting the device.  And the company should have implemented a way to reconnect the device from the app without having to remove that plastic cover, or to design the cover to be more user friendly.",Easily disconnected from Wifi and difficult to reset

The doorbell is a great investment, with one tiny issue.  The slight delay in the video, and if someone comes to the door, it doesn’t notify us until they are already at the door.  We’ve checked if we needed to adjust the span and the angle, but all is set correctly.  It’s a small negative that we are willing to overlook.

However its time limitations largely defeat that purpose. If you get motion and don't answer it (e.g., asleep, busy at work, not constantly monitoring your phone), then it stops recording after 30 seconds. So, if someone were say, breaking into your house or car after 30 seconds of casing it, then you would have no recording of it. Completely stupid.

I guess it’s my fault for not doing a little more research, but there are at least 4 models of ring doorbells.

It doesn’t even look like a doorbell, I was worried guests wouldn’t know to press it since it looks like some huge intercom system. The mounting system is poorly designed and cheap. The provided masonry bit could not drill into brick. There is a level on the bell for mounting, but not on the actual mounting bracket, which is the part you need to mark for holes to be drilled. Someone didn’t think this through. The mounts that sit behind the unit are cheap plastic and when I tried to screw them in the screw head just went straight through them.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jan 2019,Jonathan Wol,"The Ring has been a disappointment. I bought it at the same time I purchased a Blink camera system and because I can compare them, the Ring’s weaknesses are apparent. The Ring often does not capture the motion until the person has turned to walk away. For instance, if a delivery person leaves a package and hits the door bell, the video is most often of their back when they are moving away. The most frustrating part is once the trial period is over, you cannot access the videos unless you pay a subscription!! In other words, unless you are available when someone hits the doorbell, you have no idea who was there or what they want. I will be trying to return it and if I cannot I will move it to a less used door and buy something else. In contrast the blink cameras never miss anyone and I can hear on the saved videos there just isn’t any two way communication. I should note that the Ring video quality is higher than the blink.",Ring is very slow to respond to motion.

But if your not home and want to see the motion video the ring detects and saves to the cloud you have to pay at least $3 a month or $30 a year .

I do wish it was better at detecting objects apart. It goes off when cars drive by in the street but not people in sidewalk. The positive is it isn't telling me about people on sidewalk which is great. Negative is cars zooming by even farther away I don't need to hear about. Wish it had a better wifi receiver.

Yes you can always use the doorbell and receive a notification but if you want the option to view your videos at a later time, you have to pay for this subscription. I find this to be a downfall because I actually purchased two Ring cameras and I'm not sure if I want to pay for the annual subscription.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Mar 2018,Carlos Frey,"...I elected to place the doorbell in the middle of my front door...so hard wiring was not an easy option...(see photo #1...taken with 'flash' to lighten the entryway).  Consequently, I chose the Ring 2 Video Doorbell because once installed the battery is still easily accessible when charging is needed.  Installation was relatively easy...but more detailed instructions would have been most welcomed. ...The entryway leading to my front door is long and narrow...(10'x4')...which makes it relatively dark...(see photo #2).  In this darker environment the Ring 2 camera lens 'opens up' to take decent videos of activity within the first 3 to 10 feet of the door...but beyond the entryway, the images are completely burned out because of the much brighter exterior surroundings...(see photo 3...taken with Ring 2 video camera).  This is disappointing as nothing is visible beyond about 14 feet of my door.  I  hope a software fix is coming...as I would like to see activity in the street to the front of my house. ...Overall, I am happy with my purchase. ...NOTE:  The first two photos were taken with my digital camera...the 3rd photo was taken by the Ring 2 Doorbell...(showing 'burned out images' beyond the entryway).",Installing Ring 2 Doorbell...on Front Door...in a longer narrow entryway.

Having to spend another $50 for a device 15 feet away from the router is just poor build quality...... or ideal for getting people to buy more stuff (ring extender),Signal strength and stability

Anderson,Just had the Ring Doorbell installed along with the Ring Chime.  I am very pleased with this product as it adds a way to remotely and at home to monitor traffic to ones door.  It allows you to speak to door knockers  in a more candid manner than through a screen or open door.  One can simply indicate no interest in what they might be selling or ask them to move on or advise them that you are summoning the police.  after I ascertain the effectiveness of this system I may add components to it to further enhance my control of my homes perimeter.,Ring Doorbell is a hit at my house.

Simply put, this is awesome technology.  My installation required the ability to limit the motion activation zones or it would be triggered constantly.  The motion zone settings work perfectly for me.  I now know when someone is at the entrance to my property, packages arrive, etc...  Even when I am not home.  And the My Neighborhood feature is great for keeping tabs on anything that happens nearby. After having the doorbell for 2 days, I ordered a security cam and plan to order 2-3 more cams once I decide how best to cover my property (I am on 4 acres).  One caveat, all wireless devices are dependent on good wireless network coverage so if you have issues with the wireless connectivity you may need help from someone that understands coverage areas and signal strength.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Aug 2017,J. Cohen,"[update on 8/31] I talked with Ring's excellent customer support and they helped change a couple of settings on their end which significantly improved things for me. Connections are more stable and reliable for sure. Still just 4/5 instead of 5, since it's not perfect. Very rarely, a video will drop out despite my internet connection being fine. And motion detection is still a little wonky - sometimes too sensitive, others not sensitive enough. But most of the time it works well, and well enough for me to cancel my return and keep the device for now. Hopefully they'll be able to fix some of the remaining issues in a software update! [original review - 2/5] I really really wanted to love my Ring 2 and spent hours debugging issues, trying different wi-fi channels, moving things around, and on and on. In the end, I simply couldn't get it to work reliably, which is just a complete non-starter for me when thinking about products which are supposed to give me a sense of security. The biggest issue for me is probably that the Ring 2 doesn't support 5GHz wi-fi. My router still has pretty good 2.4GHz wi-fi support though. The ring itself claimed that it had a ""Good"" (green) signal. Yet despite that ""good"" signal, I often couldn't connect to it remotely or locally, and the videos it tried to record would end up just being 40 seconds of black/blank video instead. Ring (the company) was even kind enough to send me a Chime Pro for free, since it works as a wi-fi extender in addition to a loud chime noise. I placed the Chime in multiple different locations - all of them between my router and the Ring 2 itself - and not only did it not help my signal at all, it actually made the signal significantly worse! From there, customer support didn't have any suggestions left to offer. So in short: It worked poorly with a ""good"" signal, it worked even worse with their extended installed, and now weeks later I'm just giving up.","Improved after talking with customer support, tentatively recommended"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2017,Aleks Chernyy,"I bought the Doorbell 2 a few weeks ago.  The device comes with several covers and attachments so that you could customize it as you think best fits your home. There are settings for both motion detection by area, as well as doorbell activity.  Videos are recorded and stored indefinitely with a small yearly fee. The camera does require a battery that is supplied with the device and charges over several hours, but it lasts a very long time on a single charge (been several weeks and still at 100%) probably depending on how often you use the device. Also, the device requires a wifi connection, and if your router is too far away, you may want to invest in a range booster,  in order to be able to rapidly connect to your door.",The device comes with several covers and attachments so that you could customize it as you think best fits your home

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2017,Rich of California,"2d Update. I have been using the replacement Ring2 for awhile now. It is better than the one it replaced, but it is still off and on about when it connects. I thought the video froze on me a couple of times, but when I tried to repeat it, it worked ok. Also, it sometimes starts with a washed out video, as the first one did, but usually it clears up much faster. Bottom line, it is ok, but the Floodlight system seems to be the best choice. If I had electrical power at my back door, I would put one there. The new solar spot lights are not as bright as the flood, per reviews I have read. But I am updating my review on Ring2 doorbell from 1 to 3 stars, mainly because of the good customer service. Update: Jessica of customer service spent a great deal of time with me, troubleshooting my entire system, which includes a Ring floodlight and Chime pro. The floodlight has improved greatly. Ring2 still has issues, so they are sending me a replacement unit. I will upgrade my rating, if it works better. I have upgraded my floodlight rating to 4 stars. Very disappointed with this. It worked off and on for awhile, although I never had very good audio. But now it won't connect for long periods of time, at all. I spent $500 upgrading by adding a wifi mesh system that is designed to cover 6000 square feet. I have less than 1000, so it should be plenty of signal for Ring. The doorbell is the worst, but my Ring floodlight camera is almost as bad at times.  However, everything else in my house has great wifi coverage now. I am on Fios with a 150/150 mbps system. I guess I will call Ring tomorrow and go thru everything again, before I send it all back. BTW, even when it does connect, it takes way too long. Anyone stealing packages from the porch would be half a block away before I could see a live view.",OK

Written instructions were very clear and concise and if followed will provide success.  The tools provided were a drill bit sized for the anchors supplied for installing in stucco or concrete.  Also, a special bit was supplied to install and tighten the cover to the doorbell body achieving a tamper proof set up.  Performance is very good and you will have to adjust the motion detection to suit your needs and willingness to accept notifications-sometimes for legitimate people, dogs, etc approaching your doorbell, sometimes for loud garbage truck driving by.  You can also identify the area in front of your doorbell you want included in the motion detection.  Why not 5 stars?

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Feb 2019,M. Norris,I Like the ability to keep an eye on my front door. Great Idea! Absolutely hate that Ring wants me to pay $10 or more dollars per month to see the action at my door. I get immediate notification of motion but when I open the video the first seconds of action are not recorded. I see the car driving off- whatever. After the trial the recordings are not saved so the action is lost. When I purchased I did not know I would have to pay to see the video recordings! If you are bothered by paying for things you have already purchased I would suggest living without this device.,Monthly service plan SURPRISE!

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Sep 2017,Wilfred,"As much as I enjoyed the Ring Doorbell I feel like it's usefulness ends after their free 30 day trial of their services. It's about $3/mo which isn't bad but without it, the entire $200 investment isn't worth the money. Here's why. 30 Day Trial/30 Day Return Window Ring was smart to offer a 30 day trial for their services because it forces customers to try their products until the return window closes. After the 30 days, the Ring Doorbell is only available in LIVE VIEW mode. This means that if you have spoty wifi at home or if your phone's data plan wasn't strong enough to load the Live Video during a live incident, then you wouldn't be able to view it again. My phone's data is a bit spotty so sometimes when I attempt to view the live incident, it just shows a blank screen. If I back out of it and try to view it again, it says I can't because it's no longer a live event. Basically, if someone walks up to your door and picks up your packages and leave, you better hope you're not in a meeting or driving so you can view the incident live. If you miss it, it's gone.",Basically useless after 30 days unless paying for services

The app did lag half the time whenever you get a notification. But where they do get you at is you need to buy a subscription after the 30 day trial ends. It will not record/store any videos unless you have a subscription. The video doorbell becomes pointless unless you get a subscription. The battery life was mediocre and lasted only a month then it had to be charged again.

This is the worst product I've ever purchased.  It goes off every time a car drives by the house and it's on the lowest setting.  This drains my battery constantly.  This requires me to remove the security screw, fight to remove the cover which is now cracked and then spend hours without security or a doorbell while the battery charges.  Go and spend $400 on a different system.  It will be cheaper in the long run when you factor in the subscription and additional equipment.

It does seem to have fixed 1) battery life: I now have a good length of time before having to recharge my battery and 2) speaker: the speaker also seems to be working now that I have a new battery in.  Not that I have tons of visitors, but the speaker has now worked 3 out of 3 times since replacing the battery. Thank you Ring for the customer service. I have now bumped my review up to 2 stars, but not sure I can give higher star rating yet, because of earlier problems.  If Ring performs well for the next 6 mos I will update my star rating. Original Review: HATE HATE HATE the ring doorbell.  Firstly: I just charged the battery 2 days ago, and the battery is low and needing to be recharged again today ... NOTE: no one has even been at my house to ring the bell these past 2 days and the ""motion"" notifications are off, so why did the battery discharge so quickly?  Secondly: When somebody rings the doorbell, try opening the app and answering your doorbell if you are not in a good wifi area ... forget it.  Thirdly: even with good wifi, I've tried to answer when somebody rings but the speaker will most times not work so the person at my door can't hear me saying ""hello"".  Out of approximately 6 visitors ringing my doorbell, since my purchase 2 mos ago, this ring doorbell has worked only twice. AND this is my 2nd ring doorbell, because the first one did not work at all and had to be returned!  The ring doorbell has proven to be a complete waste of money.",TERRIBLE RING DOORBELL :(

I liked my Ring 1, too, but there were some problems with it.  They are gone with the Ring 2.  The image quality is drastically better as you would expect.  But other things, too.  There seems to be much less lag time before the Ring detects something and begins to record.  Live View is much, much fast at this, too. I can now face my Ring 2 toward the street, even though it gets direct afternoon sun.  While there is lens flare, you expect that from any camera pointing into the sun.  The good news is that even with the lens flare, the video is remarkably clear.  Night vision is much better, as well. There seems to be better Motion Zone sensitivity now.  I had to cut the distance to almost nothing in the Ring 1 to avoid trucks setting it off.  Now I can extend the area out much further without getting the false vehicle alerts. Best of all is the removable battery, especially for someone like me who runs it totally on battery power.  While I don't know if it's larger than the one on the Ring 1, it seems like it might be.  And being able to recharge it by just removing the face plate is a real improvement over uninstalling the entire unit to charge it.  Plus, now you can keep a fully charged extra battery on hand to swap out the depleted one. Before you lost any Ring usage while recharging the battery.",Upgraded from Ring Original

I purchased this product on February 4 this year because we had a scary incident one night while we were asleep. I knew I wanted to have video proof next time the incident happens again, so I looked into Ring Video Doorbell 2 based on good reviews. Everything worked perfectly within the first month. Video was high quality and I was even able to answer my door without opening the door for a salesperson. Then, last week I noticed the video would freeze up while audio was still recording. A delivery man dropped off a box near our front door. Ring recorded a very choppy ""figure"" that was heavily pixelated which then froze. Audio was recording delivery man scanning the box and other scuffling sounds. Then video came back with the man walking away. The video I'm uploading is our plow guy shoveling the front steps. Notice how you can hear the sounds, but the video freezes. I will be providing a follow-up review if Ring ever fixes this issue. If not, I will keep the rating at 1 star.",Video freeze

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2017,ROANDER,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW - 12/1/2017 I can now happily report that my RVD2 is working much better!  The problem seemed to have been due to the Ring Pro Chime needing new firmware.  Once it received new firmware, then the connection to the Ring Doorbell went steady and has remained steady and pretty fast ever since (about 2 weeks now).  I am bumping up my original 1 star score to a 4 star score since it is now working as it should.  I really can't give it a 5 star score as there are still some hangups regarding the product (i.e. - the need to have a Chime Pro in the mix & night vision issues when a porch light is on).  Now that it's working though, I love the peace of mind that it offers.  I would recommend the RVD2, but know going into it that it may not work right off the bat without some troubleshooting involved.  Good luck!  :) Original Review: Simply put, the Ring Video Doorbell 2 has been a piece of junk so far.  I set it up, following all the directions, and out of the box, it's performance is horrible.  Troubleshooting to get it to work has yielded the same results - still not working.  All wireless connections are very good, and my connection speed is 91 Mbps down and 80 Mbps up - there shouldn't be any problems in the connection department.  The issue I'm experiencing is that it sometimes works (about 5% of the time), but most all the time (95%) does not (all aspects - motion, doorbell activation, and live view).  Reading some of the reviews stated that performance improves when adding the Ring Chime Pro, so got that the next day, set it up, and still not working.  Called support and spent an hour with them this morning moving the Ring, disconnecting, connecting, etc... and still doesn't work.  The only thing they could offer was to send me another Ring Chime Pro for more troubleshooting....  How about just getting the Ring Doorbell to work without the Chime Pro??? I'm betting that the new Chime Pro will not work either, so sadly I will likely end up returning both the Ring Video Doorbell 2 and Ring Chime Pro.  Super bummed as I was excited about adding this product to my home.  I will update this review if it does end up working with the new Chime Pro, but still makes me wonder why the Ring VD2 doesn't work by itself??? Anyway, this is just my experience.  If you do decide to try it, I sincerely hope it works out for you!",Update to original review

But due to the lag time you can never log on quick enough. Total waste of money. Buyer beware BAIT AND SWITCH buy something you can use with out the contracts and extra service cost.,Save your money. If you dont pay for thier service its worthless.

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Apr 2018,Helene S.,"I cannot give this item more than 3 stars even though for the most part it does what it says and works well.  There is one huge issue, though, which is causing the lower review, and I don't know what to do about it. Generally, this works as expected.  As a single woman living alone, it is very reassuring to be able to see who is at the door without opening it, talking to them, and also getting a Live View at any time.  In this regard, I am getting everything I expected.  Sometimes the app is a little slow to load (and I have a very up-to-date phone and great Wi-Fi), but I've managed ok with it. Here's the main problem....this particular item (Ring Video Doorbell 2) does not allow you to adjust sensitivity to ""People Only.""  This became important early on, because I am woken up at 3:00 - 4:00 a.m. virtually every morning to my neighbor's car headlights swooshing across my porch.  I get an alert on my phone, waking me up, only to find it's his headlights.  Adjusting the zones did no good, because the headlights literally sweep over my whole porch.  In reading online, it seemed there was a way to select ""People Only"" somewhere in the settings, but alas....that is only for the Doorbell PRO, not the one I have.  In an online chat with a representative at Ring, he basically said I'm out of luck....nothing can be done.  Well, he DID suggest I turn off the motion overnight so I'm not woken up (ummm, do they not think I'd want to be alerted and woken if someone is on my porch at 3:00 a.m.???!!!).  Then he suggested that I adjust the settings so I only get alerted if there is motion for more than one minute.  Seriously...if someone is at my door for 2 SECONDS at 3:00 a.m., I want to be alerted!  I understand that the rep couldn't fix my issue, but I felt the suggestions were a bit asinine.  Better to just say, ""I'm so sorry that this can't be fixed"" than to suggest I turn off my motion overnight and leave my house vulnerable. I am not sure what I am going to do here.  I could buy the Pro and just take the $200 loss on this item (return window has closed), but honestly I am kind of turned off at the ridiculous suggestions I got from the rep.  I know there are other options out there, other companies.  I just know I can't go much longer being awoken almost every morning to this. If you get this item -- PLEASE make sure you will not have an issue with neighbor's headlights, bugs (yes, they set it off once or twice too), or even the sun and shadows, as you CANNOT adjust for this.  Spend extra $$ for the Pro version, or just go with a different company.","Ring doorbell is ok but has a huge flaw, and their customer service had ridiculous suggestions"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Apr 2018,Littlestar4,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. With an increase in property crimes in our area, my husband decided to order the Ring Video Doorbell 2, & I am very happy he did.  The Ring2 is a self contained, battery operated doorbell.  No electrician or wiring needed as it runs on a rechargeable battery.  You do have the option of hardwiring it into your electrical system, if you wish.  It also must connect to your in-home Wi-Fi. The Ring 2 has an HD Video Stream.  Placed on our front porch, it gives a view of the entire porch, front yard and the street in front of our home.(See upload)  The picture & video is quite bright and clear, even at night.  he Doorbell works via an app that can be accessed on your cell phone or the computer.  That means that you can still see & talk with  people who come to your home, even if you are not home yourself.  You also choose to be notified if there is motion - for example if the mailman throws a package on your porch.  There is no extra fee to simply have the device & use the app- however, if you want to save or download any of the videos to share with anyone (like the police or a neighborhood watch) then you will need to pay a small monthly(or annual) fee of around $3.  You can build an entire surveillance network with Ring products, if you wish.  They also sell a stick up cam, a floodlight cam, a spotlight cam, in addition to other versions of the doorbell with more features. Through the App there is a ""Ring Neighborhood"" where others in your area who have Ring products can share videos of people who have been to their home. For example, videos of people who broke into cars or homes.  I am very pleased with this product and we have been using it for over a month.  I suspect it will definitely come in handy when we go on vacation and can see who the ""kids"" have over while we are gone! lol",An excellent addition to your home security

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jun 2018,Melrin,"The doorbell works well and the installation was simple enough. I knocked off a star because the installation could be even easier.  If you have an old doorbell or want to use the existing transformer to power the Ring you must obtain a resistor . Back in the day there were stores where hobbyists bought such things for very little. At one time I had a tool box full of them leftover from projects. Now that store is gone and finding a place that has that resistor for sale isn't easy. There's one available on site for pennies and I ordered it with the Ring doorbell.  The resistor is big and hard to hide once connected.  I've installed a couple of these for others without an issue but as I was installing this one a lead broke off. The remaining piece was too close to allow soldering the wire to it. I had to find a resistor locally and it cost 8 bucks; that's a ridiculous expense Ring could eliminate. They already include a diode, including a resistor as well would cost them pennies and prevent buyers paying ridiculous prices. Other than that the device works as advertised and performs well.","Great device, Ring could make installation easier"

"Ring Video Doorbell 2 with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Feb 2018,Bronte,"Really disappointing. 1.  The Doorbell . . . only rings outside your door not inside.  So to hear any of the alerts you have to pay another $27 on top of the $170 you already paid. 2.  There is a circular light that twirlers around when it is on and makes your neighbor (in an apartment) crazy as they think you are recording them. 3.  The Echo Show which I also bought other than saying ""Show me the front door"" does nothing and that takes nearly 10 seconds to program on.  10 seconds is an enormous amount of time nowadays - whoever came was gone by the time you see your door.  Complete waste of time to buy the Echo Show with it.  That was another $149 4.  Your phone will not pop on when someone is there. A tiny slider will come up (no sound) to say someone is at the door. But you would have to have your phone on to know that.  Again that will take about 7-10 minutes. 5.  Battery.  NO one has rung it but at testing.  The Motion alert is at lowest and yet in a few days the battery is dead. 6.  There's more problems but you get the picture",A very expensive very slow and faulty excuse for a security camera
