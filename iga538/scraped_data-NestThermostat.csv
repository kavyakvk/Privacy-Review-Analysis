"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Aug 2018,2000SS,"I have had this device for almost a year now. I have come to the conclusion that I should have kept my programmable thermostat. The Nest is great if you need to control your HVAC at a vacation home or other long distance mostly unoccupied home. It might also provide some benefit if you have a DRAMATICALLY inconsistent schedule at your primary residence. But for the average person, there is essentially nothing it has to offer over a programmable thermostat. Unless of course you just feel the need to control something electronically ""just because you can.""",Think Twice Before Making Such a Large Investment
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2019,Runnerboy,"bought first unit from Amazon, easy installation, AC worked fine. After about 70 days, the wifi chip went dead and I tried to turn on the heat as it became winter time...no heat. I spent 4 hours with Nest support working through wire swaps and setting changes, and they finally agreed to sent a replacement unit within 2 days. 10 days later i received the replacement and installed it. The wifi worked but the it would not turn on my heat strip. Google searching revealed this as a known problem. Nest was trying to blame my AC unit's heat strip, but it works just fine when jumpering the wires together or when in Test mode. I had my own AC technician prove it too and he said he also had similar problems with the Nest. I called Nest support again, this time for another 3.5 hours, much of it spent on hold or explaining my issues over and over again, and then back to swapping wires and settings with a Senior Technician. I told them I give up and want to return both units for my money back so I can go buy a working thermostat, but they said ""no we only warranty it for 30 days""...30 DAYS?!!?!?!?! insane for a defective unit. So i came back to Amazon and like always, they resolved the situation by accepting the return back because they take responsibility and because they understand the importance of simple things like having working heat in the dead of winter! thank you Ray in Customer Service and thank you Amazon for standing up for your customers when manufacturers aren't willing to.",absolute piece of faulty garbage - known issue with heat strips!
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2017,Kevin Fangman,"I've only had this unit running in my vacation home for 4 days.  So far I really like the way it performs. I have an Insteon thermostat in my primary home.  It does not take into account the weather conditions or even monitor the weather.  Therefore when you program it for cooler temperatures at night it will try to run the AC even in the winter unless you install safe guards to prevent that.  The Nest won't do that in fact it wouldn't allow a test of the AC when I installed it because it said it was too cold to safely run the AC.  Very smart. I'm also impressed with the programming.  The web interface you use to access it from a PC is nearly identical to the app you use on your Android phone.  Even the thermostat interface is similar so you don't have to think about how to do things depending on what platform your accessing it from like you do with the Insteon thermostat. So why only 4 stars? 1)  The 3rd generation Nest has a new feature called Far Sight.  In combination with the ""Activate on Approach"" feature it will light up when you get near it and can present you with things like, current temperature, current temperature setting, digital or analogue clocks, the current weather in your town etc.  All that is great but if it activates to often the unit begins to get warmer which throws off the temperature sensors.  So, if you thermostat is mounted in a high traffic area your house will be cooler than you want as the thermostat will think it's warmer than it is.  You can eliminate this issue by switching it to ""Activate on Touch"" mode but then of course you don't get the Far Sight Advantages. 2)  Being new to my house I've been keeping an eye on what it's been doing.  I'm not at this house during the week and I was looking for something to keep the house within a temperature range while taking into account the weather conditions so has not to damage my HVAC system or run it needlessly.  When I'm away I have it in ""Away"" mode with it set to ECO which will allow it to run the furnace or the AC as needed to keep the house within the temperature range I've set so long as it can do so without damaging the HVAC system.  I noticed this morning the temperature was 1 degree cooler then the range.  I waited several minutes to see if it would turn on the furnace but it did not.  I put it in heat mode and it fired up the furnace immediately.  I've only noticed it do that one time but it is something I'll have to keep an eye on.","I really like this thermostat, far better than Insteon but not perfect"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Oct 2018,Sean,"I was super excited to get out of the Stone Age and start making my home smart. While the Nest looks flashy and makes you feel like your house could be smarter, it just doesn’t deliver for the price point. There are some things I love about it... the look, how the dial functions, the motion sensor, how it’s on WiFi. But the whole smart predictive capabilities are just not as smart as they make it seem. I find that I have to be the one to adjust the temp every single time. The worst part is that every night the heat kicks on at 2:30 in the morning, probably to heat up before we wake up, but my house heats up in less than an hour so 3:00am rolls around and I’m boiling. So I have to get up and crank it down time after time. This would be fine if the Nest could pick up the hint and learn not to do that but for some reason it just doesn’t. This really makes me question how smart it actually is and makes me think that it’s just not worth the price. They should really just make a nest for half the cost and not pretend that it’s going to change your life... it’s just a sleek thermostat.",Just a nice looking thermostat
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jul 2019,Knife Collector/Tech Addict,"I went into this with all of my friends telling me how awesome it is. I went into this wanting to like it. Install was extremely easy. Match up the wires from your old thermostat and connect them to the clips on the Nest base. Setup was a little cumbersome because of all of the information it needs and the options to set but it wasn't a deal breaker. First full day of use I was trying to figure out how to get it to go to 78 while I was at work and go back to 74 when I got home. I found the schedule in the app and set my settings. When I got home it was still on 78. I figured out it thought I was Away so it had me in Eco mode. I discovered this as I was at the Nest going through the settings and it was still saying there was no activity detected at home. Let me repeat that. I WAS AT THE THERMOSTAT GOING THROUGH THE SETTINGS AND IT WAS SAYING IT DIDN'T DETECT ANY ACTIVITY! I went through and turned off home/away and went back through my schedule which had lost my morning change to 78. The people defending Nest will say ""you have to let it learn. You don't program it, it learns your schedule."" No. It doesn't. Lastly ECO mode is a bad joke. It wants to let my house get up to 92 while I'm at work and not change it back to 74 until I get home. I don't want to come home to a house that is 92 degrees and wait 4 hours for it to get back down to 74. All while my AC runs constantly to cool the sweat lodge back down to a temperature that reasonable people would want to come home to.","""learning"" and ""smart"" are nowhere to be found"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Sep 2018,!,"I see a ton of negative reviews for this thing and after two years of testing mine continues to work as advertised. It cools my home down to desired temp before I come home 98% of the time. It adjusts temp in the am so when I wake up it’s not freezing cold. I’m never to hot to sleep. Life’s simple joys. The software itself is some kind of hybrid of magic and logic. I can’t figure out exactly what tells it to do what. Between my settings and it’s brain it’s ideal. I have a 950 Sq ft apartment in swampland Fl with a 1996 dinosaur ac unit. My electric dropped by more than half in the hot days. There is no real cold here but I assume it would be similar. Bought a second one for my other property and am eager to install and have reassurance that the pipes aren’t frozen. Of all the annoyingly confusing competing brands Nest makes the most asthetically pleasing devices. Will invest in cams, locks etc. it’s the Apple of connected devices in my mind beating them at their own game. I hope it becomes the standard. Works with my ADT. Very happy.",All I needed.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2018,DeepThought,"PROS: ▪️Control online from anywhere ▪️Intuitive interface ▪️Very flexible and detailed scheduling ▪️Easy installation (*also see CONS) using a well thought out labeled wire bracket mount and pop off front bezel ▪️Unobtrusive small ring design is easy to handle and control ▪️Feels very hefty and durable CONS: ▪️Home/Away Assist is not very good.  By default, it's on, and lacking any other Nest product, the only sensor it can use is the  thermostat's proximity sensor.  If nobody walks directly in front of the thermostat for 2 hours, it automatically sets it to Away mode.  Well, in our house the thermostat is tucked away in the living room, which doesn't get much daily foot traffic, so it set it to Away mode like 6 to as many as 9 times a day, every day.  I had to turn it completely off by going into the app settings, Home/Away Assist, What decides if you're home, and set the thermostat to No.  I don't use our phones geo-location either, because there's 4 of us, and sometimes the kids won't even take their phones with them, plus I don't want yet another of my dozens of apps on my phone draining my battery constantly.  I don't even keep the app on my phone, only on my tablet. ▪️* Installation was easy from a mounting standpoint but very hard from a compatible wiring standpoint - it seems I have a proprietary HVAC system that was using ABCD (i.e. carrier) wiring, but it was still labeled Y1 G Rc W and C at the thermostat (no doubt because of a lazy installer). Since Nest encourages you to go by the wire labeling (and not by the HVAC system), their compatibility tester led me very far astray.  On a support call, even though I gave them the exact brand and model of both my furnace and A/C and pics of both the control board and the wiring diagram in the manual, they insisted on sending out a Nest Pro to do my installation.  They will NOT advise on wiring over the phone, no doubt for liability reasons.  The so called  ""pro"" showed up without being prepared, despite being informed ahead of time of the brand and model, so he spent hours reading my HVAC owners guide and left with not only the job unfinished but without even hooking up my old thermostat so we could have heat.  He was scheduled to return several days later, but I canceled on him.  I read the HVAC manual myself, and it shows quite clearly the difference between the carrier wiring method (i.e. proprietary controller) and the traditional standard 24V wiring.  I had 5 wires to the thermostat, but only 4 (for the ABCD method) in use, and because I have a 2-stage furnace, I needed a sixth (W2) wire added to have Y1 G Rc W1 W2 and C, so I bought an 8-wire bundle (just in case) and ran new wiring.  Once I read through the owners manual, all I had to do was move the wires from the ABCD terminals on the HVAC controller board to the bus terminals detailed below.  To also include the A/C in the wiring, I had to read through its manual and trace the wires to a controller board in the outside condenser unit to get the correct colors (the A/C has green/yellow but the previous installers used red/white wires).  It now works, but I had to do the research and wiring myself.  I had to overcome the shortcomings of both their inadequate compatibility system and their so called ""pro"". Note, Bryant is a VERY proprietary brand, and they pay installers to push the proprietary ""carrier"" wiring system controllers, because they cost extra and are only sold by Bryant, locking you into their system.  But, if you're lucky, you may have a compatible controller board and you may still have the owners manual, like me, and you may be able to break free from their proprietary vise grip and do it yourself.  In my experience, any installer that pushes a Bryant system on you is receiving kickbacks not only for the HVAC unit itself but also for the proprietary thermostat control system.  They want to make you believe that you can only use a Bryant thermostat with a Bryant unit, and I believed them for several years, but that's false.  In fact, I remember asking the Bryant installer if I could install my own thermostat, and he flat out told me NO and I should only buy Bryant products, which for the WiFi enabled version is $600.  He also told me that because it's a 2-stage unit, no other thermostat would be compatible.  What a load of horse pucky. I included a pic of my Bryant controller board.  The green terminals are where the old ABCD wires went.  The bus board below that is for the standard wiring for Nest and other thermostats.  The hard part for me was how to wire in both the A/C and the condensation overflow cutoff (SAFE-T-SWITCH) which uses black/black wires.  For me it went... ▪️A/C C terminal with green wire then spliced to red wire to HVAC COM ▪️A/C Y1 terminal with yellow wire spliced to white wire to HVAC Y/Y2 (not a typo) ▪️Nest W2 AUX, orange wire, to HVAC W2 ▪️Nest G, green wire, to HVAC G ▪️Nest C, blue wire, to HVAC COM ▪️Nest W1, white wire, to HVAC W/W1 ▪️Nest Y1, yellow wire, to HVAC Y/Y2 (not a typo) ▪️Nest Rc, red wire, to cutoff switch black wire #1 🔹cutoff switch black wire #2 to HVAC R My furnace is a Bryant 987MA (Product# 987MA66100V21A-B, Model# 987MA66100V21, Series B) My A/C is a Bryant 187BNA (Product# 187BNA048000DBAA, Model# 187BNA048-B) (Geez, could they make those numbers any more confusing?

Overall I am happy with the purchase but have also had much more frustration with it than I would have expected. Positives: It is easy to adjust and maintain temperature In addition to the indoor temp it displays humidity and outdoor temp Easy ECO mode Can set different triggers to adjust temperature App is simple and fairly easy to use My house seems to stay at a more consistent temperature Negatives: Set up - for me was unnecessarily frustrating. It doesn't come with a manual, it's all in the app. Download the app and go to sign in.... Only options are to use Google account or Nest account. No option to create a new account. I use a password manager and dual factor authentication so logging into my Google account on my phone isn't the easiest when it doesn't automatically integrate. Instructions were limited. Little things like how to pop it apart so you don't break it aren't included. Mentions what it won't work with half way through installation. Made us concerned whether or not it would work with ours and few options to determine if it was ok. We pushed forward and installed it and it was fine. Learning setting resulted in some odd temperatures and sometimes we felt we were battling the thermostat. We would turn the temp down because house was getting too hot only to find Nest had readjusted back to previous temperature. Motion recognition - it turns on when you are near. Great during the day, not so great in the middle of the night. I haven't found a setting to turn this off yet. Action settings don't seem to be working. We have it set so that when it senses our phones are away from our house that it should turn itself to ECO mode.... It doesn't seem to be doing that even after 2 weeks of use. We have to either manually adjust or set schedules. App calendar scheduler isn't easy to do multiple edits. For me wasn't as intuitive but will be for some.",Worth getting but is imperfect

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jul 2017,jr,"So I live in the southeast, where the summers are brutal and the winters are colder than you'd think. We get wild temperature swings which keeps energy usage quite high during peak months of the summer and winter seasons. Thinking this could help save some costs, I decided to try it. While others have explained a lot about what this system does, let me tell you what is does NOT do. I was under the impression it would ""learn"" my schedule (as it advertises it does) and basically figure out that during the week, I work regular hours, as does my spouse. We leave the house within 15 minutes of each other, and arrive home pretty close together soon. So if I leave at 7am, and come home at 5 pm, I want the temperature a comfy 75-76 degrees in my home. The interim? Don't care, which is what I hoped the Nest would work on for me. Ideally, When I leave at 7 or so, it would start to dial back the AC/heat to a decent level, let's say the low 80s, so I could save money, then when it knows I'll be home around 5, it aims for heating/cooling the house back down to an acceptable level for me for when I walk in the door. This thing should be working at my house when I'm away to save me money by not heating or cooling an empty house for a few hours while I'm away, then kicking back on 30/60 minutes or so before I arrive so I walk in to a comfy house. However, it doesn't quiiiiite do that, you see. I have to do all the heavy lifting as far as keeping it saving me money through the app while I'm away. It has a motion sensor, and a phone proximity sensor, and uses those two things to determine if you're home or not. If your phone leaves a 1 mile radius, or you don't pass by the motion sensor for a period of time, it starts an invisible countdown (anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours, though it doesn't tell you how much time, and its not programmable!). After that time, it will starts to let the AC/heat slide in the house to a temperature threshold you set to save energy. Then, it waits until it senses motion or sees your phone again to fire back up. This is a significant issue if you've been away for an extended period, as your house might actually be quite warm/cold when you arrive, but the Nest won't fire up until it ""sees"" you, meaning you don't walk into a comfy house, you walk into your threshold temperature and have to wait for the Nest to catch up. The motion sensor is also a big issue if you have an older home like mine, and the thermostat is tucked away at the end of a hall, instead of by the front door. Might be a non-issue to some, but be warned if your thermostat is in an out of the way location. There IS an ""early on"" feature which lets you set a temperature and time (""I want it to be 75 degrees at 4:30pm""), and let it start heating or cooling your home a bit before that time depending on the ambient temperature. This is a good feature....except somebody HAS TO BE IN THE HOUSE? That makes zero sense to me. Why would I want to have the early on setting on....if I'm already home? Why, if I leave for work, should my wife sit through uncomfortable temperatures if she stays home, only to have it kick on a few minutes before I arrive? This is the feature that is missing from the home/away assist that is absolutely crucial to this being a REAL learning thermostat. This feature DOES NOT work if your home/away assist is on AND sees nobody home, so you're back to walking into a furnace during the summer, when it should realize that every Monday through Friday, I'm home at 5 (give or take a few minutes), and aim to have the temperature at my desired level at that time WITHOUT programming. As it is, you have to turn the main selling feature OFF (the learning schedule, home/away assist) to make it work right.This means manually changing everything if your schedule changes, instead of letting the cool parts of this work, like phone proximity etc. If it turns out I have to call in sick, now I have to go into the Nest software/app, and remove any settings I have for the day, and remember to set them back up so the next Thursday (or whichever day I deleted), I'm not blasted out by extreme heat/cold. So you CAN program this thing to set the temp throughout the house at specific times.....but that defeats the purpose of spending $200-250 on this thing. It sure looks cool, but I can get a programmable thermostat for a fraction of the cost of this. Why won't the Nest ACTUALLY learn like it says it will? This is a sorely missed feature for those of us who live in areas that get quite warm and cold throughout the year. If they could set it to where the Nest could actually learn the fact I like the temp at 75 degrees, about the time I get home, AND keep the home/away assist stuff on, I'd change my review, but for now, I'm sorely disappointed.",Doesn't quiiiite do what you'd expect

They connected with no problems at all and worked together nicely, as was advertised.  When my Foobot measured dirty air, the Nest turned on the house fan (furnace/ac fan), and we have a HEPA-like furnace/ac filter that cleaned the air.  The whole system worked perfectly and the air in our home was always of excellent quality.  Much-needed for my small kids and me, as we are prone to respiratory infections. About a month ago, I noticed that the Nest thermostat wasn't turning on the fan as it should.  Since everything looked okay with the Foobot, I contacted Nest support.  What a mess!  The support person was very hard to understand and made little sense.  She basically told me that everything is fine with the thermostat, so the Foobot must be having problems. I thoroughly investigated and learned that the Foobot is working perfectly, as it should. Here is the problem: When Google integrated with Nest, it cancelled out/removed some of the Nest features, including the ability to integrate with Foobot AND the ability to manually turn on the furnace/ac fan.  The ONLY thing that I can do with Nest now is program the temperature settings, control the thermostat from my phone, and get reminders to change the filter.  And, the Nest customer support person didn't even know about the changes to the Nest features with the Google integration?!?! What a joke.  I am extremely disappointed in Google.  The Nest thermostat is useless for me now.  I had to take it down and go back to my original (old-school) thermostat so, at least, I can turn on the furnace/ac fan when needed.

Bear in mind, this is with all my same equipment and no changes on where the thermostat is located, etc. Nest Support says this is normal.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Dec 2017,DermDoc,"I love it but beware Nest Home/Away Assist. I think I finally figured out why I wasn't saving money on energy when away from home for extended periods. My conclusion is that most home users with a smart home  need to fine tune the nest aware feature. My home has several smart gadgets because I enjoy tinkering with technology if nothing else. So the lights automatically coming on and off, the Roomba cleaning the floors and similar while away will fool Nest into thinking someone is home and turn your setting to the 'Home' setting if you allow other Nest gadgets (Nest protect, cam etc) to be part of the nest aware setup. I believe the best is to allow only the Nest thermostat and maybe your smart phone to control Nest Home/Away Assist. You see, I'd leave home and manually set it to 'Away' but it would revert to the learned schedule within a day or so. This despite the fact that my smart phone is part of the nest aware setup. Nest will in fact report that it is now ignoring your phone as part of the Nest Home/Away Assist setup as the phone has not reported its location in a while. Not sure why it does this as in fact I do have very restricted location reporting for my phone but the Nest App is one of the few allowed exceptions. The Nest protect smoke/carbon monoxide detectors in particular are very sensitive to light and motion and I have 12 of these in my home. Movement and lights coming on and off will be registered very efficiently by them. Anyhow, it took me about a yr of use to figure this out. Indeed you could just turn off the heat or cooling when away for extended periods and Nest would still turn them on if your house reached your critical temperature settings. In the cold you may have frozen water pipes by then. For me making Nest Home/Away Assist less sensitive is more useful. I'm currently travelling away from home and trying this out for the first time and so far my theory seems to hold true. I must add that part of my conclusion is based on the fact that I have a separate Nest thermostat setup at my office where it is the only feed for Nest Home/Away Assist and that setup has followed the schedule appropriately for a long time. This also may have delayed my diagnosis as I always believed the App on my phone which controls both setups was incapable of controlling both setups accurately. A false preconceived notion led to the wrong diagnosis. You'd think I'd know better, I have medical training after all. Edit 12/29/2018 I have changed the title and narrative of my discussion as in fact the feature I should have originally discussed is called Nest Home/Away Assist. Additionally, I can report that my thermostat has stayed in the Away mode the whole time I have been away.

It is no longer sending enough voltage to the HVAC and the AC is no longer working.

But now that the temperature has gotten down around 0, it FAILED!!!  I woke up at 6am the day after Christmas to a cold house while the overnight low was -1 and had a ""no power"" error on my Nest.  I ran through their troubleshooter and couldn't solve the problem.  I sent in a support ticket, and after submitting it, it told me to call. So I called their support and got stuck in an automated loop that eventually just referred me back to their troubleshooter.  I just assumed no one was working that early.  I grabbed my old thermostat and hooked it up and the furnace kicked on immediately and showed it was 60 degrees in the house. I received an e-mail from my support ticket the next day, telling me I had to call them to solve the problem.  Again I called, and never got through to a person. After a quick online search, I found out that this problem has been occurring since last year, but Nest doesn't seem to acknowledge it. I can't trust this thing to work in the cold when I absolutely must have heat in the house.  What if we were out of town?  With the highs being in the teens all week, our pipes would have frozen and our home would have had a huge disaster. I'm definitely returning it!",FAILED ON A COLD NIGHT

It’s simply awesome for my gas heating and cooling forced air system here in Texas. The weather changes seasons inside of one day here during the winter months so having a Thermostat that switches between AC and furnace automatically is amazing to me. Only thing I would recommend beyond this is a 3rd party plate like the POPMAS copper plate I bought here from Amazon. The neat comes with a super cheap plastic plate that will look terrible.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jan 2016,AL,"Purchase Date: 27NOV15 Purchase Price: $211.44 ComEd Utility Company Rebate: $100.00 After purchasing a new home and watching our utility bills rise for a while I vowed to change all of that in 2015. I began to purchase LED light bulbs as a start, new energy efficient appliances, and then September 2015 the Nest 3rd Generation was released which caught my attention. I asked my father in-law who had the Nest 2nd Generation for information and he had nothing negative to say about it so I was sold. After comparing it to other competitors I was hooked on this one due to the ease of installation, good reviews, and $100 electric company rebate (ask your local energy company). Do not be intimidated to install this on your own it's not hard. The instructions it comes with and YouTube to be on the safe side did it for me. Before installing please make sure to shut your homes power panel breaker prior to uninstalling the old thermostat and installing the Nest (be safe). Take a picture of the way the wires were installed on your old thermostat prior to uninstalling. In doing so this will ensure that your connections are connected correctly. Test your wires one more time prior to uninstalling to make sure no power is running (avoid being shocked or damaging anything). I did not use/install the base-plate (pictures shown) because I wanted a modern, sleek, and clean look. The body and display (40% increase) of the 3rd generation is slightly larger then that of the 2nd generation. If you have children you can lock it so that a child touching it can not change or disrupt your temperature or any of your settings. The stainless steel dial is very smooth and allows you to navigate through the settings with ease. It takes the Nest a couple of days to remember what temperatures you like when you are home and at what times you are home. After a couple of days Nest will ask you if you want it to automatically go into ""Away Mode"" when it senses you are not home (you decide opt in or opt out - I opted in). I recommend opting in to ""Away Mode"" for better energy savings. You can control when you are home and when you are away during those few days or if you opt out of ""Away Mode"" then you control it all. Smartphone application is free and easy to use. The new ""Far-Sight"" feature is awesome and can catch me at approximately 10 feet away even in the dark. When Nest detects any motion it will illuminate with what the current temperature is. This is how it can tell if you are home or not and can automatically place itself in ""Away Mode"" for energy savings. Being able to control everything from the application on my smartphone itself is so awesome (fan, cooling/heating mode, humidity level, away/home mode, set a schedule, history, etc.). Nest will remind you when you should change your air filters on your furnace because it can base it upon how many times it turns on and off. Significant drop in energy consumption can be seen on my gas bill after month 1. Due to this my father purchased the item as well and has no complaints thus far. UPDATE: 15FEB17 Still own the item with no problems. If you are doing research and thinking of purchasing it - just do it! It is paying for itself in savings thus far. Highly recommended!

The more time I spent exploring it, I found nice capabilities. Then problems started after two months. My home is in the colder climate of northern Michigan. While in Florida I checked my nest status. The nest was not calling for heat and temperature was dropping fast. I called the nest techs which were polite and helpful. They said my nest was wired for a heat pump which I do not have. Just impossible. The nest was actually calling my ac to cool down the house. Luckily I got a heating contractor to resolve it that was very familiar with nest. The nest was properly wired, but when wiring was check via the wi if it said it was erroneously wired for a heat pump. The nest was removed and reset. Now functions properly. The tech said they have never seen this malfunction before, but it's noted in their website. I asked for a replacement which they promptly sent. I'm now requesting reimbursement for my very expensive contractor services. This will be a good test if they stand behind their products. We will see. A month later Nest did reimburse me for the furnace tech visit. They have integrity. Nice to see today.","Nest Software Malfunctioned twice. Nest replaced the unit both times.

He told me he had six fail last year. My own Nest worked perfectly for 18 months, but then it decided that my fan and humidifier should run 24/7. Not the end of the world, but I was out of town. A different point of failure and I’d have frozen, burst pipes, or maybe 150-degree temperatures inside.  I contacted Nest, and after a long, long chat session they sent me a new base. I installed it and it didn’t make any difference. Then I installed my old non-Nest programmable thermostat and the furnace worked perfectly. Looking through the unit’s menus, I found that Nest issued a firmware update around the time the thermostat failed. I’m not sure if that was the problem, but we replaced the hardware and it didn’t help. Two big problems here: 1) Nest has been totally unresponsive since the new base failed to solve the problem. They were sending me emails and replying to mine up until the point I told them the new base did not work.  Now nothing.  I could call them, but they leave you on hold forever. I could chat with them, but the last chat session took 40 minutes. It’s still under warranty. They could reply to my emails. 2) Even if the service was wonderful, it was a mistake to buy this thing. The modern thermostat was invented in the 1830s. It is an extremely reliable, proven technology. In my 40 years of home ownership, I had never had one fail. Then I installed a Nest and gave my furnace all the reliability of a Windows 98 computer. And what did I get in return? I didn’t have to stand up and walk over to adjust the temperature. It did turn down the temperature when I wasn't home, but so does my old, $38 programmable.

I could not get it to work, the installers could not get it to turn on the heat.  The professionals that installed my furnace claimed that they have the most issues with the Nest controllers.  I really wanted this one to work because it was cool but it just refused to turn on the heat.  It did control the fan and the air properly.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2019,Steve Silva,"Nothing but problems with this thing. I never thought I'd be writing a bad review on Nest but here you go. I have a very simple HVAC and compatible system at my house. The heating works fine, but not the AC. It will provide cooling for most of the day, and then it switches, on it's own, to fan only, for hours. During that time, it will not operate the cooling part of my AC, just the fan. Nothing I can do in settings changes that. I have disabled all schedules, fan time, you name it, and the thermostat does not do the one thing I want it to do, like, run the AC until it's 73 in here. Nope, it's 80 and it might be 73 in 2 hours, or 3. Check back later. AC unit is newer, nothing wrong with it, worked perfectly with my old Honeywell. Nest sent me a replacement, but it's doing the same thing all over again. Virtually no help figuring this out from customer support, and it takes a tortuous time to have them send you another non functioning replacement. Buy something else, like a Honeywell. Edit 11-23-19- Not even a year since I bought this thing. Now with my heating: After using this Nest3, which is a replacement for the previous one I bought, which had an entirely different problem with my A/C system not cooling for the hottest times of the day. Only the fan ran. That was fun having my house 83 degrees from 2 pm until about 7 pm, when all of a sudden it starts cooling. Now this. No power, have to charge it via USB, which lasts a very short time. No, I am not having a Nest Pro out to my house either, (which is their solution). When I installed this latest expensive hockey puck, I ran a brand new thermostat wire from my furnace to the unit. All wiring has been verified as correct.

Probably would have been faster if I had needle nose pliers on hand to get a good grip to slip the wires into the slots. It detects everything your AC system can do and goes through a test of them all to make sure the wires were installed properly. Alexa syncing was super simple and I use it all the time through my phone via the Nest app. A nice eco feature allows you to set a temperature you would like it to maintain when you leave your residence. To save money, I set it about 5 degrees higher than normal (75F from 70) and I noticed a difference in my electric bill instantly! This will pay for itself within a couple of months! Recommended for everyone! Even if someone is elderly, you can set it up for them and have it do the eco mode whenever they leave the residence with their phone in their pocket/purse. 10/10!",Installed in 2 minutes!

The thermostat itself works just fine, it's the app and several other associated ""smart"" features that are disappointing. The smartphone app is a terribly glitchy thing and crashes more than 50% of the time. Just using the app for several minutes every day severely depletes battery life of the phone.  Also, it's disappointing that the energy usage history only goes back 2 weeks, and there is no way to view energy usage beyond that time frame. Nest will send a ""monthly home report"", but it doesn't show how much energy was used each day or the outside temps, etc. It would be super awesome if there was a way to access this information! Anyway, we have reduced our energy bills, which is nice, but we ended up programming our Nest to a regular schedule because for some reason it always wanted to go to 67 degrees (like that was the default temp or something).

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,Ray K,"This product has worked for us for over a year (bought in the fall of 2018). It is not easy to learn and it did not learn what I needed it to do. Thing is, it would do it, but I had to figure it out for myself. Let me explain. I wanted to keep our heat pump around 74 year round during the day and around 69 during sleeping hours. That's it. There is no easy way to do it. The interface with the thermostat is different from any other that I have had over the years. This one is round, so you can turn it to the right or left. You need to push in the middle to ""select"" things and sometimes tap it to the right or tap to the left for other choices. It didn't make sense at first, but through trial and error I figured it out and with a hour of turning, tapping, etc I was able to get it to work. It does have a heat/cool choice, so for a week, I needed 14 discrete settings. It is beautiful and it did work with my trusted Simplisafe system, one of the reasons I bought it - it had to be compatible with Simplisafe. When we turn our Simplisafe security system to ""away,"" it notifies the Nest to go into ""eco"" mode and supposedly saves us money. Earlier this year (2019), after having this thermostat for a year, Google bought Nest and has been transferring them to the Google Home ecosystem, including their own apps. A visit with a Google Nest tech a couple of days ago said that a recent update had made it more secure by terminating support for most ""third party apps,"" including Simplisafe. That is ironic to me since I trust Simplisafe, but do not trust Google with security and privacy! Simplisafe would notify the Nest when we would leave automatically (after we set it up to do that). Google Nest want us to use their app or my iPhone so that Google keeps track of wherever I go out with the iPhone AND it will tell the Nest we aren't home. If my significant other is still home, it would shut down the Nest. I would have to add her to the list of iPhones that they keep track of. Google says, in the disclosure, they want to know and keep records of my whereabouts and my spouse's, so that they can target ads, location information, and other stuff. I just do not trust Google with that much information in real time. I do use Google for email, YouTube, and other services, but not this one. If you are ""all-in"" with Google and their home apps, this might be a great-looking thermostat. Trouble is, Simplisafe, Apple, Google, ADT, Ooma, my cable company, Alexa, and numerous other companies want to be my ""security"" company and sell me their brand of peripheral devices. They are not mix-and-match and they all want to be my ""one-and-only.""

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2018,Dean Buzzell,"So far, so good. The videos offered on the Nest website made installation seem pretty easy, but mine wouldn't work right - no cold air from the AC. I went back through the instructions a number of times, looked online at user install videos - couldn't find anything that was helpful. Finally called Nest support. They answered straight away, and asked me a few questions, then asked me to upload the photo I'd taken of my wiring with the previous thermostat. I tried, but couldn't seem to get the image uploaded. While we were struggling with that, the technician asked me 'is your unit a heat pump?' When I replied 'yes', he said he thought he knew what the issue was. He had me attach a wire that wasn't covered in the install manuals, and it worked. I looked back through the instructions, and didn't find any documentation on how to connect the wires if you've got a heat pump. I'm sure that there's a LOT of homes out there with this type of AC unit, so perhaps there could be some clear documentation for that type of install put out there where it's more easily accessible. For simple installations, the provided documentation is pretty easy, and you can install this unit yourself with a minimum of trouble. However, if you've a more complex setup - zoned ACs, for example, or a heat pump, it's a bit more complicated. Even with a simple install, there's a LOT of advanced settings that aren't clearly explained. Like primary and secondary heat settings. Heat pumps have both, but I couldn't tell you which is which, or if my Nest is wired to properly take advantage of that feature. Or a setting that asks me how long I want to 'preheat', with the default set to 5 hours. I've got no idea what that means, and haven't been able to find any Nest documentation that talks about that setting. I've a lot of questions to figure out if I'm using the best settings for a heat pump in North Florida, and so far not finding any helpful documentation. That being said - it's working fine, and is saving me energy. By installing the app and tying it to my phone, the thing knows when I'm home and away, and goes into Eco mode when I'm away, which pretty much keeps it from running. Now that a few weeks have gone by, it has figured out my schedule, and starts to cool the house minutes before I get home. I looked at the schedule it created from my comings and goings, and I can see that it knows when I'm home, when I'm away, and knows when it's the weekend and that I'm home - the schedule it created on its own is a pretty clear indication the Nest knows when I'm around and when I'm not. It connected quickly and smoothly to my amazon echo device, but haven't used that feature a lot yet. I feel like I've gotten my money's worth from this device, and feel confident that I'll find the answers to my questions about the heat pump setup. It may already be set up correctly, but I want to know that I'm getting peak performance out of my AC, and I can't be certain I am at this point. I'll update this comment once I find that information.","Nice unit, but Heat Pump installation isn't as simple as you're led to believe."

I've had this for around 7 months now. In one word, I ABSOLUTELY HATE this thermostat for one simple reason: you CANNOT adjust the temperature differential on this thing, so your home is always either too warm or too cold. For instance I set the cooling temperature to 75, it won't start until the temperature hits 76, and it won't shut off until the room has cooled to 74! If I wanted 74, I would set it to 74. If I wanted 76, I would set to 76... 2 degree of swinging is just not comfortable. How stupid is this? Google/Nest have disabled all the 3rdparty APIs / IFTTT, so there's no way to mess around with the temperature settings via 3rdparty apps. Bottom line, I have my phone in my hand every day, and I have to manually keep changing the temperature to make our apartment livable.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2015,W. Stebler,"After a few months of use, I've lowered my rating for the Nest from 5 to 3 stars, and here's why:  Don't get me wrong, it's really cool and fun to play with and I want to love it, but, first and foremost, the thermostat should work correctly and somewhat predictably, and this thing always has surprises for me.  There have been at least 3 (to my knowledge) software updates applied to the unit since I've purchased it.  You can't control when you get these or prevent the unit from self-updating (unless it's not on a network of course, but what fun is that).  While I'm very happy that Nest is continuously improving the unit, i'd say their testing leaves something to be desired.  There have been several other instances when you walk by and the display doesn't come to life immediately - always a sign of trouble - the fix recommended by Nest is to reboot the unit. Really?  Thanks.  I don't know what else is not functioning correctly when things go south like this. First of all, I gave up on the auto-learning feature, as my schedule was too unpredictable - never gave it a chance but it seemed to learn quite slowly.  So I went to a self-programmed schedule like my original thermostat.  Programming on the unit itself isn't very easy just because you use the dial for everything.  Phone-based app is a bit too small as well (but arguably the coolest feature of the Nest - the remote monitoring and changing).  Best way to set up a schedule is through the Nest web site just due to the size of the display and that you can manipulate with a mouse rather than a finger. Also, I've found that since you can set the schedule remotely through various devices, the Nest seems to get confused and although the correct schedule is displayed, it doesn't seem to be the one that it follows.  I've had to clear the entire schedule and just program from one device. So I'm using the schedule but have enabled the ""start early"" feature which supposedly uses the outside temp and knowledge of how long it takes to heat your house in order to start heating beforehand and have it up to temperature (or nearly so) at the programmed time.  Better than setting the start time manually since it doesn't compensate for outside temp.  Great idea.  If it would work right.  Let's just say sometimes it starts early enough to get there, other times not.  But the worst part is that on several occasions the Nest has not only failed to start heating early but simply skipped over my programmed setpoint without changing the temp at all! - but only occasionally of course - it's unpredictable - so there's this level of mistrust between me and my Nest. I can't imagine what they are doing with software updates, but testing the basic operation of the thermostat should be something they do with every release, and it seems like they're not great at that.  I'm just waiting to come home one day and find my house at 90deg.  :)",I've lowered my rating...

Of course, I kvetched and they transferred me to somebody who offered me 40%, alas this was after 60 minutes of waiting and I was in no mood to continue using nest. Buyer beware!

I really like the idea of it learning my schedule and adjusting accordingly. But summer is drawing to a close and NEST is still turning the thermostat temperature UP (to 75F) at NIGHT. Every night. And since I live in the Houston area and it's 80 degrees outside, I then wake up and wonder why I am sweating. I realize it's not a hot flash and it's the NEST again and have to get up and turn the thermostat back down. Did I mention this happens every. night? I keep the thermostat up during the day (80F) , I don't need my house cool during the day, but everyone in my family prefers to sleep at 72F. It's late August now and it's been in the 80's at night for months now....if it wouldn't cost be so much to replace my TWO NEST thermostats, I'd do it like a shot. I probably will bite that bullet in the next few months. If it breaks, you can BET it won't be replaced with another NEST.","I hate NEST with the firey passion of 1,000 suns...."

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2018,Gregg Miller,"Admittedly it's a cool looking thermostat and that's a rarity.  Unfortunately it will change the temp setting on it's own and not to where I want it.  I've tried turning off the nest sense and auto schedule to no avail.  I don't really need A/C in my condo until it warms up to 78 or 79, below that I'll have the windows open.  With thermostat set to 80 and windows open Nest will suddenly change to a setting of 75 turn on the A/C and start pumping energy dollars out the open windows forcing me to react and increase the setting to get it to turn off.  The area where I live and on a mid floor in a condo building I don't need to run heat often unless there's a pretty good cold snap.  Last December I was away on vacation and had put on the home away setting and set the thermostat low so the heat would only come on if the temp dropped to pretty cold in the unit.  Once again Nest changed the temp setting I had placed it on.  It turned out that month the only energy I used was when Nest turned the heat on when I was out of town, heating up an empty place.  That experience may have been part of my inexperience with using it but it comes with virtually no instructions other than how to install.  Information on their web site or phone app on using is pretty lousy.  I regret buying the Nest thermostat.",Nest has a mind of it's own and overrules what I want
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2019,T,"A NEST PRO (authorized installer) said NEST removes unfavorable online reviews, so I hope this one goes through and you can search others.  Bottom line:  Do due diligence..... do online searches like “NEST complaints”, “c wire”, “common wire”, “NEST” And “compatibility”, “incompatibility.” What NEST doesn’t tell you, according to a NEST PRO, is that lots of systems are incompatible with many of their products (thermostats, doorbells, alarm systems).  You might have major installation headaches and unexpected wiring costs. Simple one floor, one unit, one thermostat ac/furnaces might work ok (I have relatives who love their NEST for such houses).  Sony dual thermostat control systems are  incompatible.  It will cost a minimum of $300 or more plus labor (per a HVAC expert) to change some dual systems to be compatible w the NEST thermostat. Also, NEST thermostats draw energy from your ac.  In some cases, like mine, when the NEST gets power it will trigger a surge to your AC and it will cause some ac units to randomly and repeatedly turn on, even though it’s freezing cold inside and outside your house, you have the NEST turned to heat only, and all your temp settings should not cause the  ac to turn on.... but it does.  The only way I could stop this was to turn off my house breaker to the ac.  As a temporary fix, NEST tech support had me disconnect the ac wire at the NEST and so the NEST would go to the heat (next wired connection) for to recharge the NEST but that could then cause problems with the heating system. See additional details, below. Sorry this is a fragmented review.... I’ve been writing down notes from my experience w NEST as it has gone on (a very long time). —— Generally installation seems simple, and their tech support in my experience was good at walking you through things, BUT I highly recommend doing one of the following:  1) before installing yourself, call NEST tech support and have them help you determine if your system is compatible, OR 2) Look in the NEST PRO box the product comes in, and follow their directions for finding one of their NEST PRO contractors near you to install your NEST thermostat (that’s what I did).  Using their NEST PRO installer for the thermostat gives you a 5 year warranty on the product and more support. Even though I am very handy at electrical and home projects, I used a NEST PRO because I was very busy and just wanted it all “done”, fast and right.  However, I got a total nut as a “PRO”.  Aside from him endlessly talking (while I was trying to do other things), asking very inappropriate questions about my income, marital status, if I lived alone, him talking about his prison time, his adultery, etc, etc, and his seeming very unstable mood, and questionable know-how, the  “simple” installation, took him over 6 hours and the NEST thermostats still didn’t work.  He tried to pressure me to give him a 5 star rating review before he would come back to fix the problem.  He said he did this with his other customers.  Additional problems w this PRO with other customers resulted in him bailing on being a NEST PRO and bailing on my job (likely a good thing for me). My system was still not right & I had problems w the Ac constantly running, the fan randomly running, and furnace not responding right.... problems I never had before with old fashioned Honeywell thermostats.  My electricity/gas provider sends me weekly updates my bill/usage and my usage / bill doubled with the NEST even though I had settings turned where it was not suppose to be turning on AC or heat,  and no one was at the house. I read up online about such problems and figured it was possibly a “C or ”common wire issue”.  The NEST PRO flake had removed himself from working for NEST and so I called NEST directly.  The woman in tech support was great, and the second, higher level tech guy was also helpful.  They walked me through  trouble shooting steps and agreed it was likely a common wire issue.  They sent out a service contractor to evaluate. This service provider was also excellent and NEST paid for his visit and would have covered the cost of installing a common wire BUT ONLY BECAUSE I had originally used a NEST PRO to do the installation. (Hence, I recommend using a NEST PRO.  Various bids to do follow wire outside of NEST were $500 to $1000, according to 2 people who served as NEST PROS). However, the good service provider found that my system is incompatible with NEST.  It would cost $$$$$$ to change my system to be compatible with NEST and there was no guarantee.  At this point I regretted changing from the working perfectly Honeywell thermostats.  I wanted to love NEST.  It was not meant to be. The problems continued as I tried to get compensation for my pain. The NEST higher level tech originally said he would work to get me reimbursed for the (authorized) NEST PRO original fee and the 2 NESTs I had bought.  He then told and emailed me instructions to ASAP send my NESTs back to amazon for a refund.  Amazon held back $80 of my reimbursement to restock the NESTS.  Then the same NEST tech said since I had sent the NESTS back to Amazon, he could not help get me reimbursed for out of pocket expenses I had (refund of my bill for the official NEST PRO who didn’t know what he was doing; full price of NEST Thermostats minus whatever amazon deducted for restocking).  I would NOT have followed his advice to send the NESTS back to Amazon if I had known it would jeopardize my situation.  I originally had felt pretty good about the customer support I received from NEST, but now feel like they do not support you.  I will never buy another NEST product. Incidentally, my old school Honeywell thermostats that worked perfectly before, were no longer found anywhere in my house after the NEST PRO left.  Perhaps they were misplaced by the PRO but they are gone so we had to buy new ones. So, for 2 NESTs, I have spent over a thousand dollars and more than 14 hours in this nonsense.  Plus double utility bill.  Plus $250 to put in traditional thermostats.","No to NEST:  incompatibility, customer service"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Mar 2018,EBF,"First let me say that this is a very cool looking thermostat. It lights up when you approach it and really impresses people. That said, I have battled with my Nest for over a year. It will work fine for weeks then decide for some reason to stop heating the house. And when it does stop, trying to get it back on the job has been a chore taking hours of resetting and rebooting the unit, and turning my furnace off and on countless times. Then, it will magically begin working again. I have called Nest only for them to tell me that my 1 year old, high-end furnace is the problem. I have updated the software just in case I was the victim of the glitch they had with the power on one of their releases. I never did have a problem with the battery going dead. It always indicated that the heat was on, only that it would be another 2 or more hours before it reached the temperature in my schedule. It would continue to say that all day if you didn't address it. Meanwhile the temperature in the house continued to drop. I finally gave up trying and bought a Honeywell WiFi thermostat. Guess what, my furnace is not the problem after all! The Honeywell is so much easier to set up and gives so much more information on the display. No more spinning the dial forever trying to enter a network password. The Honeywell actually has a keyboard that pops up when typing it! And, finally, my home temperature is actually what I set it to. Nice try Nest in attempting to save energy costs for me, but don't do it at the cost of family comfort.","Great looking, now if only it heated the house!"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2019,BrianD,"I purchased this to replace a first generation Ecobee.  The touch screen had failed and it also lost wifi connection while I was on vacation, during the record setting Polar Vortex of January 2019.  It was no longer trustworthy. After some research I decided to follow the crowd and buy the Nest. My first impressions were the documentation is nearly nonexistant and definitely tailored to the neophite.  If you have any technical ability you might be frustrated by the lack of information.  Any complications or advanced setup endevor will be met with direction to seek PRO assistance, in otherwords hire someone. I was able to get it setup after some google searches.  I have a humidifier and wanted to control it from the thermostat.  Turns out the Asterix output can be configured for this.  No where in the box does it explain that. It’s overall software capability compared to Ecobee is very limited.  For example there is no ability to schedule a vacation.  Your only option is to just turn off the thermostat from the app.  The Nest folks recommend this and then just rely on the safety Min and Max temp settings which will force it back on if it gets too cold or too hot.  Well this would be ok but the Min is 45f and the Max is 92f.  What if I want it to be 54f and 85f.  Can’t do it. Also historical data is very limited.  With the Ecobee I could see when my furnace was operating historically back many months, both with first and second stage heat(I have a 2 Stage burner), or cooling. Finally it’s hard to comprehend but there is no hold feature.  Nest says their advanced learning features negate the need to require a hold feature.  I disagree.  In general I feel like the Ecobee is far more feature rich.  Ecobee is also constantly improving their APP. The Nest’s claimed advantage is it’s ‘Smart Learning Operation’.  We’ll see if that pans out, but so far I think it is thoroughly over-rated.  Also the temperature is reads is almost 4 degrees high and there is no option to calibrate it in the setup.  The Ecobee has the ability to compensate the reading up or down in the setup configuration.",Over-rated and lacking in features.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2018,Kristin,"I purchased this Nest Thermostat mainly because I can monitor everything in my phone and because it tells you how long your furnace is running. I live in the Midwest where the winters can be pretty cold. I like seeing how much time each day it has been running and if I make changes (such as changing the furnace filter or adjusting the window coverings) the next day you can see the effects in your energy usage! The idea of changing the temperature based in people homenor gone is nice, but not useful to me. I work from home a lot, and do not walk past the thermostat enough to indicate I am home. If you are gone more I could see this being a nice feature. There are directions in the box and lots of videos in line to help you install this yourself. I was able to install easily by myself. My biggest problem was the wire hole behind my old thermostat was larger than expected and they had messed up the drywall pretty good with holes installing the old one. I had to patch some of the wall and touch up paint, and then position this carefully so I could get enough grip with the screws. But that is reflective of the person who installed the old thermostat, not this one!",Love the remote monitoring

It's expensive, high tech, and top of the line. But it has been a disappointment. There's no hold feature. Probably so you don't forget and waste energy. But it will turn off all the time for no reason. Or the other way around. It will turn on even after you have adjusted the temperature to avoid it. I have turned off all the ""smart"" features and it still seems to do. The only way to stop it is to turkey turn it off. Another problem is the software. I've had multiple times where it has randomly stopped charging. When this happens the wifi will cut out. After research it has been shown to a software issue that hasn't been fixed yet. I have also purchased the remote sensor and have had connection problems with it when using it just feet away. On a positive side. The screen is a nice feature. I like how it displays the weather when walking by. Choosing which site to use would be nice. Something I'm sure nest would have to set up contracts with.

Integrated with Alexa flawlessly.  All just to insidiously enter my home to torment me! This thing has a mind of its own.  I've had it installed for one month, and twice I have come home to a 54 degree house (cat and dog doing forbidden things together to stay warm, icicles in the toilet bowl) and three times to an 80 degree house (palm trees sprouting, vacation webites advertising my house for a winter getaway). Many times the furnace just won't shut off despite exceeding the programmed temperature, and I have to go down in the basement and flip the switch manually as even turning the Nest all the way down did not shut it off.  But other times it will reach the programmed temperature and shut off properly.  ""Ahh"" I think, ""it's working now.""  I could hear its quiet evil laughter...  20 seconds later the furnace kicks back on for another cycle. So I turned off the learning feature and set my own schedule.  Didn't matter, none of the glitches changed.  My natural gas and electricity bills this month are going to be through the roof.  And this thermostat is supposed to save energy? Nah, at night it makes surreptitious visits with the gas and electricity companies promising them even more money! I gave in and called my HVAC guy who could not find anything wrong with the wiring.  The install was perfect.  He pulled out an unused common wire in the wall and added it and reconfigured the wiring to see if it would help.  Nope.

It's a nice clean design, and I like the auto-away functionality. But after a week's use it is repeatedly dropping off wi-fi because the battery is not charging off the low-voltage wires like it is supposed to. Which ultimately means it's not that much better than the digital thermostat it replaced and which will go back up on the wall if I have to send this back. It's nice that it has a micro-USB port on the back to plug it into a wall to recharge, but that is not a viable solution in my book. I have an older house, and the only wires I have are Y1, W1, G, and Rc. I had it hooked up to Rh originally, but when I started researching this problem a post said to try Rc instead. It made no difference. The thermostat will eventually charge enough to get above the 3.7v it needs to connect to wi-fi, but then hours later it will drop off wi-fi again. Which means I cannot control the thermostat with my app at the minimum. What other functionality it loses when it has no wi-fi connection I don't really know.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Mar 2019,kim ross,"I purchased this thermostat and installed it in the summer of 2018. Reason for the purchase was my mom, who was turning 88, and needed something easy to read and understand (she does not understand technology and had trouble seeing the old mercury thermostat we had since the 70s that worked perfectly all those decades). This thing was great!  She could turn it with the dial like she was used to. It was easy to read. It had color so she knew what system was on. And best of all,  she could tell Alexa to turn it up or down from her chair. Only thing I noticed was it kept kicking the AC unit on and off in shorter cycles,  which I didn't like. Then winter came. I live with her and work days. She would start noticing the thermostat would adjust itself to 60, without touching it,  at least twice a day. She would get cold and realize it's on 60 and turn it up. The other thing I noticed was it would adjust itself to 70 at around 4 AM when I didn't want that, wasting heat and money. I tried adjusting the schedule so it wouldn't do that and had the away feature off since she's home. That didn't work. Turned the schedule feature off and figured that was that. Seemed to work. Then we started getting the infamous ""2+ hours"" message people are reporting when you turn the heat up. Thermostat is still lit orange, which means boiler is still sending heat ... and registers are warm, but the temperature in the room wasn't going up. In fact sometimes it was falling. Thought maybe internal battery was getting low (I don't have a C wire,  but support says it's not necessary). Battery was reading about 3.8. Charging it via USB didn't make a difference. Adjusted display brightness and farsight to ""on when pressed."" Didn't help. It would take hours to go from 67 to 70. So by the time I get home,  my mom's finally comfortable in the room. Thankfully we have a big house,  so during the day she's in the back bedrooms, which is controlled by a regular manual thermostat,  to stay warmer. So in the last few days I've had to use a space heater in the room with the Nest to warm it up before I leave for work. It seemed to to maintain the warmer temp (70) for the first two days. Over the last two days, however,  after heating the room to 70 it gradually fell (usually not below 67, however this morning I woke up to 64 degrees in the room. I went into settings and updated software .. which said was up to date. I decided it worked better when auto schedule was on so I turned it back on,  and instead of saying ""2+hours,"" (which is the thermostat saying to you it doesn't care if you turned it 70 it's refusing to heat the room to that temp for over 2 hours, even though I'm cold), it said ""heating."" I thought yessss, heat! That's what a thermostat should do, give you heat when you're cold. So since it's my day off, I have to get my car worked on and do shopping. Checked the thermostat before I left. And you guessed it .. it won't seemingly heat past 68 (giving me that 2+hours crap message again). Checked the app while I'm sitting at the car mechanic waiting ... sure enough it's reading 67 in the room, even though the color is orange and set to 70. So temp is falling again. So far I've used support online ... not chat yet ... and YouTube videos to try to solve this. My life is too busy at the moment to deal with nightmare stories I read online about being on hold over an hour and how bad Nest customer service is.  Guess I have 2 options at this point. Suck it up and waste probably hours with customer service when I get home. Or simply trash it and put back the old reliable thermostat my mom has trouble seeing. Soooooo, my conclusions.  I thought this thing was literally the greatest thing since cheesecake (much better than sliced bread). It worked great for one summer, fall, and much of one winter. I've had it installed for nine months to date (it's currently early March 2018). I live in NYS, so no major temp swings during the year. I'm technologically savvy with just about everything.  But have no idea what's going on with this thing. I'm a technology junkie of sorts. I wanted to love the Nest, but decided never to buy a Nest product again. I'm starting to hear a lot of bad things about them (my mechanic had trouble with one too he just told me). I can't afford it failing with my elderly mother at home and I can't even get the heat to go up. BTW the app worked perfectly for me ... really loved the easy interface and that I can control it remotely.  Installation and setup was super easy too. It's all such a shame. The design is beautiful.  They would have to lower the price and have maybe a 10th generation before I may consider one again. They have to fix a lot of issues. By then, however, there will be many smart thermostat options, so doubt I'll give Nest any more of my money. If it wasn't for my mom's vision problems I would probably still have that old reliable thermostat on the wall that worked perfectly.  It ""listened"" to me when I was cold. Turn it up and presto ... heat came up almost on cue. A thermostat is supposed to keep you comfortable and obey your wishes. I think this one actually wasted money by blasting heat early in the morning when I didn't need it. Although now it's not giving me enough heat. If customer service miraculously solves this I will update this review. I'm not holding my breath though. To safeguard my mother I'm going to put the old thermostat back. We still have cold days ahead. Guess I'll use my $200 Nest as a hockey puck for the kids.",Don't know what's going on with this thing ..

The following weekend, it went up & down like the previous weekend.  I had to go to the schedule and remove most of the settings.  Sometimes. we're in all day, sometimes not.  The Nest couldn't handle that. The bigger problem was, every time we walked by it, it would display the temperature (nice and big, which was nice) but it also turned on the air handler!  I don't think we had it connected a month before we woke up to a very cold house - no heat!  It burned out our air handler motor. We had to have a heating & cooling repair man come and replace the motor.  We put our old Honeywell thermostat back on and we have heat. I do miss the display and the ability to turn the heat up or down by phone.  It was handy if you forgot to turn the heat down before you left the house and you could turn it back up on your way home so the house would be nice & warm. I was really excited about trying it!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jan 2019,Mr. Deal,"I was excited to get a Nest, but that excitement was short lived. Sure, it looks cool! But... does it function as well as my previous thermostat? No, unfortunately, it does not. In fact, it's has cost me a lot more to operate the Nest, because it does not understand Dual Fuel systems properly! You can not choose which fuel source to use, you can only either have them both on, or both off. In the winter it's a lot more affordable around here to use natural gas, however, it's impossible without rewriting every time you want to change the fuel source to turn off the Hot Air Pump. So, my heating bill has been $200-300 per month during the Winter months. On top of all that, there's more! First off, the original device sent my way was defective. I paid 2-pros to take a look, the first one charged me $200 and we got no where. The second one was a Nest certified pro, unfortunately, Nest does not actual train their ""Pro's""... From the Pro's mouth, they give you them a multiple choice test, and a video interview (in which my Nest pro just looked up the answers on the web... thanks for the honesty! I don't blame the person, he was a nice guy, but Nest should know better!). So, I paid $120 for a ""Nest Pro"" to come out, we ended up having to send for a replacement for the Nest... And the saga continues! The replacement was the wrong color... at this point, I'm probably giving up... I have spent hours with customer service, running in circles. Honestly, out of the 10's of thousands of dollars of equipment I've bought on Amazon in the past couple years, Nest has been the most difficult to deal with. Wish this would of worked out! At this point, I've lost hundreds of dollars using the Nest, and everyday it continues to run during the Winter, I lose more money.  Perhaps this is a great product for a Single Fuel home, I'll never know!",Have a dual fuel system? Look elsewhere.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2018,rgprints,"From my experience with the product, I can see why some might rate it 5 star, but my experience was not good and cost me a lot of time and frustration after purchasing and subsequently returning (one after another) three Nest Thermostats. It's a long story... My heating-A/C system is three zone with a Honeywell HZ311 controller and an Amana ASXC16 air conditioner. The saga begins in early January when I purchased and installed the first Nest Learning Thermostat after checking for compatibility online. Installation was a bit of a hassle because Nest thermostats won't work with the Honeywell controller unless there is a common wire. I had to overcome two problems - (1) the Honeywell thermostat that I was replacing had been incorrectly wired with respect to the common wire and Nest's instructions are based on existing wiring, and (2) the Nest tech support person that was helping me did not understand the common wire requirements as related to my controller. It took me a day or two of further detective work, greatly aided by inspecting the wiring on a second thermostat, to figure out how to properly wire the Nest. After several weeks of using the Nest with my heating system we ran into significant conflicts with the so-called ""learning"" aspects of the thermostat. I would set a schedule only to notice a few days later that my heating schedule had been inexplicably altered in ways that I could not understand. (A personal note. I have decades of experience in AI, starting in the early '70s as a graduate student, so I was also very interested in seeing how the learning function would work.) Well, the learning function of the Nest, IMHO, is beyond comprehension as it seems to completely ignore any explicit instructions it receives from the human operator, so I think Nest techies have a lot of work to do there. As a practical matter, we could not live with the thermostat as a learner. In a conversation (or chat) with tech support, the Nest representative suggested we replace the Learning model with the ""E"" model, which I then did. Now we were very happy with the Nest (the ""E"" model) for several months. We really liked the scheduling functions and the Eco ""away"" functionality, and what was particularly useful was the ability to remotely set the temperature prior to our return after a week-long absence. However, that happiness evaporated when we had a heat wave in early April with temperatures hitting 80 degrees and we found that the ""E"" was causing our air conditioner to rapidly cycle on and off with a significant loss in efficiency. What I had failed to notice and what the Nest rep had failed to point out is that the ""E"" and the ""Learning"" thermostats have differences wrto A/C compatibility. In particular, whereas the ""Learning"" works with two-stage air conditioners, the ""E"" does not. Our Amana is two-stage. All of this involved another long session with a Nest tech rep, and after going through our whole saga, the rep suggested we go back to the ""Learning"" model and also that it was easy then to turn off the learning feature which we strongly disliked. (I wish that the earlier rep had made that recommendation rather than the suggestion to replace with an ""E""!) So the ""E"" was returned and another ""Learning"" model obtained and installed. A few weeks went by and with the learning mode disabled we were now pleased with the the ""Learning"" model, until the weather got warm again. Then we saw that the ""Learning"" model induced exactly the same rapid cycling in the A/C as had been the problem with the ""E"". Again a conversation with tech support and this time the rep told me that my specific model of Amana was not compatible with any Nest thermostat. So now our third Nest has been returned, and we are getting a ""smart"" Honeywell thermostat instead. After all this I began to wonder if I had not been diligent enough in my initial compatibility checking, so I did a Google query combining ""nest"" with my Amana A/C model number, but got no hits. From that I conclude that the fact that my Amana is not compatible with Nest is knowledge available to Nest reps, but not the public. Some final comments on Nest tech support. If you've read this far, you are aware of several problems arising from tech support. Overall, support personnel were easy to work with and seemed very knowledgeable, even though in some cases it turns out that they should have been more knowledgeable. The biggest problem is that waits are extremely long, both for chat and for telephone support. On top of that, their chat and telephone technology is not reliable. I had at least two chat sessions that terminated unexpectedly, and one extremely frustrating phone call where I was finally connected to a tech after a 40 minute wait, only to immediately get disconnected. The phone wait is also extremely frustrating in that a voice occasionally comes on to inform you that wait times are extremely long and to suggest that it might be better to try at a different time, without suggesting a time range that might have shorter waits.",Compatibility issues are paramount. Tech support has some problems. Be aware before you buy!

We both spent 2 hours on Nest support with senior tech rep (painful to get to that level) and seemed to be working.  Over the next couple of days it was unreliable as before.  Would not work with one phone or two.  Another 1.5 hrs on the phone with tech support.  Rep went over all settings (same as before, no change), but then told us to add actual street address instead of just the flag on the map.  Tried that over next couple of days, no help.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,Donald W.,"I have lived with the Nest thermostat for three years now. It has done nothing much to improve the heating/cooling experience in my home (as compared to a regular mechanical thermostat). As others have commented, they market this product as a ""learning"" device that will save you money in the longterm by automatically setting optimal temperatures. It absolutely fails in this regard. You might as well stick with your old thermostat if that is what you are looking for. In fact, my Nest actually wound up costing me extra money on heating/cooling during the first year because I naively believed the hype and didn't do a good job of checking on it. When I did start checking, I found it pretty much was just keeping the temperature at constant settings with no good adjustments for time-of-day or outside temperature BUT, you can easily program a schedule of temps and times. That's not ""automatic"" and other cheaper thermostats can do that, too. It does look modern and cool but if your thermostat is down an out-of-sight hallway like mine, who cares? The best thing about the Nest thermostat is you can adjust your settings in your house from anywhere in the world using the app on your phone or computer. That's great if you do a lot of traveling. But, if you're mostly always at home and only take a few days away here and there, it's not that big of deal.",Overhyped gadget

As the house temp was down in the 50's, I was on hold for Nest support for 2 hours and 15 minutes (Happy New Year).  This a big issue and we are starting to see the reviews stating the serious problem.  If you do not have a functioning control wire (usually the blue wire) and the temps get below zero outside, some HVAC systems quit powering the Nest thermostat and it just turns off because the battery drains out.  The temp solution is to disconnect the yellow wire which controls the air conditioning.  That will get the furnace working again.  It also means you need to remember in the spring to hook up the yellow wire again or you will have no AC.  The long term solution is to get an HVAC repairman to hook up a common wire to the Control port of the Nest so the battery will always receive power.  The only redeeming part of this review was the Nest support person I dealt with (Alexis) was very helpful and spent the time to answer all of my questions and wait patiently for about an hour as we fixed the problem.  That good support person got it up to a 2 star review.",Furnace quits running in frigid temps due to Nest battery draining
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Nov 2017,S. Heath,"Just installed yesterday, but so far, I love it.  Very stylish.  Ease of install could not have been better.  They even provide an optional mounting plate and screwdriver for the install.  Turn off breaker, record which wire went where on the old thermostat, then reconnect to the same terminals on the Nest.  Breaker back on and it boots up in a few seconds.  Connect to Wifi, then it walks you through the rest of the install asking a few questions, then even lets you run through test cycles to make sure it is working well.  You have to download the app, then input a code the unit displays to activate fully.  Then, in my case, I linked my Nest account to my Alexa account (in the Alexa app) and I have voice control.  Worked like a charm, both in setup and voice control, so far. My son had a Gen1 Nest and he complained all the time that it would not 'see' them in the house (since they were on the other side of the house) and assume they were away.  Not a concern any more.  Now you get Geofencing as an option.  You can tell it to use the GPS in your phone or tablet to 'know' when you are home and when you leave and adjust accordingly (per your guidelines).  It even will let you share the app features with others in the house, so it knows if one phone left, but the other is here, to assume you are home (unless one of you forgot your phone, of course). Make sure to go back to the settings menu and scroll through each.  You can set up the display to show the current temp, current setting (including high/low range if set for auto-changeover from heat to cool), or even the current outdoor temp and expected temps for the next 4/8/12 hours (which it gets from the Weather channel, when you set it up and tell it your zip code). I'll update again if I end up with any negatives, but have to give it time to learn our habits to see if it will save us anything in the long run.  If not, still happy just getting the automation with app and voice control.",So far so good - I think I'm going to love it.

This white Nest learning thermostat is the 1st of 3 thermostats I'm upgrading and I'm very happy with it so far, but there are specifics that need to be mentioned. The 1st Nest thermostat I received from Amazon was defective. During installation and near the end of setup the thermostat detected a wire connected to the Y2 terminal (which there was not one). After looking high and low on the internet for any similar issues and finding non at all (I can only assume this means it's a rare issue), I called Nest tech support. They concluded the device was defective and gave me the option of using up the warranty or returning it for a replacement through Amazon. Obviously it was best (and faster) to replace through Amazon. One thing that really bothered me---since the device thought there was a wiring issue, I could not finish setup. But, you must finish setup to remove your personal information that was entered at the beginning of the setup process (wi-fi password and SSID for example) and reset the device. There is absolutely no way to remove your info in the event of a setup error such as mine. The replacement device works great and I really like the white version. I've heard the stainless steel version gets finger prints and smudges very easily. The white matches all of the trim in my home and it looks fantastic. I did use the wall plate to cover a hole that was previously hidden by my old thermostat. The wall plate looks great though and with the inclusion of a built in level, a metal back plate (if needed), wire labels, and magnetic screwdriver, it shows all the thought Nest has put into making installation easy for anyone. It works seemlessly with Alexa and the devices display is customizable and gorgeous.",An excellent smart home addition!

Since my first replacement they have outsourced their customer service offshore and the agents are very difficult to work with. I'm on the phone with customer service now again. Here was the worst experience I had with them: My Nest Learning Thermostat failed inexplicably today 11/16/2018, with family en route for the holidays, and a 5 day old in my home. We are expecting 20 degree lows overnight and up to 1"" of snow here in Iowa. I performed a lite reset and factory reset the thermostat to see if that would resolve the issue. It looked like it was functioning but the furnace wasn't responding so I initially ruled that out. I mean, the thermostat was only about a month old! I paid an HVAC professional $125 for an emergency service to diagnose the problem, suspecting it was something wrong with the furnace. He diagnosed the thermostat as the culprit and even plugged in a new Nest unit to verify a new unit would work. Before things went downhill from there I must say, I have been extremely pleased with Nest products up until this point. I have them throughout my home and they have been a major convenience and peace of mind. I am furious however that your customer service is so limited in authority and arduous to navigate. I spent 3 hours on the phone with your support team, at least 1 hour on hold. My call dropped and I lost my place in queue. I was referred to the chat support for senior level support. Chat access was quite a bit faster actually, so that was good, but my optimism was quickly stymied by support agents that were stuck in old modalities of thinking. Instead of ""the customer is always right"", I got, ""here are the options, they both suck and require our customers to be punished and suffer."" My solution was, I went to Walmart, got a new unit and sought approval to refund my original purchase upon receipt of the defective item (the lesser of what I paid for the two Nest thermostats I have bought now). I had the new thermostat at the ready for the approval from Nest support. They could solve my problem in just minutes if they only agreed to the resolution I had at the ready, but they wanted to make it harder than that. They want me to wait 1-2 days for a replacement to arrive from the factory. This inconvenience with everything else I have on my plate at this time. I don't have time to write this comment, let alone spend the 12 hours I did today dealing with this in-toto. After all I had been through today, I was not wiling to accept their solution when mine was clearly better for them, and better for me. I'm not trying to screw anybody here, I just want to get back to my newborn and preparing for the holiday! I drove a hard bargain and still customer support did not arrive at the solution I had at the ready. The correct solution. How infuriating! I'll be selling the replacement unit on Craigslist, buying a competitors product, and advising to everyone I know never to buy Nest products again because of this experience. Mega-huge companies like Walmart, Amazon and Nest have to be built to eat some expenses when their products fail. Even if only within a certain statute of limitations. It provides an incentive for the development and perfection of your technology that your already making money hand-over-fist upon. The expense you would have incurred making me happy if peanuts compared to the money it WILL cost your company in the long term.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jun 2017,Steve,"I bought the Nest thermostat with high hopes about a year ago.  It has, so far, not been quite the life-changing element that the sales material suggests, but I have been completely happy with it (who needs their lives changed by a thermostat anyway?). I think my favorite functions of the Nest are these: 1) Really easy installation.  Nest has been really good at providing instructions that think of everything (they included the screwdriver to install the unit).  I came away impressed because many companies provide instructions that leave a lot to interpretation. 2) The Eco function.  The Eco function allows you to set minimum and maximum temperatures (I set my minimum to 60 degrees F and my maximum to 80 degrees F) that dictate whether or not to run the appropriate unit (heating or cooling).  While we're away, I know that I'm not running my AC or heater unnecessarily, but I also know that I won't come back to a 90 degree home.  I live in a relatively temperate climate (Colorado) and so I use this setting most of the time. 3) The Airflow function for AC.  I just learned about this - but the Nest is smart enough to turn off the AC condenser a little bit early and still run the fan over the chilled coils in order to extract the last bit of cold air in order to get your temperature down to the desired level.  They correctly know that running the condenser is the big energy draw, so by limiting that, you get more bang for your energy dollar. 4) The integration with Amazon Echo has been seamless, and while I don't use the voice function a lot, I have integrated the lighting through the Nest occupancy sensor (it knows when you move past it) to automatically turn on my lights as I come home after sunset - which is a cool integration, I think. I will say that I haven't really noticed a lot from the learning function.  It has done a pretty good job of noticing when I routinely will change the temp (we'll turn down the heat when we go to bed, for instance) and it will automatically do that - but for the most part I still find myself fine tuning the temperature more than I thought I would.  That said, the dial is really tactile and intuitive and easy to use. I've liked the Nest and would recommend it.  It is pricey, and I'm sure other thermostats would work just fine for the way I use it, but I'm happy I bought this.",Good Thermostat with lots of neat features

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2019,Daniel,"After 15 months I got the low battery warning. After 30 minutes of net research this is my conclusion. The nest requires a C (common) wire to PROPERLY recharge the internal battery. However, in an effort to broaden compatibility to (older) HVAC’s without a C wire, they essentially hacked or hot wired the thermostat to recharge the battery while the HVAC is running. This will get you by until the rechargeable battery degrades enough to not hold a charge (in my case, 15 months.) It seems Nest has deemed this not covered under warranty and basically tell you, “yeah, you gotta install that C wire.” That being said, these are your options. Install the C wire. $200 for the HVAC guy to run one skinny wire 30+ feet. Keep buying a new Nest thermostat until the battery degrades. The battery appears to be replaceable. Available for $10 but you have to open the thermostat and fiddle with the delicate internals. Take the unit off the wall and manually charge via USB port on the thermostat, daily. Run the HVAC (no matter what the weather is like) to keep the thermostat charged, daily. Scrap Nest and put up a classic thermostat that costs $20+ and will last for 40 years.

And it constantly running, because the sensor is faulty. I'm use for cooling only,and it will not work correctly.

This product is faulty by design and surprisingly their service is useless if you realize their product is faulty after 30 days... When we first installed it I thought it was just trying to be smart and learning the environment but it seemed to have a mind of its own not always heating when we wanted to.  The Nest never provided any error messages, or warning of any kind. It took us quite a bit of time to realize there was something wrong. But recently we kept losing heat, the furnace would shut down during very cold days and it was clear something was wrong. We thought the problem was with the furnace. We call a heating technician who didn't find a problem with the furnace and left. But the furnace continued to shut down randomly. We had to call the technician back and in total he spent over 4 hours costing us over $600 to finally realize that the Nest was faulty or not compatible with our heating system.  The technician replaced the Nest with a simple thermostat and solved the problem and our heat is back!!! I then called Nest and spoke to 2 different agents including an executive called Alex. There answer really surprised me ""they do not accept returns after 30 days"", even if the product is faulty. Very disappointing. I will never buy another Nest product again - and if you value your heat and want to avoid over $800 in expenses especially in the middle of winter, I suggest you look for something different or stay with what you have.

Depew,"Setting up the nest was quick and easy. The instructions were simple, clear and easy to follow. Nest's goal is for customers to have the thing up and running in less than 30 minutes. I ran into two tiny problems, neither of which should discourage you from buying and installing one. 1. I had some trouble mounting the Nest to the backing plate the first time. To control the nest, you turn the metal ring on the outside and then push the Nest to click it, like a mouse. If it's not mounted correctly, the click-like-a-mouse doesn't work. It took me a few tries. Maybe I'm just clumsy. Once the locking tabs were engaged, it worked fine. 2. Don't expect it to light up right away once it's installed. The display remains dark for a couple of minutes while it wakes up, brushes its teeth, checks its circuits and so on. Be patient. Installing the smartphone app, and controlling the Nest from the app or the webpage, is painless. I object to the huge stack of permissions the app requires (why does it need access to my Contacts?) but that doesn't really apply here. I'll take that up on the Google App Store. ONE FINAL NOTE: We've only had the Nest for two days. Always be wary of reviews posted within a day or two of receipt of something. Check back in a few months to see if this review has changed.",Quick and easy to set up.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2017,Jer,"Everything I needed was included in the box.  I have a 14 year old heat pump system that had a programmable thermostat already so I knew it would work, I just didn't know how easy it would be to install and cover up the area where the larger thermostat had been.  The included trim plate was the perfect size and looks great.  I did not have to drill any holes as the included wall screws were perfect for the drywall and specially made to hold it securely.  I would definitely recommend using a HAND SCREWDRIVER to install them as an impact or electric screwdriver or drill would almost certainly turn them too tightly and strip out the drywall. I had a slight hiccup on the install.  I put all the wires in according to how they were supposed to be placed, but when I tested the system, the heat pump would heat when it was supposed to cool, and cool when it was supposed to heat.  I used the built-in troubleshooter app on the thermostat itself and discovered that the O/B wire (which tells the heat pump which direction to run) was set as an ""O"" wire which is normal, but was actually supposed to be a ""B"" wire setting.  I simply selected ""B"" wire on the screen and the thermostat automatically reversed it and now everything runs perfectly.  I also set it up to work with my SimpliSafe security system and now it automatically changes to the Eco setting (my Eco setting is 86 degrees) when my alarm is set to ""away"" (as it knows no one is home), and changes back to normal operation when the alarm is off or in ""home"" mode.  I can also set it to start cooling at a designated time before I get home. Another cool thing is that if I set the temperature lower (or higher if heating) it actually tells me how long it will take to get to the desired temperature.  A function that I'm sure it calculates after it has been in operation for a day or two and senses how long it takes to cool the house.  A very innovative and smart upgrade to my home.  I also like that it senses when someone is approaching and displays the current temperature (or outside air temp, or current set temp, whichever you choose to display), then when I get closer it changes to the temperature setting.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2019,William,"I got this Nest thermostat because they offered a NestPro installer to install it for me and get it working for $99 plus tax and I think in total it was just a little more than that. It was supposed to include a year of support and service with the Nest Pro installation. The installer had some difficulty and said that our wires to our AC were not right so some adjustments had to be made but it appeared to work for almost 2 months. Then it suddenly began turning on the heat at random times. We live in Florida so if the heater kicks on in the middle of August you feel it immediately. You can even smell the difference between the AC and the heater so it was obvious when the heater was switched on. Going to the thermostat and manually turning the temp way down seemed to correct the problem but I have a small dog that is not suited to high temperatures and I don't want her dying because the temperature in the house got too hot while I am away from the house so this is not acceptable. I had to call for support. Instead of sending another professional to diagnose the problem they tried to walk me through troubleshooting on the phone. They had me remove a wire and check the voltages and said that seemed to fix it but two hours later the heater just kicked in on it's own again. This was after some automatic firmware update that went in at midnight. So in the morning I switched the wires back to the way they were initially since it did not solve the problem. I then went into the settings and turned off all the eco settings for power saving. I basically asked the brains of the ""smart"" thermostat to stop thinking and just cool my house on a schedule. This seemed to solve the problem for about 2-3 weeks. Now it is back to randomly just turning the heater on again. It does this while it says that it should be cooling the house. I am done trying to make this work. I paid WAY more for a ""smart"" thermostat to monitor my house temperature very closely and hopefully be more efficient but this thermostat can't be trusted. I am removing this piece of crap and putting the old ""dumb"" honeywell that works back where it belongs. I will just buy a smart thermometer to keep me apprised of the temperature and warn me if things go wrong. That was a $350+ lesson.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2015,John S,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Have had 6 of these nest thermometers starting about 3.5 years ago.  Unfortunately, they are not built to last.  They look great, and work great too...  Until they do not.  Check out the video.  At about 3 years of age they start to fail.  Others have mentioned similar experiences here. Here is my thought.  A simple sensor failed on this thermostat.  Probably a 25 cent part.  Why not offer parts kits on a $250 computer that acts as a thermostat.  If it was a $50 thermostat, I get the ""throw away"" and consumable mentality.  But once you go over 200 bucks for something that used to cost $10 and last for 50 years (mercury switch thermostat), it is a durable good. I am not a lawyer, but I do sense a class action on this one.  Nest should be forced to sell, or allow others to sell, aftermarket parts kits. Is there a wonder that their warranty is only 2 years.  I am really torn if I tear down my nest of Nests, or risk throwing good money after bad. I do have to say that Nest support was  ""so generous"" with at 20% off coupon from the Nest store (list price).  Amazon sells the thermostat at about a 20% discount.  Nest should know that we can do math.  That is not a savings to keep customers happy. I am really torn.  I like the thermostats, but there is no way that each of them save $200 in their lifetime.  No way. The video below shows the failed nest (outer ring sensor failed).  And worse than that, it randomly started setting the heat very high and the AC very low.  Good thing we took it out of service while we were home.  If we were away, we would have come home to crazy utility bills!!! I do not know what I will do going forward.  But I can say I wish I never started with the first Nest. OLD REVIEW BELOW - I already had two Nest 2 thermostats, and to continue down our path to the internet of everything, we replaced our master bedroom heat with this thermostat.  We had previously run into the issue in the family room (with the nest 2 - but believe this is similar) where our setup (heat and cool) needed a common C wire for 24V power.  Nest went above and beyond for that and paid for an HVAC tech to come out and complete the wiring for us to the AC unit. We had already replaced another one of our heat zones (Red and White wires only) to a forced hot water oil furnace, with a nest 2 that was working perfectly.  So when we installed this one with identical wiring, we expected identical results. The form and function are nearly identical to the Nest 2.  I dont think it is worth the extra money if you can get a nest 2 now for 100 dollars less at times, but we got a cyber monday deal... What did surprise us is an very audible buzz when the screen comes on and when the heat is on.  You can google it - others hear the same thing.  But it appears to be a function of the power stealing technique when not using a C wire. We had the extra wire, and it was not hard to hook up to the 24V transformer in our case, I just had to do a bunch of research to make sure I was doing it right.  I didnt want to fry my whole system going into winter. With the C wire hooked up, the audible buzz no longer happened, and it is on par with the Nest 2.  (Added the C wire to that as well.) C wires aside, I do like the wifi app and the ability to have as many schedules as you want on a 7 day cycle.  It seems that you have to get into this price range for that functionality.  We have a Sensi as well, and for 100 bucks you get the wifi, but are stuck with those four schedules.  A real legacy hassle if you ask me.",Started out as a 4-5 start product.  But they started failing after 3 years.  What a colossal mistake this has been!!!
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2017,JKT,"Had the nest for 3 months now.  Not much savings to speak of in our power bills.  Maybe a few bucks.  This is due to having it set to go down to 68 at night and warm back up in the day to 71 (but my spouse will often turn it up a few degrees over that if he's home)  I'd love to have it set lower but my family would revolt.  So if you are prepared to suffer with much less heat then this might give you more noticeable savings. The Good: Installation was not easy, but when we accidentally broke the nest they sent us a replacement no questions asked.  You can opt to hire some one to install this for you.  Our problem is our wiring didn't match exactly what any of the examples showed.  Maybe yours will be more straight forward. Cool looking interface You can control this when you are away with your cell phone, or even in the house with your cell phone or connect with your Echo and voice control it. The display remains off unless you walk by, and then it lights up to show you what temp it is set for. The Bad: Not a lot of cost savings unless you are willing to really cut your power use. I don't like that it won't automatically show you the current temp when the house is warming up after being away.  You have to manually set it to that.  Sometimes the controls/app is not that user friendly.. or it could be better anyway. Seems a bit big brother-ish. So, I advise if you don't have a lot of extra money for home improvements, this is one to skip.  If you have plenty of disposable income then what the heck, drop the 250 and get it because it's cool.  But if you are not willing to change the heat and cool levels in your home, this won't save you all that much money. UPDATE 2/7/17 - Our nest stopped heating and we were on tech support for an hour and they were helpful and we got it working again and they wanted to follow up with us too.

During that time the unit shuts down its WiFi function and the screen stays dark. When it finally recharges you must reset the time. If you have a C wire, which I don’t, I believe the unit comes back on immediately when power is restored.

True, it will technically work, but the Nest requires a power source to charge the battery, and our furnace was short cycle starting throughout the day to get that charge to the Nest. The Nest essentially pulses the furnace to charge itself and it was loud and annoying (woke us up at night) and we were worried it might damage our furnace to run constantly like that. Called Nest and spent hours on the phone with their help desk, who eventually told us that, yes, we needed a c-wire, which was going to cost over $200 to install. So the Nest is going back.

Need to remove the Nest face to charge with our own charging wire daily. Keep in mind without the face attached the thermostat does not work (not good in winter).

You can easily control the temperature on the Nest unit itself, via smartphone (anywhere in the world) or with Google voice commands with our multiple Google Home Mini speakers throughout the house. Plus, you can set up all sorts of schedules as well. It's really convenient. Even though the install guide told me I would need professional assistance installing my Nest, I installed and configured my unit all by myself just fine. I did have to look up online and downloaded a larger Nest pdf manual that shows all possible variations and combinations of wires, for numerous heating / cooling units with heat pumps and emergency heating, which is what I have. It really was no big deal. After that quick study, the installation was easy and although some of the wiring colors in my HVAC unit were different from the Nest install diagrams, it all made sense in the end, and the system confirmed the wires accordingly. Once all the hardware and wires were connected, everything worked and tested properly. All in all it took me about 30 minutes from beginning to end of install. The only extra tool I used, other than the included screwdriver set was a thin head pliers that I used to push the wires into each socket all the way in. After that I just placed the Nest on the base plate and finished the testing and setup walk-through. The app is very complete and easy to set up and understand. It really gives you all the tools that will certainly help you decrease your overall utility bill costs. I am really looking forward to my future utility bills with better savings next month! So far, with 2 days of usage the system has automatically switched between heat pump and auxiliar heat on its own. Before, we had to do that manually directly on the old-school thermostat depending on the temperature outside and how comfortable we felt inside our home. Now, Google Nest does it all on its own. It's amazing. See the screenshots. Plus, Nest detects when we're physically present and controls the temperature accordingly. This will really reduce our electricity costs very quickly. It's been about a week since I installed Google Nest and I can definitely see huge savings by reducing the temperature in my home by a half a degree has already resulted in a lot less time running the heat pump and auxiliary heat in our home. Eco mode kicks in when there's no one home. Just look at the screenshots on both Android and iOS. My only gripe, completely unrelated to the product itself is that my electricity provider is cheap because they don't provide customers with any rebates when installing a Nest. Oh well... At 140 bucks I couldn't really ask for a better price on the 3rd gen Next. I'm really loving our Google Nest. This product certainly deserves a five star review. Must buy for sure.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,MT,"I had an old 1997 thermostat and wanted to upgrade it. After looking at the top smart thermostats on the market,  I decided to go with the nest. I then proceeded to watch several different YouTube videos on how to install the thermostat. Some common themes emerge after watching the installation videos: 1. You need to use the google nest site to make sure your thermostat is compatible with the nest before you buy it. 2. The Common blue wire is an important wire for the thermostat to work properly in many situations 3. If you have a dual fuel system it is highly recommend you have a HVAC professional install this thermostat. I have a single fuel system and some knowledge of HVAC and electrical so I gave it a shot. It took me 90 minutes to install the thermostat as I ran into mounting the thermostat onto the drywall with the screws provided. I advise having anchors and screws with flush ends ready to go for this project. Otherwise, it was easy to install if you follow the wiring guide And online instruction videos. Setup was seamless through the app. My thermostat now keeps a consistent temperature in the house thanks to the nest.",Thermostat of the future!
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2018,Christopher Gardner,"This thermostat was incredibly easy to set up! The whole process began with removing the old thermostat and wiring the Nest and installing it. Total time was about 25 minutes. Once I powered it up and logged it into my home network, it downloaded all of the necessary updates it needed. I was pleased to know that it will display time in the 24-hour format! I live and breathe by this format and when I walk past it, it flashes the time and the date to me. The display is easy to read and navigate. I waited too long to put this thermostat in my house! If your HVAC system is compatible with this thermostat, I would highly recommend it to anyone! Just a side note: After several months, I noticed that the battery wasn't keeping charged and I was losing my internet connection. After consulting with a neighbor that is an HVAC technician, he said I needed to have the common wire hooked up (blue). My system only had four wires, and nothing going to the common terminal. I bought some 18 gauge 5 wire thermostat wire (that's the way it comes packaged) at Lowe's and rewired my system. My furnace had the terminals labled for the color coded wire, and everything matched with the Nest unit. The whole process took me less than an hour, and the system runs better than ever. The battery is being charged better than it was before. Make sure you use the five wire setup for best results!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2019,"Dutton and Beth Armstrong, Editors","We bought two of these and our experience is VERY mixed so far.  I installed both but we had HVAC installers on hand putting in a new system so they supervised my install. Installation is pretty easy BUT the wires do not LOCK in place so if you bump the Nest or if any of a dozen things happen, one or more wires can slip out of the slots rendering the Nest a brick.  While it is easy to insert the wires, getting them to STAY in place has been very difficult with one of them.  The professional took over and also had issues getting the wires to stay in place on one of the units. Usage is also pretty easy.  You can set the Nest locally or on the app.  However, one of the two we bought does not handle touch very well.  You press in (and should get a click) to select.  On one of our thermostats it worked beautifully.  On the other it was very intermittent.  Sometimes you would get the selection you desired.  Other times it would read a ""press"" as a rotation (changing selection).  The professional also had this experience. Both of the issues we experienced in installation and setup lead me to believe that QC on these units is very hit and miss.  They might be expensive, but they simply are not built well and they apparently are NOT tested until installed by the end user. In usage, things went as expected for several days. Then..... I came home to the front zone (oddly, the unit which had not issues during install and setup) being VERY cold.  It is normally set to 78 degrees with the eco set to ""on"".  Despite my not having changed any settings, the Nest was suddenly set for 68 degrees and the air was running like crazy.  It was 72 degrees already so the system had changed itself and been running for quite some time. I thought that this was a one-off situation.  It wasn't. I arrived home after running errands for a couple of house and the same Nest had again changed temperature settings on its on.  This time to 75 degrees.  Once again the A/C was running like crazy. I have re-set the temperature again and verified that it is properly set to 78 degrees with the eco setting active. One more crazy change on its own and both are coming out and will be replaced with Ecobees which is what my HVAC company recommended.  They have found the Nest to be expensive and problematic.  I already wished I had listened to them. Beware of these units.  Something is not right in their build process.  Additionally, it looks like some have terrible flaws causing the settings to change spontaneously. I have several other Nest devices with NO issues.",Disappointing Beginning

It worked great until it burned out the control board in 2 months and then you needed the original thermostat as it’s a “communicated system” and the Nest cannot work after a part went bad. You have to have the original Bryant thermostat to program the new board which we no longer had. It cost $750 for their thermostat. We have had nothing but problems with this thermostat since we bought it. All the HVAC people I talk to say that Nest is the worst thing to buy and to steer clear of them. I wish I would have asked prior to purchasing this thermostat as it’s an overwhelming amount of professionals saying how bad these things are.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 May 2020,Steven C,"All in all, I'm very impressed with the Nest and I love the minimalist design.  It's a well-made device that feels sturdy when pushing and rotating it.  I think it could win design awards! I replaced a 15 year old Robert Shaw programmable thermostat with the Nest 3rd Generation.  What turned me on to the Nest was the ability to program via your smart phone, some of the modern features, and the ability to add remote sensors.  Installation was straightforward, however, you have to be somewhat handy and you need the right tools, such as a wire stripper (you have to have enough exposed wire to be able to seat the wires in the connector ports, thus you need a wire stripper to remove the wire outer sheath).  Nest has very informative guides on installation, and they include a small screw driver in the box along with a plastic decorative plate with two screws and an internal metal plate designed to attach to a junction box in your wall. I've read some of the reviews about problems when the battery life runs low and it stops working.  I can't attest to these issues since I've only had the Nest for a few weeks.  I believe it uses a CR123 battery that is recharged thru the wire connections and lasts for years.  At some point, the battery will need to be replaced but this is the same for any battery powered thermostat.  Apparently, the unit warns you when the battery is running low. So far, I'm quite impressed with the Nest's intuitiveness, sleekness, and build quality. It does about 90% of what I want and expect.  I did turn off the auto-movement sensing, a feature which turns on the display when the Nest senses movement, such as when you walk by.  The problem was that it was turning on in the middle of the night when I went to the bathroom and lighting up the bedroom.  You can turn off auto-movement and instead activate it by a momentary push, but in the push mode, it doesn't appear that you can customize what is displayed, such as the current temp, the programmed temp, or a short weather analysis.  UPDATE: I discovered that you can change the brightness, with three level options.  The lowest level works best at night for me with the auto-movement sensing. I added a Nest remote sensor (a small disk with a thermostat and wireless capability) which automatically paired with the Nest 3.  The remote sensor can be placed on a table top or mounted to a wall with an included screw.  I programmed the Nest to use the remote sensor in my son's room in the morning when his room heats up due to its south-eastern exposure.  Now his room is comfortable in the morning.  It's not the perfect way to control temperature throughout my house, since the master bedroom where the Nest is located will be over-cooled, but it's only a few degrees difference.",Great design and intuitive user interface.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jan 2020,TA,"I purchased a Nest a few years ago and it has worked perfectly on my first floor.  My wife purchased a Nest for me for upstairs and I'll just give the facts of what happened over the last few days.  I checked the compatibility test and it passed and I began installation on Day 1.  After about an hour, I had the old Honeywell thermostat off and installed the Nest.  The fan came on but no heat came on in the heat setting.  On the auxiliary heat, nothing came on.  I couldn't test the AC because it was too cold outside and Nest doesn't allow that.  I called Nest and they couldn't figure out the issue and after an hour, they suggested I contact a Nest Pro.  I  contacted a Nest Pro that was suggested by Nest.  On Day 2, he came and spent two hours working on it and about an hour with a Nest customer service rep.  It did not work.  The Nest Pro came back today (Day 3) and spent from 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. with Nest customer service and tried to install my Nest.  At noon, he gave up and had to go to another job.  He had the Nest customer service rep call me directly.  I spent an hour and 45 minutes with Nest on the phone testing all sorts of wiring and different configurations.  It still did not work.  Nest will send me a new Nest for upstairs.  When I went to put back my Honeywell thermostat upstairs, it stopped working.  No idea what happened.  Now, I have no heat upstairs.  Also, I'm out $600 to a Nest Pro.  And, the upstairs Nest does not work.  Later on tonight, my downstairs Nest started going haywire.  Our forced air would turn on and off.  It would do that repeatedly.  I spent the next two hours with Nest trying to fix the downstairs Nest that had been working perfectly for the last two years.  I have no idea what the Nest Pro did or what Nest customer service did to trigger this issue.  After two hours, the Nest customer service could not resolve the issues and is sending me a new base for my downstairs Nest.  In other words, I have two Nest products that do not function and now, I do not have any heat in January.  Those are the facts.  My opinion is that Nest products are difficult to install and Nest customer service is hopelessly incompetent.  The Nest Pros are untrained handymen and women, who are clueless about the product.  I'm really hoping these products can be fixed within the next few days.  I will certainly never be buying any more Nest products.  I'm worse off today for having Nest products rather than my manual Honeywell thermostat.",Compatibility is Huge Issue
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 May 2020,terpfan1980,"Honestly the installation of this thermostat is pretty darned simple, or so it seems.  Take a picture of your existing wiring, look through the app and if necessary send a copy of the picture of your wiring into Nest support and you should wind up getting a clear set of instructions on which wires need to connect to which terminals that this thermostat will be using.  In most cases it is simple.  Until it isn't quite so so simple.  Which was the case for me recently. I actually called in the services of a family friend that I paid a few $$ to do the install of this thermostat (along with putting in an older thermostat back in my old home as the new owners didn't want to have the Nest thermostat and instead wanted a ""dumb"" thermostat to use there).  He got it installed pretty quickly and the initial tests seemed to show it was working as it should. We could feel cool air blowing through the vents when we should and seemed to be getting warm air when we should.  Seemed to be though, and not actually getting forced air like we should have.  I didn't catch the issue until the next day and at that point it was a bit cooler outside and I was looking for more forced air to push the warm air around.  I was very disappointed in not having the fan motor running as it should be, and worse without the fan working the heat was working too hard, heating up and not having the air blown through so it was turning itself off after just a few minutes before it cooled down enough to try to repeat the cycle. This issue lead me to make use of Tech support to try to confirm the wiring was correct and had me uploading the picture of the old wiring along with a picture of the new wiring.  They confirmed that things *should* have been correct.  OK.  That lead to more trouble shooting and a determination by the tech that the Thermostat that I had just purchased must have had a bad terminal internally.  No problem, I was offered a replacement unit and would be shipping the ""bad"" unit back upon receipt and install of the replacement. Replacement unit was received and other than having to take down the old thermostat (that I had to go back to using during the intervening period, at least temporarily) and wire in the new one, the replacement went quickly and easily.  Except the same problem still existed.  Which ruled out bad hardware and left me wondering and troubleshooting again as to what wires were used on which terminals.  More troubleshooting lead to proving that the fan motor worked, that the heat worked depending on how the device was wired, or that the air conditioning worked depending on how it was wired.  Getting the proper combo of all of those was continuing to elude me. Back and forth between where the thermostat was and where they HVAC and heating system are installed was exhausting me a bit, but I went and confirmed the manufacturer of the hardware and relayed that information to the technician that was providing technical support.  In doing this I started researching a bit myself to see if that combo of hardware and Nest was a problem or had known issues and that eventually lead me to solving my own problem when I saw mention of the wiring for the Oil heat making use of the RH terminal.  Hmmm, the recommended wiring for me was using the other R terminal, and not that terminal. The tech support person kept going with me and I noted that I was going to and did test using the RH terminal.  MAGIC happened!!  It worked.  Again, not what the tech support people were telling me to use for my own wiring, but was exactly what was needed. I give credit to the tech support people for being pretty patient with me.  I give credit to them for working to ship me a replacement item when they thought that the one that I had was malfunctioning.  I give credit for the additional support and trouble shooting time that was taken when I was trying to get the replacement working. I take away some of the rating for not realizing early on that they should have suggested trying the RH terminal earlier. Functionally, this is a pretty nice smart (learning) Thermostat.  I like it, otherwise I wouldn't have bought a second one for use in my new home.  (One upstairs, one downstairs actually) I have a complaint that has been common with these in the past in that I really, really, really wish that you could set a ""hold"" temperature and get this thermostat to stay at that manually set temperature until the hold is released.  If I know I'm going on vacation, I should be able to quickly and easily use that sort of function.  This has been asked about multiple times by multiple users or potential users and I honestly believe this is a failing that the company just doesn't want to address.  It shouldn't be that tough to add as a new feature. I can't give this 5 stars at this point (reasons listed above), but I do really like it.  It is mostly a really nice Smart Thermostat and the Alexa integration makes it a really nifty item to use in my home.  Alexa set {Thermostat name} to {Temperature} is really powerful for someone wants to make things easier on themselves. 4 stars from this reviewer.","Second time around with one of these, not quite so simple on this latest install"

Kierski,"I could have swore I already posted a review... but when I came to update it, I wasn't able to find it.  So here goes: I was very surprised at how easy it was to install and configure.  I had a Honeywell programmable thermostat, with an hemostat to control my April Air humidifier.  I'm not an HVAC professional, and I don't pretend to be one.  So I was expecting the uninstall and re-install to take hours, and potentially leave my house un-heated on day that was expected to be -10F. I watched the install and configure video.  The video was very complete and easy to understand.  I was able to watch it several times just to be sure I understood every step, and that I hadn't missed anything. If you exclude the time I spent watching the install video, and the time it took me to figure out how to remove my old thermostat from the wall, it took me at most 10 minutes to replace my thermostat.  And that's when the joy started. Setting up a schedule was pretty freaken easy.  The first week, the Nest ""Learned"" how long it takes my furnace to warm the house.  So on the second morning, it started the furnace at 4:15-ish so the house would be warm when my alarm goes off at 5:00am.  Similarly... it started the furnace at 3:30 because I told it I'd be home at 4:00.  That it was actually able to figure that out is pretty impressive. The April Air humidifier didn't have a smart hemostat.  You guess what it should be set to, and try to remember to update it if the weather changes.  The Nest if fairly similar, except that I can monitor the humidity in the house from my phone and adjust the settings... from my phone.  It would be nice, if Nest was able to automatically adjust the humidity based on the outside temperature.  Maybe it already does, but I can't tell what it's doing. The user interface, both on thermostat and on the phone app is easy to understand. I'm a little disappointed with the Alexa integration.  I can set and ask about the temperature with voice commands via Alexa.  But I can't control the humidifier, or ask about the humidity via Alexa.  I can't ask about the temperature of my remote sensors via Alexa, or switch to using the remote sensor.  I can't ""Hold"" a temperature via Alexa.",This is how you do it!!!

Had absolutely no issues all winter and loved it. Being able to monitor and change things from the app on your phone was great too. However, this spring the nest blew the control board on my furnace twice in two weeks. Initially it seemed like it could have just been a faulty control board and it was covered under warranty so no big deal...paid for a couple hours of HVAC labor and that was that. Two weeks later it blew the board again, which led to a much more in depth check of the HVAC system which showed everything was perfectly fine and the only possible cause was the nest. It was professionally installed and compatibility was checked before installation. Again, worked fine all winter and ended up costing quite a bit this spring/summer.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2020,D. Hagel,"First, I’ve moved a few times and installed a few different smart thermostats in different homes. The Nest is by far the easiest install. If you are shying away from a smart thermostat because you fear the install...this is for you. All of my houses previously had builder grade basic thermostat.  Typically I upgrade to a more basic smart thermostat. Basically a adding WiFi/app control and a schedule to the otherwise basic thermostat.  I originally tried that here too, but either mine was not compatible with my heat pump unit, or it was defective.  Frustrated, I broke down and paid 2-3 time the cost of a Honeywell for a nest...and I hate it.  But more on that later. As I said, install was stupid simple. Install the app on my phone. Answer a few questions and follow the on-screen instructions and it just works. When you buy a nest, your buying the sort of hands off Smart technology that keeps your home at a comfortable temp When You are home and saves energy when you are away.  So when I first installed it, I let it do it’s thing. The house was frequently too hot when I was home (I’m in Florida)  and took too long to recover from the eco mode once I got home.  So I ditched all the fancy AI for the good ol’ scheduled settings.  I thought this would be the answer to problems and it was...sorta. I set up a schedule to keep the house on track, but I noticed that it wasn’t following the schedule, and still used all the smart tech to adjust the temp for me, despite the schedule I set. I had to turn all the smart tech off to get it to just follow the schedule I set. That took some trial and error to figure out, and that is why I hate the Nest. The problem is that my thermostat is in a hallway that doesn’t see a lot of traffic, so I may pass it in the morning to go into my home office, but then I won’t pass it again until I stop working for the day...-and of course the Nest assumes I’m not home and would raise the temp to save me money. Maybe that would work better if my thermostat was in the living room or another high traffic space, but no home I’ve ever owned has had the thermostat in a high traffic area. No one wants to display their favorite art next to the ugly thermostat. So that’s pretty bad, but the thing that makes me hate this more than anything else is the display.  On a $10 builder grade thermostat, you walk up to the stat and read the temp...but NOT with the nest. The nest shuts off the display and wakes it up when you walk by which is a great feature...and even though I have the app setting to show me the temp, it actually displays the set point if the AC is running...not the actual temp of the house.  So if you are hot or cold and want to know what the temp actually is, it will likely take some fiddling to find it.  This is a real shame because the screen has the ability to do some cool things, but in practice it’s not as cool as it should be. Another big short coming I just found...no ability to just set a temp and leave it there...at least not if you use a schedule. On a $20 basic stat you set a schedule, but when you go on vacation, or for some other reason, you can manually set a temp and press the hold button.  Then it will disregard the schedule and just hold the temp at that setting.  Not with the Nest. Apparently adding a software switch is way to advanced for this massively overpriced thermostat.  Support was nice enough to tell that it can sort of be done if I use the away feature, but then we get back to the motion sensing features changing the temp of the house while I’m working.  Oh but if I just let google track my phone’s whereabouts 24/7, it will do a better job.  No thank you.  How about you just add a hold button in the app. How hard could that be? So there you are.  I would never recommend the nest because I really hate it.  It’s over-priced and the smart features seem to be half baked to me.  If you just want a thermostat to save on your heating and cooling, I would suggest contacting your utility provider and signing up for their energy saving program that gives them the ability to control the temps in your house...because that’s what you are doing here.  You just turned over the temp of your home to google, who owns nest....and if you don’t have privacy concerns with google, you might want to do some research.","Easy install, but hate the automation"

Called Nest who would not give a refund, claims that we had to use one of their “approved” service technicians?! So to sum up: buggy product, bad/constrictive service policy and poor design.

We have a heat pump at our house and after reading all of the installation details figured it would work. Installation was not actually that hard, but before completing set up this unit runs a test. During the test it runs the heat pump, but the energy draw to turn on the heat pump was enough to trip the unit and cause it to fail. I called nest and ended up having an installation Pro come out to my house. He confirmed it was all installed correctly, but told me this is a known issue where the Nest sensors are so sensitive that any extra power can cause them to fail.

It installed immediately. I read all the reviews on this and was puzzled why they are so down on the Google Nest. When I downloaded the Nest App on my computer, It worked, flawlessly. Here is the problem with the app you need for interfacing that I came across and what is probably got these negative reviewers so upset. I read the Nest inductions and got to the Migrate the Alexia with Google. I think it is all in the wording. At Google says to migrate to the your Google account. At first I thought they were going to change my email that is Alexia's and change it to the Google account. Their wording of Migrate, stopped me in my tracks. I looked at the reviews, negative and positive. The positives were hopeful. The negatives were confusing. Here is where I figured that Google needs to change the wording Migrate to Pair. Because, that pairing is really what you are doing.  It is a word that people know. Migrate? That is understandably confusing and the wording of Migrate is deceptive. So my fellow Nest users, go for it. Oh, one more thing, when you get past Migrating be sure to go to get your's computer app at https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#appliances and ""discover"" the thermostat (or what ever else in the Google services you have. So it is a 3 step process that is really quick and easy.  1 On your PC, download the Nest App  2 .Migrate (which really is a pairing) the Google account with Alexia, 3 go to  the Alexia page and discover the device.

Beginning of October, it stopped charging on the wall out of nowhere, which means no heat. After multiple calls to tech support, who were rude and condescending, I was able to get them to send a new base. I asked them to overnight it since I live in NJ and it’s getting cold. The guy refused and a week later, the new base came. Product still didn’t work. Three more hours on the phone with customer support and a call to an electrician And plumber to prove that It’s not my boiler and they sent a new thermostat and had me go to Home Depot for a cheap Honeywell, which they said they’d reimburse but still haven’t. New Nest came, and it worked for five days before dying. Paid a Nest Pro $110 to come out and he thought he fixed the issue, but I guess Nest doesn’t actually train Nest Pros because I woke up to a freezing house and dead thermostat AGAIN. Nest support is now telling me it’s that I need a common wire. This is a $250 piece of garbage and I’ve paid over $400 in service fees and over 8 hours of my life - to still freeze.","Stopped working after 7 months, customer support no help"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Mar 2019,KillerRabbit,"Update Nest customer support was excellent although their follow up calling got slightly annoying. My old thermostat was a Honeywell RTH9580WF. I hated it. Needless to say, it was refreshing to take a well made thermostat out of the box (not cheap plastic), have everything you need to install it (including a screwdriver and labels) and have it install easily. No issues except had to troubleshoot an issue with the C wire. At first it was blowing hot air. I had to go into setup in thermostat and switch settings for the wire. I mention this in case yours does the same. So far I have had ZERO problems. Nest server has yet to disrupt the thermostat. Honeywell was down all the time with no warning. The Nest is much quicker to respond, the app is better maintained and has a slick UI and it runs like a dream. Also turning the dial is very satisfying. Would recommend. Old Review: My first Nest product and it was dead out of the box. Display never turned on no matter how much I charged it. I called Nest customer support and they were not surprised. Gentleman immediately put in a request for a replacement (brand new so I was still under warranty). That's great, but now I have to resort to using my busted thermostat until the replacement arrives. I will update review when I install replacement. So far though, not impressed.",Dead out of box; updated
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Dec 2018,David Bixler,"There are a few setup / calibration procedures, and some notes you might want to take an interest in BEFORE you buy. First off, this thing requires the C wire to provide power to the unit. Keep that in mind. Luckily I'm ""downgrading"" from a Crestron-based ""smarthome"" system, which luckily supplied a lot of redundant network and power options, so I have the 24v(C) wire [YAY!]. You can get someone to install them, for around $150 based on other reviews and personal experience at a previous residence. The next thing you need to know is, it's going to be bugged until you reboot it (based on numerous complaints/reviews/support requests). Mine was... and the simplest solution was to reboot it (in the settings on the device), then run it through its paces with the heat/cold/fan test, and then to let it run for a while. Removing it from the wall and replacing it didn't seem to do anything. There are also some firmware updates which might help. The next thing you need to be aware of is the placement of your sensor/thermostat wire. We determined ours was in our master bathroom. My house has 3 independent HVAC systems, powering 3 zones. Zone 1 is the Master Bath/Master Bedroom/ Study which is where our NEST Thermostat is located. If someone is in the shower, and the door is closed, the shower will remain warm from the hot water, while our bedroom will cool very quickly due to the number of windows and the deck-facing door... The thermostat said 73/74 whilst the bedroom was around 67 at one point. Once the bathroom was cooled off, the doors were opened, the temperature stabilized to an accurate reading and began heating/cooling appropriately. If you're not sure if your system is compatible, you can contact a NEST rep on their website for free, and they will help you examine your wiring for your current system(s) and see if your system is compatible, and will even prepare a wiring diagram to speed up the process. Additionally: there are extra screws and far more wire connection options than you will need. You will only need 5 wires to operate the system effectively for heating and cooling. 4 if you're only doing one or the other. Very simple instructions, don't overthink it. 1. Remove old thermostat / cover 2. Use included wire labels on wires (BEFORE DISCONNECTING THEM FROM OLD PANEL) 3. Remove wires from old panel. 4. Remove old patch panel. 5. Install metal adapter panel (I used the 2 screws from the old thermostat back panel/patch panel. 6. Install Shroud (you will only have 2 screw holes, so you will only need 2 of the 4 included mounting screws) 7. Pull wires through, before placing NEST patch panel on the shroud, and attach all of the wires with corresponding labels. (refer to the diagram your NEST tech provided you from their website... free) 8. Once you've inserted and locked all of the wires, you are ready to install the patch plate/backplate. Remove the two screws (top and bottom) holding up the shroud and install the patchplate over the backplate, without fully tightening the screws. 9. Use the integrated level to align your backplate/thermostat, then tighten the top and bottom screws. 10. Finally, install the thermostat, configure your settings, set up WiFi connection, and then run updates. It may take some time for it to accurately read room temperature, based on thermostat location, airflow to the thermostat, and a restart of the thermostat may be required. The restart option is in the settings menu. The app works extremely well for me, but also remember you can integrate NEST devices with IFTTT to further automate and enhance your experience. You can even use IFTTT with NEST thermostats to get alerts when they detect motion, so it doubles as a security device for my home. MERRY CHRISTMAS! EDIT: 12/26/2018 I purchased 2 more of these from Home Depot (don't be mad Amazon) because, well, I wanted it done NOW. Mostly so I could properly utilize the eco/away mode. With only 1 zone in a 3 HVAC zone house on eco mode, the other 2 zones would have the burdon of normalizing the temps in the home. Instead I went all in, got 2 more thermostats for the other zones, which came with 4 temperature sensors, which paired easily and work very well it seems. As with the thermostats, it takes a little while (20-45 minutes give or take) to start reading the right temps. The temp sensors are a great way to manage a thermostat which is in a dead air zone. If you feel too cold for the reading on the thermostat, put the temperature sensor in an area that feels cooler than the rest of the room, then tell the thermostat via the app or the wall device to use that sensor instead of its own temp reading... and badda bing badda boom you've got a wonderfully balanced and convenient, and elegantly climate controlled home. It only took about 5-10 minutes for each thermostat to remove/replace the old units and install the NEST Thermostats. It's too freaking easy. Update Feb 5, 2019 Installed Nest thermostats throughout the house. Dropped energy usage from 2148 kWh for Aug - September 2018 to 1834 kWh in December. All the while using the 3 HVAC systems to heat the home. After ending up with a second Crestron thermostat dying, I had already sank over 200 bucks in replacement thermostats. So, I decided to upgrade to a smart ""learning"" thermostat. There is a marked difference in how well (and evenly) the house is heated/cooled now. The HVAC systems are not active, nearly as often. Before, the thermostats (placed literally a few feet away from the HVAC intakes) would be cooled or heated by passing air, being pulled into the intakes. (Talk to the Contractor about that one) NEST allows you to use remote wireless sensors. So I placed one in the kitchen, one in the office, and one in the tiny ""study"" between the master bathroom and bedroom. Since then the thermostats have done a far better job at maintaining temps, using less gas, less electricity, making less noise, and doing a better job at maintaining comfortable temps. Not to mention being able to use eco mode when I'm not home, saving more energy. Not to mention being able to set the temperature while I'm outside, or in bed, from my phone/tablet/Alexa etc. It's a straightforward install too. Nest support provided a wiring diagram for free. Used the screws from the old thermostat. There are no buttons on the units. The unit IS a button. The unit is literally a dial you turn to change options and you press it to select. Program a schedule, or just change it. When NEST detects a pattern it ""learns"" and will start adjusting the thermostat before you can make it there. Oh and you can automate with If This Then That (IFTTT.com). For instance If ( Motion Detected) Then (Turn On Lights) Yeah NEST thermostats have motion detection so the screen stays off unless you're close to it. Kind-of handy actually. A neat night light when I'm fumbling my way to the bathroom. Occasionally the Living Room thermostat freaks out and goes to 55 degrees. Not sure why yet.... perhaps a firmware update is required. Not losing a star. The pros far outweight the cons here.",Beautiful / Simple / Easy to Use... But
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2020,J. Gibson,"So I purchased a Nest because I wanted a smart thermostat.  I didn't think it was going to save a lot of money because we already have a programmed schedule which minimizes the AC/Heat usage.  I was very excited and while I waited for it to arrive I was looking at the forums for it.  There is one missing feature that Nest users have been requesting on their forums for 2 years with no action from Nest.  That feature is a hold feature.  The only way to have the thermostat hold a temperature for longer than the next scheduled change is to delete the entire schedule and turn off smart learning.  This was a dealbreaker for me, as occasionally I will set a hold temperature and don't want it to change until I manually change it, (IE sleeping in on the weekend).  Furthermore as my schedule isn't static, I doubted the utility of the smart learning feature to begin with.  After further research, I returned the Nest unopened and replaced it with the EcoBee3 Lite.  The EcoBee has all the features I wanted, with the minor hassle of having to program it (which is very easy with the app).  Additionally when I change the temperature on the EcoBee, it asks me how long to keep the altered setting (2 hours, 4 hours, until the next programmed change, or until I change it back).  I really wanted to keep the Nest, but the refusal of the company to provide this functionality drove me to EcoBee.  I will say that while the EcoBee looks ok, the Nest blows it away in the looks department, but at the end of the day, EcoBee has a better feature set.  YMMV.",Lacking One Requested Feature

My main level I replaced with a Trane thermostat about 6 years ago.  ""Before"" all the tech updates to the world of thermostats!  I paid over $600 for it from an HVAC friend and it required a separate sending unit at the furnace.  It still works great, but the on line integration is not so great and periodically it just loses the network and can't be controlled.  This Nest unit has been working flawlessly for about 4 months now and is SUPER easy to modify as needed and program.  When one of my kids comes home to stay for a night or so, we can simply alter the program and boom its changed for that time.  VERY easy to operate and now I'm debating just replacing my Trane stat with the same one for super ease.  I would buy this a hundred times over.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2018,Manuel Noriega,"You can read all these other reviews here, and I can't add much. I'll just report my perspective: $200 for a thermostat is pretty hefty. After doing a lot of research into thermostats I decided to pull the trigger on purchasing TWO of these. We have 2 units in our house and had problems remembering to turn off the smaller one we use only at night. We tried for a year to remember to turn the dial on the old honeywell every morning but would still forget a couple times a month. That can be an expensive mistake both from a power standpoint and because the smaller unit was trying to cool the whole house. It can't be understated how easy it is to install. I've installed 3 thermostats now and the auto-detect wiring was really impressive. Due to the old wiring in our house, we had to jerry-rig our smaller unit to leave out the ""blower"" lead (we therefore can't run the fan without either the compressor or heater). The Nest picked it up perfectly and saw what we were up to. The automatic schedule is absolutely amazing as well. After just 1 week it was automatically setting temperatures just as we wanted. Very impressive. I logged into the nest website to set the schedule (you can use the app) and really didn't have to make any changes from what it had put together by itself. I have yet to use the geofencing feature but plan to in the future. I have 2 gripes: - Price: Granted, this is a very pretty LCD screen and a smart computer on your wall, but I still think $200 is steep given todays technology. Though for me this thing will probably pay for BOTH thermostats within a year here in AZ just with electricity alone. Also, some services run a monthly fee to give you the same features and support. Still though, $200 :( - YOU MUST HAVE WIFI TO GET IT WORKING OUT OF THE BOX. After the initial config, I'm sure it's optional (??), but I was incredibly freaked out that you can't at least get your HVAC running out of the box without having it talk to Nest's stalk-o-matic cloud computer in the sky (which I am fine with, if I have to, I guess). You could easily configure it and then change your wifi password, but still. I'm knocking off a star, because you should be able to at least get your house temperature under control without wifi. It's $200, create a ""dumb"" mode people. UPDATE:  June 2019: I bought this Nest with the intention of eventually linking it to a wider home-automation system, which I have since finally built. This was a feature Nest advertised, I bought it with the intention of doing so, and Google has since TERMINATED this feature. The integration with most platforms has been shut down for those who have not done so already, and even existing integrations will be shut down in August 2019. Currently I'm trying to get Home Assistant to link in and the API sign-up has been disabled. It's unclear if they will ever allow me to use the product I bought in the way they told me I could. Alexa integration has been affected as well if I understand correctly, though I don't own an Alexa so I don't know for sure. I am waiting for the class-action lawsuits to role in to see how Google will make me whole after paying $400 for a product they've since hamstrung. Even if they fix it, this is obviously not a trustworthy company. Also, there are many other options out there now (Ecobee I've read is good). PS: Nest has responded to my ""does not work without wifi"" comment stating that this device indeed does--maybe once you have it setup this is the case, but myself and my friend the professional HVAC repairman friend were unable to figure it out after reading the instructions that came with it and tinkering with it in the 90 degree heat for a half hour. I suspect that if it is actually possible that it was added to a later software revision which my Nest did not have out of the box (and without internet, could not get it). There were definitely some configuration questions we had the option to SKIP plainly seen on the screen, wifi setup was definitely not one of them. If you buy a Nest and plan to review it on Amazon, maybe you can try to set it up without wifi to start out with just to have a more complete review.","[UPDATE: Bait and switch, buyer beware!]"

I tried to turn off all smart settings but it won't respond - even though at times it says it will get to the temperature in 2 hours. Never happen.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 May 2018,Shockster,"Every time I have to deal with this thermostat I'm frustrated. This thing has so much potential yet fails so horribly. Pros: It's pretty. No wi-fi connection issues. It hasn't broken, technically. (Has it ever worked, though?) Cons: First and foremost, it doesn't hold a temperature, which I think is what a thermostat is supposed to do. I can't overstate how terribly uncomfortable this is. Temps swing 2 full degrees. I wake up at night sweating because it lets the temps rise so much before triggering the AC to come on. And then 30 mins later I'm freezing because it over cools. This, according to support, is to save my compressor from cycling too often. Okay, I get that, but this is all software, right? Give me the option to choose how much the temps swing. Why is this not user configurable? Secondly, so many of the features have no consideration from multi-stage systems. Instead, the settings want to swing temperatures wildly, which defeats the purpose of having a multi-stage system. Again, this is software--it COULD be smart enough to not trigger the second/third stage when it decides to swing, but of course it's not that smart. For example, the auto-away mode has a minimum setting of 76 degrees Fahrenheit. (I don't ever want my house 76 degrees in the summer, by the way--what's wrong with you, Nest?). If I leave, my house will go from 72 to 76. When I come back, it now wants to run the second stage AC to force the house down 4 degrees. Uhh... why isn't there some logic to say use first stage for an extended period instead? Again, this is software, right? Or how about you just let me have my away setting at 74, which is way more reasonable in the first place. If my thermostat were 76 degrees half the day it would be a sauna. It needs to cycle more than that just to control humidity where I live (KY). The heat used to have some stupid max setting of like 64 but they fixed that--it can now go up to 70. I'm not sure why they won't fix the AC. When I called support, the tech said he hears this complaint constantly. Next, the scheduling is awful. The auto-smart crap is like AI from 10 years ago. They must have gotten the code from RIM for the new BlackBerry. Manual scheduling is unbelievably time consuming. I'm forced to create a gazillion points to slowly bring the temp down because I don't want it to trigger the second stage AC. What I want, in the summer for example, is for my house to be 72 if I'm home during the day, 70 at night while I sleep, and 74 when I'm away (Boy, how I wish that auto-away feature wasn't so STUPID--it's the whole reason I bought this thing!) So this thing can control a humidifier--great! Good luck finding that setting. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to find it. Controlling the fan schedule is equally confusing. The humidifier setting is slightly easier to find on the phone app, but my HVAC tech doesn't have his phone setup to control MY thermostat. The fan setting is dumb in every interface. This product is a piece of crap for no good reason. My intention was to buy ALL of the Nest products, but if they can't get their core offering right, I have to assume that the rest of the line can't be worth my time.","The interface sucks, there is nothing smart about it, it doesn't hold a temp. Nest could fix all these problems but they don't."

Always Too Hot or Too Cold - In my opinion the Nest thermostat is inaccurate and too slow. I find that all day long I am turning the next up and down since it does not do it on its own in a timely way causing the home to get too hot or during the summer too cold. Exactly what happens is demonstrated in the video.  The house got too hot so I turn down the nest then a minute or two later the thermostat changes the room temp registered.  It should shut off 1 degree cooler than it does since it thinks it is colder than it really is and it finds out too late after I had to manually turn it off. I called Nest support and did all the activities they suggested all to no avail because it did not fix the problem of not working right.  I think they either did not want to send me a working new one or they did not have one that didn’t have that problem. Also I have turned off auto adjust temp based on history because it was acting wonky and causing a lot of manual override and way too frustrating. 1. Video (sorry its so long, 1.7 minutes so ok to scroll to the end to see it jump from 71 to 72 after I manually turned it down. 2. Picture of thermostat with a high quality “air quality machine” I got here on Amazon. 3. Screen shot from the Dyson air quality machine iphone app showing a higher temp than on the thermostat.  It is always colder in the kitchen so not surprised it is 1 degree lower in there than the living room where the nest is and where I see 74 degrees on the Temtop unit, 72 on the nest and 73 on the Dyson. Overall super excited to get it very neat and nice to be able to turn on heat manually from remote location like when wake up but need a thermostat that is higher quality and works more accurately so it is managing the heat instead of me stopping what I’m doing to adjust the “nest”. ...looking for the ultimate iphone controllable thermostat.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Nov 2019,Metz,My installation is a simple forced air heater. For years I have had a basic programmable thermostat. I found a like new discount NEST (the one with the fancy screen) and jumped at the chance to upgrade. The installation was easy enough (I did need to do a factory reset but that is to be expected given it was a used device). Once completing the reset it has functioned flawlessly. With the ability to manage the system from my smartphone and the devices ability to adjust to my schedule and temperature setting makes to really nice. After a few weeks it seems to automatically go on or off just like it was reading my mind.,A new level of comfort

I have a separate heating and cooling system. Gas furnace heating hot water which is sent to a radiator in the attic. A single blower is used for heating and cooling. Pros: Conpatibility app is great, It gives anyone the knowledge they need to ensure compatibility and gives you the confidence you need to complete the install on your own. Very easy install with added instruction manual, included wire labels, and on line videos On phone tech support was excellent Iphone (and mac book pro) apps are the best, no more getting up in the middle of the night to lower or raise the thermostat Kids think it's the coolest Cons: Price, it's not cheap Chat support was not technical enough, in the end they gave me false information. Could have burned out my heating coil if I didn't call tech support Problem, out of the box the system does not turn on the fan when the heat comes on. Has to be modified by a tech. Luckily, phone support walked me through some advanced settings to turn on this feature. Very easy to do if you know where it is. Problem, When the heat goes off the blower goes off. Should have a setting that keeps it on for say 5 or 10 minutes. Inconvenience, after making the change above the fan icon is not displayed on the thermostat, iPhone, Mac apps. Worried about burning out my coil I keep checking just to make sure.",Very cool tech but use caution

I have removed from base and charged with micro USB cord and still will not stay charged longer than 2 hours. Now my A/C will not turn on and stay on due to thermostat shutting down. Even with out the Common wire connected, my nest worked for over 5 months, it is supposed to charge while the A/C, Fan or Heater are running without the Common wire connected. It is not charging even while the A/C is running. It will not get above 2.6 volts even after spending all night on the wall charger.

Up until today, if you'd asked me what I thought of Nest I would have given in five stars. But, all of the convenience and money saving just went out the window. Up until recently, the Nest app on my iPhone worked well.  When I was going to my vacation house, I would set the Nest to Home (70 degrees), and when I left, I would set it to Away which should have set the temperature back to 40 degrees. But, someone at Nest thought it better to keep the temperature locked at 70 degrees day and night when it's set to Away. As you can imagine my utility bill was exceptionally high since I last left that house several weeks ago. Apparently Away no longer does what it used to. Being a developer of iOS apps myself, I'm well aware of how to use the software, but some moron at Nest had to screw around with the app and f' it up.

Nicely starting the heating process *the moment you walk back in* so by the time you go to bed you're warm enough to take your parka off? Then buy a Nest! (Bonus: you get the opposite effect in the summer!) If you don't want to walk into a frigid house every day, you can simply: turn Nest's ability to recognize that you've left the house off! Or manually schedule the house to warm up every day whether you've left or not!  Either way, overriding all of the ""smarts"" of this thermostat and all of your energy savings! I've owned two Nest thermostats and three Nest Protects for two years.  I've had plenty of issues with them... I was more enthusiastic at first, but then I noticed that my energy bills were not meaningfully lower (don't presume you will pay much less!) and functionality that used to work no longer did. But this one is the kicker.  It's a problem that most people would run into - seasonal variation.  Nest support/engineering seem totally clueless and unresponsive about it, and I've noticed this is a widely shared/posted issue. Folks at Nest... A ""smart"" thermostat with the ability to sense when you're away and turn your thermostat off has to be smart enough to a) turn it back on *prior* to you arriving home, unless it figures you're going to be away for a while, and b) not let it get so cold or hot that you lose all energy savings benefit in the process.  Isn't this obvious???  Maybe this just isn't a big problem in the Bay Area.","Nest, did you test this in any area with hot summers and cold winters?"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Apr 2019,Carl S.,"This thermostat works great as a remote controllable thermostat. Home/Away is a great idea, but there is no way for it to be used if you want the house warmed up before you get home. Schedules are a way to get around that, but you have to disable home/away because if the nest is set to away, it ignores your schedule. Since I am not following a consistant schedule, I found I was constantly having to change the schedule every day anyway. Eventually I disable all the automation on the nest and outsourced it to IFTTT and apilio. Now my nest works great as a remote controllable thermostat. 2 things that could make this better is to let me change the home/away status remotely (IFTTT) and let me use the motion sensor in the nest for an IFTTT trigger. Then at least I could call it smart.","Great, just disable all the ""smart"" functions"

I don't quite understand the mindset of its developers but it seems that they intended this for use by extremely rich white house wives with a/c and heat control in every room of their mansion. Most normal people have just one thermostat in their house, even if it's got 3 bedrooms and 4 stories. I don't think I've ever been in a house with more than one thermostat. There's not even an option to choose ""House"" as the location of the thermostat. This makes no sense. On top of all this their Alexa app is probably one of the worst device control apps I've ever had the displeasure of using. It has almost zero instructions on what the commands are, you basically have to guess, and the commands are limited, make no sense, and once again, assume that you have a thermostat in every freaking room. Who are these people? ""Alexa set the basement to 68"" Yeah, setting ""the basement"" to 69 isn't possible because that would set the whole house to 69, I named it ""The House"" instead, since it didn't have that as option I had to do it custom. Not only that, if the heat is on and I want it to cool instead, I have to say ""Alexa, set 'The House' to cool"" THEN say ""Alexa, set The House to 69"".  Only then will she turn the A/C on and cool it down. Why can't I just say set the house to 69 and have it assume that if the heat is on, and it's 76, that she should turn the A/C on instead and cool it down to 69? WTF?",Who Are These People?

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,geoff arvesen,We have had our best thermostat for a little over a year now and I have to say we love it. I would give 10 stars if I could!!! The features are amazing. I like that You can adjust the temperature when you’re not home plus it syncs with the weather and knows when to adjust the temperature. Plus it knows when you’re home or away and learns your routine. We keep it set to a temperature range where in the winter it won’t go below a set temperature and in the summer it won’t go above a set temperature. No more switching back and forth between heat and ac in our crazy Texas weather Our electric bill is significantly lower. It takes a couple weeks for it to learn your routine. We don’t ever even have to touch the thermostat.,Would give it 10 stars
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2020,A,"I was skeptical upon buying since most reviews were negative. 3 months into using and so far I am happy with our purchase! • Set-up: Phenomenal walK through — ANYONE can do it! I was so nervous to start it on my own, I actually procrastinated a few days. Advice: make sure your phone is fully charged and house cooled (and it’s not the hottest day) before starting installation, as your power will need to be turned off to install. •Sensors: If you are looking to purchase, I would HIGHLY recommend getting AT LEAST 3 sensors (depending on your sqft; ours is 2400) or the Nest will not be worth it. Make sure you place the sensors in your warmest rooms and one in the coolest. This will help with the Airwaves feature, which saves energy by using the fan to circulate the air and make the house a similar temperature. With sensors, you will also be able to see individual temps of each room (which sensor was placed) and will have the choice to set the room as primary. For example, at night I set my temp to 68 and make the bedroom primary; otherwise, if I leave the family room as primary my bedroom ends up 3 degrees cooler. All this to drive home the point that the additional sensors make a big difference. • Learning: This feature can be turned off. As far as the learning thermostats settings go, I’m happy with it. I find myself adjusting the temp less, though I nearly always want it set at a certain temp at a certain time so could easily get by with a schedule. I could see how this setting could become a nuisance if you are one to change the temp constantly at various times without some sort of pattern. For us, it took about 5-7 days before the temp was automatically changing. • Geo-cache: The geo-cache is a really cool feature — we love! It will prep the house for your desired temp when you are within a certain radius coming/going from your home. Downside, the constant ping of your cellphone location decreases your phones battery life. • Remote access: Controlling the device from our phones and Alexa may easily be one of the best features. The convenience is a game changer! • Reports: I was so excited to review the history reports and they did not disappoint! It tells you the run time, of an adjustment you made saved energy, if weather affected usage, and how many hours the ac ran for the day. I’m sure there are other features I haven’t touched-on, but these are my most used and -enjoyed. As far as energy save, it’s hard to say that the Nest has made a tremendous difference in our electric bill. We installed it in Spring, when the temps outside have started to rise. Our electric bill has remained about the same since installing — so it’s either saving money (because with outside temps rising there has only been a slight increase to our bill) or it’s making little to no difference. Though energy savings was my main motivation for purchasing the Nest, I am still happy with the purchase (even with our electric bill not reflecting much of a change).",Great buy — must purchase sensors!
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2018,Andy H,"After 1 year I had to replace the unit because the battery stopped being able to charge to a level that would power wifi.  This would have been fine because Nest was quick to replace it and things worked.  Until just recently, I had my A/C die and I had noticed that heat was coming out when the A/C was supposed to be running.  I replaced the air handler and outside unit b/c a valve had blown on the heat pump - only to find that heating was still happening.  It turns out something in the Nest, either a bug, or a faulty mounting base is causing the AUX heater to run while my A/C was running.  I have no idea how long this was going on for but I'm sure it isn't good for my A/C unit.  I have not done complete analysis yet to see how much this was affecting my bill.  Note to figure this out I used a temperature gun and pointed it at vents with the aux wire plugged in vs unplugged - I saw about a 10 degree difference.  Update - I'm raising my rating on this because I like all of the features of the Nest Thermostat.  And I like that they stand behind their hardware and do care about their customers experience. I'm raising my rating to 2 stars because I like Nest's software and the concept behind it.  Also their support, when I have known there was an issue, has been helpful.  I replaced the base on my unit and it is no longer running the heater.  So it appears that all of this was due to a bad component - the battery issue may have been related to this as well.  It's a shame because it's the cheapest component and probably should have been replaced with the thermostat the first time to rule it out as an issue.",Faulty Hardware has shaken my confidence - Still they have good features and stand by their product.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 May 2020,SteveH,"Thermostats have been installed for some time now and they're nice but I'm not a fan of the ""learning"" feature (I only bought this version because I wanted the copper finish and it was on sale). Sure, if you fiddle with your thermostats all day, ""learning"" may eventually be welcomed. But most of us live by the clock so great (manual) scheduling functionality, without having to teach it is, IMHO, better. I eventually turned ""Auto-Schedule"" off because it competed with configured schedules. I live in northern New England and have a duel-fuel system (propane, heat pump) with 3 zones; I run 2 different schedules for winter (one when it's cold and one when it's REALLY cold), then 1 for summer and 1 for spring/fall (heat-cool). But, you cannot configure multiple heating schedules and switch between them so, even with Nest, I STILL have to edit schedules. :-( Nest scheduling is better than many but still not ideal. Pros: 1) It's looks very nice on the wall. 2) Installation was easy although I did have some trouble getting one connected to WiFi. Googled for answers- got nothing helpful. Then it just mysteriously connected and has been fine. I dunno. 3) The user interface on the device and the app is nice and I really like the detailed technical info. 4) Heat-Cool mode: awesome. 5) Fan schedule. Cons: 1) It is obsessed with displaying the setpoint(s); seeing the actual temperature isn't as obvious. I'd like to see inside and outside temp, setpoint, humidity and time - all, conspicuously - when Farsight activates. Maybe someday there will be more display options. 2) Can only create one schedule for each mode. 3) Can't make different fan schedules for weekdays/weekends. 4) It will mysteriously light up at night in the bedroom even with Farsight disabled. Overall: Very good. Minus 1 star for the listed cons.","Good thermostat; don't like the ""learning"" feature"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 May 2017,jm,"My home is old and does not have a ""C wire.""  The system consists of AC and Electric Heater, using a 4 wire controller (R=24 VAC, Y=Cool, W=Heat and G=Fan.) I had the first generation Nest installed and it worked for about 4 years without problems, until it failed, conecting both the AC and heater for a day and a half: I have been heating and cooling my home during day and a half!  I installed an ancient mechanical thermostat and things were normal again. I decided to order the third generation Nest. In my installation, the 24 VAC transformer delivers an open loop voltage of 28 VAC (R wire) with respect to Y (yellow) or W (white) when the thermostat is disconnected and there is no load.  When connecting the 3rd generation Nest base to the wires, the AC voltage between Y and R, used by the Nest electronics, drops to about 12 VAC, impling that the current consumption of the Nest base produces a significant drop of 28 -12 = 16 VAC in the coil of the relay used by the AC activation.  With that low voltage the thermostat shows an error message when the additional load of the display is connected.  Bottom line, I had to return the Nest 3rd generation. Some people (even Nest) suggests that the heater wire (W) could be connected to C (common) as a short term solution, during the summer time, or viceversa, connect the cool wire (Y) to C during the winter time, until you have the time to add a c wire.  Others suggest using the fan wire G connected to terminal C.  Any of these ""solutions"" imply not using all the features of the thermostat. My suggestion is to avoid the Nest 3rd generation or any other smart wifi thermostat if your home does not have a c wire installed.  Nest should make it clear that a c wire is a requirement.",C wire strongly recommended
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Mar 2019,Nathan,"First off, I have to say that I am not only impressed with the actual thermostat but also Nest as a company. This was quite an expensive purchase and took some time making sure I was making the right purchase. One of the things that solidified my decision to purchase this thermostat was Nest's compatibility checker on their website which made the process a lot easier to know it would be compatible with my existing system. It involved me taking off the cover on my existing thermostat, looking at the connected wires and their labels, and then putting that into a checker on their website. Nest told me which models would be compatible and then also how it would look once I received it. Others here say that the installation is simple and they are not lying. I'm somewhat handy, but I hate messing with electronics like this. This was a relatively easy job that took me about 30 minutes, if that. Nest also included most of the tools I'd need to do it, minus one screwdriver but that was to remove my existing unit. Now Nest doesn't leave you in the dark once they get their money like other companies do. While going through the setup in the app (which is extremely user friendly and helpful), I encountered a problem. I called Nest support as I was directed in the app. The wait was about 7 minutes and I was speaking to someone who spoke clear, understandable English and then transferred me to their thermostat division. The call was interrupted for some reason, maybe my end, I don't know, but they called me back and the woman was extremely helpful in explaining. She didn't baby talk me nor did she use jargon most people wouldn't understand. She explained, what turned out to be, a very stupid misunderstanding on my part. Had I read the directions a little more clearly, I would have seen it, I just got confused. Once we got all that cleared up, she sent me an e-mail and directed me to take a picture and send it back to her. The e-mail arrived to me faster than she could finish her sentence, and I'm not exaggerating on that. She received my e-mail as I was done sending it and she explained to me over the phone how my wiring would be done. She also offered to create a customized diagram for me to use which showed me exactly which wires would go where. The rep offered to stay on the phone with me while I finished or encouraged me to call back if I ran into any other issues or questions as they have a 24 hour customer service line just for questions like this. I have to say I was very impressed based on that call alone. Next part was that I had a working thermostat in 5-10 minutes after ending the call with her. It really works! Setting up Alexa was no problem as well which Alexa does on her own for the most part in the app. We needed a thermostat like this for my dad who has been having vision issues. Thanks to this thermostat, he is able to control the temperature in the house much better than before, making him feel more independent and better even though he's in this nasty situation. From myself and my family, we thank you Nest for allowing this for us. The only complaints I have is in regards to the voice control, which I suppose could be changed if we really wanted to. For instance, there's no documentation I could find that tells you exactly what you need to say. But after a Google search, I found a forum on this where someone had the same issue and I found the solution. To control the thermostat using voice, you say ""Alexa turn up the heat"" or ""Alexa turn on the cooling"" depending on whether you want air conditioning or heating. I was hoping more for ""Alexa turn up the heat to 80"" but this is fine. We all now understand what to say and there's no real issue. The thermostat is smart and seems to be learning our habits and how we like the house and the Eco feature is supposed to save us some money on our bill, so we're looking forward to that. I can't comment on either of those features at this time since we've only had the unit for around a month now. As of now, we're extremely satisfied with this. It truly feels like we're living in the 21st century when you can turn up and down the temperature using your voice. And that thermostat is absolutely beautiful to pass by. It has a lot of useful information on the display and also lights up when you pass by. It's really awesome and I'm really excited about it.",5 Star Item

I purchased to install on my Lennox furnace / air conditioner.  Have friends that love their Nest's, and wanted to get started with the Nest universe of products.  Purchased, opened, installed and found it was not compatible.  My Lennox has a continuously variable fan, that I love, and the Nest will not work with it.  I started to questions the Nest after the testing of the fan, turned it on but would not speed up the fan (it barely blew any air).  After much Googling of Nest website, buried deep on the website was a note about continuously variable furnaces, and the fact Nest 3rd did not work.  So, here is what you need to know.  If you have a single stage, dual stage, or three stage (1,2 or 3 speed fan) furnace this will work.  If you have a high tech continuously variable fan your out of luck.  Once you go to a furnace with continuously variable, you will never go back.  You hardly know your furnace is running as it can ramp up and down to the perfect heating and cooling fan speed.  So, hope Nest will update their thermostat some day to work with this style of fan.  Hey Nest, how about a remote thermostat like Ecobee?","Good Stat, but did not work with my high tech furnace."

First, check to see if your system is compatible with Nest. You can easily do that from their site. Once you’ve determined that it’s compatible, add this baby to your cart. Skip the expensive pro installation unless you have a really jacked up system. I was able to install it in about 10 minutes. 1) take a picture of your existing unit and where the wires are plugged into 2) cut the power off to the thermostat. I couldn’t figure out which breaker was assigned to our system, so I just shut the main one off to the house. No big deal. 3) dismantle the old unit 4) screw on the vanity plate from Nest (it was more than big enough to cover up the holes from our old unit, so don’t waste money on a large plate if you don’t want to). 5) Connect the wires to where they were on your old unit (kinda like speaker wires, you open the clamp and it pinches down. It’s easy) 6) attach the Nest faceplate (main unit) 7) push on the faceplate to get it hooked up to your WiFi, what settings you’d like, etc. 8) download the app and sync it with your unit Boom, done.

Once I figured out how to remove my exsisting thermostat, I followed the instructions on the video that nest posts on youTube.  I shut down the power to my house, simply because I was unable to determine which breaker shut down the power to my new heating/cooling unit.  Once I did that, it was super easy to match up the wires to the correct slot, flipped on the power, replaced the front and tada it booted up!  Follow the instructions and download the app on your phone and you are in business. Now I bought the nest because I wanted the ability to control my homes heating/cooling from  a distance.  That can't be done with a simple programmed thermostat.  I like the idea that I can be at work or school, stay uber late and make sure that my heat/cooling doesn't come on and run for a few hours while I'm not home. The box comes with everything you need in order to disconnect your original thermostat and then install your new Nest. The bonus with the nest is my particular gas/power companies offer rebates, that drop the cost of the nest by a significant amount. I would highly recommend the nest to anyone who is looking for an easy install, great control, and nice looking thermostat! Enjoy!",Super quick and easy Install!

I put the white wire in W1 and the red wire in Rh. However, after reading from others that using a Common wire would be good, I saw that there was an unused blue wire. So I stripped it and plugged it into C. That was not a good idea because the Nest thermostat didn't do anything. It didn't turn on and the little light did not flash or anything. So I unplugged the blue wire from C and then it turned on. It was a little difficult to get the wires pushed into the holes all the way so that the clip button stayed pressed down. Since I read from others that auto-schedule and Eco mode do not work very well I disabled them and just set a schedule. I don't know how Eco mode could effectively know when people are home or not in a house with four people and different schedules. I don't want to make every person install the Nest app on their phones. It was not as easy as I had hoped to get Google Home and Amazon Alexa to recognize the Nest thermostat. It wasn't difficult, but I am a tech and it still should have been easier for non-techs to setup. I wish it worked with Siri without having to buy extra hardware or third party apps, but Google doesn't want to take the time to program it. Apparently it will work with Homebridge and a Raspberry pi. But that is a lot of work and hardware. Also, now it will apparently work with Siri Shortcuts, but you also seem to need to purchase an app called Thermo Watch.

The temp display could be one small corner of the video. The second image displays what you see when you click on the camera.  Hmm...

It is easy to install if you have even the tiniest bit of DIY experience.... but. I do not like the web site by Nest to see if your system is compatible for using the Nest thermostat. I decided to upgrade to the Nest after hearing good things from a few friends. I opened up my old thermostat and check the wiring to see if everything was good. According to the Nest web site I did indeed have everything I needed for a Nest to operate with my system (wiring coming out of the wall from my HVAC system). I was assured by the web site that my four wires (W,G,Y and Rh) were enough to operate the Nest. They were not. If you are going to purchase this Nest... I suggest you look at your current wiring. If you do NOT have a ""C"" wire (common) either attached to your existing thermostat or shoved back in the wall... you might want to either run this extra wire or look up alternatives on-line. My Nest operated for two days and then died. I troubleshot the fault and found this is a common problem that Nest doesn't really address... at all. Cut to the chase... If you have a HVAC (heating and air conditioning) system like I do... check to see if you have at least five wires coming to your thermostat... if not... you might need to re-wire it BEFORE installing the Nest. Without the ""common"" wire, your Nest can NOT charge the internal battery... then it cuts the WIFI connection... and then will stop working totally. It was 5 degrees F in Minnesota this morning... I am just glad I found the problem before I went to bed... and that I had not yet thrown out the old thermostat.

So good that I decided to give it to my mom and bought a 3rd Gen. What a mistake... The 3rd gen worked for 9 months until the Wifi chip went bad for no apparent reason.  Common problem on these, look it up. Did some troubleshooting to the Nest Tech support team via FB messenger since they don't have a phone number to call anymore (I'm sure a cost cutting measure). They checked the power readings and a few other things and sent me a replacement within a week. The replacement (likely refurb) worked fine for half a day then next morning it suddenly can't detect wifi anymore (and the display wakes up after 30 seconds rather than immediately as it should). Now I ask for another replacement but continually troubleshoot for a week and go as far as including whitelisting the Nest MAC address on my router (which my network hardware config has not changed at all) and they keep telling me that their team is looking into it with no expected time of when they can respond... In this day and age, this is unacceptable service of keeping a customer in the dark. Why not just send me a replacement and their troubleshoot the defective thermostat when you receive it? Also, perhaps they refurb the defective units and use them as replacement stock but clearly, their quality control isn't very high. I'm more tech savvy than your average consumer and I'm pretty sure 9/10 people would have no idea how to whitelist a MAC address. With that in mind, be expected that if yours does go defective, it's pretty much a paper weight and they'll get around to it when they get around to it.  I'd have second thoughts buying another one given my experience.",Warning: Tech support and quality declining
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2019,Flaxman,"I've now used two of these thermostats for 4 years and as I've noticed more annoying particularities, I'm updating my review. These thermostats are obviously very pretty. Build quality is outstanding.  The Nest app, which allows you to control the thermostat remotely, also works great. I have three gripes with these thermostats: 1. The learning feature is worthless to me, unless you want a thermostat that changes the set point every 15 minutes.  Maybe this is good for people who are not capable of setting up a schedule on a programmable thermostat with proper setbacks when they're out and at night. For me it just means the programmed schedule gets messed up if you ever manually adjust the temperature. Thankfully, the learning can be disabled. 2. With heat pumps, alternative heat changeover temperature does not work well. We have a heat pump with a natural gas furnace to provide alternative heat on very cold days. The Nest has a changeover temperature: if the outdoor temperature  drops below that, it will switch to alt heat. The problem is that it gets its outside temperature from Weather.com with zip code granularity. This will work great if the outdoor temperature at your house is always close to the average for your zip code. However, if you live on a mountain side, close to a body of water or any other geographic feature, then that may not be the case and the Nest will not be able to switch over to alternative heat correctly. Temperature at our house is often off from the zip code average by as much as 10 degrees, so that means this function does not work well.  As I am writing this, it's 83 degrees outside and the Nest tells me it's 67. That's a full 16 degrees off. In the winter it's no better and to get around it, we adjust the alt heat temperature frequently as needed. It's unfortunate that there is no way around this. It's just poor software programming at Nest Labs. The device has all the technology to do this right. To get accurate outdoor temperature, it could allow you to enter a weather station code, or even just allow to place a Nest sensor outside your home and designate that as an outdoor sensor. It's all there, but the system doesn't allow you to do this. OK Google, can you fix this? 3. the third issue is that the home/away function stopped working well. I believe this used to be determined by the GPS location of your phones. When Google acquired Nest so that they could monitor us better, they changed the away feature so that ""away"" means the motion sensor in your thermostat hasn't detected you in 15 minutes. When you walk by the Nest, it knows you're home. This may work great when you live in a studio, but it's useless in a home office, when you're working in a room out of the seeing eye of the thermostat. It made the away feature, which worked pretty well before, completely useless and I had to turn it off. 4. the last issue is that the temperature swing is not adjustable. This is uncommon among programmable thermostats. The differential is always set to 1 degree, which means that you'll have 2 degrees temperature swings; fairly much.","A beautiful, extremely expensive programmable thermostat with some issues. Not ideal for heat pumps."
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2018,Physics Teacher,"Amazing thermostat. This NEST Learning Generation 3 thermostat surprises (in a good way) everyday. We are now in week 3 and are still discovering some of its capabilities. We were replacing an 11 year old ""dumb"" SimpleComfort 2200; dumb but a true workhorse. Installation hiccups: 1) The Widget Wiring diagram was incorrect. If we had followed that diagram's layout we would have been without auxiliary heat strips. A quick call to NEST support caught the Widget error. Basically, the correction was to a move wire from the W1 to W2 Auxiliary. CAVEAT: TAKE A PHOTO of your ORIGINAL thermostat wiring!! You wil be glad that you did. 2) NEST seems very proud of the fact that it does not need/use jumpers. This is true if your jumper is  bridging R to Rh. However, the ""no jumper"" feature does not include any other jumper settings. In our case we had a jumper bridging W2 to E (Emergency Heat) - see attached photo. Result? We no longer have the Manual Emergency Heat option. While this is disappointing, we could not think of a time when we ever used Manual Emergency Heat. Manual Emergency Heat is not Auxiliary Heat (heat strips). From what we have learned Manual Emergency Heat is a feature most useful in the higher latitudes. We live at the beach in North Carolina so it is not an issue for us. We called NEST support concerning this issue. They researched possible solutions. Unfortunately, the only fix is to run a separate wire from the air handler Manual Emergency Heat connection to the NEST * input. In our case, this is not practical.",Amazing thermostat.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jun 2020,MSRR,"I’m disappointed with the temperature gauge. Something is completely off. The sunblock function does not work. If sunlight hits the Nest directly, it assumes the room is super hot and air conditioning turns on when the temperature is actually satisfactory and 10 degrees cooler. So, the sunblock function is not working. Another example is using the eco setting when it’s windy and we keep the windows open because the temperature feels comfortable. However, the Nest shows a higher temperature than what it feels like and turns on the air conditioning. Basically on some days Nest displays 78 degrees and it feel comfortable whereas on others the same temperature is too hot to handle. We also turned off the google learning feature because we wanted the rooms to heat up by 2-3 degrees early in the morning and then by another few just before getting up. With the learning feature I had to get up 2 hours early to set the temperature and then again 30 minutes before actual wake up time. I wish the learning app could facilitate the set schedule as a basis and then build on by learning deviations. The design is modern and setting up is not an issue, but I cannot claim the Nest is better than the Honeywell we had before.",Needs improvement

It would stop, start again a few second later, stop after 30 seconds, and just kind of randomly pulse.  Thought it was part of the money saving logic, so ignored it for a year. Finally googled it and its a sign the nest doesn’t have enough power and needs a c-wire ran. Mine already had the extra wire ran, so not a huge deal to hook it up. More concerned about what this did wear and wise to the blower. For as much logic as they built into this thing, a simple incoming voltage check was just out of the question?","Just run the c wire, ignore nests claims"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2015,Sam R.,"So I ordered 3 of these for my business. Absolute garbage. They do not work with my system. I'm not upset that they don't work - there's plenty of other competitors products I can purchase and use - I'm upset because of WHY they don't work. So far I have returned 2/3 and I installed the third in my home - just to give them a chance. The one in my house is working fine so far and I plan to leave it there for a month or so to see what happens. Installation was simple enough - I've installed plenty of thermostats. I went through the setup like normal - added to wifi - which doesn't have WPS which would make the process SO much easier when you have a 24 character WiFi password! After setup the last step is to do a ""system test"". Its cold, so it won't let you test AC (which is good you'll find out why soon), but it let me test heat. So I hit heat and the heat turned on. Good! Then I hit done and the display said ""the heat is now off"". The heat did not turn off. I removed the display from the baseplate. The heat STILL did not turn off. I removed the R wire - the heat then turned off. After talking on the phone with nest support and burning out a second baseplate they tried to tell me that having stranded instead of solid wires was my problem. WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!! After I told him ""lets pretend I have solid wires"" he just told me my system was incompatible with NEST. I then decided to measure the current that went through when the heat was running. The systems we have deliver 680mA @28v while running. I'll admit this is high, but its not extreme. Most systems run at less then 300mA. My system at home runs at about 50mA. The systems at work DO have a common wire which the support guy tried to tell me was also the problem. Basically what happened was the 680mA was enough to destroy the circuitry in the baseplate. This is insane to me. The fact that this wasn't engineered well enough to take that little current is just poor design! I began to read online of issues others have had with this. Some people have had the Nest burn their compressor out because the baseplate fried while it was running and the fan turned off but compressor did not. To solve this issue you must add a relay for each wire. Thats crazy. Add relays to switch another set of relays.... So I returned them and ordered 3 EcoBee's. After reading up on them, an engineer stated that they had designed the EcoBee to be able to handle the proper current. Since I have common wires I can use them. Nest's power stealing design I've heard can burn out circuit boards - I hope it doesn't do that to my unit at home. If it does, I'll come change this to a 1* review wish you could give it negative stars! It is unacceptable for a third generation design to not fix a fatal flaw in the hardware of this thermostat. GET SOME BETTER ENGINEERS! I am an EE that works in an office with other EE's. . . We all think its crazy how poor this design is. Last thing to add - support is wonderful because it is 24/7 but when calling at 5pm means you have to wait for a half hour to talk to someone then wait 45 minutes to talk to escalation... useless... Get more employees. So in the end... If you don't have a common wire and need a smart thermostat - this is pretty much your only option unless you run a common wire from the thermostat transformer. Otherwise please don't buy this piece of junk. What a waste of money.",Poorly engineered garbage.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Feb 2019,Shopper,"This thermostat is a beautiful design and functioning triumph. Not only for what it does, but the way we as humans interact with it. A great technology and human focused design. It makes it easy if you want to save energy/money, by tracking your usage, seeing when your system was on, what temperature it was set to, when it was changed. If you like you can have it use its motion sensing capability to determine if you are home or not, and if not, change the thermostat setting to a more energy efficient one... and when it detects you are back home, change it back. If you also have a Nest smoke detector, you can have the motion detecting capability of that to ALSO tell the thermostat if you are home, or not. I understand you can also set up the thermostat to use the location of the cell phone(s) with the Nest App on it to determine if all of them are out of the house, and then change the thermostat setting ( I have this turned off). The phone App is pretty intuitive, clean design, easy to read and control the thermostat when you are in the house or out of the house. When you log into your Nest account on a PC, you see the same thing as the App on your phone and can control the thermostat from there too. Since the thermostat has connection to the internet, it knows (and displays) the temperature outside. Using that and the indoor temperature it learns how long it will take to heat your house to your desired temperature when you increase the thermostat temperature in the winter... and it will show you the minutes it will take. It also measures and displays indoor humidity, accurately, as I have compared it against another humidity gauge. It directly and correctly controls both stages of my two stage furnace. In the app on your phone, or using your PC, you must set up the thermostat to determine if you are home or not (and change the temperature setting) based on motion it detects as you walk by it, and/or motion that your Nest smoke detector detects, and/or cell phones at home or not. I have them all turned off. I programmed a daily schedule that I want the thermostat to follow whether it thinks I’m home or not. Unlike many other reviews who are complaining that the temperature setting keeps changing, I don’t have that problem as I correctly turned off all those motion detection and cell phone detection features, and mine follows the program I set as my humble servant. And if I’m going to me gone for a few hours, I open the App, touch AWAY, and the more energy efficient settings are used. The only thing more I could ask for from a thermostat is that it makes my lunch. Really, really nicely designed product. Worth it.",A beautiful piece of technology made simple and useful. Thank you

It anticipates my needs and keeps me comfortable 24/7. In the spring and fall, the nest is a terrible product. I spent time building a great custom schedule in the winter. In the spring, every now and then we have a cold morning and I want just a little help getting the house up to temperature so I will change the thermostat from off to 63. The problem is, the nest has no 'Hold' feature. This means come 8am, the schedule kicks in and my house is now auto heated to 70. A few hours later the sun is out and it has warmed up outside and my house is now roasting. All because I wanted to raise the temperature from 58 to 63 several hours earlier. The official solution is to delete your schedule so it will hold temperature. It took time to get my schedule set exactly how I want it. No way I want to go through that again next winter.

Everyone wants to know if Nest is as cool as it looks (it’s probably even better than you expect).  The super sleek design looks great on the wall without drawing needless attention to itself. Nest’s LED display conveniently lights up the dark hallway it sits in when you walk by at night. However, it’s not so bright that I would hesitate to install it in a bedroom (it wouldn’t wake you up). Having the ability to adjust the settings via the phone app or via a web portal is super slick. The fact that it has the ability to automatically switch between heat/cool modes is also very useful in spring/fall, when the weather requires heat in the mornings and AC by afternoon. It also tells you the inside humidity %, which is pretty awesome. Plus, it knows the local weather so it’s always thinking.  There are a number of energy saving features and reports you can utilize as well. One of my favorite features is the ability to synchronize it to your mobile phones. If you choose to set it up, it will adjust the HVAC setting depending if you’re home or not. Yes, if you give it permission, it can detect if your families’ mobile phones are present and adjust the air so you aren’t wasting $. Seriously, how cool is that??? My big question was if the Nest would accept timer settings - or if you were forced to have it “learn” your preferences over time. My wife wasn’t going to indulge my interest in having a smart thermostat if she was going to have to adjust the thermostat for the first few weeks. Fortunately, I was able to set up a schedule during the week and chose to let it “learn” our weekend routine (since I would be home to teach it on weekends). Truthfully, I haven’t really messed with it more than a few times. My wife has little patience for technology when a less complicated/technological solution can perform the same task. Another nice feature I didn’t know I cared about: Nest quickly “learns” your home and will tell you how long till your selected temperature is achieved. I do worry about what happens in 10 years if they decide they are no longer supporting this “older” technology via new phone/app updates, but I guess I’ll worry about that 10 years from now (it will tell me if I am buying another Nest product when it’s time to replace this one). The thermostat unit the Nest replaced was just a builder grade 6-day timer thermostat that fulfilled its purpose. No frills, but it worked pretty good. The Nest tech is flawless and the online-installation tutorial is pretty much idiot proof. If you register it before you install it, it tells you where to connect the exact wires your wall has sticking out of it. It really couldn’t have been easier. I get a bit nervous when I get into these kinds of home repairs, but it is something a novice can do (if you can change a wall switch/plug, this will be no problem). Highly recommend. If you are on the fence about whether to purchase a Nest, I hope my review was able to address some of your concerns.",Sleeker and easier than I anticipated

After several rounds of texting with Nest Support, resetting, sending photos of wiring, etc., their conclusion was there was a problem with the wiring and a Service Tech needed to call. An interesting conclusion after having the Nest operate for several months with zero changes to the install or set-up. Switched out the Nest to the basic Honeywell thermostat it had replaced and did have a Service Tech come out to check out everything the next day. No wiring issues were diagnosed and the Service Tech, who installs the Nest Products for clients regularly indicated that this was not an usual situation. That the Nest products were known peculiarities like this. Left the basic Honeywell thermostat installed since, and have no intention of further experimentation with the Nest reliability in the midst of a Texas Summer.",Disappointing Investment

Packaging was lovely. Installation fairly easy. Downloading the app, ok. I like the 'internet' connectivity, where it will display the relevant outside temperature, and detects when you walk by and shows whats up. But, after setting it up to smart learn, I found the device is just not 'smart' enough.  Frequently found it cranking up the heat when not needed or wanted, and often i find it set to some bizarre temperature.  I used the app to try and clear all of these (the app is horrrrrible at helping you set schedules and on/off) - and still, it seemed there were 'ghosts in the machine' to borrow a phrase from ""I, Robot"".  It still behaved weird, turning on the heat in the middle of the night. Maybe Nest developers dont realize here in the Northwest, in summer months we use cool mornings as our 'A/C' and dont want the heat on in the am . I finally just turned it all off, and manually set temperature. I would not buy again.",Ghosts in the Machine

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2020,cmsk,"So I’ve had TWO of these units installed for several years with pretty much no issues.  That is until the dreaded OFFLINE due to low battery issue popped up — on BOTH devices within a month of eachother.  Apparently this is an ongoing issue that seems to plague these NEST units.  After exhaustive support — which I will say is very good from NEST.  It’s been determined that the NON-REPLACEABLE battery will not keep a charge.  From the troubleshooting performed, the issue seems to point to a faulty WiFi chip that’s draining the battery. From a design standpoint, this whole situation makes NO sense.  A battery issue should NOT be a problem when the system has constant power.  It should ONLY be a problem during a power outage, in which case the entire system wouldn’t work anyway.  Regardless, I have a whole home generator, so the system is NEVER without power, so regardless of the battery charge level, the device should not SHUT DOWN and go ‘OFFLINE’ mode when it has constant power.  This is obviously a design flaw. Side note: when the low battery/offline issue happens, the thermostat starts ‘freaking out’ and doing pretty much whatever it wants at random times.  Woke up last weekend to the house boiling hot because the NEST decided to crank up the heat… mind you, it was set to OFF at the time. This has been extremely frustrating and disappointing, especially considering the cost of this product. I’ll be replacing these two units with some other brand!",Low battery failure only a matter of time.

I bought two more for a new house and the whole experience is horrible.

Second every time some update comes out I have to go back and reset my setting for away and home assist - don't find this out until the house starts getting hot.  Third you have to go through Google home to set this up.  Google home itself is a nightmare and not something I want to fool with but had to sign-in with a gmail account and navigate that mess.  They would not let me use my old non-gmail email address.  Thanks Big Brother.  Online help is absent - you have to search forums to get simple answers to how the different features work.

Its almost must need for me now.  The copper is amazing. This review is solely about what was delivered.  I paid full price for the main product here on Amazon, sold by Google.  The box seemed to be a new package.  Upon opening and then install it became clear this was a repackaged product.  First taking the protective cover off the face revealed a nick/scratch.  Not sure if that's a google QC issue or maybe it was nicked and repackaged? Upon install, the device was locked with a security code and obviously had been installed before.  I spent hours on the phone with google troubleshooting (including connecting to computer, sending xml file, etc.).  The tech questioned me about 30 times where i got this product and was I sure it was never used before.  He had to escalate with a response expected in 48 hours.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2018,Dennis Hamilton,"I'd been putting up with an ancient forced-air system with inoperable A/C and a thermostat that was impossible to program and then adjust later.  I had been fascinated by Nest, but was concerned that it might not function well in my situation, especially because of the apparent reliance on Apple and Android smartphones.  Being Alexa-ready was attractive, and I was satisfied that nest.com can be used from a PC and I could do without a smartphone/tablet app. The TL;DR: This is my favorite in-home technology.  I have not yet ceased walking up and checking it every time I am near its hallway location.  Although it is still ""learning"" in the first week of installation, the ease of manual operation and some simple energy-conservation moves are instant rewards.  I look forward to a nice rebate from my ""energy service"" and also future suggestions, at the Nest, for energy-saving and relief of peak demand.  And there is the yet-to-be experience of the trained Nest. INITIAL INSTALLATION The video on the Amazon page for the product is very useful, with great tips about removal of the existing thermostat.  The Nest package also recommends going to a site for verification that the existing system is compatible and the available wiring can be used.  Do that.  And follow those instructions carefully. For the connection, the most physically-demanding operation was mounting the white base plate (for covering the marking from the previous thermostat) and the Nest base.  The two screws are long and I encountered frightening moments with about 1/4"" inch to go and sudden very tight resistence.  I overcame that, but the supplied reversible screw-driver was not good enough.  I recommend drilling pilot holes, something I failed to do.  The built-in spirit level is a wonderful nicety. I had some trepidation about how the built-in Nest first-time setup procedure would go.  It was easy and a treat. WIFI, INTERNET, THE APP, AND AMAZON ECHO My WiFi access point, on a household router, is secured but visible.  The Nest found it.  It did take three tries to get it to both recognize the WiFi and get the passphrase it needed.  Entering the passphrase was challenging, with nothing like a keypad, and it worked.  Think dymo labeler. I had created an account on nest.com, even before the Nest order, to satisfy myself that I could do what I needed for internet connection at the nest.com web site.  After local setup and Wifi Connection, I adde the device using nest.com through my PC browser.  It just worked.  The PC use of nest.com provides an equivalent of the phone-based apps.  The only thing lacking is a way to have GPS detection that I am away, although this works on my wife's phone.  If I travel with my non-GPS laptop, I can at least use a browser to control the Nest via nest.com and my incompatible-smartphone browser might accomplish that too. I wasn't certain that Alexa connection was working and I saw reports of difficulties in other reviews.  In my case, difficulties in tying alexa.amazon.com and nest.com accounts was because the nest.com service was down and I couldn't tell that from within the attempt.  It also helped, when then the nest.com server was back up, that I was already logged into nest.com over my Internet browser on the PC.  I learned immediately that Alexa will tell me what the temperature is at the Nest, if I mention the name (""Hallway"") of the Nest.  Reports of inability to do that are apparently out-of-date. All-in-all, a great experience and I look forward to more adventures in economizing household energy use with the Nest as the instrument.","Becoming my Favorite in-home technology, even without smarphone app"

I've been using Nest for a few years now and the features I love the most are: ability to modify the temp via phone app and eco mode (to save money). The smart thermostat is kinda like Santa Claus, as it knows when you're awake- or at least knows when you pass in front of the device and activates ""home"" status rather than ""away"" status. There is probably a ton of technical data out there if you are inclined to research. My reason for my initial purchase a few years ago, was my interest in adjusting the thermostat from the convenience of my phone. I thought it was great for when on vacation, or away on work trips. Now I'm too deep into the Nest to go back to the old boring thermostats that demand batteries for the clock.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2018,Anthony S,"If you have a Dual Transformer system, you MUST run the C ""common"" wire to the A/C system, NOT the heating system!  I have completely SEPARATE heating and A/C systems, which is quite common in the northeast where I live.  I have an oil burner in the basement, and a central air handler in the attic.  The compatibility checker said this would be fine, but it was not.  I preemptively ran a common wire to my heating system.  When I installed the Nest I was getting Wiring error codes (E79) stating that I had no power to the C wire.  I confirmed the power on a digital multi-meter was 27 volts.  I called Nest phone support and they told me my C wire was ""not grounded properly"" which made no sense.  When I disconnected the A/C wires from the baseplate, the wiring error went away, and then the thermostat was working.  As soon as I added the A/C wires, wiring error codes and the thermostat just shuts down, will not work and will not charge.  I called again and spoke to a different tech, who determined that I had a defective baseplate.  They sent me a new one, and as soon as I installed it I got the same error code.  I spent over an hour speaking to 2 different Nest support techs, and many hours reading through Nest reviews and info on the internet before I found this bit of information buried towards the end of the Nest Pro installer guide:  Dual transformer systems must have the C wire connected to the A/C system, not the heating system.  That bit of info shouldn't be so hard to find. The other BIG issue I had was that the thermostat would not automatically switch into ""Away"" mode when I was not home.  I set it up to use my iphone 6 to know when I was away from the house.  Well, I would check it everyday from work and find it thought my phone was still home, even though I was 10 miles away.  Checking nest online support was again not very helpful, as it states that this feature may not work if you are not far enough away, but it doesn't specify how far.  So one day I went about 100 miles away, and checked, and it still thought I was home!  I double checked all of the location settings on my phone, and restarted the phone to no avail.  One day I decided to switch the phone associated with my account to my work phone, another iphone (SE), and the feature immediately started working properly.  Which does not make sense! Lastly, Nest began emailing me to send back the ""defective"" base plate, but they never sent me a shipping label, and I am not going to pay to mail something that was not properly diagnosed by their own technicians.  I had to contact them yet a third time so they could send me a shipping label.

I received this nest thermostat today and I have no doubt that this is a great device. It seems to be a great thermostat. HOWEVER, I was very sad to see that the humidity sensor on this device is faulty! It is measuring at 77% humidity (which is very high for indoors!) when my hygrometer measues at 52% (much more reasonable) I literally put the hygrometer next to the nest thermostat and took a photo to show the discrepancy in case I Needed proof that my house is not at 77% humidity lol. Apart from the fact that there are no drips and mold everywhere. And no, this thermostat was not installed on an outside wall so the air from the outside could not be messing up the reading.

I really like the way that it automatically lights up and shows the current temperature and setting when it detects motion. The scheduling UI is very intuitive. Nice to have apps on the iPhone and iPad. I’m ambivalent about the “learning” feature - do I want tight control over the temperature schedule vs. having the thermostat figure that out over time?

Along with that I noticed a loud noise coming from the unit. In the early summer i assumed some maintenance issue was occurring on the unit outside. After getting 2 certified technicians to review the unit, they determined the Nest is the culprit. For whatever reason the Nest is causing my unit to power on and off even when it hasn't reached to temperature I had it set for. It would disengage the cooling each power off which created a loud noise. I still haven't found a solution and my unit is now louder than an airplane, scaring a few dogs on my block.

I found the Nest website very helpful to ensure the wiring from the old thermostat would be compatible with the Nest unit, and it provided excellent visual aids as far as how to wire it correctly. Once I received the new thermostat from Amazon, I did the swap in about 30 minutes. I felt I was unboxing an iPhone since the packaging and instructions are top-shelf. Watching a few YouTube videos helped a lot with the install and I advise you to do the same. I’ve had the Nest thermostat for about a week now and it’s still learning my preferences, but one thing I noticed almost immediately was how much better calibrated it was compared to the old unit (which dated back to the 1990s). The old thermostat kept the a/c running far longer than needed, I assume because of its location in the hallway. The Nest thermostat keeps house temps even and far better without running the a/c for long periods of time. This will save me money as far as the electricity bill is concerned.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2020,Mark,"Love it, but for the premium price, I think they could do more. CONs 1. Unable to use home/away mode. With auto away mode (eco mode), even when I schedule the house to be warm at the specified hour when I usually get home from work, Nest senses that I am not home and keeps the temperature at 62-degrees. Not until I get home does it start to try to warm up to the desired 68-degrees. (So I am cold for 2 hours). 2. I have even had to disable auto-schedule, because no matter how many times I told Nest that I wanted to sleep at 66-degrees, it would always decrease the temperature to 62-degrees. Disabling auto-schedule is the only fix. 3. Does not allow me a one-time hold at a constant temperature; something even a $20 thermostat allows. For example, if I am working from home I want to tell the thermostat to hold at 68-degrees. Not allowed! Instead I have to wait for the thermostat to set itself to 62-degrees, only then can I reset to 68-degrees.  My schedule is complex so I have 6 adjustments times per day. Lack of a simple hold temperature feature should be considered a non-starter 4. Lots of lost opportunity. My steam boiler behaves much different that hot water boiler, because mine needs more time before the steam (212-degrees) begins to circulate; hot water circulates at 140-degrees. Nest only allows Boiler vs furnace (and gas vs electric).  My radiant heating is even slower still, which Nest could easily optimize. Optimizing boiler cycling is the key to keeping your utility bills low. 5. Doesn't have full integration with Alexa. I would love to be able to: -- say, ""Alexa what's the heat set to"" or similar. But it only lets me ask the current actual temperature. For example, 62 is actual and 68 is what the thermostat is set to. -- Allow Alexa to automatically take it out of Eco mode (away mode). I could then use existing Alexa functionality to being heating when I leave work. 6. While it will ""work"" without a C-wire, it will abuse your heating system to charge its internal battery. Don't do it. 7. Tech support for advanced wiring is abysmal. They only tell you to hire a technician. (I wanted a wiring diagram to connect to 24v (with positive and negative wire), since I don't have a C-wire (single wire); but they never gave me diagram; only told me to hire a technician). PROs 1. Beautiful and simple. 2. The functionality that does work with Alexa is wonderful. I love adjusting the thermostat from bed. There is an issue with not allowing new Nest Accounts (instead forcing you to use a Google account) 3. Even given the limitations, I ended up buying three more thermostats to control my future radiant heating zones.","Good, but not perfect"

Ok I continue with the app, which doesn’t respond about 20% of the time (I’m on an iPhone X) and the Instructions were some of the worst garbled up concoctions of steps I’ve ever seen. I’ve taken engineering classes, built a keyboard, built a dozen computers and fix my own car all using YouTube and online instructions mostly. But this? Boy this takes the cake for the worst instructions ever conceived for this millennia. It expects you to know what everything is and what every piece is called without ever telling you anything. Anyways I get through the god awful instructions to the point where it says something along the lines of “go turn off the breakers for the house to keep you safe, and make sure you switch to cellular data so that you can continue with the instructions”... Are you joking? I happen to live an area where there is no cell reception. I mean NONE. So because google was too lazy to make some paper instructions I had to go bust my butt turn off every single breaker in the house one by one to find out which breaker will turn off the wires connected to the thermostat and not my WiFi (it’s an old house and the breakers are not labeled, and it shouldn’t be my job too considering they say it takes 15 minutes as an easy install). Several painstaking flips later I find out which is which and start to plug them in. Again the instructions are terrible so it takes me and my father who is also helping me with this, a very long time to figure out what the hell to do. After we get past the terrible Installation of the board and wires we begin the setup. Before I can even turn the nest on, it just flashes “low battery turning off”. And shuts down, I can’t do anything, nothing will turn it off even though it’s connected to the wall, so now I waste more time plugging it into a micro usb. It decides to act normally and we get past the setup page. We find out it only shoots out cold air and no hot air. We try for over an hour flipping switches, switching the wires etc to no avail. My dad has given up at this point. It being a Christmas gift and not for me, I called customer support and they make me do all the basic stuff even though I told them I had already done it. A few minutes later they have me doing slightly more complex steps to no avail. It takes about 2 hours on the phone for the lady to say that she’s going to escalate it to a senior technician. Why this took so long I don’t know. The Senior technician was very patient and kind and helped me throughout this process. After another hour I mentioned that we have a gas furnace and he says “oh well in that case put (a) here and (b) here”. It worked instantly, it’s too bad that no one ever asked me that question to begin with or had it been on the INSTRUCTIONS, this problem would never have happened. I will give customer support props for staying on the line and being patient, but this really should not have happened in the first place. It left me disappointed, embarrassed and enlightened as I will now be very careful when purchasing products from this company. Tl;dr: Took 3+ hours to install this product because of terrible instructions and customer support’s lack of knowledge.",Not a good Christmas gift

It would not connect to WiFi so I couldn’t work it on my phone during that time. It has a mind of its own and is very complicated to figure out initially. I would wake up to hear blaring when I turned it down to 64 to sleep. It takes some getting used to but I finally feel like I got it figured out. It works okay now. I like to be able to control it from my phone but I wouldn’t buy it again. That’s the only perk.

The set up was very simple. The instructions that came with the unit were easy to follow. When one of our existing wires wasn't making good contact, the unit gave us an error code and were able to make an immediate correction. The ability to test the system and troubleshoot it so quickly was just amazing. The app is easy to use and the unit user interface is great. We've only had the unit installed for approximately a month, so our experience is limited. So far though, we're very happy. *Feb 2019 update* We'e had this unit installed for over a year now. We absolutely love it! The app is so easy to use and the user interface is great. It did have trouble going on and off line, but the device told us there was a problem and the support page explained how to fix it.

It replaced an old programmable thermostat that never worked correctly. After watching a couple of YouTube howto videos, I felt ready to tackle the install. After I took pictures of the back of the old unit (for the wiring connections), I removed the old thermostat and patched the drywall, then painted up to the hole in the wall (for a nice finished looking install). I had to use hollow wall anchors for the Nest base, but it went on without incident. The wire connection process was a no brainer due to the Nest website and their wiring compatibility section. I made the connections and installed the front of the unit. I had a bad couple of moments when the Nest reported that the R wire had no power. Wait a minute....I had switched the furnace breaker off for the install. (Woops!) Switched it back on and problem solved. The Nest itself led me through the rest of the setup process. Total time for install (minus drywall patch/paint)--about 20 minutes.

Great to be able to control the temp from your phone. However, the Home/Away Assist is completely broken (with Android 9.0). I've woken up to a 50°F house because the Nest thought my phone left the house at 3am (!?) and turned off the heat. I've also come home to a house where the furnace was on all day because the Nest thought I was home. I've disabled this functionality... but really, that's why I bought the Nest.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2017,Tim,"Overall, I like this thermostat as a programmable thermostat that I can control with my phone. To be honest though, I thought that the thermostat was going to have many more options and much more flexibility. To start, the auto-schedule feature is absolute garbage. Don't use it, end of story. A little background on my issue. My electric company has a program where electricity costs more during certain hours of the day. So, I have the nest set to pre-cool my house before these hours, then bump up the temperature during the high cost hours. The issue? Nest goes into ""auto-away"" mode during this time, so it never pre-cools my house. There is no option to have it ignore auto-away mode for just the pre-cool. And without the pre-cool, my house will get far too hot and won't be energy efficient during the high cost hours (I have a very old A/C unit, so it takes awhile to cool down the house and a lot of electricity to even maintain it). So now my only options are to either turn off auto-away (a feature I normally like, by the way) and basically make this a normal dumb thermostat. Or, I can keep the auto-away mode on and minimize my cost savings. Overall, at this point, I'm disappointed with this thermostat. Definitely considering returning it for a cheapo 5-2 programmable thermostat, as that is what this has basically become for me (albeit with a much nicer programming interface). Two stars instead of one due to the great UI, instructions, and help on Nest's website when it came to installation.",Not Impressed - Customizability needs a lot of work

Bought one to ""upgrade"" from a second gen Nest t-stat.  Larger display AND it shows the local weather forecast when you pass by, if you choose to have that. Turns the heat down if no one passes by it for two hours (you can turn that feature off.) You can link it with other Nest products and all report to your smart phone.  Can control house temp from you phone, if you choose. Nest provides excellent service if you need it, and they are generous with the warranty.  I have a ham radio station and accidentally coupled excessive radio energy into the furnace control wiring. It damaged our 2nd gen Nest t-stat.  Nest sent a new one overnight at their expense even though the 2-year warranty was expired! (I moved my radio antenna far from the house...)  No more trouble. Nest sends monthly energy usage reports via email.  Nice.  It is a ""learning thermostat"" so it learns your lifestyle and uses that information to finesse the heating and cooling of your home.  It communicates with you router to get local weather updates and uses that data to its learning The 3rd gen Nest also can control your whole home humidifier as well. I removed the control electronics from our Aprilaire humidifier on our furnace and simply connected the water solenoid to the Nest's ""humidifier"" terminal.

Like, ever. I had a Nest Thermostat in a my previous home and it was great, but for my new home, this bundle is ESSENTIAL. I have a boiler system with radiant baseboards from 1961. It is awesome but the original mercury thermostats weren't registering and the system was on constantly. We have two zones, upper (which covers main and upper), and lower which covers a lower floor. The upper floor of our home would be in the 80's while our main floor, set in the high 50's, would be about about 70-75. Our bedrooms are on the upper floor so we'd have to crack a window and let the 40* air-in or roast. I was unsure about having multiple Nests in the house, but I put one one the lower and it started regulating the heat properly down there, so I bought this bundle for the upper zone. I placed the thermostat in the main living room and the sensor upstairs. Oh my god.  You guys. We have it set so that the Nest automatically switches from the thermostat to the sensor overnight and back in the morning, and it has saved us. It is (unexpectedly) exactly what we needed and is doing exactly what we need it to do. Our sleeping temp is perfect and when it switches back to the thermostat in the morning and starts getting warmer we naturally wake up and go down to a perfect temp main floor.

From 1500 miles away my wife or I can control and monitor the temperature of our house in FL without being there. This is a huge plus. As far as installation, I had some questions regarding installation with a heat pump. I called customer service and they were clueless. Although they were based is US, and were friendly enough, they didn't know how to install the unit, which I think would've helped a lot. They actually told me it wasn't compatible, and that I should return it! Have such high expectations, I went online and did some research of installations on a 6 wire heating/AC system. I still had my doubts, but I installed the 6 wires the best that I could, call it an educated guess- and it fired up and worked fine. Some better documentation would probably save the a lot of returns and calls to customer service.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Feb 2020,D. Mitchell,"I wouldn't recommend this product. We have a couple of Nests and they've worked okay for us in terms of function until we've had issues. They've been installed for about 1.5 years and we've encountered some temp setting issues with each (one resulted in the Nest blowing out a board in the furnace that cost about $1K to fix). For these issues we've spent about 60+ hours talking with Nest support and they haven't been helpful. It seems like their goal is to create the most time consuming frustrating experience for customer as a means to discourage customers from seeking a solutions to issues they're having. Each support member says they'll follow up with you and they rarely do. They have each offered solutions that they then rescind which means that the process essentially restarts every time you talk with them. And, each time you contact them (via phone or chat support) it takes about 30-45 mins for them to find out the information they need to in order to help you which means that each time you talk with support you have to block out 1.5 to 2 hours. We were finally able to get them to have someone come out to check out the issue we're having (which involves something they've told us is covered by the warranty) and the company they contract out with told us that it will take them almost a month to have a technician come out to look at the problem despite us living in a major metropolitan area . The company, Service Live (who is the only company that Nest contracts with to do work), said that every customer they have from Nest has said that their experience with Nest support mirrors mine. The tech hasn't come out yet, but I've already received contradictory information from Nest about the service appointment so my 2 month saga seems far from over. We'll likely go back to the non-smart hassle-free easy to have a tech check out issues quickly for free thermostat that came with our heater. If you do end up buying this product a service tip is to call Nest Support at (855)469-6378 and ask for a Tier 2 agent. It's helpful to do this once you have a case number. When you do this, the person will ask if it's okay to take a couple of mins to find out more about your case, ask them again to transfer you Tier 2 support. They'll likely ask once more so ask them again for the transfer and say that Tier 2 support will have to look up the same info so you'd rather not waste time. If you don't insist on being transferred then you'll spend at least an additional 20 mins on hold with the first person you're on the phone with. Again, I would highly discourage anyone from buying this product and if someone does I hope that they will never have to contact customer support.",Don't Buy - Worst Customer Service Ever (feels like purgatory)

Everybody loves them, even if they barely use all the features. I turn off the learning because my schedule is random, but if you have a pattern, the Nest will learn it. Actually if you don't have a pattern turning that feature off is must or it will drive you nuts. Nest will also figure out your HVAC system's response time and predict how long it will take to heat or cool. That way it is better at achieving desired temperatures at desired times. App integration and wifi work great. For some reason it is just way more fun to to turn the heat on remotely using my phone from the couch than actually walking across the room.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 May 2020,Michael Angel,"Pro: Looks nice. I now know a lot about HVAC systems and how they are wired. Cons: After 2 days getting support from Nest, 4 blown fuses, and a unit that Nest determined to be defective I had to go back to the original thermostat. No refunds, No returns, No in-person support. Altogether I've done 4 installs of a Nest Thermostat and I can say it takes WAY longer than the ""20-30"" minutes Nest quotes.  If everything goes right and there are no hiccups then you need 1-2 hours to install the thermostat. You need to have access to your circuit breakers, some tools (screwdriver, drills) and know a bit about your HVAC system. Nest more or less encourages people to install the thermostat themselves but you need to have at least those basic preparations (and some luck). But on this latest install not everything went right and I was unlucky. I was working with a heat pump system which Nest seems to have compatibility issues with, or at least that seems to be the case and it's what one of the senior support staff alluded to. The regular support operators know very little about HVAC systems, they are Nest specialists and don't know much more than ""Y = Yellow wire, G = Green Wire..."". One of the support operators directed me to test different wirings and we ended up blowing fuses on the heater circuit board (all the circuit breakers were off when the wires were put in place so it was the wiring that did it). I had to go to a local hardware store to pick up new heater fuses ($4), new heat pump fuses ($14) and a voltmeter ($49). Another support operator directed me to test if a B wire (heat pump reverser control) was hot by directing me to put it in the G hole (fan control), it was indeed hot and my fan control got a current that it wasn't set up to take. The support operators had me reinstall the old thermostat twice (they still worked just fine) and my hands are still tore up from manipulating the wires. There were frequent disconnects in their digital support system which stemmed from connection issues on my end and on their end. Overall I spoke with upwards of 10 support staff. When they exhausted their trouble shooting abilities then they would tell me to hold while they transferred me to a senior support staff who would 'be with me right away', and then I waited 2 hours before getting disconnected. Another staff member attempted to transfer me to someone senior and I waited another hour before getting disconnected without help. Waiting 3 hours on hold is unacceptable in my book. After 2 days of chatting online with their support and messing with my HVAC system Nest is confident that I have a defective Nest Thermostat. I still suspect that it's an incompatibility with my heat pump (Rheem brand heat pump that uses a ""B"" wire instead of an ""O"" wire for reversal control). What's the resolution?, no refunds, no replacements, no in-person support. I now have an expensive piece of garbage.

I had to hire professional electrician to install and the devise wiring was less than self explanatory with the devise to devise blue wire designation, so they guessed  (later no AC, out they came, reset blue wire and the AC popped on).  NEST dropped the internet connection within a month and no amount of tech support reconnected or electrician skill could get it to set.  This meant I could not easily control the schedule (it did not know the time) and would not respond to touch control, or know the outside temp.  It is under warranty and I am returning it for a new devise.  I really like the light comes on when you approach, displays the date, time of day, indoor/outdoor temp (if connected to the internet), and was so easy to program.

I am very frustrated with this thermostat. Not effective in between seasons when switching between air and heat. HATE that can't see current temperature to assess. House has mainly been hot when air should turn on. I do NOT understand a thermostat that doesn't display current temp?  What knucklehead man thinks that's OK?  Rethinking my decision and may consider another thermostat. 10/23/15 - I'm still getting used to this, installed it 2 weeks ago.  I am a single female in home that is 14 years old, and installation was easy.  I do not like that you can't see the current temperature, that just doesn't make sense to me.  You can only see the ""target"" temperature settings and you can see the outside temperature, but not inside???.  Doesn't really allow me to gauge the accuracy of the settings.  I have turned off the ""Away"" setting.  Just doesn't work for me daily.  I work from home and am home much of the time, but my elderly mother also lives with me and she is always home.  The thermostat was switching to ""Away"" and changing the temperatures, without rhyme or reason, and we would get hot and cold.  I have now set a ""schedule"" and will see how that works for awhile.  I really installed this as I wanted a thermostat that did a better job of switching to heat or cooling, during season changes.  This one seems to do that, I just need to get the target temperature settings right.  I do like being able to control from phone or iPad, and I can also control if traveling for business and my mother says she is uncomfortable (she never can figure out any thermostat), so that really is a nice feature.  I also have DropCam/Nest video cameras, and is nice having those integrated with the app.  Verdict is still out, but I think this just takes some time to get adjusted correctly.",Downgrading my rating.

I decided on a wireless system because my roommate is battling cancer and I wanted something he could adjust from his bedroom. It was fairly easy to install myself, except they don’t tell you that not all the wires from the old thermostat will necessarily be needed even if there’s a spot for them. After a few errors and a chat with Nest online, I found out we did not need the “C” wire. Once it was functional there seemed to be another issue in that it t always seemed to be 5 degrees colder than what the temperature was set to be. I set it at 69 during a few 20-something nights but it seemed to not heat past 63 so I’d have to turn it up to 73/74 to get comfortable. We live in a 1200 sq ft condo so it’s not a huge place to heat and the old thermostat never had an issue keeping things running correctly. After a couple weeks researching online, I decided to make tweaks (disable the “schedule” and set everything manually) and purchase a 3 pack of room sensors. I placed one in each of the bedrooms since they are opposite sides of the condo and since doing these two things I’m coming around more and more. Temperatures have become more stable and consistent throughout and no longer requires adjusting well above the desired temp just to get comfortable.

It cycles the air much better, it senses the ambient temperature with way more accuracy than those old mercury thermostats that suddenly got triggered when you move by them.

I’ll keep it simple.  This is a nest problem.  I’ve had problems with my thermostat before google merged with nest.  Either way it’s a terrible product.  It doesn’t hold temp after the display says its set for the night. It doesn’t learn from habits.  I’ve really noticed it since being indoors during Covid.  At least 30% of reviews here and on google website are negative reviews. The customer service refuses to address the problem.  I’ve reset my device numerous times and it still doesn’t keep the correct temp.  I’ve gone thru and changed all the settings to make sure everything was correct. Still not working.  I bought this about 1 year ago.  Didn’t install for a few months due to remodeling.  It’s good for a conservation piece when you have company.  Show everyone how you can control it and how it learns from your habits.  They are definitely selling a product that’s defective.  Time to move on to another brand.

This thing has saved me so much money. My power bills are consistently never over $60 even after running the AC while I'm home in the evenings and overnight. If your schedule is pretty regular, I would recommend using an app/site called IFTTT. It uses my phones GPS to set the NEST automatically. As soon as I leave for work, the Nest shuts off, and stays off I leave work to come home. This saves so much energy! I think they have similar functionality bit into they app, but I like the fact that as soon as I leave work, the AC kicks on. It's nice to walk into a cool house, or at least get it started by the time I arrive. I'll be replacing my smoke detectors with Nest Protects as well. Don't forget to check for rebates! AEP here in Ohio gave me a check for $75 for replacing my old thermostat for the Nest. I do have one complaint. I really wish they would add Apple HomeKit support. I know this is an Apple Vs Google issue, but they should think of their customers. I have had an iPhone since they were first released. I'm not going to switch to Android because my iPhone doesn't support my thermostat.

I have no problem with my current programmable thermostat, but I wanted one that connects to the internet to check and change the temperature when I'm not home. I have a very consistent schedule so I know exactly what I want it to do and when. I set up a schedule, but turned on eco mode as well. Heads up, when you turn on Eco mode, it seems to ignore your schedule - I got home from work and the house was freezing. Over Christmas, I set it to away so Eco mode kicked in. This time, it seemed to run my schedule. Three days into my vacation, when I thought my house would be about 55 degrees, I checked and it was 72. For some reason, it was running the normal schedule. UNLIKE MOST THERMOSTATS, THERE IS NO HOLD/VACATION MODE. Eco mode/away mode is not the same thing. So, during my vacation, I ended up shutting off every ""smart"" setting and deleting my schedule to make it keep a constant temperature. When I came home, I left all the settings off but had to remake my schedule (this is not difficult). In conclusion, I feel this thermostat might be great if you're a complete idiot and want minimum control over your houses temperature. Technological improvements aren't always necessary or even better. If I were to buy something different, my experiences with honeywell therms. have been great and I see they make several wifi ones with less features, which is exactly the way I think it should be.

I learned you can set a schedule with the Nest, but then the price was a hangup. Like several other things I finally broke down and shelled out the money and wish I had done it sooner.

I like the features of it and the minimalist design. We've had it over a week now and it seems to be settling into a routine that works well for us as well as reducing the daily run time of the AC unit. I didn't like the way it jumped around between temperature settings at first but those peaks seem to be smoothing out. It still does some weird stuff but I have the app on the wife's and my phone and I'm not sure if the settings on the apps are conflicting. So far so good though. The initial setup process and descriptions of some of the functions could be a little better. Edit: 11-16-18. We've been using this thermostat for 6 months now and I really like it. In the early fall the temp varies enough here day to day that we may require heat at night and AC during the day and I like the feature of being able to set dual temp thresholds so I don't have to remember to switch it from heat to cool on the same day. In the last couple days the wifi chip in the thermostat failed and it lost wifi connectivity. After trying the troubleshooting on the website and emailing a trouble report I waited a couple days and finally called customer service. Customer service was great and friendly and immediately upon telling them of the problem offered to send me a new thermostat 2 day express to replace the faulty unit.

It was way ahead of the competition, but I think over time they somewhat stagnated, probably because of the Google acquisition.  But my real beef is not with the product but the online services and product positioning.  So, I upgraded both of my old Nests to the Gen 3 product.  In Nest's mind every person is a thermostat, and upgrading is not a valid use case.  There is no upgrade/migration path in your online account.  Every 'stat is treated like a new one.  There is no ability to migrate your scheduling for winter (heat) or summer (cooling) across a new thermostat.  That can impose a lot of time on someone to re-create.  There is no ability to replicate settings across multiple thermostats.  I had to set up the new ones from scratch and then delete the ones I replaced from the account.  There were also a lot of wrinkles.  I had to remember to zap the firmware's of the old ones first.  I didn't in one case...  I actually had to rewire it up to zap it.  Would be great if there was a document that described some steps for a smooth upgrade.  Right now Nest is more concerned about the ""new"" customer experience, with bedazzling boxes, and QR codes.  I get that more people have not seen the nest than have, but it seems like every box is positioned as a new home/customer and we all get shoe-horned into that process.  Look, the product has been out for a good 5 years or so now.  It's 2017, and the business model and experience hasn't been upgraded.","Great product, online site needs some modernization."

Same average daily temps. Power usage was around $80 less. After around 10 months of use, my equal pay payment is dropping by $30 a month. That pretty much pays for this thing in a month since I got it on a Cyber Monday sale last year, and my power and gas companies both gave me $50 rebates. If you don't have one yet, you probably should. The ability for it to turn off your compressor early and use the cold AC  condenser to continue cooling has to save a bunch. For heating, the saving may be more in my mind, and the use of Ecco mode.

I think there were three reasons we didn't like the Nest: 1) we're control freaks, and this thing just has a mind of its own; 2) the ""maintenance band"" is too large (more on that below); and 3) the ""away from home"" settings do not allow you to keep the house below 76 (or at least we couldn't figure out how to do that). The maintenance band is the range of temperatures around your ""target"" set temperature. In a larger home like ours, it simply takes too long for the Nest to turn on. It allows the temperature to go a couple of degrees above the set temp when the AC is on, and then it runs until the temp is well below the set temp before turning off. This meant that the AC would run for long stretches of time, and the changes in temp were very noticeable. Finally, we didn't like coming home to a warm an stuffy house in the summer. Perhaps if we had given the Nest longer to adjust to our preferences, this would have improved, but my review of info online indicated that this likely would not change significantly over time.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jul 2019,Raiven Ellinwood,"I love how easy it was to install, even with an house that's over 20 years old all you had to do is follow the amazingly simple instructions, they include a photo of which wire goes in what port, and all you had to do is basically snap it in. So no twisting wires! After that the nest will sense the wires you installed. I've had no problems with any type of delay in turning the AC up or down and the phone app is extremely useful (especially if you forget to raise the temperature before you leave the house like I do) if you dont like doing manual temperature changes, it will learn your day to day pattern and do it itself. However if you have a very random schedule like I do, you'd probably turn it off which defeats the purpose of the ""learning"" aspect in my opinion. The one thing I wish I could change is the lowest temperature setting for ecomode, the minimum is 75, which is great for most people but I have an elder dog that doesn't fair well in that temperature. Plus any warmer than that can cause mold growth (especially in high humidity climaxes like I live in) so I like to air on the safer side. But that's definitely not a deal breaker and probably just unrealistic on my part for an ecomode. Other than that I throughly enjoy getting the energy reports from the nest and the different ""screen savers"" like the clock, current weather reports, or just the current temp in the house Plus you can make it where it displays any of these whenever you walk by or approach it, and it does it amazingly well. It also has a safety feature that if you turn the air on and off without delay it will have a timer (usually about 2 minutes) before itll send the signal for your ac to kick back on. If that's a good thing or not is up to you. I also recommend buying a different back plate off of amazon because the white one is comes with is...not great and takes away from the high quality feeling the nest has.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2018,Shadywood,"Just installed the unit 4 days ago.  I am optimistic that I will be completely satisfied once I address one installation issue. This unit upgrades and replaces a Honeywell programmable thermostat.  The Honeywell was essentially a dry contact device with no internal logic.  The Honeywell unit also only had a hysteresis of only 1 degree Fahrenheit.  The narrow hysteresis design is not as energy efficient as the wider hysteresis of the Nest, approximately 3 degrees Fahrenheit. The installation issue that I have encountered originates with the 2-wire connection to my 30+ year-old ThermoPride furnace.  The Nest will allow connection to a 2-wire system (Rh & W1 for heating), but it has operational limitations.  The Nest is more than a dry contact for the furnace operation --  it has a processor for its ""smart"" operation.  The processor has a battery that requires a power source to recharge the battery for continuous operation.  On a 2-wire installation the only source of power comes from that furnace circuit that was never designed to provide power for recharging a battery.  The Nest makes a best effort to share some of the power from the furnace when there is demand for heat, but the available power is not sufficient to maintain the battery power during a long heat cycle.  The result is short cycling of the heating operation.  The Nest will interrupt the furnace operation in order to take 2½ minutes of ""battery recharge time"".  The Nest clearly tells you that it has to do this when you are monitoring the ""power"" function in the technical info screen on the Nest.  After the 2½ minutes have passed, the furnace is returned to its heating operation.  The Nest will interrupt furnace operation multiple times during a long heating cycle (i.e., morning setpoint increase after night time Eco operation). The solution to this issue is to install a 24V power source with connections at the common and ground terminals on the Nest.  The 24V power source will maintain the Nest battery independent of the furnace.  I have ordered a basic 24V power source that will delivered tomorrow.  It will be a simple installation for me.  I will update this comment after I have installed the power source and verified that the fix worked.  I am confident that the fix do the trick. Nothing that I have found in the Nest literature indicates that the 2-wire type of connection will lead to possible short cycling.  This is potential problem should be mentioned upfront.  It appears that Nest would like to promote installations by Nest Pros.  If you do go this route of employing a Nest Pro for the installation (at $99 minimum cost), I assume that they would be prepared to install a 24V power source if necessary.  The power source would be an additional cost for parts and possibly labor Update: The 24VAC power supply fully solved my issue. The Nest is working perfectly now.",Opitimistic that I will be completely satisfied after I address the 2-wire limitation

Hughes,"I have several Nest products in my home and have had nothing but problems with most of them.  While they work ok once you can get them installed, it still feels to me like technology isn't quite ready for these smart products.  Purchased the NEST Thermostat after hearing several friends have one and with moderate levels of success.  I desire to have a smart thermostat, but I'm beginning to believe NEST is not the right option.  Got my NEST in the mail and started the installation process, including removing my old thermostat.  This is where NEST went wrong.  Did not realize it would need to be charged.  After removing my old one and installing the NEST, I quickly discovered the battery was completely dead.  I called NEST and they recommended I charge it for 30-45 min to get a small charge going before trying it again.  Ok, annoying as nowhere in the pamphlet or in the app did it indicate a charge might be needed.  I would have kept my old unit in to keep the AC on and just plugged it in for a nice full charge for a few hours first.  After removing my old one, turning off my AC for 40 min (I'm in Texas so its still 100 degrees), I popped it back on again.  Still didn't work.  Plugged it back in to a different USB outlet just to make sure it got a good charge and left it there for 2.5 hours.  The first agent I called said a good charge of 3 hours would fully take care of it.  After the 2.5 hours, I popped it back in again.  Got to the first couple of screens to allow me to begin the setup and the screen goes black.  I called again and the agent said its probably a lemon.  They are expediting a new one to me.  Great except in the process of taking out my old unit, we basically had to destroy the thing to get it off so it can no longer be used.  The wires are all fine so its not that.  So, now its 100 degrees out, I have no AC and hopefully the new unit arrives in a couple of days.  This is a huge hassle and I had a similar experience with my Nest Secure.  We finally got my Secure working after probably a dozen calls and an executive escalation to get the issue resolved.  This will be my last Nest product and I would not recommend them.  They seem to work ok, once you can get it in and working.  Its just a huge hassle to get to that point.  There are likely better options in the marketplace and if I use any other smart products, I'll go with something other than NEST and just use different apps.",Typical of Nest - only partially works or is confusing

Also, these things fail on cold nights. I think its hacking but cannot prove it. I has all the bells and whistles you’ll turn off anyway.

A bit pricey, but great. I noticed when I moved into my new house that the old thermostat had a mind of it's own. I would turn the heat down before bed only to be woken up in a night sweat at 3AM. Turns out my old thermostat loved to randomly increase my temp to 76! Searching the model of my old thermostat I couldn't find any explanation as to why this was happening. I assume it was just old age. So I decided to give my thermostat an upgrade. Searching around I kept coming across a nest thermostat. I was skeptical at first because of the ridiculous price but I couldn't find any competing device that offered everything this did. So I broke down and bought one. Boy am I glad I did. This thing is so handy. Between the ability to set a temp schedule, the home away assist and the ability to manually set temp from your phone I have reduced my bill by 40%. And the first month I installed it and saw the 40% reduction, it was on the coldest month of the year (Feb). That is nuts! By my calculations this thing will pay for it self by end of spring. However I still think this device is way over priced. Let's be real here, it's a thermostat with a few bells and whistles. It's not a smart phone or a rumba. If I could do it over I think I would try to get a used one instead. As far as installation goes, it's pretty simple. Just follow the instructions. First shut down power, then pull the current thermostat out (with wires attached), label the wires with what ports they connect to, take out the current thermostat, add nest mount, wire in nest using the labels as a guide, turn power back on.

I compared it with competitors, found out that ecobee does not really support a connection for old thermostats which have 2 wires only (no common wire). I have an old heater and it only has 2 wires, W and R. There are many confusing answers on the internet in regards to whether this product would work with 2 wires, (when there is no Common wire). My experience proves that it does work with 2 wires only, I connected them as Rc and W1. Initially nothing worked, and thermostat was complaining that there is no power on the wire, this was because on my old thermostat the wires were mislabeled, i.e. I ended up connecting a wire that was labeled as W, to nest's Rc and the wire labeled as R, to W1. Now when everything is connected, I am fully satisfied, the product is simple to use and I did not notice any glitches. Also I was amazed that technical support works on weekends and very prompt. Please note that technical support was not actually able to resolve my ""reversed wires"" issue, the support referenced me to a ""certified installer"".

It's easy to use and set, and has helped us track how often we actually turn the a/c on. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's saved us money as our a/c habits haven't changed, it's just made it more convenient to regulate. It has seemed warmer in the house since switching to this thermostat, and I'm not sure if that's a result of previous inaccuracy or if it just cools the house over a slower, more extended period of time to reduce cost. Previously (last summer), we could keep the thermostat at 74 and sleep comfortably throughout the night, but lately we've been having to turn it down to 70 or 69 to keep things cool. I've also been home a few times but the thermostat registered that I was ""away"" based on my phone's location (which was also at home), so the thermostat would turn off and I wouldn't notice until things started getting uncomfortably hot. Aside from that small glitch, it's worked pretty well!

It is easy to use and reliable.  For single stage systems it is great. It’s not great for multistage heating or cooling systems.  First it is quite dumb.  It will only turn on the second stage AC once the temperature gets 3 degrees more than the set point.  This is not adjustable.  Therefore you are sweltering before the second stage kicks in.  For heat you can only turn on emergency heat at the thermostat not via the app.  Again it’s dumb. Other cheaper thermostats like Honeywell handle multistage systems better and are cheaper.

Take photos of your existing thermostat wiring before removing the thermostat you are replacing. Cut the power and remove your old unit. Mount the backplate of the Nest to the wall and then place the wires to the corresponding locations. The wires attach with a push of the tab and inserting the wire. If you have a jumper on your old unit between R and RC, you will no longer need that as the Nest has an internal jumper that it applies if it recognizes it needs it.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2017,Rachel K.,"It's been installed in our house for about a week but so far I love it. The install itself was very easy, and Nest has made checking whether or not the wiring in your house is compatible incredibly easy as well - so no issues there. We upgraded from a thermostat that had a slider to select the temperature and it didn't seem very accurate. With this, there is no confusion at all. The interface is super sleek and minimal, and I love that it programs itself to the temps that you like as time goes on. My mother who lives with us is known to sneak by and turn the temperature down so everyone is freezing without knowing why. Well ha! Now I can change it back on my phone! Although with this she hasn't touched it once because she sees the little leaf on the thermostat and is settled by seeing it saving money. Definitely recommend, picked it up for an insane price on Black Friday, but it's worth paying the full listed price!",Worth the investment - who knew buying a thermostat would be exciting!
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Sep 2016,Drjb74,"While the Nest in expensive, I think it is definitely worth the cost. It has a very sleek appearance (looks modern, minimalist, high-end).  Installation was extremely easy.  The app asks you to tell it what wires you have from your current thermostat, and then it tells you exactly where you attach them on the Nest.  There is no guessing at all. The auto-program feature is great.  You tell the Nest what temperatures are the minimum and maximum you want, and it begins learning from there.  I have found that the Nest has done a great job adjusting the temperature to fit our desires. The auto-away feature is great.  With our old thermostat, I had to set a temperature and time when I wanted the thermostat to change.  If our schedules were different that day, we would have to go and manually change the thermostat.  With the Nest, it automatically senses when no one is home, and goes into an energy saving mode based on the min/max temp you set. I like being able to change and/or monitor the temperature from my phone as well.  While it isn't the most used app on my phone, it is nice to be able to adjust temperatures if I need. I have other smart devices and this is connected to them.  It will turn on when I walk in the house at the end of the day.  I can also program it to begin warming or cooling the house before I get home.  I have it connected to an Amazon Echo, and also with an August Smart Lock and Nest Protect CO2/Smoke Detectors. When I leave the house, the August Smart Lock communicates and sets the Nest to ""Away"" Mode.  When I return home and unlock the door, the Nest then turns back on (that is the way mine is set up).  I have seen a decrease in the utility bills as well.  Only had the Nest for a couple months, so hard to say if that is driven solely by the Nest or by the weather itself.  Either way, I will be interested to see how it pans out over the course of a year.  I would guess that it will have paid for itself in the next 1-3 years in energy savings. Great product - expensive, but definitely worth it.","Easy to Use, Works Very Well"

One of the main reasons I invested in it, is that it is supposed to LEARN and predict/adjust accordingly to make sure when I get home, it will be comfortable at the temperature I set it to. Well, the ENTIRE summer, it still hasn’t learned to turn on the A/C so it isn’t 85+ degrees when I get home. I get home around the same time every day, and EVERY day, my home is hot as can be. I have to wave my hand in front of the thermostat for it to kick on, and have it tell me it will go from the current 85 degrees to a comfortable 76 degrees in 2 or more hours.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2019,NYNJ,"I just received the Nest Thermostat in the mail today and installed it without experiencing any issues. I switched from an ancient Honeywell double mercury switch thermostat (see photo) and replaced it with the more nimble and operation intuitive Nest. The entire installation involved shutting off all power servicing the HVAC (make sure it is not high voltage before buying), disassembling/removing the Honeywell unit, labeling the wires with the Nest-provided adhesives, mounting the Nest plate and connector base and finally clicking the Nest Thermostat into the base. I turned the power back on at the breaker and, voila, the Nest Thermostat powered on and commenced the booting sequence. Setting up the unit by supplying it with WiFi information and data about the home and location was a breeze and easy to manipulate using the dial which feels very nice and responsive. And after 5 minutes, I was good to go and tested the system. It took about 5 minutes for warm air to begin circulating but after that, Nest Thermostat responded fairly quickly when increasing the temp. The app is also very easy to use and all functions can be controlled from your smartphone remotely or while within your home. The ""Away"" function is very useful and is what the analog Honeywell thermostat lacked which makes Nest Thermostat useful in being more energy efficient. I also like that the Away mode can be sensed (via motion detection) or switched on by pressing ""Away"" on the app when away from home -- with just one press. I have read the reviews about the scheduling function being a bit cumbersome -- I disagree. It is very easy to set the temp and time on each day. Just choose the day, click, then set the temp, click and set the time, then click ""done"". There's not much else to it. ""Farsight"" is also a nice feature as it provides real-time data about the system and the current interior/exterior temperature (you can also set it to display the set temps or vitals (outdoor/indoor/humidity, etc.). The only downside is that language support is lacking. I was hoping it would be more comprehensive as with most smart devices, but it only contains European languages at the moment. Hopefully this will change to include Asian language support. I am not an experienced electrician by any means, but have installed dimmers and switches with very little help. The Nest Thermostat is, by far, one of the easiest high-tech devices I have ever installed and I am horrified by anything that involves electrical systems and even a little static shock. I initially was advised to hire an electrician but I watched multiple videos on Nest and various YouTube install videos and it looked easy enough so I gave it a shot and it was truly a painless experience that took no more than 10 minutes. This is Day 1 with the Nest Thermostat so I will provide a more detailed update a few weeks from now and again when the temps warm up. For now, I love it and recommend this if your electrical system is compatible and if you're looking to heat up one general area of the house!",Easy Install and Setup

I almost fainted when my typical $50 bill had jumped to $850 last month.  I called the power company and they read my meter by computer and told me this month's bill would be even more, noting all of a sudden on August 2 there was a huge jump in power usage.  They told me it was either my water heater or HVAC.  This is just my small vacation condo that has been vacant since April! So I called the AC man, had him check everything- he said it was likely due to the Nest and I had him replace it with an ordinary thermostat.  Power bill is now back down to $50/month.

I am no expert but I will tell you my impressions if it is important to you to have it in both heat and cool mode. Dual mode works sort of but not like I wished, it doesn't seem to know that I wished it knew the outside temperature and would make the house a little warm or a little cold because of it. See to make it work it can't cross-over the temperatures. Not sure if this makes sense, so let me try to explain. I have to set the heat side to 68 and the cold to 71 and either the display will be orange if it is heating or blue if it is cooling. So the house is always a right around 70, but if it is cold outside I wished it would heat to 72 so it would be toasty inside, nope. Or if it is heating up outside I wished the cooling would come on sooner so that is doesn't heat up to 74 before the cooling can finally compensate and cools it down to 71. Maybe it will just get better and better as it learns, or I can switch to heat only and warm the house a little extra or to cool, but I could do that with my old thermostat, I just wanted to be lazy and never have to mess with it.

The fact that I can adjust the temperature from my Android Wear smartwatch, or phone or tablet, from anywhere is worth the price of admission. Apparently, the best temperature for sleeping is between 60-65 degree F. The nice thing about the Nest is that you can set a Heat.Cool mode where you can assign temperature thresholds. The Nest will automatically use Heat or Cool air to maintain the temperature thresholds. This use case works perfectly for me more than anything else as I want to maintain certain temperature thresholds at night when sleeping, and a different set of thresholds during the day. The Nest is perfect for this use case. The Eco features are also a nice bonus. I'm not particularly enamored by them, but I'm glad they exist and I have all of them enabled.

They followed the same installation instructions and blew 2 more fuses. I had installed it perfectly. I immediately returned the EcoBee and bought Nest and it works perfectly! I did not have to do anything strange to my furnace and I did extra research to confirm it is fully capable of recharging itself through your heating and cooling wires. I am very happy with the purchase as well as the application. It works great with my Alexa and there were not setup issues. This takes less than 15 minutes to setup. My only criticism is for folks looking for features in EcoBee - remember this is a learning thermostat. If you want to set your own schedule this application on Nest is a little clunky but that did not bother me at all since I like the learning feature.,Bought after returning EcoBee! FANTASTIC!

The profile is slimmer and the black on black color scheme is more attractive in my home than the shinier Gen 1 Nest unit it replaced. This should be a 5 star product but for the following cons: 1) Entering information, such as a complex wi-fi password, is exceptionally tedious using the rotary dial. The dial can only cycle through the alphanumeric screens in order, so you have to cycle through a bunch of unnecessary screens to switch between capital and lower case letters. A faster, easier way should be available -- like being able to go back to the previous alphabet or symbol selection. 2) The unit develops a mind of its own over time, which would be a great thing if it could be appropriately contained. But no matter what I try to do, I find my unit switching back to a cool setting of 80 sometimes without explanation. The Nest needs a simple way to set up ironclad rules for automatic temperature adjustment. It's especially hot where I live. Under no circumstances do I want the thermostat to go above, say, 77. Additionally, although the system allows for scheduling the fan to run, there doesn't appear to be a way to incorporate running the fan as part of the overall cooling settings. You have to know in advance when you want the fan to run to circulate stagnant air without actively trying to cool the home further vs when you want the system to actually cool the home.",Still not perfect.

Make sure to run the compatibility checker with the wires going to your current thermostat before purchasing.  It took an hour or so for the firmware/software to update after the thermostat was installed and initial settings were entered.  Afterwards, I used the Android App on my smartphone to set a schedule and I linked it to my Echo and Insteon apps.  Auto Scheduling was useless to me since the thermostat is in a room rarely used.  My furnace has two stage heating and the Nest thermostat can control it with an extra wire, but after reading the furnace manufacturer's website, I felt it was better to let the furnace determine for itself which stage to run.  I also came to this same conclusion for running my whole house humidifier.  The Nest Thermostat can run it, with an extra wire in the * slot, but I believe the manufacturer's humidistat with the outdoor sensor and independent blower control does the same thing and is geared specifically for my equipment.  I like that I get a daily view of the furnace on/off cycles and how many hours it runs per day on my smartphone.  I really love the ability to control the thermostat remotely via my smartphone app and through my Echos, my main reasons for getting it.  As for the energy savings, that still has to be determined.  If you're replacing a 7 day properly programmed thermostat, you'll probably see very little difference.  If you are replacing a non-programmable thermostat, then the savings could be substantial, especially if you use the ECO temperatures at night and when away from the home.",Great for Smarthome Integration and Remote Access

Installation: I've installed several thermostats before and this was probably the easiest I've ever done. Setup: Connecting to WIFI, naming the device, linking to the App, and setting up schedules were all a breeze. The only concern is that you need to know a little about your unit before you begin. You need to know ALL of its capabilities (like 2nd stage/emergency heat, etc..) You can look it up online if you find the make/model of your unit. Likes: Ability to remotely change temperature for up stairs without having to go up the stairs. Also, setup Geo-Fencing (in the Nest App) with all the smartphones in your family, it will auto-detect when you are away and reduce the cooling until you get close to home (which saves $$$) DISLIKES: Constantly battling the thermostat to ""save money"" with the green leaf and having a comfortable temperature.

This is additional security that Apple had added to make you iPhone “invisible” when you are away from your home WIFI and exposed to public WIFI signals to protect you and your data.  However, when VPN is activated (and your iPhone defaults to this automatically), it confuses your Nest app which results in the app crashing after a minute or less.  Making the app useful for only quickly changing or adjusting your Nest thermostat. I learned this design fault recently after “speaking” with a senior customer service rep (via online chat)  where I learned the only way to avoid this crash is by turning off the VPN When you are in your hone on your iPhone thereby potentially exposing your iPhone security to others if you would forget to to turn VPN capabilities back on when you leave your home!  It was very interesting that the Nest representative indicated that i was the first that contacted them about this problem and after I stated that online customer reviews state otherwise, the rep magically came up with the “VPN off” workaround.  He also stated that a team is working with Apple to address this issue, but did not offer any information when it will be resolved.

We recently bought a new house and knew we wanted to upgrade to more energy efficient and convenient devices. This makes adjusting the temperature and saving on our energy bill so easy. It uses my phone's location, and also my SimpliSafe home security systems status (home or away), to determine when to switch to eco mode, which I have set to be a certain range of temperatures. The dial and screen are easy to use. I can control it from my phone and from my Google hub Max.

Instead, they send you to a simple compatiblity url that asks which thermostat wires you have to determine fit.  This is not a proper check and they're aware of this based upon my conversations with their support team. In essence, the Nest I purchased did not only work in improperly with my HVAC unit, but it has likely been hurting my unit.  It was making harmoic buzzing sounds periodically.  I had the HVAC installer out multiple times and even the manufacturer's rep.  They all told me it was likely the NEST causing the issues because it was power stealing.  We have a 'C' wire for what it's worth.  That doesn't matter. What we found, two months later, after calls with Nest support was that our furnace, a York Affinity 9c series, was not compatible.  Nest employees have a list, which they won't share of incompatible furnaces and or AC units.  It's unacceptable they won't share this publicly before spending $200 and worse, before it might damage your HVAC unit. Trust me - HVAC professionals have a great disdain for Nest thermostats.

It has failed twice. The first time was when it was still in its 1 year warranty. It worked great for the first several months. Then suddenly one day, towards the end of summer, when AC was activated, it would turn on the heat. It was NOT a wiring problem. An A/C tech diagnosed the problem to be caused by the Nest. Luckily, we got a replacement Nest under warranty, and even got compensated for our A/C tech cost. (That was nice.) Unfortunately, now about a year or so after that incident, it has failed again with the exact same issue. Again, not a wiring problem. I double-checked it. The A/C worked fine just last week.

I was attracted to Nest's rich feature set and sharp appearance.  I am generally satisfied except as noted below. Likes: Easy to install.  Sharp appearance.  Intuitive interface.  Programmable functions.  Controllability though the Nest app. Ambivalent aspects: The Nest's schedule-learning capability will be wasted with me.  My schedule is utterly changeable to the point of near randomness.  This is due to my professional obligations.  I understood when I purchased Nest that I wouldn't fully benefit from its learning capability, and that is fine with me.  I chose to pay for a feature that can't be reasonably deployed in my environment and that's not Nest's fault.  My schedule modulates from one day to the next, one week to the next, one month to the next, and so on.  Machine learning -- pursuant to my schedule -- isn't going to happen here. What ultimately disappoints me about the thermostats is that they have no idea whether I'm home or away.  I've been home for two hours now and just noticed on the Nest app that both thermostats are engaged in ECO mode.  This mode is supposed to trigger only when one is away from home. So, while I have zero concern about never realizing the full benefits of Nest's learning capabilities, its inability to properly determine whether I'm home or away (a presumably basic function and the foundation for ECO mode) is, frankly, puzzling. I'll be keeping the thermostats and hoping that Nest comes up with a fix for their home/away non-functionality.",Falls short of its potential.

Communication with the app was great, and it cooled/heated the house properly. Then after a couple days I began to notice the system would be cooling, and turn off and right back on immediately. I timed it and noticed it did this numerous times per minute. I reached out to Nest Customer Support. They seemed great! After a 3 calls and approx 120min waiting time, they determined it was short cycling due to power sharing because of a lack of a Common Wire. They said they would send a technician out to fix this issue. I was pleasantly surprised since the unit cost $250 and it may cost that much to fix the issue via an onsite technician. They set the date. It came and went and they said the technicians are too busy and had to push out. The next date that was scheduled came and went and again was said to be because they are too busy. After a few calls I found a customer service rep that finally admitted that they DO NOT HAVE ANY NEST technicians in the area and they cannot provide the support. I am not 90+ days after purchase so I cannot return the item. I now have a $250 paperweight.

Reseated that red wire and its been great. I noticed the system wasn't running as often and the nest seemed a lot more accurate than my old thermostat.

The instructions were incredibly clear, especially with the YouTube video and I was able to change it out myself, which is a big deal since I am  not in any way an electrician.  The only negative comment that I have is that the written instructions that came with it contained wiring labels that did not match my original thermostat and because I have little experience with these things, I wasn't sure if the labels were interchangeable.  However, the YouTube video put out by Nest did match my wiring and the confusion was quickly cleared up.  The mechanism itself is extremely easy to learn how to work with, it learns very easily and being connected by internet to our phones makes the efficiency quite good.

Ultimately, the Nest won out due to aesthetics but the concerns I had from the negative reviewers here kind of haunted me. I was able to install this myself in MAYBE 5 minutes.  My 5 wires were C, G, Y, W, and R so I wasn't sure exactly where to connect them to the Nest.  I did a quick google search and came to Nest's support where you click on what wires you do have and it tells you exactly how to connect them to the Nest.  That was a neat feature. I did have one issue with connectivity but it was trying to connect via wifi to my Apple Airport (from 2007),  The nest said it was connected to my network, and it was, but it couldn't get past firewalls or something.  Anyway, I just disconnected my Apple Airport and had the Nest connect straight to my wifi router and it worked like a charm.  I've had similar issues with other things trying to connect to the Airport so I knew that it wasn't the Nest itself. Last thing - I was hoping that I could install the Nest just bare against the wall, but I couldn't.  There were still holes outside the Nest.  If I had to complain about anything it would be that the trim plate included isn't quite as nice as what I think they should include.  For this price, I feel like even a rounded piece of sheet metal that would compliment the sleekness of the Nest should be included.  I bought a metal back plate from Amazon for $25 but it's bigger than what I needed and kind of takes away from the aesthetics. The Nest has been up a week in my house and has functioned exactly as expected.  Two days after me setting the thermostat to my wake up temperature and going to bed temperature and it did it automatically.  So cool! OH!  And I almost forgot to mention...they include a cute, higher quality screwdriver to disconnect everything from your old system and connect it to your new system.

The box showed evidence of a label removed. Shrink wrap meticulously razor trimmed around removed label and damaged box area painted white. Not sure what to make of that but the product was not damaged and worked fine. Just what you would expect. Simular to an iPhone, everything just worked. The free app is simple and functional. Scheduling is fast drag and drop. Love the connection to my iPhone location. My old programmable was basically a set temperature and press hold device. Programming was too difficult to constantly change to my irregular schedule. Not sure if it will find me close to home and adjust temp automatically. We will find out. Price $218 + tax-free shipping. $100 ComEd rebate. Four stars because packing was fondled without disclosure. At the end of the day I hope to recoup $118 over the next year's heating cost. I use propane  heat and pay about $2000/ year. If it saves 6% there is my justification. I will probably never audit the savings and just assume happened.  I will settle for just coming home to a temperature adjusted house. As a traveling empty nesters we like that we have access to our home temperature from remote and that it will alert if something is wrong. My furnace went out twice last winter 2016 with my old controller (igniter then exhaust blower). I was home both times. No alerts, just a cold house.

In both cases, there was no existing connection between the old thermostat and the ""common"" power source on the furnace (the old thermostats were battery powered).  And in both cases, I lucked out because the original installation of the furnace had a wire run with several spare leads on it.  So I was able to use one of the spare leads to carry constant voltage from the furnace's common connector to the Nest.  Other than that, it's just a matter of attaching the base plate to the wall, connecting the correct wires to the tool-less slots on the base plate, and snapping on the face plate.

Overall happy with it, but recently the WIFI stopped working. After some troubleshooting, I learned that the battery voltage is ""too low"". What the? If the thing is hard wired into the wall and receiving a constant 24 volt power source, why on earth would it start disabling functionality because of battery voltage? OK So I can just pop in a new battery right? Well yes and no. I have found shady suppliers that will sell a battery on Amazon or Ebay. It requires you to disassemble the unit, replace the battery, and then reassemble it. It may not be a simple process for some users and it definitely will void your warranty. Dead battery should not disable functionality. They should have used a standardized battery like triple AAA rechargable, and they should have put a simple door on the back to make it easy to replace the batteries. This will likely end up in some people throwing away their thermostats to the landfill and replacing them.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Dec 2015,louisut,"While the Nest's core function (regulating temperature) isn't really all that different than a conventional programmable thermostat, it has two main strengths: ease-of-use and connectivity. Prior to Nest, programming a thermostat required wading through menus. With the Nest, you simply adjust the temperature manually a couple times, and it learns on its own. Its sensors help learn your schedule faster. Most thermostats only have four time slots; there are no limits with Nest. Lastly, if you want to enter a manual program, it's easy to do so online or using their app. This brings us to another strength--connectivity. If you connect the thermostat to Wi-Fi, you can do everything remotely. Forget to turn off your AC while on vacation? No problem, log in and turn it off. Want the house cool by the time you get home? Open the app and do it. Don't want to leave your warm bed to turn up the heat? No problem--do it from your phone. The one feature I feel is missing is geo-fencing. With this feature, your thermostat looks at whether your mobile device is nearby. If it isn't, your thermostat switches off/away, regardless of the programmed schedule. This can further improve your energy savings. Fortunately, there are third-party apps such as ""Coming Home"" for Android which take care of this function. It also supports IFTTT, which allows additional event-based programming. Overall, great improvements on a traditionally boring device. Also, check with your power company to see if they offer any incentives. Initially I had reservations about the price, but the subsidy made the decisions easier.","easy to program, good features, 3rd-party apps fill in the gaps"

Read an article about a software update causing issues that resemble mine, not sure if it’s that what the culprit is but I got sick of what I was reading and what it recommended (charging via usb cable for an hour) so I jumpered red and white to get our house up to temp and then wired in the previously installed programmable non “smart” thermostat, which works reliably!",Worked for a couple weeks.

I qualify for $125 in rebates just for buying and installing a smart thermostat! I even found one that was “Like New” for less than retail. Done deal. Turns out it must have been a restock because all of the original packaging was intact, even the plastic tabs on the box and the Nest unit itself. Score! It was an easy enough install. I watched the video beforehand and then I went to task on my old thermostat. I followed the instructions which were fairly easy. My only issue seemed to be that the preexisting wiring was where I was drilling the holes for the Nest. The previous thermostat’s screws were aligned horizontally while the Nest has them aligned vertically. I hope I didn’t fray anything back there. I used the back plate because I wasn’t sure I had the right paint color to touch up the white wall were my Nest is now installed. It doesn’t really bother me but if it comes to it, I’ll go hunt for the paint. So far it works great. The app is really easy to use. I can turn it on when I’m not home, which is a great feature. My dog is really grateful for that. It tells me how much usage I’ve accrued and I can schedule when to run my cooling or heating. It also has an ECO function which is a range of where I’d like my home temperature to be. I like that it tells me what temperature it is when I approach and what temperature it is outside. I’m not sure why I didn’t get one sooner but I’m glad that I did.",I can't believe I waited so long before I bought one.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2016,C. McDonald,"Very easy to install.  I had a 2nd generation Nest at my old house and bought this one for the new home.  I ended up using the included wall plate because there was a large hole in the wall from the old thermostat.  Eventually I'd like to patch it up because the Nest looks cleaner by itself. My 2nd generation had a little more resistance to turn the dial - this one turns smoother which I like. I wired in single stage heat, single cooling, and a common wire to avoid any battery charging issues.  I'll add a whole home humidifier to the * input this winter which I had at my previous house.  Nest controls the humidity flawlessly.  One thing I would like to see is some type of frost control algorithm - at my old house, when the temp was -20 F in the winter, I'd start to see frost on the windows.  Would be nice if the Nest could use the outside temperature to dynamically control the humidity.  Or just allow programming the humidistat based on outdoor temp. I turned off the learning schedule feature - my schedule was too erratic for this to be useful, so I just program a 5+2 schedule.  Big benefits I see with the Nest is Auto Away and the ability to remotely control the temperature/humidity.  Being able to see the usage history is nice as well. Great product.",Very easy to install

We had the installer put it in along with the new system. We were warned by the installer at that time that they had a low success rate with NEST. It passed the initial test. The system was installed during the summer so is was installed for a couple months before it ever needed to flip over to heat. That's when the problems started. We started getting E106 errors, indicating a problem with the wiring, but the wiring was correct. Make a long story short. The NEST monitors the Aux Heat wire for small changes in voltage - its part of its protection circuit. Most other thermostats use a standard switch/contact closure. Any over current on the wire is typically managed by a fuse on the wire that will blow if there is a short. I'm not sure what system do work correct with the NEST. The app is great. I like the learning feature. I am very disappointed that I had to return it.",Check for Compatibility - Even that may not be enough.

The thermostat went on sale and that combined with a rebate from our electrician provider prompted our actual purchase.  We did our own installation and called customer support for assistance.  Customer support was excellent, able to send us a custom set up diagram based on the color of the wires that we had. I set up a nest account and, after registering the unit with our account, programmed the thermostat operation online. We also installed the nest app on our android smartphones, associating one smartphone's location so that it could automatically revert to its away temp (preset through prigramming) when that phone leaves. If it sees activity (me walking past it) it will automatically reset back to the preprogrammed temp for that time of day wuth someone at home. Our pets do not trigger the thermostat. We can not only change the temperature using our smatphonesecure, but can also use our Amazon Echo. The display is easy to read and the unit has a simple, clean design.

I was up and running in about 5 minutes.  My only gripe is the scheduler on the app. The days of the week are down the left and the hours of the day are across the bottom.  If you want to schedule a time/temp, you just go to the day, then click on the time you want, then adjust to the temp you want it to be.  Seems easy enough, however, you have to add every single time you want to change the temp, and the hours are in 2 hour increments, so if you want to have the temp go down at 10:30, it's almost impossible to get the right time.  I usually settle for something close.  I've only had it for a little over a week, so I really can't tell yet if I've saved anything on utilities, but by looking at my usage (usually less than 2 hours each day and I live in Wisconsin), I think I may be pleasantly surprised.",This was so easy to install

My builder refused to install it so I had to pull out a brand new thermostat and install this myself (easy to do).  I've had two furnace problems and the first thing the installer does is blame the thermostat.  Both times it turned out NOT to be the Nest Thermostat.  The professional folks report that they have nothing but trouble with Nest, but it has always worked great for me.  So, be prepared for a fight whenever you report an HVAC problem.  The only other annoyance is that I cannot set the time limit for motion sensing before it goes to ECO mode.  If I'm in my office for long enough and don't walk down the hallway by the thermostat, it assumes that I've left the house and it shuts down the heat.  I can't find anyway to require more time before it does that.  One can control the ECO temp settings (just a little cooler or warmer) and, of course, you can turn off ECO mode; but then you miss the advantage of having the unit reduce heating and cooling bills when you are away.",Works great with a couple of odd annoyances.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 May 2017,Bryan Stevenson,"First I would like to say that if you are at all considering buying a Nest thermostat and are having any doubts, be it price, ease of use, installation, etc, go ahead and do it and be sure to check with your local energy providers for any special offers or rebates.  I state such because my only regret is not getting one a lot sooner.  Plus you'll want to make sure you existing system is compatible with the thermostat which they provide a guide on their website for checking this as well. Installing the Nest thermostat was very easy with the instructions(Including a recommended instructional video) that step you through the process of installation and it takes about 20 minutes to complete the installation and setup and you're up and running. Operation is straightforward with the added convenience or being able to control the thermostat via an app on your phone or tablet or even through voice commands though the in home assistants be it google home or amazon's own alexa.  The information available make it clear and concise and overall the way the thermostat operates is more sensible than simply running on timers like older thermostats might do.  This results in a more consistent temperature in the home and energy savings from the heating/cooling units or the fans not running unnecessarily even when I do set the thermostat for what I would expect to be an uncomfortable temperature with an older thermostat it is actually consistent and pleasant.  This takes some getting used to but once you get things setup how you like it's wonderful The application and the thermostat show a decent amount of useful information and the far-sight feature is nice as it  can quickly show you the state of the thermostat  as you approach it and other useful information at a glance. and although the controls on the thermostat itself are a little kludgy they are still easy to use and well thought out. Subjectively I think that the unit is also aesthetically pleasing even though I had to use the provided back-plate for installation but I understand that others could/would find contention with such and it would be nice if there were options for those individuals as well to better fit their decor In summary the nest thermostat is a great product that is easy to use from installation to integrating into your every day life.  It's best trick is that it  can make you forget its there because it  learns from what you teach it and adjusts accordingly.",Great product that speaks for itself

I purchased two of these and they are great when you do not work from home and it remains empty while you are away, or don’t care about humidity building up in your house. This thing is beyond TERRIBLE and you would think for this price point that you would be able to have manual control without setting a schedule, without sharing your whereabout with google, and be able to stop it from TURNING OFF!!. The two main issues is with the AWAY mode and the ECO temperatures. If you don’t want to share your phone location with nest (google) or a family member is home without the nest app then it has to rely on its motion sensors to determine if you are home. We placed the motion sensors in the hallways where are bedrooms are, so we don’t trigger the motion sensors while in our home office which puts the thermostat in AWAY mode. There is NO WAY to disable it from going into AWAY mode! Once in AWAY mode, you can have it use ECO temperatures, but guess what?! I can’t set my temperature to be anything below 76 when I am in “AWAY” mode. This product is a complete joke, I loved it until COVID happened and have to work from home. Google/NEST, please allow complete manual control by allowing us to disable AWAY mode and allow us to set the ECO temperatures when we are AWAY to cool at any temperature we want instead of your arbitrary lower limit of 76F.",Do not buy if you work from home!

Also, I've read that you should be able to say, ""Alexa, I'm cold,"" or ""Alexa, turn up the heat,"" and the Nest would get set up two degrees. That has never worked for me.

This is my first winter with Nest and I came home to find that the thermostat had shut itself off. After reviewing the history logs, I discovered that the previous day showed an entry stating ""Thermostat switched off by Auto-Schedule."" (see screenshot.) According to Nest, this situation should be impossible, as Auto-Schedule isn't able to turn off the Thermostat. Furthermore, the Auto-Schedule function had already been disabled long ago, as I prefer to have heat on a simple and predictable schedule. Nest customer support acknowledged that this is a software defect, however they had no insights into the conditions that caused this defect to occur and expressed no concern with the damage that would be caused by turning off the heat during a week with temperatures in the single digits Fahrenheit. Nest's proposed solution was to offer to ship a new Thermostat, which would be running the same software containing the Auto-Schedule defect. A search on the net shows that Nest was aware of other reports of this issue nearly a year ago, yet it appears they have never addressed it. Nest declined to issue a refund, so I am instead left to either roll the dice and hope my house isn't damaged by lack of heat, or throw them out and pay for a reliable replacement.

I did a YouTube search and found post for the same issue (W5), this is where it loses the ability to find a WiFi network. After about 2 days I was contacted by email saying they where going to replace the unit but wanted me to send my unit back first. My thermostat was still working at the time just not able to connect to WiFi. It took another 2 days before the support through Facebook (oh yea you have to reach out to the Customer service through social media but any action happens from email). Then was told yes they could send me a new unit prior to receiving mine back just had to place funds on hold, ok. While waiting for email 3 or 4 days the thermostat stopped working. I contacted customer support serve time last ask for them to please send email also asking to speak to a supervisor and got nothing but the run around. Over a week later I received the email for the new until (by the time I receive it it will be two weeks), I had to go out a purchase a new unit since now the Nest is not working at all and still have not heard from a supervisor. Great product when it work but customer support is very much lacking so be aware if you start having issues or if you purchase this product keep your old/buy a cheap backup.",Didn’t last long/customer service very disappointing

The installation was very easy too. My apartment has 2 wire system and it works perfectly. I was a bit worried that I was missing C wire but everything turned out just fine. Alexa integration works too. You can tell Alexa to set temperature and eco mode. Just note that if you enable eco mode Alexa can't turn it off. Integration with Alexa could be much better still. You cant access nest properties when creating a routine. For example if you want your smart lights to turn red when it's hot or blue when it's cold. Just an example.,Integration with Alexa works but could be better.

It was cute and I was able to set a schedule on my phone.  I could check in on the temperature while away to verify furnace was working and have the home heated upon returning from a tropical trip to frigid minnesota winter. Unfortunately it quit working after 3 years. It happened to be one of the first cold spells of the year and we now have a baby. Since our thermostat wasn’t very old we thought something was wrong with furnace. The repair man wasn’t able to get to out house until after 11pm and found the nest to be the culprit. After complaining to the company, they did send a new base even though the warranty was up. Come to find out the in laws had gotten one and it only lasted a year or so.

Installed a new Trane outdoor AC unit and it started occasionally making really loud noises when the compressor turns on.  Turning off the unit and back on always fixes it.  Had my AC guy come out on multiple occasions and found nothing wrong with the unit.  He contacted Trane and they said that it is the Nest that causes this issue as it sometimes tries to run the outdoor unit fan without the compressor causing the issue.  The recommended fix is to go with a better thermostat. I also could never get the thing to learn my cooling/heating habits.  The “learning” part is pretty much a useless feature.  The best part was being able to control the temp with my phone and remotely.  That part worked like a charm. My recommendation is to go with another brand.,Slamming Compressor loud noise due to Nest

I really was looking to get a Nest as I've been reading about them since the first generation release.  Like any tech, I always approach with not going first generation so I figured I'd wait.  Plus, I did need a house for it! It's been great from the start.  Our HVAC installer said once it was connected to the heater and central AC units, it recognized both instantly.  They are Trane units for those that might be curious.  It's only been a week and the Nest has already started picking up our habits and automatically adjusting the temperature of the house. One side note, one beneficial thing for me was that it didn't need a WiFi connection right away for set-up.  Our HVAC was going to be finished installation before we had internet services in our new house, but thankfully that was not an issue.  Once WiFi was available, the set-up was easy and it's great controlling the Nest via my phone.  Hopefully I'll be able update soon about the energy savings.",Nest in a New House

The differences are amazing, and the 3rd generation has exceeded my expectations. I will eventually have a third thermostat as well, and I would not hesitate to purchase another Nest. This thermostat, I'm using it on an HVAC unit that has dual stage cooling. The thermostat automatically senses if the cooling is not keeping up on stage 1, and will turn on stage 2 as needed. It works pretty good in dual stage mode. Another great feature is the new Farsight option. At first I didn't like it because it showed the setpoint, but Nest updated it to give the option of showing some other data, namely the current temperature. It's so much nicer to see the current temp in huge numbers than seeing the setpoint. I know what the setpoint is, so I'm glad they are telling me something I don't know; current temp.

You can control it with your phone or Amazon Echo. Highly recommended. I had an issue with this Nest thermostat, you have to be aware of the power stealing or power sharing or power robbing situation depending who you ask. The problem is that the Nest thermostat doesn't use batteries and is charged by taking ""a little energy from the boiler"". In my situation I have a System 2000 oil boiler and every time the Nest thermostat needed to recharge it would turn the boiler on, so now, in the summer the boiler sent heat to the rooms even though the rooms were quite warm. I googled it, read about the power sharing issue and  called Nest who suggested some changes in the wire connection but nothing helped. The System 2000 web page has a pdf document about this problem. I called Nest and they said to call my HVAC company. Nest suggested I put a C wire but the C wire is not what System 2000 recommends and is a little more difficult to install. The recommendation by System 2000 was to install an isolation relay which the HVAC company did and now the thermostat works perfect. I give 5 stars to Nest because after discussing the situation they issued a check for my HVAC expenses that were $360. I talked few times with Dominic who is great!!! He's very helpful, cared about the situation and followed up with e-mails. My only suggestions for Nest to improve is to decrease the wait time when calling the customer support (sometimes was about one hour on hold), and also to mention about the possibility of the power sharing issue in the Nest web page. I recommend the product and I will buy more thermostats now that I know how to solve any power sharing issues.",Easy to install

I can use it to not only heat and cool my home, but prepare my home for me before I come home. With integration into ADT, Automatic, IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, and Google Android I can monitor my home and adjust temperatures for different times of the day. For example, Automatic can tell Nest that I'm coming home from work. Nest can then start cooling my home for me and get it to the right temperature before I get there. With Amazon Alexa I can voice control my thermostat. When I set my home to away with ADT security it can automatically set Nest to away. Nest can also tell when I'm not home by looking for motion from itself and the various Nest Protects I have available. When I'm not home, Nest can set itself into away mode, saving energy costs. Finally Nest integrates with my Android phone to auto detect when I'm home or not. Nest may cost more than others, but it will pay for itself with energy savings.",Awesome smart home thermostat

I wouldn’t recommend this one. Regardless of what I ask it to do and what temperature I set it at, the nest does it’s own thing. I find my house at ridiculous temperatures, perhaps trying to save me money, but that’s not what is my intent. I want to be able to just control the thermostat from my phone. It truly has a mind of its own. I also, there are icons on the nest that I’m uncertain what they are without searching them on the internet. And even then, I can’t control that function. Further, I bought the sensors to try to mitigate the control, thinking I’d be able to control my baby’s room. That was not the case. One room would be freezing and others were blazing hot. Not event really sure what the point of the sensors are, unless I had a super fancy HVAC unit that differentiated air flow to specific rooms. I do not have such an air conditioner unit, nor do I think those are common or standard. Lastly,  there is TERRIBLE customer service. They literally have no phone number. I was put on a text chat with clearly a robot who could not answer my questions. If you buy this, you’re on your own, or maybe web searches.

They asked me a couple of questions, and then asked for charge card information to transfer me to an A/C “expert” at Justanswer.com. I was assured that there would be a onetime $1.00 “fully refundable” charge for this service. I was connected to Justanswer san francica. As soon as I was connected to Justanswer I was told that there would be a $5 “Non refundable” charge. (What happened to the $1.00) The first gentleman that I spoke with disconnected me as soon as I quested the unexpected charge. The next gentleman from Justanswer (Geztech)  worked with me for some time. Including having me completely remove my nest thermostat and replace it with my old twice. When I connected the old thermostat, it heated heated just fine. Geztech Tech told me that it must be a broken “White Wire “ between my Thermostat and my A/H???? If in fact the wire is broken, how can the broken wire work with my old thermostat???? The Nest phone help desk is understandable closed. I messaged them as instructed, and have heard nothing back from Nest support I went on line to the Nest forms, and found over three hundred Nest customers with the same issue. I have already been charged $5 that I never agreed to on my card! I will be refusing that charge, and ANY charge from  JustAnswer as none of Their people where able to resolve the issue.

Turns out this is a known issue with the Nest if you don't have the blue common wire running to the unit, which it needs to charge.  I wouldn't take issue with this except that their website said the nest was fully compatible with my wiring which did not include the common wire.

After install worked great for a couple days then it started to sort of short cycle our furnace. I can trick the thermostat into keeping the furnace on every so often but can’t figure out why it’s shutting it off before desired temp and giving no error codes. Google customer service basically tells us it’s our furnace but works fine with other thermostat and was serviced a couple months ago. We missed our return window now since it’s only a month. There was an issue similar to this on older models/software but was under the impression it was fixed apparently not. We are out around $250 (sensor was also purchased) and selling to someone else doesn’t seem like a good option since it seems to be hit or miss on what systems it works right with.,Not a smart thermostat for you.
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2015,Tembrock,"I did spend quite a bit of time on the phone with a tech (on a hot day, don't do that to yourself people) but I'm only pointing that out to say that, although I am fairly handy and savvy with DIY projects I DID need some help with the wiring.  This took some time but I have to say the installation help was SO helpful. I think it was about 50 mins in all with me trying things, sending photos and running back and forth to shut the breaker off.  Also, the tech MADE SURE that I double checked my documentation to see if I had a two phase unit (I believe that was the term) and indeed it appeared I did.  We made one more wiring change and bingo, off to the races. TIP: Take a photo of your existing wiring BEFORE you take it apart.  This would have saved a lot of time.  Also, find your documentation for your a/c unit so you can make sure you're wiring it correctly for the kind of unit you have. In terms of use it couldn't be easier.  Turn one way or the other.  We actually were using more A/C for a while because it was just so easy to dial it down and leave it there.  Later we moderated using the app to bring all the ""learned"" preferences up by two degrees so we were not running the bill up so high.  Lesson learned.  The app makes it extremely easy to adjust the unit remotely from anywhere you have an internet connection. The rest of the non-wiring related set up was super easy . One last installation note. If you find the controls (dial wheel) is not pushing in easily for the ""select"" function, be patient and go back and check the mounting screws.  Try tightening them, adjusting them until the act of pushing in the dial to ""select"" feels effortless.  If it's not mounted snug (as it was for me) it did NOT work so well.  In fact I wasn't sure it was working at all.  It's a very subtle click that depends on it being firmy/flushly mounted.",We actually were using more A/C for a while because it was just so easy to dial it down and leave it there

Although I was able to get them to connect to the internet they would not link to the nest app, I worked on this issue for an hour on each unit, and still had no link. The thermostats are cool looking, and I like the digital display, but for the money, it should connect to the app without issue. I reset the device multiple times, and checked the wiring, ran the connection tests, connected to the internet, received my link code, and each time it tried but would not link.

It has a plethora of settings from auto temperature control based on your habits, and then manual mode.  The customer service is stellar, I brought up some of the finicky voice command features early on (originally you couldn't call the nest an A/C to Alexa, but they fixed that) and they fixed it soon enough.

As you can see by the 5-star rating, I am very impressed and pleased with this purchase. Installation was simple (hints: take your time, shoot a pic of your existing thermostat's wiring scheme, cut back copper wires to fresh wire, read the directions), and it worked right out of the box. My work schedule in the summer is insane, so my Nest on automatic is a little scizoid, but it's so easy to manage from the app that I rarely allow the auto-set features to assert themselves. In fact, what I like best is the ability to control the temp remotely. Kids heading over to hide from the heat while I'm away at work? No problem. Heading home from work and want it cool by the time I get there? No problem.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Feb 2019,Matt P,"Now that my teething problems have been sorted, I find this overall to be a great product. I live in the Northeast, in an 80-year-old house with plaster walls (without insulation). I use this thermostat for heat only with a ""traditional"" oil fired boiler with radiators, 2 zones. If you use Nest's online tool by which you determine if the product is appropriate for your house, you will find that it supposedly can replace an old-fashioned Honeywell, 2-wire (Red/White) thermostat. What I discovered however was that if connected using just those 2 wires, the amount of power required by this thermostat proved to be too much.  I don't know how exactly in that circumstance this thermostat draws power but after some research and experimentation what I realized was that in order for these thermostats to work the way they are intended, they also need an uninterrupted power source via the ""Common"" wire. Without the common wire connected, the thermostats were intermittent in their ability to connect to Wi-Fi and would also draw down their battery to the point where I would have to disconnect the thermostat from its mounting plate and plug it into a USB charger. Luckily, the cables that run from the boiler to the thermostats are newer and therefore had more than 2 conductors. I used the 3rd conductors in each cable to wire the thermostats with the aforementioned ""common"" wire and since then, my 2 Nest thermostats have been working flawlessly.  They connect to Wi-Fi without a problem, they activate when someone walks in front of them in close proximity, they don't draw down the battery, they don't forget to send a signal to the furnace calling for heat even if their program dictates that they should, and they don't need to be re-booted often.  Added info: I dictate my schedule instead of allowing the thermostats to ""learn"" and I also have the home/away feature presently turned off only because as it concerns my particular house, with plaster walls and without insulation, it takes too long for the house to warm back up if the heat only turns back on when I walk through the door.","Common wire required in older, heat-only installation."

I ordered the Nest on Black Friday around 5PM, and it was delivered that Sunday evening! Amazing shipping time Amazon! I am a first time home owner so with it comes all of the ""learn how to fix"" situations. I've never had to, nor helped install a thermostat before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I opened the box and read through everything (very well written instructions), and then looked online to watch their how-to video. It's all so simple that none of that was even necessary, but I had some time to kill away from home so I figured why not. I installed the Nest on Monday evening in about 15 minutes. This time included finding the several separate breakers that control the furnace and AC. It helped that prior to purchasing I used Nest's online compatibility widget to make sure my system would work with Nest (www.nest.com/works). I had an abnormal system so it was requested that I send in pictures to have it verified. I'm glad I did. Within a couple hours a Nest representative emailed me back with a custom wiring diagram using the images I sent to him. This made installation extremely simple. Once installed, Nest did a few updates and walked me through the setup. Connection to Wifi, inputting your location, and naming the thermostat were just a few steps. From start to finish I would say less than a half hour to remove the old thermostat, install the Nest, and then setup and test the system. Overall I am very pleased with how easy everything was, and how good this product is. It's still in its learning stage (only installed 3 days ago and it takes 7 to establish a ""schedule""), so it hasn't yet been able to REALLY shine yet. I look forward to seeing everything this thermostat can do in the near future. As a side note, on top of the great sale Amazon was running at the time ($50 gift card with purchase), our energy company also gives you a $50 rebate for installing a Wifi enabled thermostat.

Dislike - -Cannot manually run this. I understand it’s primary benefit is to “learn” our habits and automatically run and save us $$ on our electric bill, but it schedules itself oddly, doesn’t understand when we’re home (which is all the time now during Covid) and turns on and off at odd times. We need to manually intervene all the time. If I could just set a temp and hold when I want to, that would be way better. - they lie when they say it runs without a common wire. They claim it pulls power from the fan wire to charge the battery , but that is only when the fan is running. So if it’s off for more than a couple hours, the battery drains. And you have to pull it off and charge it. Also, it runs in a delayed run mode, where it turns itself off and on every 3 minutes or so, and wouldn’t effectively cool my home. Miserable.

Nest will show the set-point which is useless.  The difference between the 2nd gen and this 3rd gen is the clock.  I've set the 3rd gen to show the analog clock as the default display when I approach.  I suspect the lack of an ability to show the room temperature as a default is a patent issue with a competitor (the competing company that has a round digital thermostat you can turn like the Nest). The approach function works so much better than the prior generation.  And of course the display is larger and the device thinner (but not enough to notice).  The Nest has a de-humidification tap which is important for me. Warning - you need to electrically isolate the Nest from your air handler or furnace.

Came upstairs to look at the thermostat sighed and said this is the 4th one this week. Double checked the wiring everything was correct. Couldn't get the unit to kick on. Replaced the thermostat and it worked like a charm. Of coarse I'm outside of my return window and customer service is a joke. Got me a $250 hockey puck as the tech called it.,Junk
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2016,Hans,"I have always been a tech enthusiast and when I first heard of the Nest Thermostat I was immediately interested!  I am the type of person that does not buy 1st generation technology due to software bugs and flaws in design.  I cannot compare the previous generations so I can only write my experience with the 3rd gen. PROS: - Installation: The instructions were relatively easy to follow.  Nest provided a questionnaire to determine the wire setup which was very helpful.  Installed everything in 15-20 mins. - Setup: Easy!  Connected it to my network, updated the software, adjusted the settings and it was up and running. - Performance: It truly is a smart thermostat.  It learned our cooling habits within a week.  It strives to save us money and energy by implementing the ""energy rush hour.""  Nest and our power company works together to save energy at a specific time of the day which credits our bill $1.25 for every kilowatt-hour we save via Nest. - Build Quality: This product feels extremely premium.  Solid to the touch and it delivers satisfying smooth clicking when turning the dial. **Side note: Amazon customer service was amazing!  This product had a $50 off promotion after we purchased it.  I called and asked if we could get that deal and they obliged. CONS: -  Can't really think of anything.  If I had to nitpick, maybe advertise the ""Airwave"" function.  It was activated during ""away mode"" and I was confused when I got home thinking I forgot to set the thermostat to away.",Very satisfied with this product
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2019,Susan Madewell,Loved this thermostat for about 3 months. After power outage I had to remove to charge to get heat working again which is understandable. After charging it would not work more than two days without me having to remove and charge again. 6 months later i finally call support. They can't help me without it being charged so after telling me repeatedly that batteries can not be replaced and I needed to call back after I charged unit again we hung up. They also told me it was because I didn't have a C wire. When I ask why it worked for 3 months just fine they replied it must be having to do updates or something running it down that did not happen first 3 months. I have had an additional 4 months of charging every two days before writing this review. Nest will go in trash when i get home today and I will be replacing with a standard battery unit.,Do not buy if you do not have C Wire

If not, I'm stuck with a very expensive thermostat which does will not be useful for me in saving money on heating costs.  PS.  The other thing, is this thermostat is reconditioned and as such, does not come with a receipt which includes the serial number  on the receipt.

I read many pros and cons with the nest. Many reviews stated that the thermostat did not show actual temperature and only the temperature that the thermostat is set to. However, it does display the actual room temperature(although it is smaller and harder to see). My brother-in-law installs HVAC units and strongly recommended it. Install was extremely easy and set up was easy as well. The Nest app is simple, but does the trick. You can turn AC/Heat on through the app and it also shows a 10 day history of usage. The ""away"" setting shuts the unit down when no one is home. I haven't had any issues and have had the unit installed for over 2 months.",Worth the money

I had a professional hvac tech with 20 years experience come in and he said i needed the common wire. Nest pulses your heat/ac to get some power and that is not good for the system. Now this will work without common wire if you don't want it connected to wifi, but why are you buying a $200 thermostat if you arent connecting it to wifi?

One of them no longer connected to WiFi after about 6 months.  I ordered another one and attempted to get my money back from Nest to no avail.  The second one no longer connected to WiFi after about a year.  It looks like from other reviews that this is common - some issue with the hardware that causes it to malfunction after some period of time.  So, this time I contacted Nest directly and they said they would send me a link via email to order a replacement.  The link never worked, sent me another one and that didn't work.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2015,S. Wright,"I love my Nest Thermostat!  Super easy to install, just watch the online video (do a google search).  I had to use the wall plate, the video didn't help much, but I figured it out.  My wires didn't look as clean and straight as the one's in the video (their wires went all the way in, mine had some bare space that I could still see once I inserted), but it works fine so I assume it is OK.  To select a setting you just click the face of the thermostat (no that wasn't intuitive to me at first). I recommend you enter a schedule once you setup your account- for whatever reason might jump to 90.  Others complained in a forum, but  honestly if you put a schedule in it doesn't ever occur again.  It looks super sleek.  It shows a little green leaf when you are being energy efficient on the thermo display and on your phone, and you can even see a history of energy use.  Even though the weather is getting colder given we are now in November, both my electric and gas bill were cheaper this month! I have nest cam's as well, and it was SO EASY to link it to my account.  The nest will eventually learn when you are home/away, and you can turn the nest up/down using your phone.  The phone nest app allows you to see when your furnace is running, and it also shows you the indoor humidity as well as the outdoor temp. There is no monthly fee for this like there is to subscribe your nest cam's. BTW, you can locate the serial number after installation in the nest settings using your phone (just in case you need it for warranty or rebate).",Love my Nest!  Control at your fingertips!

I called my AC guy to help answer some questions about my AC that I wasn’t sure of.

When I checked the display it said low battery.  I had not had any problems with either unit for the 2 years and eight months I had owned them.  After extensive troubleshooting with Nest they have determined that the battery is bad.  It is out of it’s 2 year warranty period and they refuse to replace and it can not be repaired.

And I've have to say I haven't had much problems. Installation was a breeze, I did have a common wire so the battery stays charged. The update for Farsight is a excellent update, which includes the current room temperature setting. A setting option that should've been from the start. I truly believe that it has saved us a fair amount of money so far. The only problem I had was when they rolled out the Eco mode, that replaced the Away feature.

My heating system went out around Thanksgiving 2017 and I had to replace both the furnace gas valve and my 2nd generation thermostat. In general, I really like the Nest Thermostats due to their eco / auto away, and learning abilities. I was surprised how much improved the 3rd generation thermostat is compared to the 2nd generation. The 2nd generation thermostat was great but the clarity, details and information that the 3rd generation provides easily beats the 2nd generation thermostat. I still have a 2nd generation thermostat in on my first floor and it just looks old and doesn't seem to respond as quickly as the 3rd generation. Overall though, I think (for the most part), the guts of the system are the same (with few exceptions) but the face lift is excellent. Yes, I would like to  upgrade my 2nd generation but don't see myself spending the money simply to upgrade it since it's still doing a great job.

We were very excited to be able to control our thermostat from our phones and use the learning technology to automatically adjust the temp in our home. From the first moment we put in on the wall, we had a horrible experience. Its attempts at being easy to use actually introduce a lot of frustration. For example, you use the ring around the end to scroll to various options and enter letters/numbers for configuration. It tries to be 'smart' and enter the number you stop on even though you haven't pushed the button to select it, which is unexpected and results in you entering letters twice. However, it doesn't do it every time, about half the time, which makes it even more confusing. To make matters worse for us, it restarted 4 times while we were trying to enter the setup information, and lost ALL the information we had so painstakingly entered every time. Once we got it configured, we thought we were set. However, once the nest turned our furnace on, it didn't turn it back off again. It kept the furnace running for hours until our house was 7 degrees warmer than we had set it on the thermostat. Even turning it off didn't work. We had to physically remove it from the wall before the furnace would shut off. This happened 4 times. We tried everything because we really wanted it to work, but in the end had to come to terms with the fact that the nest is in fact, a POS. Don't waste your money.","Horrible interface, and doesn't work"

However, every night, the thermostat sets itself to 67 degrees in the middle of the night, causing our bedroom to get too hot. At least we can turn it back down to 62 degrees with our phones, instead of having to get out of bed and go downstairs to the thermostat.

He said the install was really easy and had it in fairly quickly.  I know nothing about wiring and thermostat installation, so I can't provide any specifics here.  We started ""teaching"" Nest our times and temps, and it seems to have picked up on the schedule within about four days.  The nice thing is, if you feel like it's chilly, just turn the dial and she'll warm up the house.  Once the Nest has been installed for a few days, you can look at the schedule it has set up, and then adjust accordingly very easily. Example, the weekday warm up is set to start at 5:00 am, which is what it had for the weekend too.  I went to the schedule, moved into the weekend, found the 5:00 am start, pushed in on the dial and had options to change, cancel and something else.  Move the dial to the new time and a new temp, press in again, and it's set.  Super easy. It has an ECO mode and will drop into eco mode if it doesn't sense that anybody is home.  So if you are out running errands for the day, the Nest may drop into this mode to save you money on hearing (or AC) when you are away.  If you have the app on your phone, you can tell it to warm or cool the house from anywhere you have cell service, assuming you have wi-fi at your home and have Nested it up! The hubby said that when he installed it, the Nest seemed to pick up on the type of furnace we had.  Kind of creepy that it knows, but again, apparently made for easy set up. If you just want to run a whole house fan without heat or AC, like when temps are mild and you want air circulation, the Nest can do that too, or so we think for now, it's 21 degrees today so the heat is on!","So far, so warm!"

My only complaint is that since our thermostat is in our dining room, it often believes that we are not home when we are (since who goes in a dining room?). I would probably install it in the foyer if I was doing it again, but I just replaced the old thermostat. I think Nest could fix this with an updated app that tells the device that your phone is on the same wifi network, so I'll hope they think of that.

So, if you have Verizon, do not get Nest unless you want to also buy a compatible router. We got these thermostats to be able to set them at a distance.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2016,Tia,We love the nest thermostat. We had one upstairs in the bedroom and we bought one more for the downstairs. It is expensive but it will pays for it self when it uses all the features like auto-away to save energy. I love that I can control from my phone and make it turn On when we are coming back from a long vacation to find the home nice and warm. The con is that the downstairs one is placed in our formal living room which I am not using as much so it senses auto-away and goes on off mode which I have to remember to walk around there to not let that happen. Yes its true we can switch off the auto away feature but I like it as when I am truly of the house and it saves energy. One other strange thing that had happened last year with the upstairs one is that it had automatically turned on to the highest heat setting and I was shocked to see the room temperature very very high without any of us programing it or even touching it. I was thinking that may be my son was playing with my phone and must have done by mistake but then I kept my phone away and still it happened 3 times in that week. Than it started functioning normally may be they must have updated the software or somehow it got fixed on its on and is been working great for us since then. Overall we are very happy with it and will recommend it to all.,We love the nest thermostat

I calculated my furnace was running 12 hours a day at least. With the Nest it's never ran more than 7 hours. Installation was easy if you watch a few videos before hand. I had to opened up furnace and connected an open wire(not used) to the white common first. Then connected all of my other wires based on the diagram, only issue was where to put red(R1 or R2) which has 2 connections. Of course I connected to the wrong post the first time, but the Nest is forgiving. Setup took minutes, but both Heat and Cool functions are running well.

However, the software is clumsy and inelegant. The setup and control instructions are maddeningly cryptic. I know what my schedule is—the thermostat doesn't have to learn it. But, the manual setup was not easy. Who knew there was a copy/paste function on the schedule? I still haven't done the research to figure out how to control the fan.

The online Nest guide to determine compatibility with my existing Honeywell thermostat was particularly helpful, with a 3-minute video, that shows you how to determine if the Nest should work.  I listed the 5 wires that i saw on my existing thermostat, and then was told that the Nest was compatible.  My primary aim in replacing the Honeywell was to have something tied in to my WiFi, that i could monitor remotely, and receive a warning if the temperature of the house had fallen (we live in New England, and got particularly nervous this winter when the temperature plunged in late December, while we were away).  I bought the Nest, and as advertised, it was very easy to install, and it worked, and still works well.  It also has a slick, clean design, and the online app is easy to use, so i was a happy customer.  Until last weekend (it has been working for about 3 weeks now), when i saw another dad that had installed one, and said that he had a problem with his Nest, associated with the amount of power it was drawing.  This feedback made me nervous.  Then i was in my basement, and i heard what sounded like short circuit sounds at my boiler.  There is an electrical box that was clicking, sending signals to the boiler, and the boiler itself was then clicking, and not turning on.  I thought that the heat might be off completely, as one of the zones seemed to be calling for heat, and the boiler seemed unable to turn on.  Eventually it did turn on, but i could tell that something in the wiring was wrong.  We called a contractor over, and it turns out the Nest needs a common wire, I think because the Nest draws a lot of power?  I don’t totally understand the issue with the Nest, but after a $300 repair bill, and the addition of a sixth wire, a common wire, the Nest seems like it should work now.  However, the online compatibility guide absolutely did not say anything about needing a sixth wire!  I think this is wildly false advertising, and with Nest owned by Google, i would expect more/better.  I had placed an order for a second Nest, which i just cancelled.  Evidently there is a Honeywell model, RTH9580, which ties into Wifi, and can be monitored online, without this power issue.

Rusk,"Installed yesterday with a new 2 stage HVAC system.  Love the technology of this thermostat and the fact that I can control it with Amazon's Echo.  The Nest app is also a plus as I've found it easy to use.  Since I only recently installed it (well, my HVAC installer did) it hasn't learned anything about our schedule so it'll be a while before we get the benefit of the auto programming. A note about their tech support.  I had found support for our Nest cams to be excellent. Not so for the thermostat.  I used the chat feature to ask a very simple question about the Nest thermostat: how to you change the setting so that the fan only runs when the system is cooling or heating.  My installer had set it to run all the time.  The agent had no clue . While he was posting links to Nest help articles that has nothing to do with my question, I figured out how to do it.  When he asked for a photo of the wiring I told him I had figured it out so no need for a photo.  Did he ask me how to set the fan to only run when cooling or heating so he could help the next customer?  Nope!  He just asked if there was anything else he could help with.  I don't blame the agent, I blame Nest for not educating the agent.  Of course he could have asked me to educate himself. Fortunately, Nest has a lot of documentation on their site to help customers answer their own questions.",Who knew a thermostat could be so fun?!

It has smart things that most other thermostats don't have and looks great. Setup is easy as well. When I ordered mine the unit was not booting up, hard reset didn't wake it up either so they asked me to get a replacement. This by it's own shows that these can fail easily.

They were designed extremely well with the end user in mind. Very easy, and Nest will walk you through the entire process from the moment you open the box until completion of setup. Maps are available to help with the wiring and make it extremely easy, and they include EVERYTHING you might need to complete the installation including a great screwdriver with both Philips and Flathead bits that stay in the holder magnetically. Everything about this thermostat was well-designed and thought out. A pleasure to install and operate. Ends up saving quite a bit of energy and money. Version 3 has improved on Version 2 by including a larger screen and a slightly thinner body, which are both welcome improvements.

I could have had a thermostat included with my unit but i chose to pay another 250 bucks for this device. Another sham/scam on the people.  We have had it in our home now for about 9 months.  There is definitely a learning curve and I find I still need to just accept that the thing has a mind of its own.  Now I can't even set cool to heat from the device on the wall, my husband had to go on his phone to a make adjustments. I will just say, if you want easy and stressfree in your life , stick with a REAL thermostat..

Do you really need to earn little leaves to prove what an environmentally conscience person you are?  This reeks of BB and Borg mentality- precursor to the socialist society America is heading towards.  Save your money too! UPDATE: It has now over one year since we installed the Nest. I had to replace it at about the year mark because a nest tech determined that a sensor had gone bad. at least it was under warranty so no cost. Once the device was received we had to go through entire set up process. The tech had assured me it was a simple process so I thought we could get it done before dinner at the hottest point of the day. No! Almost an hour later and a phone call we had it working. Our issue  still not resolved, in a moment of desperation, we spent another 40 bucks on a sensor .  Found out the sensor is only accurate to three degrees when communicating with thermostat!

The install is very easy and simple I believe most can do it.. What is not great is the Nest installation booklet.  One major step Nest needs to add in the book after turning off the AC breakers in the electrical panel usually in one's garage is to check your attic for the furnace switches. (most new homes will have this in the attic). (This where most people installing the Nest will ended up with NO power detected to RC because you blew a fuse).  After you replace the blown fuse because the Nest booklet does not tell you the above information you will be good to go. Lastly from the HVAC company I know who showed me where the fuses are located:  Please teach the HVAC people how to operate the NEST. I had to teach the guy the functions they have no idea how the interface works because the HVAC companies are use to the Honeywell interface, and many people are moving to NEST.  My HVAC company was grateful I knew how the interface worked and how to reset the device when a wire is not detected.

Kenna,"Can't tell if I like this or not. After following the instructions, I managed to knock out my whole central air system. The problem is that the instructions say to turn off the power to the A/C, which I did. What they don't tell you is that the 24V to the thermostat comes (or, at least, can com from) the furnace (circuit breaker labeled FAU for forced air unit on your breaker box). The instructions need to be modified with a test to ensure your system is properly turned off before proceeding with the install. What I suggest to anyone attempting to install themselves is to turn off what you believe is correct. If the thermostat(s) are blank (no display), you're good to go. If they are still on (some have battery backup), try to activate your air by turning the temperature up or down. If nothing then happens, good to go. Look for BOTH A/C and FAU on your breaker box. If you find both, turn both off. I'm sure I'll love this once I can escape the nearly 100° heat sans air conditioning expected while I wait for a tech to come out and put things straight.

It turns on automatically when I get home, and turns off when I leave based on my phone and wifi connection.  Brilliant design. I have never been the DIY type of person, but the installation is easy enough, I literally just read the instruction from the box and viola. Patching up the wall was the hard part.  I could cover up the wall with the plastic plate that came in the box, but I think that looked pretty ugly.  So I spent the time and learned how to patch and paint the hole that was left over from my old thermostat.  If it wasn't for that, it probably will take no more than half hour to change out the old one and replace with the new.",So CUTE!!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2020,E Taylor,Installed the Nest to replace an original 1950’s era mercury thermostat. Wasn’t exactly sure it was going to work due to the age of the house wiring. Furnace and A/C unit was early 2000’s vintage. After opening the box I called customer service as directed in the instructions to make sure the unit was compatible. Call was answered quickly and representative walked through the model of furnace and A/C unit installed. After determining the units were compatible I was sent a wiring diagram specific to my setup for installation. Has worked perfectly ever since. I have the Nest connected through an Alexa device and have had no issues. The only downside (minor) is that Google is moving to their Google Home services through the app so some things are limited like family control. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.,Easy setup and install

My gas bill which is usually around $220+ in January was $70.00.  Talking about Christmas coming early.  If this keeps up, they will have paid for themselves in no time.  The fact that it learns your comfort habits & adjusts automatically is totally awesome.  The Auto-Away feature is a huge plus.

One works very well the second stopped running after 6 months of use.  I had a heating technician come to my house twice to investigate and found the thermostat to be defective. This man had a lot of Nest experience, many installations and  has resolved many nest issues.  On the second visit I called the Nest help line.  One woman answered asked a few questions then I was put on hold for about 5 minutes and passed onto someone else.  He asked a few technical questions which the heating tech answered then we were put on hold for about 5 minutes. He (his name was Isa) then asked another two or three questions put us on hold again.  This went on for another 3 times.  Each time asking only a couple of questions.  I felt like they were trying to wear us down and hoping I would hang up.  Finally after about 50 minutes on the phone a Supervisor comes on and says he needs to ask a few more questions. When we challenge this and asked why he did not get an update from the individual we were talking to ( each time Isa put us on hold he said he had to speak to his supervisor) he said he did not talk to Isa.  However as we began to speak to him and challenge him he then referred to his discussion with Isa.  Finally he said his only question was to get the serial number of the unit so he could send us a new one.  This took almost an hour! If I was alone and my heating tech was not here to answer their technical questions they would have never sent a new thermostat even though it was determined to be defective after two visits to my home.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2016,Glendon M.,"I bought this item through Amazon, as always the item came well packaged and on time. If there is one thing I have ever learned, that is nothing is as easy as plug and play, but first I want to get to the good. Besides what others have said this does show the current temp in the house but it is on the outer ring and in small numbers. Others have complained that the current temp is to small and the temp setting being the focus is a problem for them, I am more concerned with what temp I set it to, not what the current temp is. Once the unit has programmed it's self based on your temp preferences the only reason to be concerned with the current temp is if the unit fails to turn on, or you really have to have that gee wiz info. I bought this to save money not to impress others with the screen and info. The screen is large, easy to read, I like that it turns on when you walk up to it, it is simple to use, the app is great and works flawlessly, and yes it is a bonus that it looks nice. Now for the bad, when I installed it I followed all the instructions, all the wires went exactly where they belong. It is nice that for those with large dual zone systems and humidifiers and all the bells and whistles they have stickers with the wire names provided, they say Y1, RH W1, G and so on. My system only used 4 wires R, Y, W, G and had no jumpers for the old system so my system was not exactly rocket science to wire correctly. I kept getting a fault saying it would not recognize the Y1 (cooling) wire, after trouble shooting on my own I confirmed the connections were good, no wires broken or twisted and everything was good on that end. In this 4 wire configuration there is no blue (or sometimes black) wire which is required, this is a power wire that some systems use to provide constant 24 volt power to the thermostat. If you do not have this wire some systems will still work with this unit with no problem, it simply takes a little power from the RH and Y1 to get its power, and remember it was not recognizing my Y1. I finally call customer support and was on the phone with them for about 2 hours, they were very polite and tried there hardest to help but that night it was getting to late at night and the house getting to cold to deal with it and the thermostat required a full charge to continue troubleshooting. As a side bar there is a mini USB plug on the back of the faceplate that works with android style plugs to provide a quick charge, this is in the event of extended black outs you can recharge fast. So for the night I reconnected the old thermostat and the HVAC worked fine. Next morning I'm back on the phone with tech support. After giving them the case number from the night before we started going through many of the steps again since my old thermostat seemed to work fine that proved there was no problem with the HVAC wiring it's self, so this wire detection problem was a bit of a mystery. After moving wires to different terminals and reading out voltages from the tech info screen for about a hour and a half, they determined that it was a faulty base plate, they were kind enough to order a replacement base plate and even overnight FEDEX it to me, so at this point I'm waiting for a part that might fix the problem. Knowing modern housing construction practices, I still had my suspicions that it was not a issue with the baseplate but was a wiring problem with the HVAC, besides I hate throwing parts at a problem to see what might fix the issue. I had a friend that does HVAC look at the system, first thing he said was I needed that C (blue) common wire connected to provide enough power. I had already tried that and seen that the issue was not fixed, that was because as I suspected the system was not wired up correctly. The common wire was there but not connected to anything, so after rewiring the entire system we got the Nest thermostat to work as advertised. There are two morals to this story, first is that Nest tech support is great and they try everything they can to get you up and running, but in the end you are talking to IT people not HVAC professionals. The second moral is if your are replacing a old ""dumb"" thermostat or even a newer programmable one but not a ""smart"" one, and they worked fine before does not mean that the system was wired up correctly to work with this unit. So if you plug it in and it gives you a E80 fault code and you do not have a blue wire or it's not connected to the terminal, chances are you need it, and after connecting it if you continue to have faults chances are your blue wire is not connected properly. If you really are insitant on upgrading your thermostat call a HVAC person to look at your system.",Works great now but...

I do not consider myself super-handy, but I have installed some light and fan fixtures so I figured I was up to the challenge of installing my two new Nests. After reading the very simple and straightforward instructions, laying out all the components that came in the box, and killing the power to my AC/furnace I got started. 15 minutes later I had both thermostats installed. 10 minutes later both were synced up with my app and I was well on my my way to the 21st century. I think the install was made easier because my home is only 3 years old and the wiring was super straightforward. My only issues have been related to wi-fi connectivity (the upstairs Nest has gone offline a couple times, even though it is literally 10 feet from the wireless router) and the auto-settings as it learns my preferences (a few times it has set the temperature to 78, which for a 100 Texas summer day is not cool enough for my house).","Easy install, and straightforward process."

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2017,RowerEngineer,"I live in a residential duplex apartment with my significant other and no pets.  So, we decided that this product might help to reduce our heating and cooling costs while we are at work.  Installation was easy and fast.  Learning how to control the Nest was a bit confusing because it operates slightly different from a normal thermostat.  But for the most part you just need to adjust the temperature to your comfort level and it will automatically learn your preferences.  We have had it now for a little over 2 months (May and June) and we have already saved over $50 compared to the same months last year.  And i think these saving will be even higher during the months where the heating/cooling need to run longer to maintain comfortable temperatures. I will try to update this when I get more results. Pros - Saves money - Easy to install - Looks good - Nice large readout - Display illuminates when you walk by, which also serves as a night light (secret bonus feature!) - Easy to use; It's almost so easy that its confusing Cons (Because no good review isn't in at least some way critical) - If you actually try to setup too much of the settings, it is difficult; in the end I just let it auto-configure to my habits, which has worked fine. Other notes: - It seems to run better if you download the Nest app on all phones in the household - I used the wall plate, which looks better than I thought it would since it matches the white trim molding in our apartment - The savings that we were able to achieve were mostly due to the fact that we don't have pets and are able to turn off the heating and cooling for most of the day during work. - Our previous thermostat was very old and did not allow for scheduling the AC.  If you already keep your AC on a pretty tight schedule you wont have the same results I've seen.  But from using other scheduler thermostats, I will say that the Nest is much easier to use and set. In conclusion, I highly recommend this product.  Based on my situation, it will most likely pay for itself within the first year of owning it. And i expect that it will run my AC for a minimum of 6 years, which makes this a very solid financial decision.","Works Great, Looks Great, Solid Financial Decision"

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2016,Erie,"This is a great system, but it needs additional integration to work in full automatic mode. I am an original Dropcam user. Dropcam activated by my location and I could email video clips of activity. Nest bought Dropcam and that functionality was lost. I had to manually activate the cameras and could not email video clips. But then, Nest initiated ""Home and Away"" and location activation worked very well, although I still can't email video clips. Because of the ""Home/Away"" capability, I subsequently bought their CO/Smoke monitors and then this Thermostat.  All the devices work together. I really like this system even though I now can't  get ""Home and Away"" to work automatically.  Tech support has spent hours, days working with me and we still can't get it to work in full automatic (cameras come on, Protect monitors know I am gone, but the Thermostat does not set to Away). The system does work if I set it manually to Away and then back to Home. In summary, it is a great system, their tech support is fantastic and there are some system glitches which I believe will be sorted out. I would definitely buy this system again and I highly recommend it.","Great system, needs additional integration"

Seemed to be working fine for about 3 days but then one night it just died and so did the heat in our house. We tracked down a charger (doesn't come with the unit btw) and then we thought we were back in business until it happened again. It turns out that the unit wasn't drawing enough power off of the furnace running to stay on, so then it started quick-cycling the furnace - ie, turning it on for seconds at a time every few minutes. This woke me up all night and I could not figure out what the heck was happening until I read about people with similar issues. It seems it *might* be fixable to have an electrician come out and wire an additional power wire but that seems like overkill for an already expensive unit. Also, even when fully charged, I had a hard time with it overriding my other zones (would just blow cool air on its level, even on eco or ""off"" while the upstairs wouldn't heat. Everything resolved when I unplugged it and I finally got a good night's sleep again last night.

We love the modern look and interface.  It works well as a thermostat and the app has been flawless. The only negatives are the nest doesn't do a great job of knowing when we are away (perhaps the app needs to be open 24/7) and I don't see a way to turn on the AUX heat on the heat pump without turning on the outside compressor.  Perhaps I will solve both with time. Nest customer service is outstanding.  One of our thermostats came with a scratch.  It wasn't horrible but it was noticeable.

The Nest is a good looking instrument and does a good job controlling the temperature in our home. Two complaints: there were no installation instructions included with the Nest; I found them online and printed them. The Nest app was supposed to generate a wiring diagram...that didn’t happen. After I completed the installation the system began to function as advertised. Two days ago the system went offline and troubleshooting showed the battery was low. I reduced the display brightness and after the battery’s charge reached 3.8 volts the Nest came back online.

Alexa has also just recently been updated so that you can simply ask her, ""Alexa, what's the temperature inside the house?"" and it will read the current temperature.  (This seems simplistic, but believe it or not, there used to be no way to do this!)  You can also ask her to set a specific temperature now, whereas in the past you could only say something like ""Alexa, turn up the heat,"" and she would only adjust the temperature by 2 degrees at a time.  This was a little annoying, but a relatively simple fix if you use IFTTT (If This Then That) to create recipes.  I did this to create a recipe for each temperature I would ever need to set Alexa for.  (It sounds more complicated than it was.)  But alas, this is generally not an issue anymore!  I do still use my IFTTT recipe to set my thermostat to Eco before I leave the house.  The thermostat will eventually know I am gone and switch to Eco, but doing this manually will switch the system sooner and save some more money.  I also like the ability to check your usage history.  My father-in-law also has a Nest, and we like to compete to see who can use the least energy.  Lol. Installation is incredibly easy for a layman.  There's an extremely helpful video available through the Nest site (or you can literally search for it on YouTube and it pops right up).  They seriously make it so easy, there's no reason anyone should need a contractor to install it. The initial setup to get Alexa and the Nest connected can be confusing, but don't get discouraged!  Just do a little Googling and there are some helpful tips to get things rolling.  (It's been a few months since I installed the thermostat, so I can't remember specifically the trouble I was having otherwise I would be more specific - sorry!) . Just don't give up or think that you got a bogus thermostat that won't connect to Alexa.  It will work, I promise! Many electric and natural gas utility companies also offer rebates for upgrading to a smart thermostat, so be sure to look into that!  I qualified for a $50 rebate from my gas company.  Many people I know also got a $50 rebate from their electric company, though our electric is through the city we live in and not the utility company directly so we did not qualify :(  Even though the price seems steep initially, with these rebates and the money you'll save long term, you can't really go wrong.  Not to mention the convenience of me being able to yell at Alexa from across the room to adjust the temperature when I don't feel like getting up or grabbing my phone.  Lol.",Got Alexa?

The mounting section was thinner than the one I replaced.  This required me to push the wiring back into the wall and, ultimately, required me to cut the wires down by about an 1 1/2 inches in length. Otherwise, the main unit would not seat correctly.

I decided on the Nest because of the heat/cool feature that can turn on the heat or AC to keep your house to within 3 deg F. I also have an open floor plan area with high ceilings and like for the HVAC fan to turn on to help circulate that air.  In most other thermostats I found you can turn the fan to Auto, or On only.

Having a dual stage heat pump, there was supposed to be a wire in the O/B slot and then in the settings of the Nest itself, I had to switch from Heat Pump with O setting to B setting.

The only issue I really have with it (and it can be fixed by a simple software update) is that I am also using it to control a whole-house humidifier attached to my furnace.  Previous experience with thermostat/humidistat combinations is with a set humidity level % that can vary slightly with outdoor temperature to keep windows from frosting.  However, Nest uses a system where you can set the number of water drops that apparently sets the humidity range.  And this can only be done by navigating the menu to the ""equipment"" settings. There is no indication as to the range that the water drops represents, so there will be a little bit of a learning curve on my part because of it. Also had a power brownout once that caused the thermostat to report that it had no power.  Had to remove it from the back plate (not hard to do at all) and just click it back on.

I didn’t have a wire going to common, and the instructions didn’t tell me I needed one so the thermostat was sending the wrong message to the air-conditioner.

For example, I set it at 75 degrees.  It turns off the A/C at 74 degrees which is perfect.  But it doesn't turn it back on until it is almost 77 degrees.  This is failure.  I don't care that the system does it to save my A/C from the wear and tear by limiting the number of times my A/C turns on and off.  I don't care that it might save me a bit of money.  The main thing that I want from a thermostat is to KEEP MY HOUSE AT THE TEMPERATURE I SET IT AT.  Saving equipment wear and tear and saving money should be secondary. My house gets too hot when it starts getting close to 77 degrees and it forces me to have to manually adjust the temperature.  I didn't have to do that with the cheap thermostat I had before.  Being able to manually adjust the tolerance of when my A/C turns on should be an option in the settings.  When I researched this problem and saw on the Nest.com forums that people have been complaining about this since 2013, it didn't give me a lot of hope that this problem will be resolved anytime soon.

Installation was a breeze, everything necessary for a clean installation was included (although having a cordless screwdriver helps), including screwdriver and mounting plate.  Programming was a simple and easy process, nest automatically detects your network, then sends an email to complete installation.  The app works great, allowing complete customization and modifications anywhere you have signal. One of the biggest complaints I read was that Nest didn't show the current temp, only what temp it was set to.  This appears to have been corrected as there is a setting for displaying current temp. The app shows usage for the last 10 days, and once the Nest learns your patterns it begins to set the temp automatically.  This feature was particularly helpful for me, I noticed the system was working harder and harder, although the weather hadn't changed significantly.

I REALLY NEEDED to like this thermostat because I installed it in another town to control the replacement TRANE HVAC in my wife's elderly parents home. The stress it caused them and me is amazing. (Over the phone, I heard my mother in law cry for the first time in 30 years) I'm an IT professional, and I thought this was going to be my best purchase ever. After 3 frustrating weeks, I reluctantly removed it and installed a $43 non Wi-Fi Honeywell digital thermostat for them that is meeting their needs for now.  (Yes the Honeywell is labeled up 'goof-proofed"" and qualifies for a spot on thereifixedit.com) Be aware that the NEST thermostat isn't ideal for occupants with diminished mental and / or motor capacity. (Dementia, Parkinsons, etc) It isn't ideal for occupants who stay at home most of the time and want a thermostat that can do what their old familiar round Honeywell mercury thermostat did but with automated heat/cool functionality and Wi-Fi remote control. It isn't ideal if you  need: 1. HOLD the temp entered - ""set it and forget it"".... and just Heat when the home gets too cool, and cool when the home gets too warm. Automatically - Without schedules, or manual mode changes. 2. Allow easy temperature changes... Bath time - manually turn the temperature up - even though it's already 76 degrees in the house and without caring whether the heat mode or cool mode is currently active in Nest ""Heat/Cool Mode setting"". 3. SIMPLIFIED DISPLAY - turn the dial right to cool the room, turn it left to warm the room without having to switch modes and without accidentally activating an unwanted menu routine that they don't understand and can't figure out how to exit from. (The Heat/Cool range display is confusing even for the rep to explain on the phone) 4. FULL functionality from the app - see EXACTLY what is displayed on the Nest screen and  perform a soft reset remotely to correct the problem in #3 above if necessary. 5. Lock out all but the most basic functions - See #3 again and would require a true automatic mode #1. I spent hours on the phone with the fantastic customer support team at Nest. (call during normal business hours if you want the best chance for On-Shore support). The reps are courteous, empathetic, and a pleasure to work with, but they can't change the basic functionality programmed into the unit. Since I work with software developers, I know every one of the items above can be addressed in the NEST software IF they care to do so. When they are addressed, I'll buy one for myself, but this gen 3 unit is going on Craigslist. I hope this is helpful....",Not ideal for occupants with mildly diminished mental capacity.

The thermostat is really smart and does what it says it will do. Had to go thru an installation issue ( Nest support really sucks - they go thru standard questions, ask you to send photos on the wiring etc., but no useful outcome ). As mentioned by one reviewer earlier, one of my Nest won't stop heating even after reaching the set temperature. After hiring a HVAC technician to rule out any issues with the HVAC unit, the technician actually found shorted wires behind the wall where you install the Nest thermostat unit. I came to know that it is a standard practice to clip the thermostat wires against the wall frame to prevent them from slipping down inside the wall. In my case they clipped it so hard that the insulation on the individual colored wires came off and were shorted. Since I ran a separate C wire, it also turned on the heat whenever the unit tried to charge itself resulting in Nest complaining over voltage. After cutting the wires just below where they were clipped and connecting them to Nest again resolved the issue. Hope it helps somebody save a technician visit. However one benefit I actually had with the technician visit is that he found out that my Lennox HVAC unit is a two stage system, but was wired as a single stage unit.  He tested the second stage and connected the wire ( I had extra unused wires running from the unit to the thermostat mount ) to turn it on.

We even installed a wireless access point near the thermostat to boost the Wi-Fi signal. We could get it to connect, but if for any reason it disconnected from Wi-Fi, it would never automatically reconnect. What's the point of having a remote access thermostat if it won't stay connected to Wi-Fi? Honeywell customer service was rude, and useless. I decided to throw the Honeywell thermostat in the trash, and purchased this Nest Wi-Fi programmable thermostat. It connected on the first try to Wi-Fi, and stays connected.

I'm a single female who is kinda handy but have never worked with electricity so I was kind of apprehensive. No reason to be! The instruction booklet is very clear with pictures and gives you suggestions like taking a picture of your existing wire setup before you begin. Setup is just as easy as the Nest walks you through all the settings. I have mine in the dining room which is centrally located in my house. I did balk at the price tag at first but once you experience all the Nest has to offer its well worth the price.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Apr 2016,Jeff C,"The Nest Learning Thermostat has been a great addition for our house.  We first installed it in a weekend property and the install was dead simple.  We were able to have it wired and programmed in about 40 minutes. We are handy people but definitely not professionals. For a property that you only visit on weekends or even if you rent to a tenant, I think the Nest Thermostat is a must have.  In the winter, it is nice to be able to turn the heater on in advance of your arrival so you don't have to wait a few hours for the house to thaw out.  In the summer the opposite is true, to be able to cool the house down before your arrival or even if a heat wave is in the forecast, you can adjust the thermostat accordingly.  For a house that you rent, you can monitor the usage of your tenants if they are short term renters so there are no surprises on your electric bill. The only issue that we have had with it is when Nest rolls out updates for the thermostat.  It will make the Nest Thermostat go offline and if you are not at the property, it can be frustrating trying to figure out whether the Wi-Fi went out or if the Thermostat is updating. Frankly, sometimes it's just nice to sit on your couch and adjust the temperature without having the leave the couch.",Nest Thermostat is a great addition to any house

One major thought to keep in mind is that, while the Nest does indeed offer an automated learning feature, you do not need to use it if you do not want to.  Rather, if you are an old-fashioned ""control freak"" like me and you want to explicitly set your schedule by yourself, you are totally free to do that.  You just go into the menu and turn off ""Auto-Schedule"", and you go into their scheduling facility and you can explicitly define the temperature for as many setpoint times as you like for the whole week.  You can do this using the device user interface, or you can do it on the web interface or the app interface.  I find the web interface to be really easy to use to set a lot of setpoints at once, and to copy whole daily schedules from one day to another.","For Us ""Control Freaks"" It Also Works Great Without The Automated Learning"

Interface is about as friendly as you can get with only 3 controls (turn left, turn right, press) although I think touchscreen might be even better. Perhaps that would be more power consuming defeating the purpose here though. Issues that you don't get with a normal thermostat: 1. I have had it crash on me once, requiring a reboot. 2. It thinks your gone when you aren't. Now, I thought complaints about this were because users did not install the app on their phone (phones which can install the app have GPS and can know when you're home or at least in the area!) but it turns out it still thinks I'm gone if I stay in my office too long, even though the app could easily communicate that I am here to the NEST.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2018,Brad F.,"Having read good things about the Nest thermostats, I purchased 26 of them (a combination of the T3000ES and the new Nest E) to replace all the thermostats in a large house.  I'm sorry to report that they've been nothing but trouble from start to finish.  They are easy enough to mount and wire, but everything is downhill from there. First of all, Nest puts an arbitrary limit on the number of Nest devices in an account.  This unpublished, hidden limit is 20, so if you have a number of cameras, smoke detectors, etc. you will hit the limit fast.  The first 'fix' Nest provided for this (to tell the app you are a business instead of a residence) failed.  Their only fix was to set up the system as if it were 2 homes, and then constantly switch between them until the end of time.  As I was stuck having already installed them, I had no choice but to accept this hack. Once the therms were all installed, registered, and named with the app, the names started mysteriously disappearing.  eventually all the thermostats  I had conveniently named based upon their locations would lose their names and just display ""thermostat"" so I had no idea which zones I was activating.  Resetting every thermostat to factory settings and repeating the entire installation process multiple times eventually solved this mystery (not thanks to Nest tech support), but then even stranger things started happening: Once everything SEEMED to be working, I found that if I changed a thermostat setting from the App, the App would indicate that the change had been made, but in fact nothing had changed on the actual thermostat.  This is with perfect wifi (verified 20MB/s with less than 100ms latency, tested right at the thermostat).  Of course, the app reported that it was in contact with the thermostat (within the last minute) and could even read the thermostat's settings -it just never sent the temperature-change command to the thermostat.  Even worse, there is no way the user could know that the change that was submitted via the app was ignored!  Nest's proposed solution: Use the web interface instead of the app! Every day I seem to experience more unusual behavior that can't be explained by nest.  Today, several of my thermostats would not display the current room temperature at all, whereas other identical models, bought the same day and set up the identical way, would.  In other cases, temperature would be displayed, but be totally inaccurate. I also find that Nest's purported 'time to reach target temp' feature is a total fail.  In reality, it has no idea whatsoever how long it has to activate the heater to achieve the desired temperature.  So if you have a slow-moving hydronic system like I have, the Nest overshoots the target temperature by 5-10 degrees.  Thus if you use these thermostats, expect to wake up in a sweat to 80 degree room temperatures.  Or just as bad, pre-heat your vacation home so it is warm when you arrive, only to find out that the heat was never turned on, despite what the app tells you. Personally, I think these products should be recalled, though it I doubt it will happen.  Someday perhaps Nest will work out all the bugs, but I suspect it will require swapping out all of your installed hardware. Caveat Emptor!",System so bug-ridden you'll want to rip it out.

Easy to use and program. Great investment and money saver in the long run. I recently purchase a home and one of the first investments and improvements I did was to purchase the Nest Thermoset 3rd Gen. With this used home, the AC unit was replaced along with all the duct work. I wanted to make it last as long as possible and at the same time, use it as efficiently possible. I have research online and yes, when you are not home during the day due to work (lets just say between 8 – 5, M – F). You should turn the AC completely since it just wasting energy cooling/heating an empty home. You should set a programmable thermoset scheduling functions to start the AC about an hour before you arrive and that will save you money in the long run plus make the equipment last longer. The current thermostat that was placed with the house, it was very simple and the scheduling function was hard to get it configure. The Nest changes all of that. On top of that, you can view the amount of energy used per day, set auto schedules manually or allow the Nest to program itself, plus it has an excellent and easy to use interface.

In addition to the system being simple and easy to use, the customer support really is available 24/7.  If you are unable, or unwilling, to find the solution to your issue on their extensive interactive support section you can call and talk to a person that will make sure that if at all possible you will have a way to keep your home temperature controlled until a replacement unit arrives.

We have a simple application -- gas-fired steam heat in a century old house.  The Nest functional and visual design are excellent.  The online documentation quickly identifies your specific application and provides a nice wiring diagram, and the installation took all of a half hour even with my compulsively careful approach.  In operation, the thermostat works well.  It overshoots the target temperature when heating by a couple of degrees, but no more than is probably optimal with an old steam system.  The visual display is informative.  My only quibble is with the IOS app I had to use to set up the weekly heating schedule.  The user interface for setting the times and temps is not intuitive, and setting up the schedule took a while to get through -- probably longer than installing and activating the device.  But it all works beautifully once it's set up.  Nice concept -- eliminate the installer, have one device that's smart enough to be adaptable to many different heating and cooling applications (plus monitoring etc), and invest enough to make the user experience simple and straightforward.  It's so obvious, why didn't I think of it?  Well worth the small price premium....I might even invest in the overpriced connected smoke and CO detectors.",It's all about the user experience

First of all, it just works. My old one was on the fritz and was powering the HVAC on about 5 seconds after turning it off so just having a working unit is a plus of course. I'm digging the programmability and remote access a lot. The fact that you have way beyond ""wake, leave, return, sleep"" is awesome. The fact that it learns how long it takes to get to a certain temperature in your home is awesome. The auto-away is nice though I don't use it in its fully automatic fashion. I work from home and my kid is home-schooled so we don't have a regular away-schedule. In any case I do have an ""away"" temperature set and can set it manually a click when I want. But with iPhone access from anywhere in the world, that's all you ever need. The aesthetics are great. It DOES show you the current temperature, not just the ""set-to"".

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2016,Brian Arse_nault,"I've heard people in person scoff at the idea of a thermostat connecting to your wi-fi and operable through an app (do you send email to it? Next we'll be connecting our blenders to the internet.. /yuk). But when you consider how much of one's electric bill is made of heating and cooling costs, it makes absolute sense to have such an arrangement (nerd-confession, I'm probably checking the app as often as people look at Facebook). In case you were wondering, yes, you can still use the Nest if your internet connection drops. You would then use it like any other thermostat. You don't HAVE to have an internet connection to use one, but that's sort of the whole point. Ok, on to the meat part.. If you have at least a minor grasp of wiring you will have a very easy time setting this up. I just moved into a new house and had planned to buy one of these for it. On our first night I was so annoyed by the interface of the existing t-stat that I just replaced it with the new Nest. They idiot-proof the installation with the help of their website. Just tell it what wires you have and it will produce an image of where you should land each one. It's a lot more straightforward than the t-stat I replaced in my previous house. Once the power is back on the Nest is very easy to use. You interface with it by turning the outer edge left or right, and confirming selections by using the thing as one giant button by pressing the lower edge around 6 o'clock. It's got a little thump of tactile sense to it, a very smooth operation. Program it for what your personal cool and warm limits are - think, I want the house to get at least this cold before the heat kicks in or, I want it to get at least this hot before running any A/C. It will suggest you play with the temps for the next few days while it accustoms to your habits. Using the app is what makes this device shine though. The Next will provide you with a simple seven digit code to enter into the app to sync it up to your phone. Connecting to it that way will allow it to know whether you are home or not, and adjust the temps based on whether it should bother heating or cooling at all. If you're away and you do notice the A/C is on because it's particularly hot that day, you can just override from a distance. The app will keep track of how much heating/cooling occurs on each day. I'd imagine some owners see a challenge there, of how to get to the lowest number. More than one user can interact with the device through the app, so if you live in a house that fights over t-stat settings I suppose you can do it from the comfort of the couch now. In summary, it's a definite five star device, and I'm very pleased with it.",You would then use it like any other thermostat

We recently had to replace our aging AC system and I decided to upgrade to the nest. It is fantastic, controls temperatures perfectly and I really enjoy the very simple learning features. It senses your presence and if you haven't walked by in 24 hours, it reverts to eco mode. We have a weekend house so this is a great feature. This also controls the downstairs level of our house so we simply set it for 78 degrees during the late evening and then 73 degrees during the day. I'm not sure how much energy it will save but it works and looks great!",We love this thing
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Feb 2016,KR,"I had no interest in a thermostat at all.  Just the old arrow up and down thing and that was it.  But I kept reading about the NEST and a few friends had the NEST and I did some research and decided to order it (there was also a 50 dollar off deal, I think). I installed it myself (highly recommend making sure you have a C Wire before purchasing) and I have zero experience with electrical anything, especially installation, but the Nest website walked me through if the wires we had were compatible.  Once it arrived, I had the old thermostat off and the Nest installed in under an hour (again, zero experience in installing anything electrical related).  The instructions were incredibly clear, easy to follow, and I had no trouble getting it up and running.  Once it was connected to wifi, we just adjusted it to what we were comfortable with and let it ""learn"" from our weird heating habits.  When we were gone for an extended period of time, it would go into Away Mode and lower the temperature to an acceptable cooler temperature while we were away and when we come home, the Nest would sense we were back and turn the heat up to where we normally liked it.  It takes about a week, but it really does learn what your habits are and then it just takes over and programs itself.  You can change it whenever you want if you're too cold or too hot and it keeps track in the app on your phone how often you used it for the day.  We've cut down on our heating costs just from the Away Mode - even when we nap and it doesn't sense any movement, it doesn't heat as much and we love that because we don't like waking up all sweaty from a power nap.  Those little things add up.  I never thought I'd like or write about a thermostat, but we love this thing.  It's kind of reminds us of the Hal 9000, and we sort of expect it to take over the house at some point, but it's so awesome, we're okay with it.",Nest Is Neat

My husband who is typically very handy would NOT have connected the wires correctly.  My photo from the NEST site saved us.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Nov 2015,TeamB,"I just installed it last night and it was very easy to install.  For those that don't have a C wire (Common Wire) please read this.  The unit itself is awesome. This is our first Nest product.  Still learning how to use it, but we can already that we will absolutely love it. Ok, for those that don't have a C wire.  It's true that the Nest unit may still operate without this hooked up if your HVAC system provides enough power through the existing wires.  If not, here is a work around. First, shut off power to your HVAC / Furnace.  There is a wire marked G both on the Nest unit and your HVAC.  My color was green but yours may differ. In your HVAC / Furnace unit, open up the panel (again not before you shut off power to it at the breaker) and you will see all of the wires going to the individual letters, just like on the Nest module.  Move the line that is on the G connection and put it in the spot with C connection.  This seems like a big job especially if you have never opened up your HVAC unit, but it's very simple.  This was my first time doing this.  Just watched a YouTube video to figure it out. With the above completed, make sure that you remember the color of the wire that you just moved.  Install your new Nest module.  Connect that wire into the C connection and you are done.  This will provide enough power to your unit and you won't run into that error code.  If your Nest doesn't turn on, make sure that you have put the panel back on your HVAC unit.  There is a kill switch in most newer models that will shut off power to the system if the panel is missing.  The Nest unit will not turn on if this panel is missing from the HVAC.  If it still doesn't power on, make sure you have reset the breaker. The G wire, doesn't really do anything on newer HVAC systems.  It is the independent fan control for the system.  I never run my fan without the A/C or the Heat on, so this wasn't a big deal for me.  It allowed me to fix the C wire issue without buying anything new or running new wires. Good luck! And enjoy your Nest!  Hopefully this helps anyone out there with the same issue.",Very Pleased with Nest so far!  Installation without C wire included

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2016,pcpeggs,"I own 2 nests in my home.  One on a classic AC/Gas Furnace, and one on a Heatpump + Electric E/Aux heating. Both units perform very well - keeping me warm or cool as expected.  In short - I do love them.  There are certain nit-picks, but overall, they are a quality product that is a vast upgrade from my classic thermostat. Install: Wiring them was very straight-forward, using the online tool before purchase really gives you a lot of confidence moving forward.  The setup questions were plain language, often times giving you prompts on ""most typical"" or ""I don't know"" was also an option.  The unit runs through tests, and all is well! Usage: I leave mine on ""Heat/Cool"" - Basically, I have set it and forgotten about ever needing to adjust temps.  Its great.  If I had a regular schedule, the ""Auto Schedule"" feature would be awesome...but alas, I do not, and I resorted to simply programming it in a classic way. Complaints: 1.  In an effort to be as user friendly as possible, Nest has stripped out some core features, and also ""Hard Numbers/Facts"".  Its main competitor - EcoBee - is a wealth of information.  Giving you all the data you could ever need to make decisions, or simply to see what kind of impact X or Y has on your energy usage.  Nest only has a rudimentary system with minimal info.  This all fits into their design philosophy (which I understand), but I also wish there was an ""advanced"" tab or something.  I would even be ok if they allowed 3rd party apps to read that info and display it.  Just give us the ability!!! 2.  Basic functionality that you must use a 3rd party app.  One feature ""Auto-Away"" is more trouble than it is worth in my opinion.  It relies on a motion sensor to determine if you are home or not.  If your thermostat is not in a place you frequently pass by, it thinks you are away, when you are not. To solve that problem, I turned off ""Auto-Away"" and found an app called ""Skylark"".  It uses Geo-fencing in your phone, and sets your Nest to ""Away"" when you leave a defined area, and sets it to ""Home"" when you come back.  Its a very basic feature that Nest should have long ago implemented. 3.  No ""Hold/Run"".  This baffles me.  You can certainly adjust the temp at any time - but there is no way to resume your schedule.  You must simply wait it out until the next schedule time comes for it to resume.... crazy.","2 Nests, and love them.  Some basic features have to be farmed out to 3rd parties."

Nest doesn't have an algorithm for that yet, but is easily capable of doing so as it knows the outdoor air temperature from the internet connection.",Works great so far

I tried using the auto schedule feature and it consistently ignored my patterns and shifted my presets to higher (cooling) temperatures and later times.  So extreme that the AC would never ever run in my weather. I manually changed them to the proper settings that I actually need and it auto changed them back.  So I disabled leaning.  It constantly shut off my AC anyway because it marks me as away every single hour even when I am home.  I made sure my location settings were working.  Even when I manually tell it I’m home in the app it marks me away again in only an hour.  HOW THE F DID IT THINK I SNUCK PAST ITS MOTION DETECTOR EVERY HOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.  Could they think maybe an hour without walking by it is a bit too short to assume I’m away... when I’m asleep? So I’m lying awake roasting in the middle of the night.  So I disabled that too.  Now... I have a regular thermostat.  Assuming it’s not still failing somehow.  Dumbest thermostat I have ever owned. Avoid like plague.  Pleass ignore reviews by those who haven’t actually tested the features they are looking at. Update 2020: Even after disabling all learning, home/away, everything, it still tries to raise my temperature and shut off the AC.  I confirmed in the Alexa history that nobody messed with it.  If I wanted to never run the AC I wouldn’t have spent thousands repairing it.  Solution I Googled said to do a factory reset.  Solution dated 2019.  Nest still can’t make a working thermostat that actually turns AC on/off when it’s supposed to.  Don’t fall for the scam nor the reviews that fell for it.

The package brings all that is needed to install, even a screw driver and an integrated level. The app works great and is easy to setup.  Also it can be integrated with third party home automation systems like the Wink HUB and others thanks to the open API (Aplication programming interface). The only thing I recommend to the Nest guys is to improve direct communications between the app and the thermostate when you are at home on the same network (LAN).  This is because when you want to control the thermostat from your mobile phone or tablet at home, it connects to the equipment thorugh the Nest servers and requires internet which makes it slow. Hue lights tkae a different approach and when at home, the app connects directly to the lights which make it very fast to control.  With Nest, you have to wait a few seconds before the Nest app can connect to the thermostat, some times even it fails.

I made the mistake of turning on auto away with very wide temperatures cause we were gone all day.  Came back to a freezing house that took some time to re-heat (and used a lot of energy) doing that.

For a fraction of the price, a programmable thermostat will do the most important thing -- keep your house as warm or as cool as you desire, on days and at times that you choose.  That said, I love it anyway because it's a terrific piece of technology and looks good as well.  It uses a Bluetooth signal from your phone to know whether you are home or not, and if you're not, it can lower the heat or turn down the air conditioning, thereby saving money.  How cool is that?!  It uses WiFi to show you the current weather, as well as allowing you to control it remotely with your cell phone.  An extravagance perhaps, but a clever one.",A terrific -- though pricey -- piece of technology

They integrate seamlessly into one nice neat app. I can't say enough good things and every chance I get I talk to people about it when they ask. I love that I can set schedules or adjust remotely, especially with our pets in the house. I wish they would jump into the home monitoring market and integrate these with the Amazon Echo because that would be something I would definitely use! They are easy to install; seriously, it took me about 5 minutes this time and the first one maybe 15 minutes. They also make it very easy to setup - it basically walks you through the process and the controls are very intuitive to use. I like that it learns from me. It knows me, it gets me. :) I know it seems expensive when you look at the price but what you get in the way of convenience and monitoring of your energy usage is well worth it tor me.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2017,Dan Hatch,Very disappointing experience with this product. I was excited to get the thermostat and replaced perfectly good Honeywell thermostats in my two homes when the local power companies offered rebates. The product itself works ok. The software is confusing and is constantly switching the thermostats for the two homes so that when we control one it frequently mistakenly controls the other one. The eco setting will not allow a temperature of less than 76C for an away setting which doesn't work very well for one home because the cooling system is somewhat under designed and takes too long to get to a comfortable temperature from 76. Disabling the eco away setting essentially reduces this to a scheduling thermostat and forces you to design the entire schedule yourself. Getting customer support is an effort in frustration and I'm sitting on hold now with both their telephone and online chat support for over two hours. Had a much higher expectation for a company which enjoyed such good buzz for so long.,My experience was not positive

Stamatis,"This is an almost perfect piece of equipment. I can't think of how to make it any easier to use. Very impressed. Update, after 2 months' use: I only have 2 wires (and no common wire) to my thermostat. Nest said that a common ""C"" wire is not required. But, what I found is that it ran fine, for a few days, but then my furnace started acting funny, e.g., when Nest was in ""heating"" mode, my thermostat would sometimes stay off, and just make clicking noises. Other times, the fan would turn on and off, every 2 seconds, over and over and over. After doing a little research on Nest's site, I found a help page that says the above 2 problems are likely caused by an incompatible furnace motherboard. Since the Nest is stealing power from the motherboard, to charge itself, some motherboards start acting strangely. In other words: a common ""C"" is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED. I'm annoyed that Nest would say otherwise, without actually asking what kind of furnace I'm using. After all, how ELSE could they tell me, for certain, if a ""C"" is required? Looks like Nest is hedging their bets. They're just telling everyone that they don't need a ""C"" wire, and assume that some 80% of people won't need it, it's acceptable (to them) to have the rest of the 20% to install Nest and have endless problems. The only solution is to wire new furnace wire (that includes a common wire). No way to avoid it.","It doesn't work without a ""C"" common wire."

Operation almost mandates the use of the NEST App--which itself only scores 2.4 on the Apple App Store.  The installation manual is complete, but the operation manual is a joke, and is really only an advertisement for other NEST products.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Apr 2018,Virginia customer,"The Nest 3 thermostat worked fine for two years.  But in the middle of the night, set to air conditioning mode, it failed and displayed error code E108.  I spent some time at Nest's website trying to solve the problem, but no luck.  I waited ONE HOUR on the phone to reach tech support.  The very nice technician walked me through a fix--removing one wire and replacing it.  (The Nest support website did not spell out this solution, which it should have.)  Then the Nest worked, but only for two hours.  Now the same error message again. I called back, and was put on hold for 2 1/2 hours!  To add insult to injury, the ""on-hold"" music must rank among the worst, most annoying, repetitive 20 seconds of audio.  It would serve the Nest executive who chose this music right if he/she were tied down and forced to listen to this rot for 48 consecutive hours! When I finally reached a tech, he told me to remove the blue wire and not put it back.  Finally, this fixed the problem.  But why this could not have been spelled out on Nest's support website is beyond me.  Turns out that earlier that day, Nest updated its software, and THAT is, I believe, what caused all these problems.  An incompetent software update.  And it was a failure on the part of Nest to not inform its tech support people that there had just been a software update that was causing problems. The Nest thermostat is a very expensive product and after spending all that money, I expected it to work and work and work, just like my 7-year MacBook Pro computer does.  My prior thermostat--a Honeywell--was still going strong after 20+ years, till I replaced it with a Nest.  I am very disappointed that it failed. I am again on the phone, on a lengthy hold.  What a terrible waste of time.  I wish I could bill Nest for all the time--5 hours!--that their failed product is causing me to expand today.  A big boo and thumbs down to Nest!",Would NEVER buy this product again - failed totally - 5-hour wait for phone support

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jun 2017,Pete Mayne,"The Nest has a major flaw and for some reason the Nest people want to keep it a secret. Purchased in January, the unit appeared to work fine until there was a need to use the ac. At that point, the unit would only run the ac for a few minutes, shut down and indicate that it would resume cooling in 5 minutes. Consequently the house never got below 80. The initial customer service rep was fine, she had me swap wires around till we got the ac to run. Although the fix meant reversing the heating and cooling wires such that it appeared that i was heating the house but in fact the ac was running. Obviously not the fix I wanted. She told me that she would have to turn the call over to an advanced tech, and that person would help me reach a permanent solution. After 2 hours on hold I gave up and decided to call again in the morning. Once again, the initial rep was fine and once again I was told an advanced tech was required. After 10 minutes the initial rep got back on the line, took my number and email and assured me that I wouldn't be on hold for more than an additional 10 minutes. He was right, as soon as he put me back on hold I was hung up on. During our brief conversation, he mentioned a common wire issue. That was enough for a decent search that provided numerous complaints and a couple fixes. What I learned was, if you have an existing 4 wire config, you will more than likely need to install a common wire. The common wire allows for constant charging of the Nest. The Nest needs power and with a 4 wire config, the Nest steals power from the running of the heating or cooling wire. What the tech told me was that in ""Settings"" under ""Tech info"" and the ""Power"", look to see what the ""Vin"" reads. It should read 30 or higher. Mine was at 10. I have just added a common wire from the Nest to the hvac, now my ""Vin"" reads over 30. I hope that fixes it, I really want this thing to work right. Bottom line is don't waste your time with customer service, it would have been more helpful if the just had an answering machine tell me to Google ""Nest thermostat common"". And yes, I know Google owns Nest.","Beware of 4 wire config with Nest, needs 5th ""common"" wire to work properly."

The only reason I knocked off 1 star is because it seems like the auto-learn / auto schedule feature doesn't really work well for my usage. Maybe it's better for others. I debated whether I should knock off a star because the unit works perfectly and the feature would work for someone that has a more consistent usage pattern. The Away / Home sensor is based on a motion sensor built into the Nest, not on the GPS location of your phone or anything like that. Also, I can't really use that feature because I have 2 dogs and a roommate and I usually like to keep the AC on just so my two huskies don't get too hot, nothing too cold as I'm sure they're more than comfortable, but just enough to keep the house from getting too hot. And I also don't want to sweat out my roommate. Not to mention, I get home at different times of the day from work, and my girlfriends schedule is inconsistent. So we usually just use the Nest On-Demand. We are constantly changing the temperature all the time. I used to have the auto schedule turned on, and after a couple weeks, the schedule it generated was insane, like every 10 minutes there was a temperature adjustment.

Aside for my initial review below, this thing doesn't work half the time. I lived in this same house for over 5 years and the last 3 month have been terrible. Just trying to get this thing to kick on was terrible. I sweat more than ever and now that the Texas heat is kicking in I had to get rid of this piece of crap. Never had this issue with my stock unit. My place would consistently stay around 80 degrees and whenever I tried to get this thing to turn on the air it would just say it will be at my set temperature in 2 hours! I turned off all the 'features' trying to just get it to blow the AC and it would not work right. After looking around the net there seems to be an issue with this thing working because it share power and recharges from the standard wiring. I replaced this with my standard unit 3 days ago and everything has been great sense. DO NOT BUY THIS THING! Its way over priced, doesn't work properly and there are other options if you want a high-tech unit. END UPDATE*** A bit underwhelming for the price. I was pretty disappointed from opening the box when the first thing I seen was the base plate did not match the dial. I ordered the bronze one so it would look good on my wall but now it has this huge white plate under it and looks like crap. Installation was pretty easy. I didn't shut off the power as it recommends (it doesn't damage the unit) but if you are not experienced with wiring make sure you do so you don't see sparks! Once plugged in the setup was quick. I connected it to my WiFi and it updated right away. All was looking good then I got to the features. I don't know, maybe it's just me but spending several hundred for a unit that connects to WiFi and has an app the options are not much better than your standard plastic square unit. The indicator faces you see photos of on this page are pretty much all you get. Pretty generic and no customization. The only cool thing about this is that it will sense when you walk by and you can have it display the Temp, Time (Digital or Analog but boring uncustomizable fonts) or the weather if you are connected to WiFi. You can't have it display multiple ones either. So if you want to have it show the time and temp when you walk by you're out of luck. So overall, I wouldn't recommend spending so much money because you certainly are not getting that much out of it. The app is pretty much the same. It's only real purpose is if you want to change the temp from your couch. So I won't be using that at all.",** 3 Month Update: 3 months later I removed it all together** Underwhelming.

We purchased two 3G Nest thermostats to use with our high efficiency variable speed HVAC units. They did not function well with our units and we had big temperature swings. The thermostat caused our unit to constantly kick into stage 2 heating, which was louder, instead of using the stage 1 heating. Our HVAC contractor mentioned the reason is that we cannot adjust the 'dead band' on the thermostat, which controls how many degrees a temp will drop before the system kicks back in. Most thermostats allow the function of manipulating the dead band, but the Nest does not. Therefore, we switched to manual Honeywell thermostats which work very well with our home.

If your current thermostat doesn't include a common wire and you have spare wires in the bundle, go ahead a include one in the installation.  You'll save yourself time, headache, and possibly freezing if you do. To make the story short, the NEST uses an internal battery that recharges with low voltage from the control system.  In systems without a common wire, it's not unusual (as in my case) to find the battery doesn't recharge properly and the thermostat will go to sleep.  NEST technical support was very helpful in getting it going again, but it's better if you can avoid a problem from the start. Google ""Nest common wire"" and you'll find ample advice and videos about how to do this.  Use the one that looks most like your wiring setup.",Surprisingly easy to install and set up for use

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Oct 2015,David Vigil,"Typically do not write these reviews, but I'd like to share my experience.  I have a technical engineering background, so anything techy that can be improved with some intelligence I like to try out.  For the most part I'm convinced if it is not broken, why fix it.  However, if it isn't broken, but can be improved then it should be looked at. Going into this I had two working 5 wire carrier thermostats.  I had them programmed with Home, Away, and Sleep schedules.  The problem with these thermostats was they were static schedules. I also could not differentiate between weekdays and weekends, so schedules that were set for the weekdays were not preferred for when our family is at home on the weekends.  The temp swing was almost non existant on these, the target would be at 74 and the units would turn off exactly at 74 and turn back on at 75 for cooling. This constantly ran our units. In the end I debated between Nest and the Ecobee.  I like the added sensors of the Ecobee, but I didn't like hearing their system had a very poor backend. I chose to go with the Nest and see what happens. I ordered two Nests Gen3 units and was going to install one for our upstairs unit and one for our downstairs unit.  It took roughly 30 minutes to get both units installed.  I did write down my previous settings on my old thermostats for reference for the Nest. There is nothing special about how these are installed versus any other thermostat out there.  You have wires and you have terminals, there are clamp style terminals like the Nest have and there are screw down terminals like my Carrier has.  My home is fairly new construction so the C wire was already being utilized on my existing thermostats.  It is a nice touch the Nest has a level bubble installed on the base.  Once mounted and the Nest plugged in I went through the basic setup of connecting to wifi, identifying the system wires, performing an update and testing the system.  All good. I noticed shortly after that both of the displays glass was starting to pop off on the lower right hand side of the display, right above the sensors.  The upstairs Nest was actually allowing light to leak out the side of the glass.  I push them both back on and they appear to be flush again.  A few days later they started to pop off again, so that is when I issued the replacement through Amazon (Amazon is amazing for returns by the way).  During that time however the farsight and nearsight sensor became unresponsive.  I had to wave my hand several times for the screen to come up. I tried resetting the unit several times without success.  The units also seemed to disconnect from my WiFi, now I've heard of this problem before with other customers and I use enterprise grade wireless access points (no linksys here), so I knew it couldn't be my wireless having an issue.  I figured I just got faulty units and was waiting on the new ones. Once the new ones arrived, I simply pulled out the unit and plugged them in to the existing bases I previously installed.  Setup was a breeze.  After a few weeks with the new units I've had no wireless disconnects,  the farsight and nearsight sensors are spot on and very responsive with very little movement. I guess I just got a bad batch. A few things to note.  I was skeptical of auto-leave at first, since one of our thermostats does not have good line of sight into our living room, but it has been working just as expected if not better.  The +/- 1 degree for the temp swing I see it as a good thing and have never seen the thermostat go more than that on the set temp.  If its set to 74 it runs and shuts off at 73.  Our previously stats would hit the target temp at 74 and stop instantly and was always trying to be at that exact target which constantly ran our units.  The airwave feature is nothing new, our previous carrier stats shut the compressor off and ran the fan for a few minutes also. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and I would recommend the Nest to anyone else.  There are some display options I wish they would include that have already been mentioned by other customers. The option to have both time and temp displayed at the same time would be a nice option.  I'd also like to have the option to have current temp, set temp or both displayed and not just the set temp.  Let me choose what I have displayed and what I want to view.  What information is pertinent to me, may not be pertinent to others.","Needs more optional display options, but got the job done."

Or maybe the most frustrating thing is that you can set the temperature, and within 30 seconds, it'll decide to change itself to another temperature. OR better yet, you set it to heat only, and it decides it's going to remain on cooling till the end of time. Do yourself a favor, get another device.

When I went on vacation recently, I ended up having to completely clear the schedule I had programmed so that the thermostat would stay set to 50 for 24/7.  The Auto-Away feature, in this case, wouldn't cut it, because I knew there would be people ""dropping in"" while I was gone to bring in the mail, and I didn't want the Auto-Away feature to turn off and waste energy heating the house until it realized again that no one was there.

Anyone can! So, when I first bought thing, I was nervous about getting it installed. I had an electrician lined up (even thought they wanted an arm and a leg to install it)... Well, I am not a patient person, so I decided to take my Nest out of the box and see if I could figure this whole installation thing out... OMG, EASY PEASY!!!!! I turned off my system at the breaker box, took off the face of the old thermostat, took a picture of the wires and continued to disassemble. OK, I was 1/3 of the way there - yay me! I start to unpack the Nest from the box and look at all the parts and felt confident I could do this. I have the instructions out and was following them step by step. The only time I had to go to The Google was when it came to hooking up the wires... I have no problem with the Red, Green or White... Yellow confused me, but The Google came through and explained that if I didn't have a multi-zoned system I needed to use Y1. All hooked up, face of my pretty, shiny, perfect Nest was on! Woohoo! Back to the breaker box, turn on my HVAC system and low and behold my perfect Nest was practically smiling at me! I followed the prompts on the screen - tentatively at first because I was worried she was fragile - and step by step I became more comfortable using the device. Even better than a pretty face - SHE WORKS! I set my temperature and BINGO, fan and heat kicked on! I was so excited, I called my neighbors over to come and see my handy work and called the guy I was seeing at the time to tell him that he was in fact incorrect - I didn't need a man to install and set this up for me (we're not talking anymore, btw)... Any questions I had, I went to the Nest twitter page, asked my questions via DM, and the replies have been prompt and polite. My questions have been answered satisfactorily and I was able to keep truckin'. Now, she knows when I am home, and syncs with my life - My Nest has given me one less thing to worry about... I can crawl into bed and set the temperature where I want it and be comfortable. Full disclosure, I had a digital programmable thermostat before. What I like most about my Nest is being able to have more control over my energy bill: I'm at work and I decide to meet the girls for a drink. The heat isn't running waiting for me to come home. Instead, when I get in the car (I work about 15 minutes from home), I open the app, set the temperature and when I get home the house feels cozy! If I stay up late and don't want the temperature to drop before I hit the sack, I can set it when I crawl into bed... Sleeping in late, when I get up, I open the app, set the temperature and in 10 minutes, I can hop out of bed and not freeze! She's learning how I live and makes adjustments based on my ""schedule"" and she knows based on my iPhone's location services if I have left the house for a quick minute, am running errands in the hood or am just going out to gossip with neighbors or if I am out of town... She doesn't turn on the heat or AC just because the house sitter came in to feed the manimals. I love seeing the hours (actual amount of time) that I am using the heat (or AC). When my HVAC guys came the other day for a plumbing issue (completely unrelated to my Nest) they took one look at her and couldn't stop telling me how ""sleek"" she looks and asking questions... Apparently the guy they had at their company to install smart devices had a very hard time installing them and explaining to residents how to use them... I was shocked! I couldn't speak for other devices - but told them that if I could install the Nest a trained professional should have no problem! They offered me a job - LOL.

However, these thermostat (we have six) work sporadically. We had to have one replaced per Nest support. The replacement worked great for about six months. Now it won't connect, and of course this happens when you are half way across the country. Restarted my router remotely; now neither thermostat is connecting, nor is camera connecting. Lovely! Needs a lot of improvement; I get so tired of calling support and troubleshooting their equipment!!!!!!!!!! while wasting my time. Update: the restart problem above had to do with our Ooma Telo, not the thermostats. The real problem with these is the schedule you set up. We returned from a trip today and the temperature outside was in the low 40's and in 20's last night, but the termperature inside was in the low 50's despite a Nest schedule which specified they should be set to 60. Took hours to get the radiant heat back up to warm the house! Checked the schedule and it was totally different from what I had set up. Temperatures of 51 degrees had been entered on several days in the middle of my original schedule. The power had gone off, so I don't know if that did anything to the schedule, but we have a generator that seconds later turned the power on if it was in fact anything other than a surge or momentary power loss. We have to have reliable heat in Maine in the winter; now I'll have to check the Nest schedule daily to make sure it hasn't changed itself.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2016,A R Platt,"The Nest 3rd Generation Thermostat will not work with my five wire heating/cooling system.  I used the Nest compatibility checker online which assured me that I only needed five wires.  When it didn't work, I phoned Nest Support.  They said their compatibility checker was not 100% accurate, and that given the configuration I related to them I would need a sixth ground wire.  My furnace service people wanted a minimum of $300 per thermostat to run the grounds.  I have three zones in my house, which translates to $900 to run the three ground wires.  Nest refused to assist with the cost of this installation.  They also refused to accept the returns directly saying that since I purchased through Amazon, I would need to return them through Amazon. I find this whole  situation to be reprehensible.  First they advertise a Compatibility Checker to see if my wiring  was okay.  No where did I see on this website any qualifiers about not being accurate.  Then when it didn't work, they say I need to install ground wires that cost more than the thermostats themselves.  This, to me, smacks of the old ""bait and switch"" in order to maximize sales. One final rant and I'll be done.  When I phoned Nest, I was referred up the chain to a ""Senior"" customer service specialist who told me he would be emailing me his name, email, and direct phone line.  Silly me, I took him at his word.  No email has been forthcoming.  My conclusion, customer service is also shoddy.",Compatibility Checker is not reliable - A Sixth Ground Wire is REQUIRED

But, given the hype, and the fact that I've just moved into a larger home with 2 AC units, I needed something to help control costs in the Texas summers. As a techie, it's pretty awesome. Super easy to install. I had to use the mounting plate for one room as the hole in the wall was too big for the nest to cover. But, the other one looks so nice and clean. When I repaint, I'll patch the hole and remove the plate. tips and hints: if it's in your bedroom, make sure to turn down the brightness. otherwise, it can blind you in the middle of the night when you walk near it. It woke me up even, so turn it down to avoid the rude awakening. It's learned our night time and morning routine, and the auto-away works fine, but it hasn't gotten the memo to start cooling the house before I get home from work.

Both versions are very easy to install and program yourself, particular with the very helpful video that can be accessed via the Nest website.  Other than that, the Nest works as advertised:  It quickly learns your routine, turns itself down when you are gone if you forget, and can be accessed via your phone or tablet so you can come home to a warm (or cool) house if you've been gone for a couple of days.  I also like the very simple and elegant design - It looks and works like an old-style dial thermostat rather than like an IPad-on-the-wall (as does most of the competition).

If you're replacing an old thermostat, make sure to first clean the copper wires thoroughly before pushing them into the base. Copper tends to oxidize and the oxides are poor conductors. Once you attach the display, it will show the wiring diagram, double check to make sure it sees all wires where they're supposed to be. I didn't do that and it cost me a couple of hours of troubleshooting before I discovered the reason for the thermostat's weird behavior. Nest support wasn't helpful, they don't have this simple step in their troubleshooting manual, neither it is mentioned in the Installation Guide.

Basically, rather than having to manually set up a schedule, you just kind of turn it to the temperature you want it at manually for the first couple of days to a week, and the thermostat figures out your routine from there. That being said, I use Samsung SmartThings as my smart home hub, and the nest really doesn't integrate with SmartThings at all. It's really disappointing the Google folks over at Nest don't want to play nice with Samsung, and if I had a chance to redo my smart thermostat purchase I'd have opted for the ecobee4 instead.","Works ok, but doesn't integrate with SmartThings"

The Nest support is pleasantly ineffectual and will send you a new one that does same thing after a few months and then when its charge starts fading, which means no heat or ac until you manually recharge, they will help you trouble shoot over the phone. Its disappointing since we have a very techn- savvy handy family member who worked for about a year to try to get it to charge on wall as thermostat but failed and it its getting cold to have no heat. There is no support if you cannot get it working with basic phone trouble shooting and no electrician or other service provider can help either. No returns either so while you patiently trouble shoot your Saturdays away the return period and warranty run out and then Google basically is moved away from its Nest product line by the new Google Home line.

There is mention of a list of working routers on the nest website, so the buyer may want to go to the nest website and look over the list. If you don't have a router from the nest list, then you might need to purchase a router from the list or you may have to adjust your advanced router settings to get the nest products to work. My router is running DD-WRT. The nest documentation from their website states that DD-WRT routers are not supported, however, I have found many DD-WRT owners that have gotten their Nest thermostat to work on their DD-WRT router by tweaking the router settings. If you are not up to the task of making adjustments to your router, then this product may not be for you. The thermometer installation was very easy and I got the basic thermostat working very quickly.  Right now the thermostat is running as a regular programmable thermostat, but I'm still working on my DD-WRT router to find the right settings that will work to allow the thermostat to maintain a connection to the network and allow all the functionality to work. Update: I was never able to get it to work with my DD-WRT router. I tried several settings recommended by other DD-WRT users, but just could not get the Nest thermostat to keep a connection to the nest servers, so I could never register the device with the nest services. The problem seems to be in the way the thermostat communicates with the Nest Servers. I called Nest support, but was told by Nest support that the security settings on my modem were too strict and that I would need to contact my Internet Service provider (Comcast) to have them open ports on my Cable modem. I believe the support person really meant my router instead of the cable modem.  From what I understood, I would need to open four ports on the router to allow outside internet traffic to be routed to the thermostat.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2017,TTYME,"This very attractive device has a simple, clean interface.  I just moved into a home with two of those late 90's vintage ""programable"" thermostats.  What a pain to figure out - even with the well preserved instruction booklets left behind by the previous owners.  I swapped them both for Nest thermostats.  Very easy to hook up (just five wires, and, if you wish, your internet. Total of 30 - 40 minutes - for BOTH, only because it was harder to get them to screw to the wall than to hook up the wires and internet!). These are a plethora of information about your usage (over time), your actual system types and air filter conditions, internal and external temperature weather conditions (including humidity), as well as options that allow you to save energy or ensure good home air flow. I also love how i can walk within range of it and it lights up automatically to show me what I have programmed it to tell me (i.e., current room temperature/what the thermostat is set to (down stairs), or analog clock (upstairs)). I also love that you can control your home's temperature remotely.  If i have been gone and the away mode has shut my system down, I can, in advance of leaving my destination or in route,  start the system up again, from my phone or computer!  You can ""override"" your set temperature, but the next pre-scheduled temperature change will still kick in on time. One complaint is that, while it ""learns you"" over the course of a few days - I would give it a solid B on that aspect for effort.  After a month or so, I just went into the app and permanently set the temperatures to my schedule. I think your schedule has to be ""to the minute"" like clockwork.  Mine may vary by 30 minutes in the morning to a couple of hours at night. Another thing i don't like has to do with the energy saving function of Away Assist (now Eco Mode).  Great concept.  However, I could leave the house at 9 or 9:30am, taking ALL devices containing the Nest App (phone and iPod) with me,. out of range.  But, when i look at my usage on the app - it shows that the system did not go in to Eco mode for another 3 or 4 hours!!  I could understand if it waited an hour to be sure there was no movement in the house or just not ""shock"" the system, but more than that is wasted energy. If it were not for all of the bells and whistles and continuous improvements i know will come with software updates, I might only recommend this to gadget enthusiasts (which I happen to be, but am also practical - I am looking for energy savings!). I will leave with this - this is a good device, but try and catch it on sale or make sure your power company offers a rebate before sinking $250 into it.  The pro's out weight the cons, cons that i believe you can mostly work around or circumvent.",Very easy to hook up (just five wires

You tend to expect that if you have a relatively new AC system, new control tech should work just fine.  Don't you believe it.  Similar to other reviews here, I spent countless hours with tech support trying to get the Nest unit to work properly.  Numerous time-consuming wiring changes,  Having to start from square one each time I worked with customer support.  Parts swaps that didn't work.  Finally had to resort to hiring a ""Nest Pro"" to confirm the unit is bad.  Now that the ""expert"" has confirmed I'm not lying - I say this because Nest clearly assumes its customers have screwed up installation rather than entertaining the possibility that their product might just be at fault - they are silent.  More troubling is that the defective unit caused my compressor to run without the fan, a condition that can cause serious damage to cooling systems.  Of course, Nest is silent on this.  So, I am now contemplating running the Nest over to get at least some level of satisfaction for all of my frustration.

The reason for the 1 rating is the very frustrating time on calls with nest support.  I happened to call at night and was forwarded to what they call a 'senior tech'.  After that, whenever I had a problem the other senior techs said I had to go thru my previous tech which was extremely frustrating given that person's working hours.  Worse yet that tech remains unresponsive overall at answering or acknowledging what I'm sure will now be a much higher bill.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Sep 2015,Jeff on Vashon Island,"I bought a new house recently and the thermostat was very basic with no scheduling ability. I bought this both because I want to save energy and I'm a geek. While I am a geek and a good with computers I am not  knowledgeable about electronics or wiring so I was a little intimidated by the idea of wiring this myself. But, between the very clear printed instructions(whatever happened to those?) and the walk through steps on the device I was up and running in 30 minutes. It's early fall so I'm not using it as regularly or normally as I will during the winter so I'm not expecting it to train properly just yet. But I do like that it has the ability of setting or changing the scheduling if need be. So far it's been great at setting itself into ""away"" mode and turning back on when we're home. The geek in me loves being able to adjust the heat from the app while I'm at work. But the very best part is that my wife, who still has a hard time with my TV setup, has had absolutely no problem adjusting the heat when she's home during the day. Being geezers over 50, we both appreciate the big, bright display. I hate shelling out money for things like this, but this is well worth the price. Nest really does live up to it's reputation for quality and ease of use. ************************************************************************************************************************************************* UPDATE AFter about 2 months of use now I couldn't be more impressed. The learning ability is quite impressive. I initially scheduled it for my odd work schedule manually. One thing I usually do is turn the heat down a few degrees before I leave; within a week the thermostat had learned this and added it to my schedule. It's proven to be very accurate in terms of what we need the temperature to be in our house. There are also unexpected benefits that I hadn't even thought about. 1. The power where I live goes out frequently. I can try checking my thermostat with the app to see if it responds. If it doesn't I am fairly assured that the power is out. This happened this week during a big storm and I was able to stop off and pick up dinner rather than get home and not be able to cook. 2. I love being able to turn the heat back up when I'm within a few miles of home so I don't have to come home to a cold house. 3. The Nest is in our Hallway and is bright enough that it acts like a nightlight when we walk by it in the dark. My wife loves that unexpected feature.",Easy Peasy

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2016,Michael Bishop,"I previously owned the 2nd Generation thermostat but bought the new model after moving to a new house. The differences are minor, but it does offer some improvements. The thermostat is slightly thinner which, along with a better quality screen, gives it a nicer appearance. This is nice for something that really should blend into a house and not draw attention to itself. The real power of the Nest comes from the automatic learning. There are a lot of programmable thermostats out there, but I'm willing to bet that a vast majority of them are not setup very well. People using non-programmable thermostats will benefit even more. The nicest part of all this is that it requires minimal interaction. The thermostat will learn your habits and set the schedule. Being able to access the thermostat remotely via iPhone/Android apps is great for making temperature adjustments or to warm/cool the house before returning home. One drawback is if your thermostat is located in a low traffic area of your home then it may switch to Away incorrectly. You can improve this by using the Nest Protect smoke detectors, but it would be nice if they sold a stand-alone sensor since my house is already wired with smoke detectors and the Protects are somewhat expensive (plus, previous versions had numerous issues but those have been mostly fixed). If you already own the 2nd, then there isn't much need to upgrade. I would recommend it for everybody else.",along with a better quality screen

Save yourself some money and frustration and get a Honeywell Wi-Fi Thermostat or another name brand. After only 6 months it keeps give BG a message that it has to shut down and recharge the battery, which apparently never charges. After investigating I learn that the betteri s in these are not easily replaceable and hard wired in. I actually bought 2 of these for our house that we were building. However had to return the one for the main level because I have a hybrid HVAC on the main level and has multiple levels of control needed that this Nest is not capable of controlling. They installed a Honeywell in its place and it has Wi-Fi fully programmable etc.. I kept the other for my upstairs mancave. It looks cool and easy to use and program. That said, I have had multiple issues with it, going out and losing control. It’s only been 8 months and now I am getting battery failure messages. It goes dead, tells me it has to shut down to recharge, now just a low Battery message so cannot connect to WiFi or my Echo or Nest app or anything (see photos). Apparently the battery in these things is hard wired in so it’s not like popping a cover open and replacing the battery. They may have the software programming down but the hardware is crap.

The Bad: Very unpredictable while in learning mode (came home to the house at 62 degrees and with radiator heat it took hours to get back to 69 degrees); the apps are very confusing, difficult to adjust, and no way to even copy a single days' programming so if your schedule is the same during all weekdays, you still need to enter each day manually.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2017,G. James,"We went ""all in"" to the Google/Nest ecosystem.  We have the thermostat, cameras, Protect, and Secure.  One of the advantages of having all the items working together is their ""Home/Away assist"" that lets you turn on or off cameras and set the thermostat to eco mode when you enable the security system.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the thermostat most of the time.  We enable the security system which sets our home/away assist parameters into motion.  Certain cameras turn on or off, and the thermostat should go into eco mode, but it doesn't.  Most of the time.  Sometimes it does, but there is no rhyme or reason that I can discern as to why it works or doesn't work.  There are multiple reports of this behavior online and I do not see an effort by Nest to fix the issue. Additionally, I am concerned about the internal battery.  The thermostat will not work without it, and Nest does not sell replacement batteries or a service to replace them.  So after a few years you have to throw out the whole thermostat??  That's incredibly wasteful but will keep the revenue stream going for them if people keep buying new ones.  I know I won't be. Do yourself a favor and don't get this device.","Doesn't function as advertised, and internal battery will eventually fail."

What I received was a 2nd generation. We ordered this to continue our smart home conversion. When things weren’t working (smart home) we called Nest and this was how we found out.

However, we actually preferred a replacement and was told they could not guarantee we would receive what we ordered (what it was advertised as). Ummm....really??? Ok...that made no sense. So we took the refund and purchased the 3rd generation Nest at Home Depot. Buyer beware...make sure, if you decide to purchase one of these from Amazon, you check the serial number. Serial numbers beginning with “02” are a second generation. Serial numbers beginning with “09” are a 3rd generation.

Nest support was very responsive, I'll give them that.  The wanted me to turn off the wifi and see if that helped (it didn't).  While I was testing it I took some measurements with an IR thermometer and noticed that the case of the Nest is at least one degree warmer on the right side than the left, at least with the display on.  I'm also running without a C wire; not sure if that can cause internal heating or not but Nest Support says not, so I guess we can rule that out.

It's not as though I am running an old system, it was updated to a new Bryant furnace 4 years ago. I had talked to Nest beforehand to verify that it should work.  Based on that, I placed the order.  After installing, and an hour on hold waiting to talk to Nest on the phone (with their endless and useless prompts to go solve all of my problems with their website; mostly out of date content) I finally got through.  Gerard was helpful and apologetic through out the call.  I sent him photos of the wiring (R, Y, G, W), the old thermostat,front and back. Apparently newer, high efficiency, higher end furnaces aren't (in many cases) compatible with the Nest.  Ultimately, the Nest thermostat is just an old school thermostat with a pretty face.  The old mercury bulb having been replaced by electronics. I wanted the Nest to work, I really did.  My near new furnace proved too high tech for this product.",Doesn't work with any but the simplest of HVAC systems

I don't like the fan to turn off and on when cooling or heating cycles. You can program the fan separately but you have to specify a particular period or have it come on 15 or 30 minutes and hour. Nest should think about a setting that would keep the fan running for 15 or 30 minutes after cooling or heating has stopped . If cooling or heating is called for within that period the fan simply stays running. With this option you would have a continuously running fan as long as cooling or heating are cycling without the need to try and figure out specific time you want the fan to run. It's not particularly energy efficient to have the fan running when you don't need it 2. There is no option to vary fan speed.",Great product just a few criticisms

When I readjust the wires, it seems to work properly again. Wait 10 hours or so, and we get the error message once again. We live in Maine, where we can't have a house without heat in the winter, especially if we are away, as it could cause a bigger issues of frozen pipes. We are not sure what's up with the Nest, have called Nest support 3 times and and they think because it corrects itself each time I readjust the wires, that it's fixed. We love being able to check the temp when we're away, see our energy usage. We have steam radiators, 1930s house, rewired for the most part, except for the heating electrical. I asked our plumber about this and he said it could be that it's requiring higher voltage constant and it's only getting 12v.. though I according to Nest, it doesn't work with 24v systems. He also said he doesn't like them because I am at a loss. At 1 month out we are convinced the support folks at Nest can't determine why it keeps losing a power connection -- we've had an HVAC technician come to the house and we've had to spend $500 to add a relay switch and add a wire.  So careful, if you have a house that's got an older heading system, this might not be the best solution.",Wish it was more reliable - good in concept

The house is very poorly insulated (no weather stripping, etc.) so it's quite drafty when the outside temp drops below 60 F. With the existing, old programmable thermostat in the home, we were often cold in specific rooms within our house, while the upstairs of the house would get all of the heat. The home was being heated rather inefficiently and our energy bill was close to $500 in November. We decided to see if the Nest Thermostat could help to regulate our energy costs a bit more. While I know the device is better suited for homes with both heating and cooling units, we're expecting it to help with lowering our heating costs. Installation was simple and I have DIY fear. It looks great on the wall and with the analog clock visual, it is helping to teach my young children how to tell time properly.",Bought it to help lower heating costs in No. Cal.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2017,einsteinboricua,"DISCLAIMER: I returned mine, not because I was unhappy, but because I saw little point in having it. I bought my Nest during a Black Friday sale. It was $50 off and after friends raved about the savings they got, I figured I might as well join in the fun. I never unpackaged it because then I realized this was an impulse purchase. My home is about a year old. Its HVAC system is brand new and it's all being control through a Honeywell programmable thermostat, which in essence already has all of the functionality of the Nest built-in, save for the ""Learning"" phase and the ability to control through WiFi. Then I began talking to coworkers and friends about their experience. They all said the same thing: they took the Nest off from Learning and merely preprogrammed it to turn on at certain times to control the temperature. However, they all liked the ability to control via WiFi in case they knew they'd be out of the house longer or wanted a specific temperature for when they arrived. So in reality, I was paying for just the WiFi capability. Don't get me wrong: the Nest has lots of promise if your thermostat is the old kind (the one with the sliders). But if you already have a programmable thermostat, then this is seriously throwing money down the drain. You'll get little benefit for a larger price. I won't recommend any competitors, but I can say that the thermostat my house came with is more than capable of handling my ventilation needs.","Besides WiFi control, what else?"

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Mar 2018,StanDiego,"A great smart thermostat with some neat features and excellent build quality. Pros: This thermostat supports dual fuel system, can be set to automatically switch from heating to air conditioning as necessary, has a geofencing feature that can automatically switch to ""eco"" mode (adjusts to energy saving temperature that you preset for both heating and air conditioning) by using your smart phone's location service to determine when you're away, and it can be configured to sense more than one phone so, for example, it won't go into eco mode when you leave the house but your spouse/significant other is still in the house. The Nest has a learning mode where it monitors when and how you adjust the temperature to build a custom schedule. Alternatively, you can manually create your own schedule manually. Cons: The thermostat is very sensitive to protruding wires interfering with the operation of the push button function (pressing in on the thermostat). This is really not a big deal as it's easy to push the wires into the wall to avoid interference but there should have been a warning in the documentation. If there was, I missed it. The manual programming is a bit of a pain with a less than ideal method of creating entries one day and time period at a time. It would be so much more efficient if you could select multiple days simultaneously and/or drag an item to extend it to other days. The last item I'm disappointed with is the Nest has no capability to back up your settings. I spent a great deal of time creating the configuration, some with the help of Pro Support. If for whatever reason, the unit lost the settings, I would have to start over from scratch. I'm disappointed that the iPhone (and Android) app doesn't allow me to save the settings to a configuration file that I could use to restore settings if ever necessary. Nest customer support: Outstanding support, some of the best I've ever had with any company. I have a somewhat complicated system, a heat pump with auxiliary heat and a high efficiency gas furnace which I use as my primary heat source, with 8 wires going to the thermostat. They call this a dual fuel system. I visited Nest's website before my purchase to check compatibility. The compatibility guide recommended I call them to confirm compatibility (they recommend this for all dual fuel systems for good reason). The agent I spoke to was very friendly and knowledgeable, confirmed compatibility, and even emailed me a wiring guide for my specific system. After purchasing and receiving the thermostat, I called the ""Pro"" group (free of charge) with additional questions. They were experts, extremely knowledgeable, verified the wiring for my system and guided me through initial setup  and configuration to use my gas furnace as primary heat source with the ability to quickly switch it to heat pump if I should ever desire. I was extremely impressed with my support experience.",A whole new level of smart

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Feb 2016,Lynne Marie,"I have a lot of observations to make about this product. I'll start with what I was faced with first. I live in a 2 story house, purchased last July. I live in South Carolina, where it's very humid and we rarely use our heating systems. The heater with air handler is located in the attic. The house was built in 2003. No one has ever replaced the contractor-installed Bryant brand heater. I've had these heaters before, and they are annoying. Whenever I replaced them in the past with a Trane furnace, my bill was cut in half and none of the ridiculous traits of the Bryant happened anymore. Those being the following: Cold spots in different places all over the house. A long ignite time, which means it's blowing cold air on you from the vents before it finally ignites. Too long to ignite. Uneven heating everywhere. Too hot upstairs, too cold downstairs. When the temps got below 35, it was unbearable downstairs unless I cranked it up to 70, which is a high temp for me on the thermostat in the winter. My AC condenser was replaced recently, so in the summer the air conditioner handled everything very well. It is a 4 ton unit and unrelated brand to the Bryant. (not a very good plan, but at least the AC works well). The AC has none of the issues that the furnace has. It works great. There's a problem, though. Because past owners pieced together a different AC system, the two systems are not as efficient as they could be. They also just can't put in a furnace and make it all work. Not the kind of efficiency furnace I've bought before. I just needed a furnace, but not an AC unit. So, I set out to talk to all these Trane installers. I love the two stage AC units from Trane because they only go into the higher mode when they really have to. The answer I got? ""You can't change out only one unit. It has to be both."" (something I knew from previous houses, anyway). Installer: ""That's going to cost you $13,000.00"" Me: ""Gulp. I know that they really need to both be married up, in order for them to work well."" Installer: ""No other way, with this pieced together system you have right now."" The problem with this? I didn't have the cash. Lowes would only loan me $6,000 at no interest. I always went for no interest loans in the past. Wells Fargo would only give me 5,700.00 but I could not combine both of these financing options. No one would loan me (or anyone else) that much money. I could've gone with a personal line of credit at my bank, but it was 10 - 12 %. Banks are a lot tighter with home improvement loans these days, since GE sold its finance division to a company called MySynchrony. GE gave me 15,000.00 no interest for the first year once. Not anymore. So, I set out to get 4 more quotes. Same answer from all of them. So, I was stuck with running downstairs to turn the heat down at night because I felt like I was going to suffocate upstairs, then running downstairs in the morning to turn it up to get it warmer down there. Then I remembered the Nest. It's expensive, yes. But .....it is better to at least try to spend $248.00 instead of 13 grand. (All the quotes I got were pretty much the same.) At the very least, I could incorporate it into a new system in the future. Install: Easiest install of any thermostat I've ever performed. I've always done my own installs because I liked Honeywell for many years, but there are no screws or difficult, cramped holes to put the wires into. You don't have to read a book to figure out which wires to use and guess what kind of system you have. It already knew, once I installed it. It's connected to the Internet through your WIFI. If I'm upstairs with the heat on and it gets too hot up there, I just pick up my iPhone, go to the app and adjust it. If I want to go downstairs in the morning and know I have it set to 65 down there, I just heat it up a bit on my iPhone before I get out of bed. It learns. I'm not quite sure what it will learn from me, because I'm retired and usually keep things about the same. But, the programming was extremely easy, both on the unit and on the iPhone app. Change it anytime I want. I was at the doctor yesterday. Realized that just my dogs were at home and I had started the AC this past weekend. (You can switch between heat and air any time you want on the iPhone or iPad app...awesome. ) So, I just turned up the AC to a warmer temp because my dogs aren't too crazy about it being really cold. Before I got home, I set it back to 70 for AC, where I like it. I was bed-ridden after some spinal injections this past weekend. I was praising this thing for making my life comfortable while I recuperated upstairs. Before, it would've been absolute agony to go downstairs all the time because South Carolina is in Spring already. You never know what the day will be like. I just changed it when I needed to on my iPhone. The WIFI was easy to connect, once I realized that you turn the unit itself with a rotating dial either left or right, then press on the choice you want. No annoying methods to type in your password like it is on a Bluray player to login to an app like Netflix. Those are a pain. The screen is motion-sensing on the unit, so you just have to walk by or wave your hand to see its settings. It seems to also get my systems to the correct temperature WAY faster than my Honeywell thermostat did. Seconds vs minutes. Now: I've saved $13 Grand. For now. It's made my furnace manageable in a two story house. I can save up the cash for a new system. It has a mode called Airwave that is supposed to save you on AC costs. I'll know in July and August if that works well. I believe it's going to save me a lot of money and allow me the time to save up for the new system that I really want. I will have my installers just leave the Nest there. It's an incredible product. I've not found one bug with it yet. It's only been about 5 days, but it is already telling me it is learning. Love this product. So glad I bought it. It's the best piece of technology I've bought so far, besides the iPad Pro. Thank you Nest. You saved me a lot of money for now. A few months later: This product is already saving me a lot of money. It's already saved me $40.00 this month on electric. One thing I wanted to mention was someone was complaining about the way it displays the temperature. I think that it is just a matter of getting used to it because there is a rare occasion that the large number in the middle and the smaller number are not the same. What I've noticed is it gets my system up to the correct temperature way faster, and so I'm really not so concerned with the smaller number anymore. I also saw that someone was complaining about the Away function if you don't walk in front of it often and waking up to a cold house. I'm retired, so I don't really need a regular Away function. I go out at really different times, so I went into the settings on the App and turned that off. Problem solved. I love that my air conditioner doesn't run as much as it used to, and I noticed I don't have as much cold air coming out of the vents when the heater is working. I also get an email of my usage each month from Nest. (see image) The leafs mean you've set your temp to an energy-saving setting and will also show up on the dial. And It's still saved me 13 grand. Win win for me.",Just an amazing product that saved me 13 grand --- for now

The replaced thermostat had a rectangular electrical box, and all modifications provided and referenced in the Nest kit are for a square.  I crafted my own piece to mount the Nest to in order to hide the old electrical box which I couldn't simply pull out of the wall without creating a larger hole.

Neither my husband nor I are handy so we were a bit skeptical about the installation so before we have made the purchase, we watched the installation video online [...].  After we watched the video, we knew we can do.  Then we check compatibility, go to --> nest.com/works.  We ordered and in two days, the thermostat arrived.  We followed the installation video, step by step, and just as it said, we finished installing the thermostat in less than 30 min.  Remember to follow step by step and pay attention to every details (like shutting off the power panel breaker for the AC unit, etc.)  We ended up using the plate that was included to cover the holes on the wall (see picture). Setting it up is just as simple as using your smartphone.  We only have it for two days so we don't know how much money we will save but for sure, we will get rebate money back from both electrical and gas company.  And as far as seeing it in action, not yet because our house temperature has been a degree higher than target, so the heating unit hasn't been turned on yet (but we did test it after installation to make sure it works).  So far, we don't have much complains or concerns regarding the product, hopefully, this thermostat lives up to its reputation and we do save money in the long run.","Easy to install and use, but can't say we love it yet."

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 May 2017,Zach,"Overall, I really like this thermostat. I wanted to get a smart one that I could control from my phone (and away from home). I had it narrowed down to this one and the Ecobee. We don't really need the external sensor. Additionally, from what I read, the Nest was more designed to learn from how you used it. That latter aspect meant that I could install it and my wife and I could just adjust it as we saw fit and it would begin to learn from us and our patterns of use. I really didn't want to go through the rigamarole of setting up a really crazy schedule that I would have to change because you never get things right the first time around. As for its learning, I think it's done a decent job. The times I catch us really adjusting it is when we do something less normal which makes us want it hotter or colder in the house for a shorter period of time, which is just life. One thing I'm still getting used to is how far it allows the temp to get from what we have it set for. So, in the summer, if we have the temp set for 75 in the house, often the Nest will allow it to get all the way up 76 before it cuts the AC on, and then it runs the temp almost all the way down to 74. This is cool with me, as it means the system actually runs less often, but it does take a little getting used to. The old Honeywell thermostat would kick in all the time, not letting the temp get over that 75 degree mark at all. Final note: Customer service has been excellent. I have a RUUD unit (pronounced like ""rude"" and totally appropriate). Apparently RUUD units are opposite most others on the market in regards to when it has to send power to the unit for cooling and heating. The install would have been pretty easy except the base unit (which you plug all the wires into) was bad, so they had to send me a new one, and I had to dig a little into the programming of it with the help of the Nest support people. Their help was excellent, but if you have a RUUD unit, realize that your install could be a little more involved than most others (it would probably be worth your while to hire a Next Pro to do the install). Overall, though, I really like it. We're only about a month or so into using it, but I don't have any regrets about choosing it, despite the convoluted install. Good unit, and the other Nest products are pretty cool too (I got one of the Protects and will eventually replace all my smoke alarms with them).",Solid smart (and wireless) thermostat

I have now purchased and installed two Nest thermostats, one reconditioned and one brand new. Both of them came with a nearly-empty battery. This led to massive frustration when trying to boot up the system after installation. I spent nearly an hour on chat support when my first Nest refused to go on-line; finally the agent figured out it simply needed to charge fully. Since my second one was new, I assumed it would come already charged; no such luck! After initially getting on-line (and taking forever to install a system update), the Nest went blank and had to be charged before I could proceed; in the middle of winter in Ohio, after I had already disassembled my old thermostat, this was pretty scary! Fortunately they can be charged fairly quickly, about an hour using a mini-USB (charger for most android phones). Please do this BEFORE you take your old thermostat off the wall and install the Nest! You'll thank me! Once you figure out installation, charging, programming, etc., the Nest thermostat is a really cool device. It ""learns"" your habits and anticipates your needs, so I now wake up to a warm house in the morning (it learned what time I usually turn on the heat, then started heating before that time). It also dials back the heat an hour or so before I go to bed. If Nest gets it wrong, or you just change your habits, you can always override it manually, or program it to a new schedule, or even turn the heat (and A/C) on and off remotely. That latter feature is the reason I opted for Nest instead of an off-line thermostat. If you forget to turn the heat down after leaving the house, you can do it on your smartphone. Actually you can even tell Nest to sense your smartphone and it will turn the heat down for you when you're out of the house.

Long story short - I found out that the actual backplate (with the wire terminals) is faulty, and that there was a current drain. The result was that - even without the Nest attached to the backplate - my AC condenser would run continuously. Without stopping. Forever. I would have had a working thermostat on the first night if the backplate hadn't suffered from this defect. Upon first contacting them, they suggested I get a ""Nest Pro."" That ""Pro"" didn't even know how to operate the thermostat, gave up after two hours, told me I needed an HVAC technician to look at my low voltage control wiring, and sent me a bill for $130. The HVAC technician scratched his head for another two hours, said that he thought my transformer was bad, and sent me another $130 bill. I bought a new transformer and control relay for $60. Same issue... My old one was behaving perfectly, and that was another $60 down the drain to *not* fix the problem. I finally got out my own test equipment and traced the problem down to a voltage jump across the AC relay control wires. Remove the backplate: voltage jump gone. Bingo, bad backplate. Over an hour on the phone with Nest support, during which they had me try, among other things, ""waiting to see if the voltage drop disappeared in 5 minutes..."" They finally agreed that I was correct and sent me a new backplate. The new backplate arrived, and it fixed the problem entirely. GREAT. It works now. But the cost (in both time and money) has stacked up considerably. I'm now out the cost of the thermostat, plus over $300 in needless (and fruitless) technician visits, plus about ten cumulative hours of my own time. I've swapped out the Nest and my old Honeywell T87 at least six times now, only to return to the venerable, wonky, but functional Honeywell. I'm not a dunce. I've got an engineering doctorate, and I'm a university engineering professor. I have wired many a control circuit, but neither I nor the technicians I brought it expected the issue to be the faulty Nest hardware. So, to Nest: Your product looks great, and it works wonderfully, now that I've resolved your screw-up. I love the idea of a smart thermostat. I've got an old home, and energy bills stack up, so I see great potential for your product to save me money in the long run. Unfortunately, a manufacturing defect in your brand-new hardware required my time, my money, and my frustration to diagnose. As a result, the total cost of my working thermostat is close to $600, so that ""long run"" just got twice as long. If I could do it again, I'd run in the other direction. Maybe I'll update my star rating if the thermostat's magical, unicorn-powered smartness wins me over... but that'll take a lot of unicorns.","Thermostat may be great, but poor quality control cost me lots of time and money."

Under normal circumstances, this unit would probably take most people 20 - 30 mins to install. Nest has done a really good job of simplifying most installs.

Therefore, we were not able to change settings on the device.  I then called Nest tech support.  This is when I realized I had made a HUGE mistake with NEST.  The first three times I called the wait on the phone was close or over an hour long, so I gave up.  Today I called again and waited almost an hour before I got a live person.  He then passed me to their level 2 support after reading his flow chart.  I then waited for another 15 mins for level two support before the phone dropped.  At this point, I really don't know what to do.  I thought' Comcast was bad but I don't think I have waited for a total of 4 hours on the phone and still can't get a person that will help me with a defective product.

Said it was compatible with my system. Once installed it causes short cycling on my ac. I looked online and this is a common issue with the thermostat. I spent 3 hours with customer support.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2015,Stealthmimic,"Nest doesn't clearly state that they do not support installations where stranded wire runs to the existing thermostat. There is a very obtuse reference to stranded wire and use of wire nuts in the skimpy documentation in the box, but it is totally unclear. I found this out after waiting on hold for an hour an a half (yes that's right, an hour and a half!!). Wouldn't have done it except it was near freezing out and since it was Sunday there was no one else to call. After much frustration and completely marginal Nest phone support from a somewhat snooty, dismissive, evasive and ultimately unhelpful second level Nest support guy, I finally had to call a local ""Nest Specialist"" and for another $260, they installed solid conductor #18 gauge wires to my thermostat location and everything started working - go figure(?). The installation of the unit itself seems pretty straight forward but you need to watch out how the back plate is secured to the wall as use of the bezel to change settings requires pushing on it and this can work the base plate loose if not well secured (and it must be perfectly level, too!).  Nest doesn't provide any form of wall anchor other than a couple of drywall screws. They do provide a small highly stylized and basically useless for anything else screwdriver, though. It bares an uncanny resemblance to a large suppository which should have been some sort of harbinger of what was to come. The directions that come with the unit are minimal, written in microscopic, faint gray print and for anything important, eventually they point any hapless consumers to the Nest website. Telling a customer, ""it's on the web..."", for a product like this is so millennial it's maddening. In Nest's case it's like saying, ""Oh, you just need to find the shoelace.  We buried it in a snow bank in New Jersey. It's white, so it might take you a while to find it. But don't worry, once you find it we'll be happy to not to tell you what it's for or ever respond to you on the phone..."" (BTW:  THE BIG SECRET: The hidden access number is #7. It is not listed on their support call-in options, but it can save you at least 13 minutes of hold time listening to inane xylophone music and an occasional disinterested comment from a VRU voice that sounds like the illegitimate sister of Star Trek the Next Generation's, 7 of 9 character). Begrudgingly, the thing does work. When it does it looks like the eye on HAL, the computer from '2001: A Space Odyssey'. No doubt Google will be using it someday for some nefarious purpose. I'd guess the on board microprocessor is packed full of additional capacity that will make this thing a 'gateway' for other products and services downstream.  For now though it does give you wireless access to control your HVAC which is nice and there are all manner of other things a true geek could noodle, fondle and fiddle with for hours. All I wanted was to be able to turn the heat on from bed in the middle of the night. Oh, and by the way, I'm trying to figure out how to sue them in small claims court to get them to cover the $260 in unrevealed wiring costs. Unfortunately I've yet to find directions on how to contact them for legal matters -- must be in that snowbank somewhere in New Jersey. Beware. Take care.",BE CAREFUL!!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2016,R. Sherman,"I ended up buying this thermostat directly from Nest.com because they had a promotional discount on the 4th of July.  I was very happy with this purchase as there are rebates for Southern California Edison and SoCal Gas for buying this thermostat with continuous rebates throughout the year.  I really do love this thermostat, not only is it incredibly functional, it's very beautiful on the wall replacing an ugly old school Honeywell system that was easily 16 years old. Things I love: *  Installation was very simple and Nest makes it easy by going online first and doing a compatibility check and shows you a wiring diagram you should print off.  I'm no electrician and could easily do this install in about 15 min once I had the diagram and the tools in front of me. * The integrated feel - it connects to your wi-fi, you have an app for iPhone (and I believe Android), you can control it online in a traditional browser.  Besides doing it's job it's keeping track of energy usage and helping to show you where you can be saving.  Plays well with other internet of things, like Amazon Alexa and IFTT * The trim plate - the ugly old Honeywell system i had left a large square mark on the wall, the trim plate that came with Nest easily covered that up and it looks beautiful. *  Senses when you walk by or approach and lights up to show you the current temperature, and outside temperature (gleans from wifi weather) * Intuitive interface, you press in the lower part of the thermostat to bring up a menu and you rotate the dial and press again to make choices, very simple and easy-to-use. *  Partnership with energy companies - besides a rebate with gas and electric companies, they have a partnership with a solar company in my area I'm going to check out.  Strong partnerships like that can lead to highly efficient systems and reducing cost (hopefully). What I don't like: *  As a geeky nerd, I'm a little disappointed that I have to use the interface to connect to my wifi.  If you have a very secure wifi password that is long, this will be a test of patience.  In other devices, I'm used to it broadcasting it's own connection that you can securely connect to and set the password on with another device, like your iphone.  I wish this kind of option were available, or other kind of pairing ease-of-use. *  The auto-schedule that tries to learn your pattern in the first few days can be a little grumpy.  For example, I had my power off on a hot day when installing.  Once I got it installed it was quite warm in my house. I turned it on and immediately set to 65.  I later adjusted that, but over the next few days it set itself to 65 until it figured out that wasn't a normal thing.  Overall, I like the auto-schedule, it's just in the first few days you'll be scratching your head.  * Don't do like me and set to 65 if you'd be happy at 71, for example.  Just set your ideal, not a drastic temperature. * When you first turn it on, it may not be immediately apparent how to achieve what you want.  I put it on hot/cold (by accident) and was trying to figure out how to just cool the house when I was staring at the heating screen.  Stick with it and it will get easier in a day.  The iPhone app is a lot easier to deal with, but once you get used to the interface, you won't give it a second thought after 2-3 days. * Cost..  it's expensive.  Nest had a 4th of July sale for $50 off which made it attractive along with the rebates is like $175 off.  But, you do get a lot more for your money. Final thoughts: If you plan to do more home automation, or already have a home automation system, be sure to know if this will work with it.  For example, at the time of writing this I'm considering a SmartThings Hub system by Samsung which apparently Nest does not have a working partnership with Samsung on, so Samsung doesn't have a supported connection to Nest thermostat (although there are developer work-arounds that work).  It does work well with Wink Hub system.  This isn't an endorsement for either SmartThings or Wink Hub but it's a good idea to know this information if you have the desire to integrate and update more items in your home like lighting, locks, sensors, etc that require a hub of some sort.",I was very happy with this purchase as there are rebates for Southern ...

I had to use a 24v AC Transformer and Din Mounted Relays in an adaptable electrical box. We use 50hz in the Uk but I'd assume the Nest Thermostat rectifies the AC to charge it's internal battery. Many UK Heating Systems use 230V Control Circuits Hence the relays. The Alt Heat controls an old existing Oil Boiler should it be required. Cooling also available from the Samsung EHS via the Nest though rarely required in this climate. The timer/setpoint facility is ideal for off peak Electric with the Heat Pump.

As a product manager, working in technology,  I can tell a lot of creative thought went into the product. However,  there was an issue with the installation that was poorly documented.  The newer thermostats with WiFi need a common return path requiring a 4th wire for a furnace only system.  When I hooked up the system without the return wire, the draft inducer motor ran all the time.  The voltage was floating without this grounded return wire.  Nest should state this since its more common than they describe.  I was able to open up my furnace and connect the 4th common wire.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2018,wraak,"This product is highly overrated. I wanted to like it, love the display showing weather, but it rarely does what a thermostat needs to do. I have a script to turn off my WiFi at night and this could the root of all problems: The device will not reconnect 4/5 times. When it does, despite showing the weather and the WiFi connection as ok, it has sync issues between the app, the website and the Nest Thermostat itself, and requires constant reboots through out the day. today was the worst, and will be returning, I prefer to keep the house cooler, but somehow the thermostat thought I wanted 71 instead the set temperature of 68 set in the app. I set it to 68 while showing 67 as temperature, I check again after 20 minutes as I notice heat fan still running, and it’s showing 69, so I set back to 68, 20 minutes later it shows set temperature 70, repeat this again after heat has been running for over an hour and It’s now 72. The only way it would respond at this point was to do it from the thermostat itself and not the app. I decide to start fresh and delete the schedule, despite never having 71-72 set on the schedule or manually. I delete the schedule, check back an hour later and the schedule is back there. I delete and refresh the app and everything still shows in the schedule. So I decided to go on a computer web browser and repeat the steps. After I remove via browser, the schedule shows back on the phone. So I delete from the phone and finally it syncs to website app and device itself. I come home later that day and attempt to update temperature from the phone as it’s showing set temp at 67 and in house temperature as 68, I set 69, and the heater doesn’t start nor does the app update to show heating, I walk to the unit and restart after an entire day of nothing but head ache, and it restarts showing 65 as in home temperature, that’s a difference of 2 degrees within 20 second. So temperature itself is inaccurate and it’s nearly impossible to control via wifi. The device was completely frozen the entire day and acting out. It’s going back. What a dissapointment and waste of my time. It also rarely detects I’m gone from home to set the AWAY feature with eco temperatures. Another issue is that NEST is known for not having an anticipator feature or maintenance band for the heater fan so it heats one degree past set temperature then issues the command for the fan to stop however because the heater is still cooling off it will run yet another degree over. So generally speaking setting temperature to 68 will result in 70. Which usually means I’ll start opening windows to cool off a bit. My previous basic Honeywell thermostat did not do that as it anticipated the length it would take heating elements to cool off and issue command much sooner. The end users have been asking for Nest to add a .5 temp increase feature but Nest doesn’t listen. Of course Nest will throw some bit about it protecting your heater by not running short intervals close together which can supposedly damage your HVAC. Maybe that should be in the hands of consumers who better know their homes/climates. I don’t live in a cold climate so generally heating the home to just .5 degree over doesn’t mean I need to reheat within the next hour. My home is well insulated, with insulation in walls, so it doesn’t drop fast enough to cause heater to go off on these short intervals, so really this feature is a must. I also can’t trust some cloud provider to store the data, or what information they have access to by having a Unix system running in my home network. Not to mention the simple fact that updating settings via cloud is very laggy, as proven in my case, when syncing back down to your home connection and highly ineffective. Instead of connecting directly to my thermostat when in home (the most common usage), you connect from your phone through your ISP out all the way to some server in USA, that sends back a command down to your Nest Thermostat. Who knew I would miss my basic thermostat after growing frustrated with this thing.",The dumb learning thermostat

I was going to originally purchase the second generation Nest to save a few bucks but am glad I went with the third generation model instead. THE GOOD - Very easy setup and fast install time - Nice big display that can be seen form a good distance away - Superb software with intuitive thermostat controls that can be navigated with the thermostat click wheel - Very clean and user friendly mobile app - Very premium feel enhanced by metal outer turn wheel and high quality display - Auto/Away feature that senses when nobody is home and goes into away mode after certain a-lotted timeframe - Is able to connect to a wide variety of ""works with nest"" devices including the Amazon Echo (works great with my Echo) - Convenient and saves money on the energy bill THE BAD - Though it is one of the top smart thermostats it is still pricey at $249 retail - The thermostat displays the ""set to temperature"" as opposed to the ""actual room temperature"" in big bold numbers which seems like it should be the other way around - No Geofencing features THE BOTTOM LINE This is one of the best, if not the absolute best, smart thermostat out on the market. I am a previous owner of a Honeywell Lyric thermostat which is not even in the same playing field as the Nest. The Nest trumps the Lyric in almost all aspects of design and functionality except for one. This one feature that the Lyric has and Nest doesn't is Geofencing technology.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2016,Monkey's Daddy,"Though part of me has coveted a Nest since first hearing about it, and then kinda went geek-wild when a friend got a first generation, I never took the plunge.  I had a 7-day programmable thermostat set up for exactly the way our family loves.  If we occasionally forgot to turn it down before we left, well, I'd let the thought of higher heating bills serve to remind me next time.  Now that I have a Nest I do love checking the temp (and RH!) from work to make sure my wife didn't leave it turned up after leaving. It has learned our schedule and, with very few hiccups, blended in almost seamlessly. But the setup was not perfect.  The unit arrived with barely enough charge to turn on, and not enough to keep running.  January in Wisconsin is not when you want to receive a message that your thermostat is turning off to charge.  Over the next few hours I kept a delicate dance going of pulling the Nest off the wall to plug into a wall cell phone charger and then hooking it back up to turn on the furnace.  Why doesn't Nest, who is thoughtful enough to include a very nice reversible screwdriver in the box to aid in installation, not put a big warning on the first page of instructions to make sure the Nest is fully charged before installing? I also wish the screen was brighter.  We have a Nest Protect in the same hallway as the thermostat, but the Protect is battery powered.  To save battery life I turned off the Protect's night light feature to use the thermostat's proximity sensor and light (since it is hard-wired).  The sensor is not as far-reaching as the Protect, nor is the screen light as bright.  The wife is already lamenting my decision with gusto. The pictograph history is also not terribly clear or intuitive.  On my phone I routinely cannot zoom in enough to see all the events and notifications for a day. None of these things makes me regret the purchase, though combined with the price it is certainly reason to pause.",It's really good; it's not perfect

At some point (likely after your warranty expires) you're going to need it again. Here's what they don't tell you: when it works, this is a great product. Really. For 2 years I loved it. However, when it fails, there is no fallback and you simply cannot control your heat or air without pulling the Nest and installing something that works. When ours failed, just over 2 year warranty mark, my wife started getting ""battery low"" errors, and then it would disconnect and black out leaving her with no ability to control the temperature in the house. in other words, there is NO mechanical fall back mode. If the battery dies, you lose function. Period. Support had me pull the unit off and plug it in to charge with a micro-USB cable, which merely postponed the problem till the battery drained again. Meanwhile support asked me to go get my multi-meter and start measuring voltages. Really? The old thermostat has worked flawlessly for 10 years. Put it back on today. Wish I had someway to recover some of the ridiculous cost. That's a lot of money down the drain. Guess I have a pretty paperweight.",this is a great product. Really

Waldon,"For my installation it wasn't as simple as I hoped. The Nest needs a ""common"" wire which is a low voltage power wire. I have a Trane system installed in 2009 and none of the wires were labeled C. I'm no electrician so I hadn't a clue which wire would function as a power wire but I know that you can really screw up your system if you wire it wrong. Anyway, it was time for my yearly system maintenance so I called my AC company for that and the guy installed it for me. He wasn't a Nest pro but he figured it out so I'm glad I had them install it. Just be aware it might not be as straight forward as you think. Aside from installation issues I love the device. But here in Florida, end of December, we need neither heat nor AC so I haven't really used it - but the functions are very cool. And it looks high tech.",4.5 stars

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2016,Goldengate,"I bought a Nest thermostat for the upstairs of our house and loved it so much, I bought another for downstairs (taking advantage of the $199 sale for 4th of July weekend). Setup was very easy. My system had one strange wire, so the online wiring tool told me to email a photo to support. Ten minutes later I was chatting with support and they created a custom wiring diagram and emailed it to me. As I installed the upstairs thermostat, the common wire came loose and I didn't realize it -- Nest support walked me through troubleshooting it and getting it going. When I installed the downstairs thermostat, it took me about 15 minutes.... I could do this for a living now! The Amazon Echo integration is flawless, much better than with my Rachio irrigation timer. ""Alexa, set upstairs to 73 degrees"" and boom, I don't even need to get up, the air conditioner turns on. Downstairs I can do this from bed, wow, this is like Star Trek! The thermostat's ""learned"" schedules can be problematic... Based on one or two days' use, it created an automatic schedule that actually didn't match our lifestyle or our schedule so I disabled that feature. Here in California our air conditioning use is much less predictable than places where the evenings are warmer and the summers consistently hot. Yesterday the high here was 90, today the high is 75, so no a/c today but the automated schedule would have run it anyway. Not just a toy -- I like the feature that runs the a/c fan for a while after the compressor shuts off to get every last bit of cold air out of the ducts and into our home. Overall, I am very happy with our Nest. Now, our Nest camera, not so much, but that's a whole different review. Hope this helps.","I liked this so much I bought a second one for downstairs.

Richmond,"If you have zoned heating and cooling do not purchase unless you want to upgrade the control board on your system to be able to use ANY wifi thermostat. After upgrading my control board so I can use the nest on the master Tstat as well as the other 2 Tstats in my home, I was very disappointed. I was expecting more. If you have more than one nest you should be able to control all of them from one interface and not have to click into one nest at a time, also they should communicate with each other to say if I am away then they all turn to away, I shouldn't have to drain my cell battery by leaving the location services on for the nest to know I am out of the house to turn off all of them. Also my first electric bill was $300 bucks up from the normal $150. Why? I'll tell you, one of the Tstats kept coming on while we were at work, instead of noticing the other two were on AWAY. I say all this to say if you want good tech Tstat then go with a Ecobe, if you only have one Tstat in your house then a nest will do, for what you get for the cost isn't worth it. If you have 3 or more Zones in your house you will need to buy a new Control Board and Transformer ($150) and install it yourself in order to use any WiFi Tstat.

Installation instructions and support were pretty spectacular (e.g., taking a picture of my wiring and getting a Nest wiring diagram back). I recommend you watch the video before installing just so one can see how things will play out. My quibbles: 1) It doesn't support my HVAC's (Trane) external thermometer, 2) So far Amazon's Alexa could only discover Nest under my account but not my wife's (so we have to change to my account to control the thermometer), 3) Alexa will not tell me the current nest temperature (seems a trending issue, not showing/telling the actual temperature), 4) tapping the Nest to set features seems to require a hefty ""thunk"" rather than a simple tap such as on a smartphone or other touchscreen.  I thought it was broken during installation when I couldn't get past the language selection screen.  I could select my language but could not get Nest to accept the selection and move on - until I hit is a bit hard :-) in frustration. It will be a few days  I imagine until it has completed learning so we'll see how smart it makes it. I feel better with the little nits as I got it at the $199 price ($50 off) and I'm hoping with software updates it will get better.","Have to tap it pretty hard to get it to make a selection, Alexa integration so-so, looks nice and seems to do the basics OK"

I found out, after installing both of them, that my furnace has a controller (Honeywell HZ311) that isn't compatible without a ""common"" wire (a wire I didn't have and would require an electrician to run).  Not wanting to pay for an electrician, I reinstalled the old thermostats and am returning these. I only found out about that because when the heat was on and it was only blowing cold air, I went down to see if somehow the furnace (gas furnace) wasn't lit.  Heard a clicking noise and the zone lights were flashing off and on a piece of equipment labeled HZ311.  I then looked that up and found out that it's only compatible if a ""common"" wire is used, which is what supplies the power to the thermostat. So if you have a thermostat that requires batteries (like the Chronotherm III does) I suggest you do some more investigating before wasting time and money on this.","If your current thermostat uses batteries, I'd do more investigation before wasting your time and money."

Whiners! This is an awesome thermostat. First off you can see the current temp when you walk up to it, sure it's not the big number shown, but who cares... It's not a big deal. Also it heats past what you set the temp to so that it doesn't short cycle. Otherwise it would be on and off all day, every time your house dropped a degree. The Nest is sleek, functional and a great thermostat. Don't listen to the Naysayers.",This is an awesome thermostat. First off you can see the current ...
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2017,SeattleDadReviews,"I bought a Nest thermostat, partly to learn about it from a professional standpoint, and partly because I was excited to try it out. People are raving about them. Bottom line: after several days of trying it out and setting it up, I got so angry at it that I took it off the wall, put back the ancient one that it was replacing, boxed it up, and I'm returning it. I *never* return *anything*, so this is notable. The thing that's wrong with Nest is that it isn't very good at its basic function: being a thermostat. There are two things that it should do: Determine the temperature in the room, and the desired temperature, and try to make the room be the desired temperature. Turn the furnace on and off. On the first point, yes, it kind of does that, but it doesn't show you the current temperature in the room -- only the desired temperature.  It knows the current temperature in the room, right? And every other thermostat on the market shows you both temperatures, right? So why is it that there is literally no way to see the current temperature in the room?  The only answer I can think of is: ""design"".  We didn't want to mess up the beautiful display by showing you two numbers because that would look bad.  Right.  Good decision. On the second point, turning the furnace on/off, the brand-new 3rd Generation Nest with a fresh software update ... fails miserably. The furnace runs for a while, then I think when the room temperature is just about the desired temperature, it starts to cycle the furnace on/off every 3- 4seconds, for quite a number of minutes. As a programmer, I'm pretty sure this is because the temperature sensor is not quite accurate enough, so when it's on the line between 68 and 69, let's say, it flips back and forth (maybe the temperature is 68.5643 and it rounds off to 68 then to 69 then back to 68 as the temperature fluctuates 0.001 degrees. This is so basic to the functionality of a thermostat that they probably have internal brown-bag lunches on this topic at Honeywell, when you join the thermostat engineering group. Except they don't seem to  have thermostat engineers at Nest, just ""user experience designers."" Fail. Okay, it sucks at being a thermostat, but isn't it awesome as an Internet of Things poster child? Sort of. The app is nice, and it does show remote status pretty well, and remote control (except for that part about ""what temperature is the room, anyway?). But it's focused on saving energy, which is great, but it is not very focused on making me warm on a cold day, which is the other reason for having a thermostat. Auto-Away Nest has a feature they call Auto-Away, which uses the built-in motion sensor to decide whether or not you're home (a pretty good idea) and turns the furnace down when you're not around. This would be great, except for WHEN YOU ARE HOME, and just NOT IN FRONT OF THE THERMOSTAT. Motion detector delays are pretty standard, right? Like your motion detector light fixture on your front porch. There's a switch on there to decide how long a delay you want. Nest's Auto-Away feature has exactly one control: ON or OFF.  That's it.  You can't set the delay for how often you walk by the thermostat. It seems to have a really short one, like 10 minutes, after which it decides you aren't home and TURNS DOWN THE HEAT.  That is so completely not helpful, on a cold day. When you find yourself getting out of your chair many times during a day and walking into the room with the thermostat in it and waving your arms, to try to make the heat go back on, you start to realize that the product is badly designed and implemented. Which brings me to the last feature, the ability to control the furnace from someplace else. This is totally great, and works well.  AND YOU NEED IT, becuase you have to turn Auto-Away off, because it sucks and that's your only choice (ON or OFF). But if Auto-Away is off, then you have to turn it off remotely if you are Away, and forgot to turn the heat down. Fail.  Epic fail, all in all, because it has all the ingredients of being awesome, but absolutely sucks at doing its basic job.",DO NOT BUY NEST!! FAIR WARNING NOW!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Mar 2018,Cali Weekes,"I love having this! I never saw all the hype before, but with the black Friday sales, decided to just do it. I am so glad I did! I love that it knows when we are not home, and will adjust acordingly. I can even set up how I want it to react when I leave. How low is too low in the winter, and how hot is too hot in the summer. (we have a pet, so I like that I can let it get a little colder or warmer, but not so cold that our sweet kitten is uncomfortable) It syncs to your phone, so when your phone is more than a couple of miles away for more than an hour or so, it adjusts to the energy saving mode. As soon as your phone pops into that radius - it kicks on to get the house back to where you want it to be. It also has a motion sensor, so if my phone is gone, but the kids are home, it knows to not kick into energy saving mode. I love the fact I can control it from my phone period! One night we got stuck in a snow storm, and it was down in low energy mode. We had to stay the night elsewhere, so I bumped the heat up a notch or two for our kitten to stay warm. (she is spoiled I guess) It can read the weather forecast, so if its colder or warmer than usual, it can adjust accordingly. It gives me a monthly update too on how I did on energy, and how I compared to those around me. It gives us helpful hints on how to run the fan system - without actually running the AC or furnace. This rotates the already warm/cool air without using more energy from those. It can kick the fan on manually or I can set it up to do it automatically. Things I never thought of! I got it in the winter, so I have not had a lot of time to experience the summer months of AC, but I have noticed looking at the readings on my energy bills that the usage has gone down. It helps me be more mindful, and give me tips to save. Just the fact that it knows when we are gone and can turn down, is amazing. No one sets their furnace schedule when they are leaving for a few hours or a quick weekend get away - they leave it alone or turn it off which can cost more in the long run to warm a freezing house back up! This allows us to do that - with no fuss! If you are looking to get - check with your local power and gas company first for rebates. I did this, and got $100 from my power company and $50 from my gas company. I only paid $170 on black Friday - so this thing literally cost me $20. I have easily saved that much in my lowered usage bills. Install was a breeze. My husband had it done in about 10 minutes. He watched a youtube video on it for good measure, but I think he already knew just from the directions what to do. He even said ""it cant be this easy - I must be missing something"" so that's why he watched the video. And it was right, it was so easy! You match color wire to color slot. Done.",Can't say enough good things! LOVE IT! Read the whole post to see how you can get it for almost free like I did!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2017,Glenn Elmore,"I bought the NEST after returning a Honeywell Lyric that had serious problems connecting to my home network.Others have reported similar experiences with Honeywell .  I'm an electrical engineer and also have more than 20 years of networking and TCP/IP experience. I have a great variety of connected devices on my multiple home networks. NEST was supposed to be not only a great smart thermostat but also easy to configure. Boy was this ever not so! I have a dual-zone single/single stage gas-heat/electric cool Amana system. The controller is an Amana ZCST2A with a master thermostat downstairs and a secondary 'stat upstairs.  When the NEST didn't immediately power up after install, I suspected it was going to need a common power wire but didn't try to figure it all out, instead I went directly to NEST chat suppor.  This 'chat' lasted almost 5 hours! It started with them checking compatibility of my existing hardware and promising me that NEST was 'completely compatible' with it. Then the 'fun' began.  I promise, I did not try to outsmart or second-guess them, I only acted as arms, eyes and photographer all along the way. He kept thanking me for being so helpful and providing information he wanted even before he asked. After a couple of hours, the rep, who was very nice, constantly thanking me and writing ""we'll get this"" and ""I've got your  back"" called in his Senior Technical supervisor. The two of them worked for another 2-3 hours with me making changes and reporting/returning results as they asked for it. All along I was led along with ""almost there"" sorts of responses. Finally, around 5PM my time (PST) they threw their hands up and said that they had come to the end of their troubleshooting ability and that this was beyond the ability of their chat support. They directed me to a web link that gave local for-pay HVAC services and told me that those guys ""eat these kinds of problems for lunch"" and are ""surprisingly"" reasonable. I am now continuing that path. I do want a smart thermostat and I suspect that it truly is possible to make all this work. I have sympathy that Amana may not have made it easy for them since a multi-zone, multi-stat heat/cool system is not necessarily trivial  BUT that's the problem that NEST is supposed to solve and the one they repeatedly claimed they would solve! All in all I wasted the better part of a day and would have been better off to simply call and pay for local services to begin with. I would probably not have missed my nap that way either! I will edit this response or often a new opinion if circumstances change and this is merited. For the moment, I have a hard time recommending this product/service to *anyone* with a system that is much larger or more complicated than Heat:on/off.  I like the possibility of a learning stat with geofencing and the hope of saving on heating/cooling bills but at present this product and support organization does not seem to provide it for me. I hope that this changes! [Edit, added after local NEST expert visit] I had a very productive visit from the local expert. After giving him the complete history, he carefully considered it and said ""You've done everything I would have""  he then called a peer who has particular NEST experience and received the advice, paraphrased ""The Amana ZCST zone board is NOT COMPATIBLE with NEST. Not cost effective to try to install a smart thermostat."" I greatly appreciate this result and can only wish that the NEST website plus almost 5 hours of time on the phone with NEST chat hadn't been WASTED due to their ineptitude.  I can take ""it won't work with your system"", some things are like that. But leading me on and on profits nobody. Incidentally, Ecobee says they can't do it either and recommended a different zone board ($150) in case anybody else has this exact problem. I'm left with Honeywell Lyric being the only possibility but I'm not going there after having tried it, seen the network problems (fixable by workaround at least) and poor quality app. Wasted time for me and no Smart Thermostat.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2017,Dan C.,"I never thought I'd be excited about a thermostat. It looks really, really nice, it has a great feel, very solid. If you want to manually create a schedule, no problem, otherwise in the first week of using it it will figure out your habits and change accordingly. Installation was simple, the mounting plate even has a level on it so you get it straight. There were 2 unexpected quirks, both related to low battery on arrival and both cleared up in 1-2 days: (1) when I first mounted it on the wall and it started to power up the first time, it went into an automatic power save mode because the battery was too low, you can either wait and it will come back up eventually, or you can charge it via micro-USB; (2) once there was enough battery for it to be usable, the battery still had to further charge before it would start up wifi and connect to my home network. All of this was resolved after the unit fully charged after 1-2 days.","really nice, it has a great feel"

Then it wouldn't cool. The house got up to 84 degrees and no matter how much I spun the dang thing, it wouldn't work. Finally for some reason it started cooling. It got so cold, condensation started forming on my vents. I didn't dare stop it. The next day the same thing happened, only this time nothing I did got it to cool down.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2017,D Money 24,"I am very disappointed with this thermostat, first off installation is ridiculous... This was my 3rd thermostat I have installed and the hardest yet, the wires didn't match with what I had in the wall previously so I called the support line and they had me switch a few (this was just to get the unit connected and turned on) so now that I had power I hung up and proceeded to test the unit well.... It blew cold air when it was on heat then blew hot hair when it was on cool, back on the phone with support, this girl was less than useless it seemed like I was bothering her by calling, she would have me change a wire and each time I would have to run to the breaker shut off the power then rewire it, test it to see it failed then run back to the breaker and try again (thermostat on 22nd floor and breaker outside) in the end the girls recommendation was to switch the heating wire and the cooling wire... This ended up not solving the problem because the condensor wouldn't run and push the cold air when it was on cool, at this point I was so annoyed with the girl putting me on mute and taking forever to respond once I had completed a step I hung up and found the answer on Reddit... I basically had to rig the system to think I had a heat pump (which I do not I live in AZ) so now the thermostat is finally running my system properly.... Now comes the annoying dumb smart tech, the system is PREset with a schedule and that would cause it to randomly set to a temperature I did not select and then heat my home up way too much, this I only realized while I was working and started sweating because I went up 3 degrees before I finally realized what it had done... Once I deleted it's preset schedule I thought I was in the clear, that was until the system suddenly decided I was away and kicked into another preset thing that changed the temperature on its on and stopped heating even though I was home (i work from home and rarely leave during the day) this was another setting I had to look for and disable since it was not working properly... All in all I am extremely disappointed with this thermostat and I feel like I paid $200 for the ability to change the temperature from my phone, I do not recommend this product for anyone that works from home, might be better if you are away a lot and want to setup A schedule to have your system run automatically when you are away, just hope you never have to call tech support because you will be disappointed too",Very dumb smart tech

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2015,Thomas B. Greenman,"I'm going to ask you a series of questions and if you answer YES, go ahead and buy a Nest.  Let's begin: 1) Do you hate getting out of bed to adjust the temperature? 2) Are you not really sure what your thermostat is doing? 3) Do you want to save money? 4) Is your thermostat a dumb one? 5) Do you want your house to be at the perfect temp when you get home? All of the above were very relevant needs for me.  I live in Alaska and have a 1500 square foot house with radiant base board heating.  When we bought the house we got a gas powered hot water on demand heating system that ended up cutting our gas bill in half (down to $60 a month from $130) during colder months.  However, our existing thermostat had a week and weekend schedule and that's about it.  I'd heard of the Nest thermostat and wanted to be more energy efficient but also take advantage of new smart technologies. There are two versions, 2nd Gen and 3rd Gen.  I'm not sure on the differences but I can tell you that being a tech guy, get the latest gen.  That way you are upgrading when you see a feature you want but it's not in the last gen.  I got the 3rd gen of course. The Nest was easy to install, just pop the box off your thermostat (no worries, it's easy and it won't break it) and take a picture of your wires - take note of the labels on them.  Go to the Nest site and use their configurator and put in the wires.  The site will email you back exactly where to place these during install.  Unhook the wires and remove your old thermostat (be sure to cut the power off to your furnace/HVAC device before doing so *very important*).  Simply mount the bracket (if you want) and screw in the wiring harness.  Plug up the wires according to your diagram and pop the Nest unit onto it.  That's it.  The hard part is done! Programming is really easy although I recommend doing most of it from the app/website.  Although it can be done easily enough on the device. Once it's all been setup and scheduled, you can tailor it to your needs but don't worry, it learns you and your routines very well.  Once it's all said and done, you can see what you are actually using in energy per day (which amounts to savings you can actually see).  For me, radiant/baseboard heating needs a Nest.  This type of heating tends to overshoot the heat setting.  So it you set a regular thermostat to 72, your heater will shut off at 72 but the hotwater's radiant heat will cause it to overshoot, possibly taking it up to an addition 5 degrees or more over time.  This is a waste of energy and it's a frustration to those who aren't sure why they can't ever seem to ""get it right"" with the temp.  Those married couples will know what I'm talking about.  With Nest, it will learn how much heat is enough to get it to your desired temp.  It will also tell you how much time it will take to get there (no need to just crank it - just let it do it's thing). Since it's smart, it also knows the outside temp and can predict what kind of  time it will take to warm up your house or if it even needs to.  But one of it's ""just paid for itself"" features is the text message you'll get if and when it drops below a certain set temp and the furnace/HVAC isn't responding so that way your pipes don't burst or your pets aren't adversely affected. I'm also a big fan of the auto-sense feature that knows when we are home and when we are not.  On the weekends, we have our schedule running most of the day at a higher temperature but if we are gone for a while, the system will go down to a much lower temp to save money.  Now that's smart! I just ordered the Nest Protect smoke/carbon monoxide detector but that's another review.",My Nest Adventure

It has a sensor to detect activity in the house, but the nest is in a hallway that is not used so much, so if nobody has walked down that hallway in a day it thinks we are away.  Sometimes we are home and wtf, the it is so cold and we check the thermostat and it thinks we are away.  We know people who think the nest is great, but at this point I would rather have an old-fashioned thermostat.  When we leave for the day I would be happy with simply setting the temperature low manually.  A thermostat that is simpler, but with a more intelligent away sensor would be better.",Not that great.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Apr 2017,The Truth May Hurt,"My initial response and review was excellent. The nest looked great and seemed to perform well. Since then I’ve read many reviews from lots of HVAC professionals, all who believe the nest doesn’t play nice with your HVAC. My issue specifically is the battery and software interface. The 3rd Gen Nest is designed with an internal battery. This was done so to allow it to “work” with an HVAC wiring system that doesn’t have a c-wire/constant 24v power input. This wiring seems common with older HVAC systems. Charging the battery without a C-Wire release on the fan and system to run as it trickle charges the battery. This issue comes apparent when good weather arrives and you run your heat or A/C little to none over several days. The nest without the C-Wire relies on the internal battery to maintain the system settings and WiFi accessibility. Over these few days the battery will discharge completely. Nest recommends you remove the faceplate and charge with a micro-USB. This is annoying. To “restore” the charge the Nest software will power down the thermostat. Now your Nest will not turn on when the critical temperature is reached. This will result in your house being too hot or cold, depending on the season, until you force the unit to power on. After you tell it to heat or cool then it will force power down to charge the low battery. This cycle continues over and over. I have exhausted the internet and there is no video or battery exchange recommended by Nest. My battery (unit purchased in April 2017) is completely drained and can not be resuscitated with a micro-USB charge or with the C-Wire. I have contacted Nest and because I purchase through Amazon they refer me to Amazon for warranty and support. I have not received correspondence from Amazon. Eight months for a $250 thermostat. No thanks. You can just purchase a programmable unit, save $150, and adjust the temperature and save more money, let alone stress. I will not recommend the Nest to anyone.",Don’t buy Nest.

Installation was very straightforward. We did watch a video on youtube first and it seemed easy and it was easy, My system is two different kinds. One for heat and one for a/c. My heat is oil baseboard and the a/c was put in at a later date so they use different thermostats. I would of preferred to use it on the heat one but it wasn't compatible with my system. At least this model wasn't. The web has any help you might need. Even a version checker to see if the Nest will work with you system. The app installed great on my iphone but on my kindle fire I kept receiving an error msg. Back to installing, it was straight forward and easier than any other thermostat I've installed. I love that it has a built in level and it has a couple different wall plates that you can choose from. The only item not included were screw dowels. Which I personally recommend as the device has some weight to it.  It even comes with its own reversible screw driver. Thirty minutes start to finish. Even if you're not mechanical you could install this. I'm going to check and see if a different model will work with my furnace. I love the display, it can be set to motion activate so as you approach it shows you the temperature. It can be adjusted manually or via the web or app. So far it seems to cover everything from setting schedules to being away.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jun 2016,J Howland,"Nest thermostats are the nuts.  Takes about 10-15 minutes to install.  If you can build a lego set or watch a YouTube video and repeat the steps you can install a Nest thermostat in minutes.  Beyond the mind blowing simplicity, the Nest is simply the best thermostat you can buy.  It's more expensive than your regular thermostat, but like many things you get what you pay for. The wireless connectivity is more than a gimic.  You can turn the temperature down from literally anywhere you have internet access.  Want to come home to a cool house from work.  Boom, set it to cool before you leave.  Come home to a comfy house.  Want to make it cooler without getting out of bed.  No problem. The Nest also learns your behaviors.  So far it's been spot on.  It knows when I'm home and what times of the day to cool more than others.  I also really love the auto-away functionality.  When you're out of the house you can set Nest to keep it relatively warm to conserve energy.  In my first 6 weeks, it's been 100% accurate. Energy efficiency is where the Nest really shines.  Because it regulates cooling based on when you need it and you can set it to be more efficient when you aren't home the amount of energy used goes way down.  I saved roughly 20% on my electric bill in the first month.  And many energy companies will offset some of the initial costs of purchase by registering Nest with them.  For me it was a win-win.  I'd buy Nest again and again if needed.",Who knew we had thermostat technology wrong this whole time.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2016,Maria M.,"I am so impressed with this thermostat and it has only been a day since my husband and I have installed it. I will be updating my review after a month or so of usage since this is a habit learning thermostat and will take some time to truly see the benefits of this new purchase. Our first impression of this thermostat out of the box was a big ""wow"". It is heavy.... in a good way though. You can definitely tell that this isn't just a cheaply made plastic thermostat. The design is very sleek and very modern. The box included items such as a a little screws, an electrical box mounting cover (optional piece), a trim plate (optional piece), a mini screw driver, and of course the instruction manuals that include label stickers for the wires to keep everything organized during installation. Installation was so easy that it was almost unbelievable. Mounting, connecting the wires, WiFi setup, account creation, mobile app download, and connecting the app with the nest took us less than 20 minutes. there where absolutely no issues or confusion during installation. We have previously owned a Honeywell smart thermostat that works with Vera, and setting up that thing was a nightmare and took us multiple hours and phone calls to their support department. There is just no comparison when it comes to the installation. Another plus, is that screen of the nest when lit up looks awesome. However, you can adjust the brightness for those that are looking for a more discrete look. Furthermore, using the app is very intuitive and straight forward. So far I'm loving it! I also really like the fact that the nest is compatible with a lot of different ""smart"" products. I am posting a picture of what the nest looks like after installation. Since our house is under major renovations, we used the trim plate to cover up some wholes and also we did not screw the nest firmly against the wall since we will be changing it's location in the near future.",First impression: It's a winner!

So I decided to give this thermostat a try, so I could turn on the AC remotely before I get home. I was terrified to install it. I knew that, if I broke anything, it would be days before I could get someone out to fix it. But I also didn't want to wait days to get someone out to install it. It was actually pretty easy to install. There was a little hiccup during setup, because the ring was being really sensitive and choosing the incorrect network. I called tech support and the man I spoke with (who picked up quickly) was very patient and helpful, though it was already working by then. Then, I went to turn on the AC and it started blowing hot air! I thought I was going to die. I called tech support again, this time panicking, and spoke with another gentleman who was again, patient and helpful. I thought we got the problem resolved, and hung up. It turned out that it was only blowing outside air, not cold air. So, I called tech support again, this time almost having a panic attack. I spoke with the first gentleman again. He was, again, very patient and helpful, even though I was acting pretty crazy by this time. Word to the wise - if you have a heat pump, the white wire that was formerly in the W slot might just want to go in the OB slot, because, of course. Also, this thing is pretty neat.",Top notch tech support!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2018,Tommaync,"I purchased the bronze look thermostat which looks very classy on my wall.  It's a very attractive looking device.  I installed it yesterday (1/4/18) and installation went well.  Instructions were good, guiding me step by step.  Once installed hooking it up to the Nest app on my phone was very easy.  It walked me through each step.  Connecting it to Alexa also went very smoothly.  I like the ease in checking settings, energy usage as well temperature, humidity levels.  Adjusting temp is very easy by simply turning the outer ring. Everything can be done on the actual thermostat by simply turning the outer ring and pressing the lens cover on the front.  The thermostat will learn how I like my home temps adjusted over the next few days and eventually will automatically adjust temps.  but I can also adjust it or set my own schedules if desired.  Today when I left for work I turned the temp down.  Before I left work to go home I opened my Alexa app on my phone and reset the temp to a warmer setting.  By the time I got home the temperature had risen to the warmer setting so the house was warm when I walked in.  It also has the ability to automatically adjust temps up/down whenever you leave your home or return by sensing the location of your phone.  It's only been 24 hours since I turned it on but I have been very pleased with its operation.",A Nest Energy Saving Connected Thermostat for your Nest

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jun 2016,Robert W. Hedge II,"I'm writing this review early, solely based on the ease of installation. I am no electrician, nor an expert handyman. Out of box to operating in less than 30 min. No bull! Using the online compatibility tool, I was able to determine which wires go where on my old thermostat. You can also determine whether it will even be compatible at all (I guess for some certain units) Nest sends you a wiring diagram based on your current wiring (provided it was done right in the first place). You label your wires where they are currently with provided stickers, turn off power to the furnace/ AC, disconnect current thermostat then attach mounting plate to wall. Easy. Then you place wires into new circuit plate provided, matching labelled wires to the corresponding labelled place in circuit plate. Once this is done, snap control into place, turn breaker back on and easily set up your Nest with given prompts at control. Easily connects to your Wifi, then you have full control and monitoring from your mobile device or computer. Can't wait to see how this learns my habits and works to save me money on heating and cooling. I can already tell an improvement in comfort after first two days. They say it takes a week or so before it really starts learning your habits, so that will be less fooling around with it. Just fun to play with and monitor for now. I can see why Nest is very highly awarded and I really want to integrate more to the system. I have already integrated a Nest Protect to it for smoke/ CO detection.",The start of my fully automated home.

The thermostat itself ""feels"" like it is made of quality materials.  I appreciated the compatibility tool on the Nest website so I could make sure my system was compatible.  Installation was very straight-forward and simple; the online video is a great help, too.  Programming/Learning and tweaking it took a little getting used to (the first night, I woke up hot because it adjusted the temp because it sensed no one was home).  But, learning new technology to customize to one's preferences does require a learning curve; I've now gotten it set-up exactly as I wanted.  The Home/Away Assist sensor on the thermostat is super sensitive; my ceiling fans were causing it to think someone was home even though I/my phone was physically miles away from home.  So, the Tech Support chat advisor had me disable the occupancy sensor on the thermostat (through the app), and that fixed the issue.  I can already tell my system is working less (while still keeping me very comfortable) and am looking forward to reduced power bills for the foreseeable future.",Excellent Product

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jun 2017,Michael the II,"After 10 months of use Nest started to turn on the AC compressor and force shut off air circulation fan. The result? You get a few hundred dollar bill for 12+ hours of AC compressor runs a day. I got lucky the AC compressor did not get damaged from frost buildup as people write on forums. I installed my old thermostat and all works normal again. I rent 2 houses and one uses Honeywell basic $100 WiFi control thermostat, and my other house uses the stupid ""smart"" Nest. I have no idea what renters do with Nest or if there are power spikes or anything else weird- all I know is that the houses are 3 miles apart and there are no problems with Honeywell at all.  NEST with its retarded auto-schedules waking me up in winter at 5AM because nest decided to stop heating in the middle of the night (consistently day by day, and the smart thing would not learn.) That was just hard to comprehend and bothersome but not a showstopper. But, opening a Pacific Gas and Electric company's bill for useless AC work in the hundreds that's a mess. I contacted Nest support always there for you via chat. After chatting for 2.5 hours combined and trying disconnecting this wire and that wire, and wiring I was told I need that new plastic ring where I plug the wires into. To my surprise they sent me a stupid all plastic rectangular decorative wall plate that does not come in contact with any wires... Next half hour of chatting they told me to forget about plastic plate and re-set the Nest.  Even if the nest starts to work- how would I know it's not gonna go into its madness spiral cycle of shutting the fan off??? The bottom line is: if you like to take risks and is by that Nest every day- you might gamble on it. If you need a WiFi in a rental house- don't do it to yourself! It will waste both your time and money (so don't buy into Nest promises of saving you dough!).",The stupid smart thermostat

I have had the device installed for 2 days, so I have zero data on the efficiency of the device.  I have a Trane Heat pump and previously had a Honeywell 7 day programable thermostat programed so well that my heat/cooling bill only fluctuated about $10-$20/mo in peak winter/summer months (Kansas City, MO), so I am looking forward to compare.  I will say that I took a huge risk trying to get this thing hooked up with my Heat Pump System.  Turns out I was lucky and everything is functioning, I've attached the picture of my wires before, and will do my best to explain my situation (disclaimer: it may not work for you, hire a pro) I had the following wires in my Honeywell: E-White  (Emergeny Heat) S1-Blue (Sensor) S2-Brown (Sensor) R-Red 0/B-Orange (Heat Pump) Y-Yellow G-Green (Fan) Here is where those Wires are in my Nest Gen 3 E-White to Nest * (Emergeny Heat) S1-Blue to Nest C (Sensor) but rewired the Blue Wire from the sensor to the C terminal on my furness S2-Brown not used capped and tucked into wall (Sensor) R-Red to Nest RH 0/B-Orange to Nest 0/B (Heat Pump) Y-Yellow to Nest Y1 G-Green to Nest G (Fan) Pro: -It's attractive on the wall, my wife likes it, but it also scares her enough I don't think she'll touch it (Win!).  I did set up her phone with a Nest Account and the app, so she can adjust if she feels the need to. -It seems future proof. Already looking at adding some ""Works with Nest"" devices. -Programming was easy (wish there was some presets/examples to work from) If you see the Leaf on the app or nest while programing it means it's still in the Eco range. Cons: -I have a heat-pump and took a chance on the wiring, required me to take one of the sensor wires not being used anymore (nest pulls outside temperature data from the cloud, not the sensor like old system did), and rewire it to create a common wire connection on the furness control panel (C= low voltage wire to power the device). -No way of knowing if it's any better than what I already had.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2015,RJ,"I been contemplating to get the nest for a while now, and finally took the plunge this black Friday since it was on sale.  It looks great and the functionally to be able to manage it while I'm away is definitely useful.  However its main functionally is to manage the home's heating and cooling and I dont think it does a great job at this. Based on the research I done one way the nest saves money is by delaying when it turns on the heat/AC and you may end up with 1 or 2 degrees fluctuation at times.  For some reason for us the difference was about 6 degrees difference in heat.  Because we have a 3 month old baby and still needs frequent diaper changes, we like to keep the house fairly warm and we set it to 75 and turn off the auto away feature.  At night the temperature was dropping to about 69 and nest was still not triggering the furnace to turn on. I understand one of the purpose of the nest is to help save money but If its at the cost of been uncomfortable in your own home then I rather go back to my old thermostat which actually does what it needs to do and that is maintain the home at a comfortable level.  We needed to resort to keep turning the dial off and back on several times through out the night to trigger the furnace to turn on.  I even set a nightly schedule, but that only helped a little bit.  Their engineers need to fix their algorithm. I ended up having to manage this expensive ""smart"" thermostat more than I had to manage my $40 programmable thermostat.  So for that reason I ended up returning the nest,  I will try the ecobee3 and see how that goes.",it favors efficiency over comfort

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jul 2016,Eric Rosenberry,"I have installed these now in several homes (mine, my in-laws, etc...) They are a fantastic example of how ""Internet of Things"" is going to change our lives. Computers are much better at coming up with a heating/cooling schedule than we are, and they never forget to re-program themselves when life patterns change. If the US Government wanted to *actually* make a huge dent in energy usage in this country they should do a deal with Google to give every household in the USA a free Nest thermostat. Now, while I am still giving the Nest five stars because it is overall awesome, I will share three negatives: 1. The upstairs of my house is *much* hotter in the summer than the downstairs where the thermostat is.  The Nest desperately needs remote sensors you can add like competitors have. 2. After I installed my in-laws unit they swear it reads ""higher"" temps than the room actually is.  After much testing and discussion with Nest, I think the reason is a vent that runs through the wall behind the thermostat.  Previous thermostats in the exact same location did not have the issue.  I think the problem is that the Nest is much more tightly coupled to the wall than the old ones and the thermostat element may actually be in the base ring if I remember correctly.  They are trying to keep it away from the heat producing components in the Nest like the CPU and the display so they bury it farther back.  I wish there was a way to adjust the displayed temp by a degree or two to compensate for this perhaps. 3. They need to come up with ways to better control new more modern multi-stage systems and variable speed fans/compressors.  One advantage the manufacturer thermostats have is that they often communicate using serial and they can very precisely set fan speeds, etc...  This world is evolving and I feel like since their Google Acquisition they have not innovated as fast as before. -Eric",I love Nest thermostats!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 May 2016,J. Bitney,"The Nest is something that I wish we had purchased sooner. I love being able to set it for a range of temps, rather than having use one temp for the summer and another for the winter. Being able to monitor our home's temp while we are on our three-week vacation in the winter makes it much easier to relax while we're away, as we can see the temp while we are gone and call or message someone if we need to have it checked. The controls are very intuitive, and it is very attractive rather than industrial. We had first seen it in a newly-remodeled bar and grill while on a vacation, and I was impressed enough to ask the owner what it was and how it worked. I then began researching that type of thermostat, spending several months reading articles and reviews and eliminating certain brands. The Nest seemed to stand out from the crowd, and when I found out that our daughter -- who owns rentals and pinches pennies like no other -- had bought one, I know that I was on the right track. It was easy to install, so easy that I wondered if it could be right because I assumed that something which does so much must be harder to install than it was. The one of the best features of the Nest will work only if you have wireless, so if you don't have wireless, you won't be able to monitor it while you are away. We use the WeatherBug app (iOS and Android) for weather, and it works with Nest to help us to monitor both the interior and exterior temps.  It shows us how much money we would be saving or wasting monthly and annually by using various interior temps, allowing us to change the temp in a section called ""Thermostat vs Cost"" without actually adjusting the Nest. It also has a section called ""Energy Meter"", and shows what today's cost will likely be based upon the predicted weather that day and with our Nest current temp setting. I would certainly buy this Nest again and tell people about it on a regular basis.",The best ever!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Sep 2015,M Star,"First of all, it's so sexy! Beautiful thermostat, super easy to use, and to install if you avoid some of my pitfalls. They even provide you with a screwdriver, labeling stickers and super easy online installation video as well as install booklet! So here are my pitfalls. I turned off the A/C breaker, but not the furnace breaker. Mine wasn't labeled, so I thought they were one and the same. But Nest self diagnoses, so I was able to figure out that my red wire wasn't getting connected properly. Nest has incredible customer service. Online was very easy to use to trouble shoot and when that failed, on the phone  (and there wasn't really a wait to get a real person!) the rep was super nice, very helpful, walked me through everything and when that didn't work they paid for a technician to come out and diagnose the issue. I was blown away! To make the story short, when I didn't shut off the furnace breaker, I shorted a fuse in the furnace and nothing I was going to do was going to fix it to get my HVAC going again. The Nest  approved technician that came out fixed it in a jiffy and was also pretty awesome. Now I have an awesome working system! Can connect from my phone, net, senses when I am home, learns, and will hopefully save me some $!","Beautiful thermostat, super easy to use"
"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2016,James Sadler,"I bought a new place and one of the first things on my to-do list was to replace the old and basic programmable thermostat with something ""smart."" My friend has a comparable Honeywell model which he loves, but I went with the Nest since it will hook up to more ""smart"" home components once those mature a little more. Also there was a black friday deal so it was at the same price point as some of the cheaper competitors. I really like the design as it reminds me of those old school thermostats with the rotary setting. The UI and is pretty straight forward and once everything is setup there really isn't much need to dive into it. Installation was easy since I was just replacing an existing system, that already had the wires labeled. The wires just clip into spring loaded clips. I wondered if I had them in far enough, but they just go in until the wire stops, so it is pretty easy. Since I was replacing an older, rectangular model, I used the provided base plate to cover up the area that hadn't been painted behind it. The installation looks clean. Setup/sync with the phone was pretty straight forward. Just follow the instruction and one should be good to go. It is a little weird in that our heater kicks on every so on for about 30 seconds. I am guess that it does this to constantly pump a little bit of heat into the house so that it isn't having to run for longer periods later to try and compensate for a colder ambient temperature or something. The weather has been rather moderate lately though so we haven't seen it have to do any substantial heating or cooling yet, but our house always seems to stay at the desired temperature, or above. I am curious how our bill will look, but I am guessing it will be pretty good, though I wont have anything to compare it to since I replaced the old one the day after we moved in. Yes this thermostat costs more than a traditional programmable thermostat, but it should save us a great deal of money over the next year or two, plus there are some decent rebates from the electric and gas companies where we live, so it puts it into the same ballpark. It just makes too much sense to swap the old ""dumb"" thermostats for these newer, smart ones.",Why wouldn't you?

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2016,B. Roche,"This is the second wifi thermostat I have had. I had trouble with the last one because the company's website was NOT stable - meaning I sometimes couldn't control my thermostat using wifi.  I have NOT had any trouble so far with the Nest thermostat's website being unstable. I chose the Nest thermostat because I thought it would work with my HVAC system wires.  I had a horrible time setting up my last wifi thermostat and I didn't want to go through that again!  I do NOT have a ""C"" wire on my system, but the Nest website said my four wires (red, yellow, blue and green) would work with no problem - and THEY WERE RIGHT!  I had NO trouble installing this thermostat - it took me about 15-minutes and everything work flawlessly as soon as I turned the power back on to my system. I also love the app for this thermostat.  The other day I was still in bed with the shades down and I pulled out my iPad to turn up the thermostat.  I noticed that on the main screen there was snow falling in the background and the weather said ""20-degrees and Snowing"".  I opened up the blinds and sure enough - it was snowing!  Another thing I really love is the instantaneous response after you set the thermostat - that is a breath of fresh air after my last wifi thermostat.  The thermostat looks very nice on the wall also. It is a ""learning"" thermostat but you have the ability to easily modify and adjust what it has ""learned.""  This is very important to me because I do not have a ""set schedule"" like some people have.  I really love this thermostat and I highly recommend it!","Excellent Thermostat - No ""C"" wire and it works GREAT!"

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Mar 2016,Mark Durstewitz,"I've ordered the Nest 3rd Gen thermostat because I like it's simple yet hi-tech design, and I will update this review once I finish testing it.  I am posting this question here in the meantime, because I see how quickly Nest Staff reply to Amazon customer concerns.  Thank you Nest! I live in Virginia near the coast, and there is a long stretch of many weeks in Spring and Fall where my HVAC system doesn't run at all (like right now).  Since I usually set my thermostat in the summer to 76, and 65 (augmented with a wood stove) in winter, on the Nest thermostat, I would much rather see what the ambient temperature is in the house instead of what the thermostat is set to.  At least give me the option to change the display.  I'd much rather see ambient temperature than a clock face. Just my 2 cents. And now that Alexa talks to the Nest thermostat, I've also sent Feedback to the Amazon Echo folks to please allow me to ask Alexa what the current house temperature is instead of just the outside temp.  Since I can't see the Nest's dial from my living spaces, I'd rather ask Alexa anyway! My Geothermal Florida Heat Pump SE only has 4 wires- G, W, Y and R.  The website compatibility program says the Nest will work, but I've read so many reviews that talk about flaky behavior without a Common wire that I wanted to ask those that already own one without a common wire and have not had any problems. I'm hoping this is the silent majority, since the Nest folks say that 95% of people don't have any problems without a common wire.  I guess all the critical reviews I've read are the other 5%. In my system, there is 28.7VAC between W and R, G and R, and Y and R when the HVAC unit is not running. I can see this potential on the thermostat's terminal board with my multimeter when the Honeywell programmable thermostat is removed. Will this voltage potential charge the Nest when the HVAC is idle, when it is running, or both? Or will I still have to run a Common wire from my HVAC to the baseplate? I ask this, because I've seen conflicting information on both Amazon's consumer reviews and on the Nest community website.  Some say when their system is off for weeks at a time due to mild temperatures, their Nest battery dies.  Others say that in extreme temperatures, their system runs so long that the Nest battery dies and their system never shuts off (in both cases there is no C wire). I know that HVAC's are different--that's why I included the voltages I am seeing when my unit is idle. Does the voltage potential between the three wires and R drop when the unit is running, causing the Nest to then rely on it's battery's charge until the system shuts down again and recharges the battery?  If that's the case, I can imagine the battery will quickly fail because of over-frequent charge and discharge.  Also, in extreme temperatures, if the unit comes on frequently the Nest may never have time to fully recharge between cycles. Thanks in advance!",I've ordered the Nest 3rd Gen thermostat because I like it's simple yet hi-tech design

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2017,Athena,"I really like this product and it works well, but I have one really strong warning:  TAKE A PICTURE OF THE **OLD** WIRING **BEFORE UNHOOKING IT**.  I didn't and I'm still trying to figure out how it was hooked up before to get the wiring right.  I've talked for hours to two different Nest support technicians who both finally gave up and told me to hire an electrician, which I can't afford to do.  So I'm stuck with a system that works well for now because the heat is wired correctly, but the air conditioning still isn't, so it's going to be a big problem when the warm weather returns. A bit more about why I like it: * It's SO easy to change the temp! * I strangely like the little clicks when you turn it  :) * The display is large enough to see what the temp is set to across the room * The system learned our preferences quickly * The motion sensor makes a nice night light when I get up at night (the Nest is in our bedroom) and turns off quickly enough after I go back to bed that it isn't annoying * It's nice to be able to change the temp from my phone -- I haven't done that much so far, but it's nice to know I can -- and that I can also change it when away from home * I like that it changes color for when the system is on (warming up the house) and when it's off (the house is at the set temp) * Except for my wiring issue, set up was relatively easy even for a mom (me) with little DIY or electrical experience What I don't like: * The tech support insists that the circuit breaker has to be turned off from the thermostat before you work on it, but it's only powered by 9 volts, so that really isn't necessary and just adds more work * The menu wasn't quite as intuitive as I'd hoped it would be, and there was a bit of a learning curve to figure it out initially","Great product, but TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR OLD WIRING BEFORE YOU UNHOOK IT!!!!"

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2017,Jeff H.,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items?  Just let me know! Installation was a breeze and it comes with everything you need for labeling your wires.  A couple of different face-plate options which was nice.  Installation took me no more than about 10-15 mins. and it worked like a charm right out of the box after connecting the proper wires.  Attaching to the home network was fast and intuitive and the onboard functionality is fantastic, from the configuration, learning settings, options, display, etc. I've been bragging to my friends about my new nest T-stat and showing it off every chance I get.  The added auto intelligence is great as it learns your desires and the reporting is great as well.  It just looks 'cool'. I'm not sure what else I can say about it other than it was a zero-pain install, fast setup and flawless performance to date.  Being such a good piece of technology, I expected some learning curve or difficulty and it's been set it and forget it for the most part.  The app for the iPhone is good and very convenient.  Again, setup and configuration is very intuitive and easy.  So much easier for the family to adjust as well if desired. I'm considering purchasing a couple of nest cams as well for the front of the house but am undecided if I really want to.  If I do decide to go the route of cams, I'll give Nest fair consideration as long as I want a wired unit. If you're looking at the Nest T-stat, it's because you are wanting something 'smarter' for your home.  The price isn't trivial but I'm so glad I purchased it and hoping that it pays us back quickly.  Would most certainly buy this again!",LOVE IT!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Apr 2017,New England Mom,"Overall very happy with our thermostats!  They look great and are incredibly easy to install (check out Nest install video - it saved me hundreds because I ended up doing install myself and didn't need to hire anyony after all).  The thermostats are also user friendly and the phone app is addictive (checking temps, adjusting temps for home and away).  My only criticism.... if your wifi cuts out your Nests go offline and stop working.  This can be a bad thing if the weather is very hot or very cold.  That said - you can choose to set up the Nest offline and it will work fine - like a ""dumb"" thermostat.  The problem only arises when the Nest is connected to the wifi (which is typically why people want it) and then the wifi cuts out.  So make sure you have good reliable wifi service before investing in a Nest.  I actually had to buy a wifi booster for one part of the home because the signal was weak and the Nest kept falling offline.  Once I installed the booster, though (inexpensive - purchased from Amazon) the Nest worked well - no problems.","Modern, energy efficient and very easy to use!"

Seems like a lot of things going on in background to make me wary of the future of this product. Also, ever since installing this Nest thermostat in my house for the main floor a/c, my a/c is, at times, problematic, condenser unit will occasionally make loud noise (requiring me to turn off the unit, wait 15 mins and start it again) and has trouble keeping the set point. Never used to have this problem with old thermostat. I had several a/c companies out to review the situation and check condenser and heating unit it connects to. None of them found any issues with condenser, or TXV valve inside, etc. They seem to suggest that their confidence in Nest products is not that high. Not sure if battery can't stay charged enough to do things from time to time? or worse? Trouble within the workings of the product. The same Nest unit I purchased for lower level a/c is working as expected. I really wanted this to work. The one good thing about it is being able to turn system off/on or change temps as needed from anywhere via my cellphone. Since I'm forever having to turn my a/c off and on to clear issues with setpoint temps, that has been helpful as I don't have to keep going back and forth to either of the two Nest Thermostat units in my house. I'm beginning to consider whether I should try other manufacturers' smart thermostats instead.",Seems like a lot of things going on in background to ...

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Sep 2016,Peter P,"I have been using the Nest Thermostat for about 2-3 months now. I found the product to be easy to install, about 20 minutes total. The system just runs the AC in the house, but I have another on order for the heating system. At it's basic level, the thermostat does exactly what it is supposed to, turns on and off the AC as needed and keeps the house at the right temperature. Looking at what makes this thermostat more special, it make more sense as to why people spend the money they do on these. The auto-away feature can ensure you are not unnecessarily cooling (or heating) the house, mine is tied to my phone gps, but there is also the device itself that detects if someone is home. If you expand the nest eco system and have the protects installed, these can also be used to determine if anyone is home. The app also adds to the value of this product, with an easy to use and simple interface, but also the ability to control your temperature from anywhere. My simple use case for this was when I went on vacation for a week, the auto-away set the house to 80. At the start of my drive home I could see the house was at 80, and was able to overwrite the auto-away and have the house cooled down to 71 by the time I got home. Very nice to walk into. One feature I would like to see is an integration with Waze, even if done through IFTTT. If I say I am going home, have the system heat or cool the house to a preset temperature in time for me to walk through the door. Google owns both companies, so it would be great to see! I would highly recommend this thermostat. Check the wiring to make sure it will work for you first though: nest.com/works. Also, look at the negative reviews, if the manufacturer is responding, it is a sign they are committed to actually solving issues that arise.",I found the product to be easy to install

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2015,franko,"My old thermostat required 4 wires (green, red, yellow, white). When you plug in that combination into the www.nest.com web site for compatibility, it says it will work. Yes, it will work BUT without having a common wire (blue) to charge the battery, it will take power from one of the other triggers. (default is fan (green), I believe) When it triggers the green wire, the fan turns on. Not good when it turns on at 3am and you are sleeping. I called customer service and the spent over half an hour trying to trouble shoot and to convince me my HVAC is confused. He even wanted to know if my old thermostat had the same problem. They know this 'trickle charge' is an issue with a four-wire system, yet, they don't mention that as a caveat for their product. I believe they want you to buy it then try to get some pro or someone to correct the issue, claiming their product is smart and smarter than me. Even if most systems out there will comply with a common wire, at the least, they would have happier customer/customer service if they were up-front with technical issues. Mostly, I don't care for their customer service. I was able to YouTube at video explaining a common wire and HVAC setup. Luckily, my wire bundle is a fire wire bundle and I connected the blue wire to the common terminals on both sides. One other comment: THE MAIN READING IS THE TARGET TEMP. THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THAT TO SEE THE CURRENT TEMP. WHEN YOU'RE WALKING BY IT, YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE TARGET TEMP BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SET IT AT OR WHEN IT IS OFF TO SEE A BIG 'OFF'. WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THE CURRENT TEMP. AT LEAST HAVE THE OPTION OF BEING ABLE TO SEE SET OR CURRENT TEMP AS MAIN READING. After reading multiple reviews, these are common issues. To me, both of these issues seem easy to remedy or maybe I'm not as smart as my thermostat.",No common wire / Main reading is set temp / Nest customer service is terrible

At Christmas time I had a few extra bucks to blow on SOMETHING small for the house. Amazon was offering a $50 card with the purchase. I said, ""What the hell."" I'm VERY pleased with it. I used to HATE programming my old thermostat. I never really got the old one tweaked the way I wanted it. The Nest Thermostat was easy to install (Instructions are great.) and super easy to adjust and program....while lying in bed! It's exciting for a few days, then it becomes just another appliance. It works really well though, and you'll like the monthly reports. Two features you have to experience to appreciate: 1> set a time and temperature schedule and it will be that temperature AT that time, not start at that time. If you wake up at 8AM, you'll have a warm house AT 8 AM not a cold house with hot air blowing out the vents trying to make it warm. 2> Presence detection and the auto-turn off of HVAC when no one is home - it does make sense and seem to save energy/money. I live in Southern California. I really don't need HVAC that much. It's March now. I haven't had heat on in over a month and I don't foresee AC on for another 3 months. But I now love my Nest Thermostat and smile at it when I walk by it in the hallway. p.s. I went and bought two of Nest's  smoke detectors.

Two of them have similar wiring setups and the 3rd is forced air a/c and heat. I have had problems with all 3. The forced air one initially was setup without a c wire and powered off over the coldest weekend this winter while I was away causing my pipes to freeze. I had to add a c wire and the issue now is that it keeps going into away mode even with setting a schedule. The other 2 thermostats had their bases short out. I turned off the power to put the trim plate on one I put the wires back in turned on the power and it shorted out both thermostats on that circuit. Nest kept me on the phone for about an hour running through the wiring and turning my power off and on then getting a volt tester and checking the wiring. What happens when my warranty is up? There is obviously a design flaw in the base. I like the convenience of the wifi thermostats, but would go with another brand if I had to start over.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Oct 2016,Simon Bernick,"Hello, experienced reviewer here. I've been buying online and off amazon for years and I always research products before buying them. This thermostat is hands down one of the best home improvements I've ever made for number of reasons.  Let me start with some of the basics: 1. It looks great, the sleek design really makes something (thermostats) which was once boring a cool home feature. 2. Solid construction (metal and glass), it looks and feels like its not just some piece of electronic junk from China. 3. Easy installation, if you've set up a new iphone you can install this. Now for some of the other features that really bring this home.  First, you can get rebates on buying a smart thermostat.  I got $100 from my electric company (Comed) and $50 from my gas company (Peoples Gas) so this only actually cost me $100 to buy.  Second, not only does the thermostat turn off when you aren't home (saving you money), but it can also participate in hourly pricing programs (if your provider offers them).  My Nest automatically lets me know when the price of electricity goes above 10 cents a kWh in my area and I can choose to turn it off.  So between the two features I'm actually saving a lot of money on utilities and it paid for itself very quickly.  Add on top of that the learning feature which figures out what temperature you like based on your past settings and the ability to change the temperature without getting off the couch and this is a no brainer. Final Advise: Check to see if your gas and electric utilities offer a rebate for installing a smart thermostat, and if your electric company offers hourly pricing.  If the answer is yes then buy this product ASAP.  If not, I'd still suggest getting it.  You won't save as much money but you still will save some and its really a great product in and of itself.",This can save you a ton of money

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2016,Edward Babb,"I love this thermostat.  Beautiful design, and without the cover plate, it has a very small footprint.  Installation was tricky, as the instructions seemed to indicate that the ""C"" wire was not needed, but it was.  The battery drained in hours without the C wire, and it did not seem to operate the fan.  Checked out numerous YouTube videos, and found that the C wire really was needed.  Since the wire was present in the wire bundle at the mounting location, I hooked it up, and then nothing worked.  The Nest did not even turn on.  Eventually I discovered that the other end of the wire was disconnected at the control box in the attic!  Once I connected that everything worked beautifully. Some complain that the display should show the current room temp, not the set temp.  If you spin the dial slightly, it will show the current temp as well as the set temp.  Not a big issue, but might be nice if there was as option to change the default. Overall, a great product, but expensive. If you need more than one (I did), be ready to spend some real cash.","Great product, once you get through the installation."

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Dec 2016,Michael Bures,"I considered getting earlier versions of the Nest thermostat, but I kept putting it off primarily because of the price and owners' reviews that indicated some dissatisfaction. I'm glad now that I waited. There was a temporary $50 mark-down this summer on the new 3rd generation version, so I bought two for slightly less than $200 each. Each box included a nice Phillips/common screwdriver, and installation was quick and easy for my central air/gas furnace systems. All functions are very intuitive. You can let the Nest program itself based on your first week's use, or you can set or modify the programming yourself. Remote temperature adjustment and programming via wifi has proven to be equally easy, and it is handy for when your routine changes. Did you leave home earlier than usual and forget to set the thermostat back? No problem! You can do it via the app with just a few clicks and swipes. Even better, you can link your mobile phone numbers to your account, and your Nest thermostat will automatically adjust to its ""away"" settings when it detects all mobile phones linked to the account have departed. There are other cool features you can read about elsewhere. Suffice it to say I was impressed enough with the first two that I bought a third one when they were marked down again during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend. The Gen 3 Nest does everything and more than I would have thought to ask from a thermostat. I'm a very satisfied (3X) customer.",I'm glad now that I waited

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2015,NickH,"Overall a great gadget. A big upgrade in functionality, style, and technology over my old digital programmable thermostat. Setup was made very easy with the website, instruction booklet, and app. Follow the steps, give it as much information as you can, and it'll steer you in the right direction. I'm fairly handy around the house, but I felt like almost anyone could have installed this unit within an hour or two. Its only been installed for a few days, so I can't comment on energy savings or long-term durability, but the front-end experience was very nice. Quick shipping, nice packaging, easy instructions, easy install, and slick user interface. I have a heat pump A/C system, with emergency/aux heating strips, along with a variable speed AHU fan. Nest was able to control all of the functions right out of the box, and has plenty of capacity to handle upgrades like humidifier/dehumidifier, filter, 2-stage heat or cool, etc. Having the Android app available to change temp from anywhere (especially while laying in bed in the middle of the night) is great. Changes are instantaneous. Within 2 seconds of touching my phones screen I can hear the unit kicking on.  If anything, it may be too fast to react.  I can be clumsy and if I accidentally set it the wrong direction I wouldn't want my system kicking on and then immediately off.","Great gadget, and most feature-rich thermostat available on the market."

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2017,Brian R,"Very lack luster. Looks good on the wall and I can ""control"" it from my phone but that's about the only useful features that this has that other thermostats don't. The UI is very clunky and a time consuming to setup properly, you can't make it automatically switch modes in the scheduler. My bills have not improved and the monthly ""savings reports"" are flooded with advertisements. Basically I paid $250 for $30 worth of hardware. Would not recommend. Update 3 Mo. Later : I removed a star. No improvements made after a release of a 'newer' product which honestly looks worse than the original. Still lacks features that Honeywell and others come with. Everyone who gave this a 5 star were clearly just fanboys of a product that has completely stalled in development.",Lacks MANY Features

(no deal, it cost the same everywhere). It's worth every penny. This is one of the finest products that I've ever reviewed. Easy to install. Tell the Nest web site your thermostat wire colors and they'll tell you if your system is compatible and send you a diagram of how to install it. It can be controlled by any smart phone or device. You can control it remotely, when your out and about anywhere. My wife controls it with our Logitech Harmony Remote Control (home entertainment controller) unit which it is compatible with. The device knows when your not home and will control your environment to your preset settings. I'm very impressed with this product and would highly recommend it.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Sep 2016,Fred,"We have a house with three HVAC systems: not our choice, but that's the way it works out with a small house added to twice over 70 years.  So I purchased three Nest thermostats.  The cost was partly covered by by my local utilities (ComEd; $100 per; limit of two and Nicor Gas $50 each). Packaging is beautiful, instructions are clear.  Each Nest comes with a very nifty screwdriver, which is the only tool you'll need.  Working and reading carefully, the first one took me about fifteen minutes to install.  The second and third took less than five minutes apiece.  Basic process: you use the labeling / terminal markings on your old thermostat to identify the purpose of each wire (in my case, four).  Then you plug them into the labeled, spring mounted connection points on the Nest mount.  Click on the display, and you're good to go. The real joy is the simplicity of operation.  You just turn the dial to get more or less heating/cooling.  After a couple of weeks, you never touch the dial again; the Nest has figured out what you like and programmed itself.  It notices when you're around, and it saves energy when you're not.  The phone app and the web interface are models of clarity. Fiddling around with three different, tacky, unclear, disconnected old-fashioned thermostats was a tremendous time-waster and caused far too much hassle (""Did you turn it down?  What about upstairs?"").  Now it just happens, and it is such a pleasure.",Smart enough to be wonderfully simple.

The design is sleek, simple, and looks great on the wall.  The installation was extremely quick considering what was being installed.  There was a page on Nest's website that I had referred regarding wiring for my old thermostat vs Nest wiring prior to the Nest arriving so I was easily able to get the Nest installed.  I highly suggest you find that resource on their site and look at it prior because it made the switch extremely easy.  The bonus of Nest is that they includes a screwdriver, the stickers to label wiring before disconnecting old thermostat, and the plate for behind the Nest.  I was hesitant to spend the price but it was well worth it once I was able to actually see the quality. I love the functionality of the Nest.  I see no issue with how they have the display.  The screen is black when it detects no motion, turns to the set temperature upon initial motion detection, then switches to the actual temp along the edge after a few seconds.  I generally am more concerned with the set temp if the system is on rather than the actual temp so this is not something that bothers me.  I like that I can control the system with my Echo or Nest app.  The away feature is another added bonus.  This is a purchase I am completely happy with.",Great addition to the house!

If you want to be 100% sure of compatibility, remove the casing of your old thermostat & take some pictures of it. Then go to the Nest website and chat with an agent. You can send them the pictures and the will confirm which models would work with your domicile's wiring and email you a PDF of the instructions to use. 3/5 Software/ Networking The only issue I have with this device is trying to get it to connect to the internet. It works fine if you have a home with your own network that you control, but if you live in an apartment which has central wifi controlled by a password it is a huge pain to get to connect. With out being connected you will lose a lot of the advanced features, including the novel temperature control app. The software/GUI on the device is great and easy to use, the App for Android is great and easy to use, getting the Nest to connect to a network was a huge pain. 5/5 Does what is was supposed to do, controls the temperature effectively and efficiently.

Has a little trouble due to the fact I had 3 Airport Extreme / Express units due to being a large house and all 3 were set to use the same SSID.  Has never caused issues with any other devices, but the Nest would often disconnect and could not connect again.  I suspect it was getting confused between all the signals.

According to Nest customer support: ""Currently the countries supported to use Nest products are the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Ireland, or the Netherlands"" as of December 2016. The web site for Nest Home is misleading in that it suggests the thermostat may work in Mexico, middle east, Russia, China, or a lot of European countries, but that is not the case. The problem is that the thermostat synchronizes the clock and the weather information with data gathered from the Internet. To get this data it needs a ZIP code or a Postcode during the configuration of the Nest Home account. No way around it. So, unless the ZIP code or Postcode for that country is supported by Nest, it is not going to work right. Even the clock will be off. It seems like this thermostat is very much USA-centric, with a handful of countries as an afterthought.",Does NOT work in most foreign countries.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jul 2016,Chiengineer,"Good, but still lacking ability for user to calibrate temperature. I replaced a programmable thermostat with the Next smart thermostat. I like the 3rd Gen, but it is still lacking one feature that I believe is mandatory in any instrumentation: allowance for the user to calibrate it. My house was built in 1919, and the thermostat is located on a partially interior wall (just inside of a sun room) with southern exposure and no insulation. On my old thermostat, I could manually compensate for the fact that this wall is typically 3 degrees hotter than all other areas of the house. When it's 74F in the living areas, the wall around the thermostat reads 77F. Nest does not allow manual calibration to compensate for this. As a result, the A/C runs continuously even after the house is cooled down. Obviously, the Nest is doing a good thing by forcing me to relocate my thermostat to an interior wall (the correct installation location). However, it's still a PITA to do this, and there is no need for me to relocate the thermostat if the Nest had the ability to be calibrated. Bottom line: Smart devices are great, but they still need human intervention to work correctly. I feel that many people will install this device with the same mistake without realizing it. Please give thumbs up or comment if my advice helps.","User Cannot Calibrate Temp, Be Careful What Wall You Install Nest On, LESS Efficient if Installed Wrong!"

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Apr 2018,The Animaster,"The one I received has an ugly bump on the motion sensor part. I’ve never notice this ugly bump in any demo unit at Home Depot or in online reviews. Why does mine have an ugly bump? I’m returning it. $2 more now. Please make sure the next one doesn’t have an ugly bump. Are we receiving previously-returned merchandise by ordering online? Seems to be a trend these days. My Nest looked as if it was handled previously — slight marring on the back and the stainless steel was — blemished. It did not have that “wow” factor or the scent of fresh electronics. I’m disappointed. Hoping my next one doesn’t have any ugly bumps, marrs, scars ... most of all hope it works. For $219 (previously $217) it better damn well be perfect. Update: got a second one. Compared. Turns out the first one also had a slight gap on the right side. Second one had a slight marr on the steel wheel. Turns out the first one has a better shaped plastic area though! After installation though, that bump and everything disappears... I’m putting this one star from last. Had fun installing it too — of all wires to touch, R and C did!! But it was a lesson that needed to be learned — and thanks to this I now know the inside of my HVAC unit, and where to find the fuse. Thanks to YouTube. I almost called a Nest “Pro” but they were all closed. Saved another couple hundred bucks in labor! Will upgrade this to 5 stars if my correspondence with Nest customer support goes well. So far when asked the question — they don’t have a straight answer. Is it a design thing or a bad batch??",Blemishes and imperfections

I have a large home with old style (read: massive) radiators. With my old thermostat I had to manually compensate heat lag. For instance if I wanted the temperature in the house to be 70 degrees I had to set the thermostat to 63 because the large radiates held so much heat. My children, being the prodigies that they are, never understood this. They would turn the heat up to 70 and act like they were were dieing when the temperature was flirting with 80. They would panic and turn the temperature all the way down (inevitably leaving us with a near frozen home the next morning) , even though I explained to them that burying the needle wouldn't cool the house down any faster. The Nest automatically learns and accounts for this. If I want the temperature to be 70 degrees I can actually set the thermostat to 70! I don't know if it has actually saved me any money (yet) but I like the fact that I see my day to day energy usage. As of right now the system only stores 2 weeks of energy usage. I wish it would store the data indefinitely. I also wish it would display, store, and graph the inside and outside temperatures.",Great product.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Dec 2015,xenoc,"This is a very well constructed, solid and beautiful bit of technology that does one thing well - keeps your house in the temperature range you want it.  Installation was very simple (and Im a modest handyman at best) and took 15 minutes.  Connection to my Wi-fi (Apple Airport Extreme), set-up and app downloading and setup (iPhone 6S) was also simple, intuitive and flawless.  I was concerned about the reviews that reported being able to see only the target temperature and not being able to see the ambient temperature but found that both were displayed and readily accessible (although the target temp is larger).  Its also very intuitive and simple to program relatively complex temperature settings for different times of day, when you are work, on vacation and other variations.  One of the few examples of technology where the developers clearly thought long and hard about the users and its simple and intuitive set up and interface are really outstanding particularly for those who really don't want to find the instruction manual every time we want to make a change.  Highly recommended!",superb technology with the user in mind

Labelled one ""upstairs"" and the other ""downstairs.""  Easily added both to master account.  Love being able to work with this from my phone.  Installation was *very* easy... just follow the directions closely.  My downstairs unit was pretty simple (gas heat and AC unit).  Upstairs, there is gas heat, heat pump, *and* emergency heat strips.  Don't be scared!  If you can match colors, you *can* do this yourself.  Took around 15 minutes for downstairs unit and 20 for upstairs (more wires, so I actually labelled them as directed with the sticky labels that are included right in the instruction manual.  Both unit auto-detected correct wiring without a hitch. The intelligence works well; without setting a specific schedule, I adjusted as needed and now no longer need to do this.  They seem to have learned my family's routine.  Also, when I went on vacation recently, it automatically went into ""eco"" mode and kept my house at a cool 65 degrees.  As soon as we walked in the door, the downstairs unit detected us and started warming the house back to normal. Love, love, love this!",Love my Nests!

However, I purchased two for using with my echo and I can't get them to connect. They make it seem that the app is very easy to use and as you will read from other reviewers-not true. Hell, finding the right app is a chore in and of itself. I went to the Apple store and they're two apps that state NEST and one is for an education system and the other for another Google product. They don't make it easy on the NEST site because this is a Google owned product and Google and Amazon are in some type of war right now. I am sure many of you have a Google Play account but I don't; I only use the Apple store and signing up for Google Play and all of the information they want from you is absolutely too much. Damn it, it's too much! I have never seen a request to surrender so much information so I won't use this app. I hope we start getting some EU type privacy for consumers in the US. TP-Link is also part of the Google system and personally, I just don't want Google in charge of my entire life.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Sep 2017,Jessie,"We got a rebate through our state or federal or something, so it was only $144, I think. It does some of the things it is advertised to do. It does control temperature. It does look cool. Being able to control the A/C from my bed is basically why we bought this. So in that respect, I like it. BUT my old one basically did the same thing, and honestly, I think it kept the temperature more consistent than this one. Sometimes, with the Nest, a 73 will feel hot, but the next day a 76 will feel quite cold. I haven't noticed any savings in our power bill, but Nest insists on telling me I'm ""more Eco-friendly than 87% of the Nest-users around you"" in emails. Who really knows. The Home-Away assist thing functions sometimes, but not all the time. That could be because my Motorola Moto X sometimes reports me at home when I'm really not, so I couldn't fairly dock a star for that. The ""Airwave"" feature just runs your fan to circulate the air without the A/C running, which I actually love, and I wish it would turn on more frequently. Other than that, this is a thermostat. It works.","Basically, it's a $240 app that lets me turn the temp down from my bed. Too bad, I really like that feature..."

I have no idea what “behavior” it uses for “learning”, but created schedules are definitely based on our adjustments. Waking up to house excessively warmed up (in winter) or cooled down (in summer) on Nests whim has become so frustrating that I have finally turned off all of its “smart” features. When one adds to this absolutely horrible stability of network integration with other Nest products (in the past year had to reset all the devices numerous times as that is the only option that customer support will provide), the only usable and desirable feature remains the ability to control it remotely.

Phone support (from Nest) said it was defective. The seller here replaced it. Nest support said that one too was defective and both times they said if we bought it from Amazon it was probably a refurbished product. Yet it had only been on the market (generation III) for about 2 months so that wasn't possible. The 2nd Nest support tech sent us a new base unit.  It doesn't work. Several hours of electrician time later and because of his scheduling it's no longer returnable.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Apr 2016,Ms. T,"Update 5/24 - I hate this thermostat more every day.  It seems like it goes to sleep (away mode is disabled) and doesn't see that the temperature has risen above the set temperature until I open the app, then it suddenly realizes the temp is higher and will kick the ac on.  I can see turning off the screen to save battery, but the stupid thing should never go to ""sleep"" like I'm pretty sure it does.  Today it let my indoor temp get up to 79 when I have it set for 75!!!!  This is unacceptable.  For a so called smart thermostat - it sure is dumb!  I can't wait to replace it with a real thermostat that actually works the way a thermostat should. Like others have mentioned - it's temperature reading is not accurate.  Now that it is warming up in houston, the temp reading is 3 degrees lower than actual temps (I set another thermostat right next to it to check it -  the actual inside temp will be 78deg, the thermostat is set to 76deg and it reads 75deg so it doesn't ever cool to desired temperature unless I overide the schedule, oddly enough, as soon asi i go in and set the desired temp down a degree or two, then the temp reading will suddenly jump a deg or two to at least get closer to the real temp). I find that I am constantly having to open the app and set the desired temp lower just so it will kick on and cool the house below 78deg.  This is really unacceptable for a ""smart"" thermostat that costs this much.  Like others, I will probably replace it with the Ecobee in the near future.  Right now, the only benefit I get for all the money I spent is that I can control it via wifi.  But I could've spent a lot less and gotten the same thing, and a thermostat that actually reads the correct temperature.",I hate it!!

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2017,Dale Yuzuki,"Surprised that it took a broken programmable thermostat for me to realize that the main benefit of a Nest is energy savings. Yes the Nest is expensive (the broken Honeywell would have cost $150 in parts alone, but would have only needed one for a two-zone system), but realizing the energy savings over time (we'll see if it's 10-15% as I read on the Nest website) it should pay for itself soon enough. Installation was a snap - the instructions are really clear, we have a somewhat typical 2-zone, 4-wire low-voltage thermostat system with a red 'common' wire from a house built in the 1970's. Took less than 30 minutes to install two of them, and the white faceplate covered up the unpainted area perfectly. Love the ability to remotely set the HVAC onto 'eco' mode, or to turn it up/down from my phone whereever I may be (including in bed late at night or early in the AM). Be sure to look into rebates from your electricity or gas supplier, they may offset the cost of installation. (The one offered locally was for $100 off of a professional installation.) However in my case being handy it was definitely an easy-to-do project.",Love the ability to remotely set the HVAC onto 'eco' ...

As a wired product, I expect to be able to connect to it any time.

I took away a star because when I tried to enter the code into my Android phone it would not accept single letters. I believe this was related to the auto spell feature of the phone. This page should temp shut off the auto spell feature so it can work. I had to use a bluetooth keyboard I own to finish the setup. I still highly recommend this item.,Fantastic technology

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Mar 2018,Amy B.,"Thought this would be an upgrade from our old basic thermostat. Boy was I wrong. Power goes out during a terrible snowstorm and our generator kicks on like it always does. With our old thermostat, the generator would continue to run our heat. With the nest, an error message comes on, the heat kicks off and refuses to come back on. Customer service tells my husband he has to go outside in two feet of snow and manually shut off my generator, go down in the basement and shut off the furnace, unplug electrical wires, leave live wires out, told him to use electrical tape to wrap two wires, and then it kicks back on. Who is this lady from Nest customer service and how is she qualified to give my husband instructions on messing around with our generator, my furnace and electrical wires? He doesn’t know what he’s doing with this stuff! Is it safe when my power gets restored and kicks back on? Will there be a spark? Isn’t the beauty of a $20,000 built in generator system that we SHOULDN’T have to go outside and manually shut off and turn my generator on to get the heat on? Absolutely ridiculous!!!",Power goes out during a terrible snowstorm and our generator kicks on like it always ...

The remote management is great and the installation was easy. The instructions were clear and the website allows you to see if your system is compatible (wire wise) with the nest. It connected to my wireless system immediately and the firmware upgrade came over quickly. I wish that you could schedule the firmware upgrade or actually install it immediately (this could become an issue in the future if a firmware update bricks something) but this has so far not been an issue. The nest does tend to be a bit noisy on the network but I was able to manage this by placing it on its own separate vlan and doing some qos.

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Mar 2016,OHM,"Easy to set up myself and I like being able to control it via Wi-Fi when away from home. However I have found it runs 1 degree off from what is set. Example: If I set the temp to 68, it only warms to 67 (although the Nest shows 68 when the heat turn off). The reason I know this to be true is that I have a digital thermometer in the same room and it always shows 1 degree cooler than what the Nest says. This is only in the heating mode. Once it gets cooler out and I start running the air conditioner I will be back to follow up. Don't know it'll run a degree cooler (or warmer) on AC mode. This device replaced a fully functional non Wi-Fi device which did not exhibit the same temperature anomaly. More to follow ...",Small Temperature Anomaly?

Installation was super easy maybe 20 minutes total.  Follow the directions, open the app finish in the app.  Done.  I did have to patch the wall some behind where the old thermostat was.  Love the interface.  Super easy.  Also love that I can just tell alexa to turn up the heat.  Lazy I know.  Works seamlessly.  I have only had it installed for about a month, but it appears to be learning perfectly so I am saving money on my heating right now.  PG&E offered a rebate of $50.  I will say however that getting this rebate was much harder than installing the thermostat.  Overall I would say it is a great purchase.  I have a friend who just had an ecobee installed.  He likes that one for his much larger house due to the other temperature units set in his house to measure for cold spots.

The Nest app and website connects to the thermostat each time I go on and new temperature selections reflect on the thermostat in approximately 2 seconds. I wish the thermostat could use your phone's location to recognize that you are at home to prevent auto-away from activating without the use of third-party apps. Its not too bothersome and I admit auto-away is handy for the times where you stay late at work and can rest knowing electricity isn't being wasted to cool/heat an empty home. Wished there were graphs in the app and website so you can see and compare your usage comparing week to week, month to month, and eventually year to year. Scheduling temperature ranges for the Cool/Heat mode is quite useful and easy to do on the website and app. For seasonal transitions and bipolar Texas weather this is a blessing! Update 9-14-15: Still working great. The thermostat has begun to start setting auto-away when I leave now. I'm not sure as to how much money I will save using the Nest, but I hope to see the Nest live up to what it says it can do. The Nest app has worked almost flawlessly with only 2 errors in connection shortly after I first set up the Nest. My Netgear router appears to work well with the Nest. Original review: Installed the thermostat easily without any problems. Connected the Nest thermostat to a new Nest account online which I had no problems doing and connected it to my google account. The Nest phone app appears to work quickly and the Google app accepts voice commands for my thermostat. The far-sight feature is very responsive with a very clear screen display of the temperature (or time if you choose to have that display instead at a glance and temperature show up when you get closer and touch the thermostat to make adjustments). Hopeful to see how convenient this thermostat will be and I will update with how the learning software works after I give it some more time.",Great thus far

I did find the nest website was hard to navigate for help. the set up instructions are simple but because it was open box it recommended calling the 800 number for help resetting it. The tech support was fast and friendly, but if the website was easier I could have done it all myself. All they did was tell me to charge it and do a system reset which wasn't all that hard. The set up is simple as long as you charge it, I could not find any information on needing a charge or how long a charge lasts. The positive is it's easily programmable, and easy to use on your phone. Very simple to turn the heat up and down, and the unit feels very solid. Good buy, much better than an old digital thermostat.

I almost did not buy this due to several previous reviewers warning that there would be problems with the functionality of this thermostat if I did not have a Common (C) wire. I took a step-by-step approach to reassure myself that this would work with my current system. I removed the facing of the old thermostat to determine which wires were coming from my furnace; then I went to the Nest website which will tell you if your wiring setup is compatible with this thermostat (just click the boxes indicating which wires you have). Voila, it was compatible. Great customer service experience #1: Even though the Nest website assured me that my system was compatible, I was still thinking of the previous reviewers' comments. I took a photo of my old thermostat's wiring system and emailed it to Nest. A couple of minutes later, I called customer service; they pulled up my photo, told me which colored wire goes to each lettered location on the Nest thermostat, and gave me that added reassurance. I do not consider myself handy around the house, but I had no problem removing the old thermostat and installing and wiring the Nest. When I began the online process of linking the thermostat with the Nest app, I had some questions which I could not readily find answers for in the literature. That is when I experienced ... Great customer service experience #2: I called Nest support on Thanksgiving Day, and a real live person answered. The first words out of my mouth were: ""Thank you for being there on Thanksgiving"". He walked me through the process until the thermostat and app were communicating with each other, and he sent me a link to their knowledge database. This morning, when I awoke, I had a whole new routine. I reached over to my smartphone, launched the Nest app, and turned on my furnace ... all from the comfort of being snuggled under my comforter.",Changed my life ... for the better!

Bought 4 of these for 2 homes with 2 zones each. Took 1/2 hour for first install. 20 minutes for the others. The biggest problem was the way my existing (badly installed) wiring came out of the wall. Had to do a little surgery... The Nest install web site and video make the install quite easy and confirm exactly which wires go where on the Nest. Beautiful design. I like the plate they provide to cover any holes in the wall behind. Love the ability to control all 4 units through the Nest smartphone app. Or we can control with Alexa in each home (Alexa, lower first floor to 72 degrees!!). Also, the learning function is very neat. Yes, these are pricey. But, I believe they will save money over the long run, particularly if you are replacing a non-programmable thermostat.

It took about 30 minutes to install and I really liked how it walked through the setup, testing the furnace, fan, and if it were warm enough, the AC response. I look forward to all the features the Nest Learning Thermostat offers including home safety and energy tracking/savings.",I knew I would love the interface after watching videos online and reading displays ...

"Google T3007ES Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation, Stainless Steel, Works with Amazon Alexa, 1",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jul 2017,B. Sutton,"I've only had it installed for a few days, and love it! I opted for the White version, and I'm glad I did. It looks great! Very simple to set up, and lots of nifty features. If you need any help, check out the sub for Nest on Reddit. Please over there are great about answering questions fast. I have a Google Home and a few Echo's. The Home seems to have better command support for things like the Nest, but both work much the same. Home: ""OK Google, set the temp to 76 degrees."" Echo: ""Hey Alexa, set the Nest temp to 76 degrees."" I have my Nest named ""Nest"". The default is ""Living Room"" or something similar. Since I only have 1, changing it to simply ""Nest"" makes the Echo commands more intuitive than having to say ""Hey Alexa, set the Living Room temp to 76 degrees"".",Great addition to my smart home!
