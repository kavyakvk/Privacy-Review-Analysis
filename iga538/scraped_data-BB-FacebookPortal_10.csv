"Facebook - Portal Smart Video Calling 10"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,1,23 Nov 2017,nojoyNursinghome,"This was purchased and delivered to my mother in nursing home during COVID.   She could not get it to work.   This was/is during COVID - so could not get anyone from family to step in and setup.  Always the conclusion was that individual attempting to setup was not tech savvy.   

Finally, after 6mos we pass the asset to family for setup.  And it turns out that this unit is broken.    No wonder my mother in nursing home could never set it up. 

lesson learned is that we ship direct to family for setup - then send it to mom in nursing home.    But we are gonna go with different product - this one is unreliable.",nojoy for mom in nursing home

"Facebook - Portal Smart Video Calling 10"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Aug 2020,Reviewer,"The portal has been easy to operate, and as long as you do not setup all the extra features on the portal, even your 96 year old Nana can make and receive video calls.  A Portal and a mifi unit, and we had her up and running within the day.  The longest part of setup was creating a facebook and whatsapp account for her that was locked up tight through all the privacy settings.  One thing to keep in mind is that you will need a device actively running the whatsapp program for the Portal to connect.  We just cloned Whatsapp on one of our cell phones for her new account, and then ignore any incoming whatsapp calls from her account so she has time to answer on the portal.  There may be a cleaner solution, but that is how we set it up, and it has been working well for us.  The Portal app also allows you to upload photos throughout the week that will then appear on the Portal as a digital picture frame when not on use.  Overall, a great product for how we use it.",Keeping Nana connected
"Facebook - Portal Smart Video Calling 10"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Jun 2020,Anonymous,"During this pandemic quarantine, we needed a way to communicate with our grandmother, she not into technological but was able to learn how to operate the portal very easily.  This was a true blessing for us, we were able to call her daily and seeing her was the bonus, the great grandkids call her every night.  The privacy switch is effective and easy to use, she loves the fact that we can tag her on photos and they appear instantly on her screen as a screen saver.  This device does offer many more options, such as music, recipes, Alexa and more.  We will be purchasing more and highly recommend.

2nd Experince:  a client of mine was involved in a terrible accident and was being treated at our local hospital, but required a higher level of care not available in our area and was being transported to specialized hospital 5 hours away, due to the pandemic and family traveling, we recommend to see if hospital would accept this device for family to stay on contact with client, they approved and family is able to communicate with client daily.  They believe the device accessibility is even helping with client’s progress due to being able to still see the family via device.  Thank you Portal!",A must have in every household!!!!
