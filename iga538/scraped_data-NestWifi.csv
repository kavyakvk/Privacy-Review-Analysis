Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Oct 2020,AB,"Not sure why I didn't buy this sooner.  I was running with slow wireless internet (5 to 7Mbs) through most of my home (2200 sq ft).  I read all the reviews and bought the Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router and connected it to my ASUS cable modem.  The setup took less than five minutes, and I now have 99 Mbs from the most distant point in my house from the Nest Router.  I bought this the day before Prime Day, so I missed out on some savings, but I don't care as I finally have fast internet throughout my house and garage.  Buy it, I can't see how you would be disappointed in this product.","Fantastic Router, super easy setup"

Able to use the old units as extenders. New one at the router. My coverage has improved greatly and the speed bump is noticeable too. Pretty cleae the extra speed I pay comcast Fire was not being fully utilized by the old wifi. Easy to install and only slight problem with one of the access points. Had to call tech support and they were great to deal with. Highly recommended.,Nest Wifi is legit

En realidad yo no necesito tener una red con points, el departamento donde vivo es de apenas unos 90m2 asi que con el puro router es mas que suficiente. Ahora tengo todo conectado al router por wifi: Laptop, 2 celulares, 1 tableta, 2 smatwatches, 1 smartTv, 2 smart speakers, 2 camaras que estan todo el tiempo grabando, 1 iRobot, es decir unos 10 dispositivos que a veces estan todos activos al mismo tiempo y no he tenido problemas con la velocidad del internet. Antes me daba cuenta que el modem que el proveedor de internet te da no se daba abasto porque al jugar en linea alguna partida de repende el juego me desconectaba, eso ya no sucede mas.

For that purpose, I am quite happy. It was easily installed. No brainer. I love that I can turn off my son’s computer if he refuses to shut down his games. I can remotely control that even when I am away! I am an WiFi tyrant which gives me power. Lol. My one star short is its signal coverage. Compare to the TP-link I replaced, the signal is one room short, which is annoying because I might have to spend another 150 to get a node. Ahhhh.... $169 was already my limit for a router.

And it does work great for everything in my home except my work phone which runs on a VoIP service. Only after installing it did I hear my clients complaining of choppy audio and then after further investigation I read that you can't turn off SIP ALG as Google doesn't allow you to access these kinds of settings. So if you are just using it for gaming and streaming it's probably great, but for work...not so much.

Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jun 2020,Mike,"I had FiOS at 75/75... Best I was getting through the old Actiontec router and wifi extender was 50/50.  With the Nest WiFi I was getting a consistent 80/60 (solid improvement).  Fast forward and with the gigabit upgrade I am in the 900 ballpark for an Ethernet connection and about 350-400 via WiFi. I did however get the 3 router bundle (as opposed to the WiFi points) and they are connected with an Ethernet backhaul instead of having the access points communicate over WiFi.  Set up was very easy with the home app and each additional router I connected automatically transitioned to a WiFi point without any hassle.  Also disregard the reviews that talk about not being able to use the Google WiFi app... while it is true you set it up through the Home app (and quite frankly can manage the majority of your network from there) you can access the more advanced features in the Google WiFi app.  Now ""advanced"" features is a relative term--if you like to tinker around beyond assigning static IPs and things of that nature look elsewhere.  But for me, I like the straightforward UI and how easy it is to set up schedules, guest networks, and prioritizing devices--really everything your average homeowner needs to run their home network.  If you are upset that you don't have absolute control over nitty gritty details of port management etc. for your office networking, I think it's about time you start looking at equipment built for businesses and/or it's time to invest in some IT resources...but I digress. I looked into a bunch of other mesh networks before selling on the Nest, and so far I am very happy with it.  If you can do it I highly recommend taking the time to run some ethernet to the various router points.",It just works--with a user friendly interface and achieves gigabit speeds.
Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Feb 2020,Harold,"It is not often that I install a technical upgrade that is so very significantly better than what it is replacing.  But this product really is a game-changer! I originally bought a Nest WiFi system with a router and three Nest WiFi points.  I followed the pretty simple instructions, and the installation was amazingly simple.  The whole thing is a paradigm change, since instead of the user worrying about wifi bands and various router parameters, these marvelous little router/points do the ""worrying"" for you -- and you end up with high-powered, very effective solutions. My initial installation was in a private house, where it replaced a single standard router.  We had long suffered with relatively poor wifi when we were not near the router, but had adjusted to that as a fact of life.  That was part of why we over-ordered the Nest WiFi points... we wanted the new system to be good! Installation was a breeze.  The system did what it did all by itself, and in like ten minutes was up and functioning.  Gingerly, out of curiosity, I unplugged the Ethernet cable from my ""main"" PC and connected it to wireless.  The speed tests rated my wireless Internet speed almost as fast as my wired speed! My experience was good enough that I quickly decided I did not need the third Nest Wifi point at all.  I then decided to buy this router and use the now-spare point in an installation in my parents' house.  They had a Google Chromecast installed, so I figured the install might be more complicated, but it was just as quick and just as perfect as my initial install, with the same great results. For my initial install, I had ordered a low-cost Linksys switch, since the Nest Wifi router comes with only one available Ethernet port.  I ended up not needing the switch, although I did install it (and it works fine).  For my second install, I took a chance and didn't bother with a switch.  The wireless reception was good enough that I had no need for a switch whatsoever.  And the back of that house, which, with a TPLink extender had had only poor wifi, now had really good wifi access! The only problems I had with this was that I had a Sonos system installed in my first location, and Sonos and mesh networks didn't seem to get along well (depending on what connected to what, the Sonos apps couldn't find the Sonos speaker systems).  Interestingly, there was some advice online that said something about letting it work itself out, and I just left it alone for a few days, and then it was working just fine!  My Sonos apps could connect to any Nest Wifi point and still find the Sonos system! If you want to spend time tuning the innards of a router technically, this might not be the ideal system for you.  But if you want something that installs very easily and is high-powered and just works (almost magically!) all by itself, this system is just marvelous.","Excellent... A ""Wow!"" Product"
Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Apr 2020,Russell,"The headline for this review pretty much says it all. Nest router has an option called ""Prioritize Stadia Traffic"", which made a HUGE difference when enabled.  Stadia on Google WiFi was laggy, and was when I first installed this router, but not after enabling that option, so I consider this a win, although it was a lot of money -- I couldn't even play Stadia before though, and now it's just like playing Xbox or any other console. If you're just getting this as a standard WiFi upgrade and want to extend your current range or eliminate dead spots, or support more devices, I can't really see that much of a difference.  It did let me use my old Google WiFi in addition to this (as a repeater), but even with this new Nest Router and old Google WiFi, it's still hard to tell if it's any improvement (my problem is probably that I'm being limited by my internet connection, but that's why I can't really attest to this). If you are a Stadia user, I'd recommend buying this in a heartbeat, but if you're not, you might want to wait.  Also, make sure your internet connection isn't a bottleneck first, as is probably my case (my internet connection is maximum 100 Mbps, so I obviously can't even take full advantage of the router's bandwidth, like a lot of people).  I just mainly wanted to vouch that it does improve Stadia performance, which was actually surprising.","Great for Stadia, but not much else."
Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jan 2020,Max Power,"This product is very easy to setup. I used 2 routers no points. The only problem is they do not work well with older devices. My laptop is capable of 100 mbps but I only get ~30 over wifi and only ~13 when plugged in. Yes, it's slower plugged in than on wifi. PS3 only gets about 15 mbps on wifi. The other problem is that Google requires you to share your location with them to setup the device. There's no reason for that except they just want to track you. You also have to share everything about your router with their cloud services if you want to use the tools to test your wifi. Google loves to track people and they use this for that purpose. If you don't want to be tracked turn off the cloud services and uninstall the apps as soon as your system is setup. You don't need to it after the initial setup. Then go to your Google account and make sure location tracking is off and delete your data too",Great with newer devices not so much with older ones

I bought the nest router for an upgrade but I missed the instruction that says you need to factory reset your old devices first WHILE they are connected . its possible to do them manually but it took a lot of time. So ... do a factory reset first and then add your router .BEFORE you do reset though if you have your various devices relabeled .... write down the MAC addresses so its easy to relabel them. and one more thing. I have found the Google safe search to be bad at blocking bad sites so I use the custom dns configuration tool in advanced settings to put in the Family Safe DNS server numbers . Those are 208.67.222.123 and 208.67.220.123. But heres the deal ... even though I was told to use the Google Home ap on my Iphone to control the wifi system currently you CAN NOT change the DNS servers on the Google Home ap .... you have to use the Google wifi ap. Google has no date for when the Home ap will be able to do this. it appears the 2 aps play well together so maybe no big deal but I wasted time trying to figure out why I couldnt change the DNS servers on the Home ap .,DO FACTORY RESET FIRST!!!
Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Sep 2020,MM,"I *really* wanted to like this. I've already got a bunch of Nest products I like a lot--door bell and many smoke alarms [LOVE them]--but surprisingly a different app is needed to manage this Nest product [as of Sept 2020]. What a miss. Setting them up was WAY harder than it should have been. The software LOOKS easy but it just doesn't work well. It takes many attempts to get them work which is a hassle [and I didn't have them too far apart]. It's not a deal breaker hassle--after all this is something to do once, but keep reading. I got these to replace my 7 year old Apple Airport Extremes. The Apples have been wonderful and reliable but I wondered what I was missing with the new Mesh Tech. Boy was I wrong [at least in my environment]. I live in a 100 year old house. four floors. With Ethernet connections everywhere. For my situation, the old Apples COMPLETELY OUTPERFORMED the new Nest Wifi's. Problem 1) The Nest Wifi's can't get internet from ethernet connections like the old Apples do. I've got one of my 3 Apples out in my barn connected with a buried ethernet cable. It works great. The Nest Wifi couldn't get a connection at all--even when plugged in to the ethenet--it's obvious they can't use a ethernet connection. Problem 2) Compared to Apples with a Ethernet connection the Nest Wifi's are half the speed. Speed tests confirm this. My guess is that this product is designed for small single story houses--it probably does that fine--not so with my big houses. Problem 3) Apple's software goes circles around the Nest wifi. Even though it's old. It just works. And it works the first time. Maybe this is because I have ethernet connections, but what a surprise! Problem 4) when I hook up a desktop directly to the Nest wifi it get the speed halved. I kid you not. The old Apples don't do this. Nest Wifi's *really* don't like ethernet connections. In summary, don't be fooled by the beautiful design and slick marketing. This is not a robust product. Mesh might be good for people in different circumstances but If you have a big house stay away. If you have ethernet connections stay away. If you have an old Apple AirPort Extreme system leveraging those ethernet connections that you're wondering about : keep it until a system comes out that makes AC look bad. Google Wifi is running the same AC and clearly isn't built for big old houses or ethernet wiring. Clearly, I should now rewrite my review for a 7 year old Apple AirPort Extreme.",Doesn't Use Ethernet For Satellites

Not much improvement over Google wifi it replaced. I have a gigabit service and did not notice any appreciable gain in download over wifi except on the Pixel 3a XL phone. I placed the Google wifi in bridge mode and for some weird reasons, most of my devices prefer connecting to it even when they are located closer to the Nest Router.

Installation, coverage and speed of the router are great.  I disabled the voice stuff.  You need the Google Home and Wifi apps to get a home configured - that seems silly.  Also, the app will show you the devices connected but it doesn't give you an IP or MAC address for the devices and most of them show as ""Unknown"" so that's frustrating.  You have to use the ""Home"" app to rename a device but it doesn't work always.  The main router in my house is called ""Attic"" because that's the default name chosen by the software.  In the list it shows as ""Attic (main).  It says you can rename it in the Home app but you can't change the room name.  This is shameful Google.","Router is great, Google Wifi App is not so great"

I was planning on using the new WiFi Nest as my router but the WiFi was constantly intermittent. The speed hardwire to the netgear modem was hitting 800/700/600 and the speed from my WiFi never went higher than 150. I spent hours and hours with Google tech support, they were very helpful but did not solved the issue. I call Xfinity and asked them to send me the new modem/router DOCSIS 3.1 and with speeds up to 1gb - just like the Netgear modem I had. After installing the new modem/router from Xfinity I was getting consistent download speeds of 300/400/600/800 on good days. I still had the Google Nest connected so I was able to test the speed from my local modem/router wireless network and the speed when I was connected to the WiFi Nest - at least double speeds from my modem/router.

Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Sep 2020,Melissa Brown,"I purchased this after issues with my Netgear Nighthawk router.  Set up was easy, and simple.  Speed is excellent and range is great.  To note I have an older home built in the 50's roughly total square ft space is 1200.  So all I needed is just the router.  I love that I can see every thing that is connected to the router (even when your not at home as long as you have the google app on your phone or tablet!! You can controll remotely as well!!) I love I can see how much data any given device is using. I do like that you can give priority to certain things connected to the router.  Great for families with kids. Gives you the option to pause internet connectivity at specific times to specific devices! I had to call customer service because when I first installed it I was getting about 65mbps and have 300mbps internet.  I spent probably about an hour with tech support trying to figure out why it wasn't getting over at least 150mbps.  Finally after all the trouble shooting the issue was that the google router assigns which frequency to connect a device to. So most computers get assigned to a 2ghz frequency not the 5ghz.  Cellphones and some tablets get connected to 5ghz. Your smart devices like TV, Android Tv Box will get 5ghz, and small wifi enabled devices connects at 2ghz frequency.  Once I understood that it made sense and was working as it should. However, it would have been nice to be told this first before going through trouble shooting steps. It would have been a shorter support call if they had said that first.  Hopefully other Google Support staff are more knowledgeable, and I just got a newbie. I do like that you can test the internet speed directly through the google app. Very convenient. One thing I do not like about it is that you can not choose which frequency to connect a device at. It automatically assigns the device to a frequency (2ghz or 5ghz). This is a little inconvenient when downloading a large file to your computer. It takes longer because it's only connecting at the 2ghz frequency.  Hopefully they will add that feature with future updates.  It's a small inconvenience for me though.  All around I am very happy with the purchase.",Great Little Router

The device (I have only one) is at the far end of the house because that's where the cable was installed before I bought it. The signal reaches my smart water timer which is on the outside wall at the opposite end of the house like at the longest diagonal you could draw through my home. I used a repeater previously and still had a bad signal in the bedroom that on the same wall only inside.

The integration with Home/Nest is pretty good though as always I am asking myself how long Google will support this hardware or if they will decide to do something horrible to it and then kill it because after they messed with it nobody wanted it anymore... or if they will just not-so-slowly shuffle them.off the update cycle until.they are essentially bricks.",Good but also Google

All of my devices connected quickly, and the app takes care of the rest. I’m concerned that other reviewers aren’t familiar with networking, or google devices, but I can say that if you are, this is the best mesh router on the market. The device uses the google Wifi app to manage the network, similar to what Linksys does with its own app, but google fails to make it clear that setup is done in google home, and advanced network admin can be optionally done in the google Wifi app. The WiFi app isn’t necessary, but it works well.

Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Feb 2020,S.D.,"I guess I must’ve been living in the dark ages all this time. For the past 5 years I had a regular router. You know the kind. Multiple antennas. From a brand that has been making modems and routers for decades now. I wanted the Google Wi-fi, but those pills were a little pricy and I couldn’t be sure that they would reach everywhere. So I opted for a range extender instead. My apartment is two floors. My router is downstairs in the living room with my bedroom directly above that. Wi-fi was always spotty and was giving me 80mbps max, 30 on a good night, but most often 10 and I had to restart it multiple time, sometimes on the same night. Range extender does nothing. $25 down the drain. Now I see the Nest is available. Should I get the router and the additional “wi-if point”? I don’t need a Google speaker. So I only buy the nest router. Just to test it out. I’m thinking if I end up needing more speed upstairs, I’ll just buy a second router and install it upstairs as I hear the “wi-if point” cuts speeds down in half. I’m tired of not getting my full money’s worth. Holy crap! I’m in my bedroom upstairs, on top of my queen size bed, the door closed, my smartphone bundled up in the covers, and the internet speed tester is still off the charts. 114mbps. In other words, I’m getting the speed I’ve been paying for all these years. And it stays that way! I checked the next morning, then the next afternoon and evening. Each time I’m at full speed everywhere within a 100 foot radius of that router, regardless of walls or floors. So are there any downsides? One, although it doesn’t affect me personally. Remember when I said I didn’t want to buy that additional wi-fi point? I didn’t want getting any speeds slower than what comes directly from the router itself. If I had needed a second router to install upstairs, I would have done that. Now my modem only has one ethernet port. I installed the Nest into that. But the nest only has one additional ethernet port other than the input from the modem. So I plugged my desktop into it. What would I have done if I wanted to install a second router somewhere in the house? Or for that matter, ANY device that I wanted to connect directly to the internet via a cable? Even my old crappy router had 5 separate ethernet ports. Google thinks one is enough? That really blows, especially if you don’t want to rely on their wi-fi points to get further wireless connection in a larger space. Google, please add more ethernet ports.","Amazing speeds, easy install, but only has ONE ethernet port!"

What a PITA!!! I had this a month and had to call Comcast daily to reconnect ... I'll leave my feed back on that router. My son recommended this one ... I was not wild about the style of it being small and with no antennas I din't have much faith in it but I gave it a try. I have a second floor level so range is important. WOW! This router may not look like much but don't be fooled! It's range is 2,000 sq ft which is plenty and if you need more range you can add ""Points"" which look the same but that also work as a speaker so you can plug it in any room to extend it's range. The only con if you call it one is the router only has 1 out plug ... Mine is used for my security system but I would also like one for direct connection of my PC. I haven't researched it yet but I'm sure this is easily resolvable. All in all I recommend this highly to anyone! The fact it is small and compact is actually what makes it nice.

This replaced a TP-Link AC1750 router that didn't get along with my laptop. It was necessary to add an Ethernet switch (the $16 TP-Link TL-SG105) to enable hard-wiring some devices previously connected to the TP-Link. The switch plugged into the Nest Wifi router's LAN port with no problems. It does stink that you must use two apps (Google Home and Google Wifi) to manage everything (three apps if you count the Nest app) but for most people these apps beat any URL-based router management page. It was necessary to remove and re-add the Nest Connect that's linked to my Nest lock but the Connect recognized and connected to the Nest Wifi router much more quickly than the old TP-Link router.

Save yourself the trouble and get a wifi mesh network. Our house is 3 floors, 3750 sq ft. We use 3 of these (one is physically connected to our internet router, the other two act as signal boosters) and we get powerful signal even at the farthest reaches. We now have a single wifi network for the whole house (instead of one for upstairs, one for downstairs) so no more manually switching between wifi networks when the signal gets weak. I was also surprised to discover that a lot of ""smart home"" capabilities work a lot better now. I guess my previous extender (which is highly rated on Amazon and I did a lot of research on before buying) used to drop the connection to our smart devices. Now, all our smart devices react to commands with lightening speed. Even for our big house, my tests showed we could have probably made do with just 2 routers (at the cost of some speed the further from the router we got), but we're suckers for speed so opted to go all out with 3, and I'm super happy we did. :) Easy to install, beautiful design.

I technically got a signal but it was a fraction of the bandwidth every other room was getting. My new setup has drastically improved everything! I not only switched out the Google Wifi for the Nest Wifi as my main hub router, but I was also able to then use the original Google Wifi now as one of the ""beacons"" located in my office.

They then had trouble connecting the two routers and getting them to work. There's an easy solution: just order one router! I know Amazon is selling the 2- and 3-packs, which is confusing, but you only need one. If you want more coverage, then separately purchase a Google Nest WiFi Point, which will easily connect with your Nest Router and extend your coverage. Now, on to the actual review. Set-up was a breeze. Download the Google Home app before disconnecting your existing wifi – you'll need this for the set-up. After making an account (if you don't already have one), it will walk you through the steps, which are very simple and straightforward. The whole process took me about 20 minutes. Afterwards, my wifi was so much better than what I previously had. My download rate changed from 13 mbps to 225 mbps. Granted, that might say more about how poor my previous wifi router was but still, I was extremely happy with the results. Bonus points for the aesthetic of the unit.

I was told that a firmware update solved a lot of the problems I was having, so I gave it another try. I has dropped the outbound WiFi speed a couple of times, but reseting it from the app gets things back. Otherwise, very easy to use. There is one other issue, if you get things set up wrong, or replace it, is is registered that way with Google and you have to phone them to undo it. I have 400 Mbps service. The speed from my cable modem remain consistently around 480 Mbps. Sporadically and immediately, the Google Nest will drop the WiFi speed to all devices to less than 20 Mbps, often as low as around 5 Mbps. Unplugging it for even 10 seconds and back in restores the WiFi speed to match the speed from the modem. The Ethernet connection from the Nest to my workstation remains at 480 Mbps. The Google app will measure the speed of the network connection and the speed to all attached devices. It confirms the network is around 480 Mbps and the devices are at a snails pace. I spent about an hour on chat with Google this afternoon with no resolution. Diagnostic was sent and confirmed the network speed is what I say. Signal strength throughout my condo it as high as it can go. No different that a couple of feet away. I bought the Nest because I was having the identical issue with the OnHub and thought it would go away. I am not alone.

All our devices will disconnect at the same time, then reconnect and disconnect repeatedly. However, the wired connection to the TV keeps streaming so it's only the wireless. Pinging the interfaces back to the modem shows it's only the wireless interface that's affected. A little research online shows this is a common problem with these routers.

Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2020,wRiNkLe sTiCk,I just swapped out an older slower wireless ac router with the new google/nest wifi router. I have to say I’m not impressed. I have a pretty large collection of uncompressed HD movies that were previously streaming to all my Roku televisions over a 5Ghz connection with no issues that are now buffering a lot and sometimes failing to play at all. Upon investigation I realized the sets that we’re experiencing issues are connected to the 2.4Ghz band. One of the sets less than 10 feet from the router. The fact that I cannot separate the bands or pin devices to a specific band is unacceptable. Blaming the speed negotiation on the connecting devices is a poor excuse and a cop out. Prior to Google/Nest Wifi all my devices were able to connect and maintain a 5Ghz connection with full bars and near top 5G speeds. An option to separate the bands to 2 separate SSID’s would fix this issue as well as the issue I see many others are having with connecting cameras and doorbells that require a mobile device connected to the. 2.4Ghz band. Many other mesh routers have this capability. Come on Google! I ended up returning this device.,"Poor Signal strength, and speeds"

Shows would pause and buffer, or lag. It was frustrating, because we were paying a lot for a top data plan. We tried a wifi extender, thinking that was part of the issue, but it had little to no effect. Finally, after almost two years of frustration, I though I would try to upgrade the combo modem-router (stock Charter) with a Google router (at the time, the previous generation). All of our problems were immediately solved, and I kicked myself for not trying it sooner. This is a massive, very clearly noticeable improvement over the stock modem/router combo that Charter provides you with. It is easy to set up, and even easier to use. It is simple to create and change your wifi network, name and password, and you can even set up a separate guest network. I've since moved to a new apartment building which thankfully features Verizon fiber optic, and also went ahead and upgraded to this current model of the Google Nest. The compatibility is great, as I've added my old Google router to the mesh network for full coverage (though honestly I don't think I even needed it for my 2 bedroom apartment). If you've been having wifi issues (slow streaming, loading, etc.), but your service provider keeps insisting that your internet speed is fast--PLEASE give this a try. Don't make the mistake of waiting years like I did, and don't bother with a wifi extender if you live in a 1-3 bedroom apartment and not a multi-story house. The issue is likely your main router, and there's a good chance this will solve your problems.",Blazing Fast Internet -- Better than a Wifi Extender

I shouldn't have been because it took less than 5 minutes.  Our house is on the borderline of just needing the Nest WiFi router and needing one additional Nest Point.  Our house is a long rectangle and our router is in one corner.  The Nest really enhanced the signal to the other end of our house.  But because we were getting ready to start distance schooling for a Kindergartner, we decided to go ahead and purchase one Nest Point (unfortunately couldn't order it through Amazon) and when we hooked it up (also super easy,) for the first time, we have excellent WiFi throughout the entire house and back deck.

After installing the first generation Google WiFi at my girlfriend's house hardwired with Gigabit Fiber internet, I liked how reliable it was, but a little underwhelmed when I averaged around 300-500megs when the fiber comes in at 1000megs. I regularly get 700megs with the second generation router in realistic usage of 30 feet. I upload terabytes of 4k video for work so my network speed is a little more demanding than streaming 4k video etc... The new Google WiFi has noticeably more range (maybe 50% more estimated and around double the speed on average). My favorite Google Wifi feature is the reliability especially paired with Ring cameras. Just knowing that if my network go out (hasn't in the past 3 months) I can get a notification from the app and reset the network wherever I'm at. The Google Wifi app is just so easy and powerful and the router works alot more reliably out the box than my yearly updated latest Linksys router after scouring the internet for the best settings. If I plan on going mesh, I will buy another router (not point) so I can hardwire it. My 2 story house is fine with one router. One second generation Google Wifi router actually works better than 2 hardwired first generation Google WiFi routers.","Reliable, easy, fast -- Better than Google Wifi and 4 generations of Linksys routers"

I had a Google wifi mesh network. Upgraded internet speed and wanted to add this new device to solve for faster speed in far side of the house. Could not add it so chatted with tech support. Was told I have to factory reset old router/points which wiped out the old network. So then I added the new nest wifi. Google’s website says those are compatible. I created a new network and then could not add wifi points - kept getting an error saying “Problem connecting to cloud.” So I chatted with tech support again. This guy was a complete moron. I had to explain over and over what I was trying to do. Then he drops the bomb - it is a known issue and they are trying to come up with a “workaround.”  So, in most of my home I went from 60-100mbs to 1-5mpbs. Thanks Google.

They require a  2.4GHz band to work.  My  modem gives out 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, so I expected the Nest router to do the same. It doesn't; My Nest router only displays a 5GHz band.  When none of my smart bulbs/plugs would set up properly, I spoke with Google customer support, and researched online. All the workarounds to achieve a separate 2.4GHz band  might as well be written in ancient Greek; none are simple solutions. I might be tempted to try the solutions, however, the Nest router did nothing to improve the 5GHz band strength of my laptop or cellphone which were 20 ft away from the Nest router in my loft condo (i.e., minimal walls).  I would only get an excellent signal by standing 3 ft from the router (NOTE: the router must be PLUGGED INTO your current modem).

We have used our own Linksys routers in the past, but went with theirs so they could run diagnostics on their end and it would simplify the issue if there was a problem. There have been lots of problems. My husband is a software engineer and works from home due to COVID-19 safety measures his employer implemented; fast, reliable internet is a necessity. With Spectrum's router, our signal dropped several times a day and our speeds were slow. We had to hard reset our modem at least twice a week. We pay for 100 Mbps service, but the fastest we ever saw on the speed tests on any of our devices over Wi-Fi was 60 Mbps down/5 Mbps up. We already have multiple Google Homes as well as Echoes, so admittedly I am a pro at setting stuff up in our home with these things. After completing the simple installation of this Google router, I tested all of our different devices and they were all over 100 Mbps. Our two laptops and our phones were at around 117 Mbps down/11 Mbps up! WHAAAAT? YES!! We live in a small 900 square foot raised brick ranch.

Everything you want to do to control the router - even the most basic settings - requires Google's cloud services. I am not much of a privacy person, so I don't mind it on that count - but this goes into the technical core of the device: there is NO web interface and worse off - there is NO WAY to control the device without an Internet connection. So if you're Internet is down because of your ISP, you cannot diagnose the situation in no way. That should be an issue for EVERYONE.

I live in a 3300sq single story that has metal outside doors, loads of walls, its cinderblock and brick construction. I know they say 3 will so it and im sure it will np but I love the Points, that let you have music, make calls etc. I replaced my netgear night hawk with the first router. I plugged the WAN into the ATT gig router and turned it on. 60 seconds later I used Google Home App to configure it. and by configure I mean names the network and password and room it was in. Super easy. In the secondary port I plugged in the cat6 from a small netgear port hub for my tv, receiver, xbox one and nintendo switch. I could have done wifi but why lol was simple remove from netgear and plug into secondary nest wifi port. Next I unplugged all my netgear mesh extenders (ex8000 and ex7500 tribands), and added my points and routers. Yes you can use other routers. The router i got from Amazon (because the 3 pack is actually two deliveries, a 1 pack and 2 pack ) and the Router/2 points I got from Google directly I treated as such 1. setup first router as explained above 2. second router in master where I then plugged the xbox into the WAN (yes wan port) on this router so the xbox thinks its hard wired when it is but only as far as the router and then its mesh to the primary router. Note: i had to use the wan port on the second router. if i plugged my xbox in the master into the secondary router port i did not get an ip. I dont know if it requires wan to be used first or if you can only use wan ports on routers being used as access points. I didnt try to diagnose more. 3. Point in my work out room. This is when I realized the difference betweens points and routers. routers have ports but no mic/speakers and have a wider range(2200) but points can stream music, control tvs and dial the phone, but only have 1600 range 4. point in the spare room Now i am putting in a couple more points. 1) in the garage and 1) in my server room. The only reason is i have tons of cameras outside, machines etc and the walls do lower my speeds in the far back to about 120/100 down/up which rocks but that is 5g so too slow. I also hehehe wanna play music through out my house so its more that. I would not get more than 3 if i wasnt a dork with enough money to waste for no good reason. If you dont care about music and talking to google assistant, then get all routers so you have ethernet ports and or hardwire backhaul to primary router. Pros 1. i was getting tons of ring device disconnect and reconnect messages on my netgear. now i get zero 2. i used to get tons of device disconnect and reconnects from my schlage locks. now i get none 3. speeds are awesome 4. awesome monitoring of devices (but you have to use cloud services which i hate) 5. the mesh itself is awesome between rooms 6. i love that i can easily see everything in Google Home and Google Wifi apps 7. Wife loves it Cons 1. None at the moment. ill let you know over time BTW if your curious if your netgear extends could connect to the new wifi yes. I used the same name and password and they auto connected before i unplugged them Ohhhhh last thing. In my master with netgear i was getting 10-15 up/down. I put in the google nest wifi and im getting 280+/100. Way way way way way better. p","EASY, Love it. Crushed my netgear mesh"

However, I immediately experienced the same brief (lasting about a minute) intermittent dropped wireless connections that many have reported in Amazon reviews. Apparently, as evidenced by the many complaints on the Google support forum, this problem started to appear around March after a firmware upgrade. Google support admits there is an issue and their constant response is that the engineers are investigating the matter. Presumably they will eventually resolve the issue, but I’m not willing to be frequently frustrated while waiting for the signal to return. If you have the patience to endure (like my wife), then perhaps this is a good solution.

Google Nest WiFi Router (2nd Generation) – 4x4 AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Router with 2200 Sq Ft Coverage,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Oct 2020,A. Ferchaud,This new router is much faster and reliable than my old one. I can now turn on the smart tvs in every room without it kicking my computer off the wifi. The only downside is that there are only two ethernet ports. Unfortunately my family is half way in the future and half way in the past. We needed four ethernet ports for the old computers that are still hardwired. For that reason I purchased an ethernet switcher. It was easy to set up. The only thing that was a pain was that my google minis throughout the house would not connect. It took me forever to locate google support. However once I did they took me through the process of factory resetting my google minis. After that they easily connected to the new router. So far I love this investment.,"Easy to set up, big improvement over my last router"

We went back and forth with Google support for a couple of weeks to try to get them to work. Support folks were super nice and helpful, but seemed to be stumped as to why our signal would randomly drop dozens of times a day. We assumed they would be able to solve the issue, but we had a 2 week trip in the middle of all this, so Google support said we could circle back after we returned. When we got back, we had a bit more back and forth with Google support before they told us that we should return the units. Well, our window to return them at Amazon was closed. So our only option is now to exchange them for new ones at Google. I'm ordering a different router because I'm done with this product.

I reset the device multiple times and even did a factory reset but the product is basically bricked.

Even then, I keep getting an error message that I can't connect to the cloud. Why do I need to connect to the cloud?

Happy with that. Major flaw- set up Bluetooth speakers to work with this, which is kind of a pain to do in the Google Home app. Made them my default speakers and worked well... until it didn’t. They were listed as connected, but would not work. After disconnecting/reconnecting several times (at least I got familiar with the counterintuitive Bluetooth setup in the app), I called Google support. Once the first guy escalated to the second guy, I was told that Nest WiFi has a known issue with Bluetooth speaker setup and the engineers are working on it. This was also confirmed on the Google help forums by a Google rep. In short, good product, but does not support Bluetooth speaker setup at this time. New update- now the devices will no longer allow me to manage settings or work with Bluetooth at all. They still provide WiFi, but are very limited otherwise. Looking at message boards this is a common problem that has been know to Google a few years at least. They are getting like Apple... too busy moving on to next big thing to support the last big thing Another update... 9 months later, still can’t reliably pair with a Bluetooth speaker. I imagine if they cared about this product they could have figured it out by now.",One major flaw... update... now 2

Initial installation of this can be a bit of a PITA. However, once you're up and running, the speeds and consistency, connectivity, and smart features, are simply superior. When you're installing, I'd recommend you reset everything. I'd also recommend renaming of the overall network. If you do both of those things, everything should play nicely. I have the fastest internet you can buy, in my area. This isn't quite averaging me out to my internet's full max rate, but it's in the ballpark and very good, especially considering how much I have connected. Also, my home is at the max of this device's capability and I have NO dead spots. For me, I couldn't be more pleased. Recommended 5 stars Cheers!","Off 26 devices, I'm averaging 700+ mbps"

I talked to Xfinity and they adjusted things, but then ruled out their cause. I spoke with Google and we went through many tests, and then they ruled it was indeed a faulty router. And that this was happening to many of their routers. They sent a new one and I shipped back mine. They then say they didn’t receive it and charged me for the replacement (later fixed and not charged.) It was a headache.

All of my wireless ip cameras all worked the this router with no lag. Overall im pleased with the coverage of this router.,Plug and play with awesome coverage!
