We added family photos to the screensaver that we update on a regular basis so everyone in the family who has Portal can see the new photos!

The only thing we wish is the Portal would be available in Hungary and other European countries.

I've bought 3 altogether and my two family members whom I bought them for love it also. It's nicer using it instead of my phone because it's bigger and you don't have to hold it while you're talking.

It's the future of the ol' house phone.",Awsome for my 70 year old mom!
"Facebook - Portal Plus Smart Video Calling 15.6"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Nov 2019,SmartShopper,"I've had this product since Christmas Time. I placed it on my kitchen and I've used it about 10 times. Each of those times, I've gotten the same reaction from my family and friends ""what are you using?"" ""how are you 'face timing' or 'video calling' me?"" and they would tell me that the quality looked very clear. I'd tell them that I'm using the Portal and they would be confused because they still didn't know what it was. This product is new and very modern looking. It fits my kitchen perfectly! The best part about the product is that you don't need to hold the camera or use your hands at all to record yourself. The camera that's built in the portal has a wide range of view and can follow your movement wherever you are around the kitchen or wherever you might have the device placed. You can always move the portal around the house wherever you'd like, I have mine placed in the kitchen where it covers the entire view of the kitchen and part of the living room. 

I did notice that the portal doesn't track the person who's talking, instead it tracks the bigger movements. For example, there were about 4 of us in my kitchen one time and my friend was talking from one part of the kitchen and the rest of us were on the other side of the kitchen. The portal would never leave our sight because we were the bigger bodied group, we caused more movement for the portal to follow. Even when we stayed still and my friend was still talking from a couple of feet away from us, the portal would still stay on us. It wasn't until my friend got closer to the portal, where she became the bigger body, that the portal started to follow her. So my guess is that with larger groups of people, it'll be better if everyone is at around the same distance from the portal in order for everyone to come out in the video.

Overall, I think it's an okay product, it has been fun to use and play with. We video called many of our friends and they were impressed mainly with how they get to view us. They get to see everything on their screen while we only get to see their face because they're holding up their phones at an arm's distance away. I would like to see how it looks from a portal to portal video call and perhaps write a new review for that to let everyone know about it.","Modern, Fun and Handy"

This purchase has been amazing.",I love Portal. It's wonderful.
"Facebook - Portal Plus Smart Video Calling 15.6"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,4,23 Nov 2019,Tony,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She loves watching Facebook video and calling to her sister. The screen is large and great for viewing in the kitchen without having to move the portal around.

A restart usually fixes the issue but it’s irritating to have to restart.,Mom loves it but has issues

"Facebook - Portal Plus Smart Video Calling 15.6"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Nov 2019,timetravvlr,"Facebook just made a big move by bringing the web browser to this! They also added a Netflix app and several games! But honestly for those of you who are so worried about the price, tell me what would you have spent if you only bought a 15 inch tablet? Now what if instead you bought a 15 inch monitor and a webcam and BOTH of them are in 1080p, how much have you spent then? Now what if you attached a 20 watt speaker to your monitor and webcam? Seriously, for the value this is soooo worth the deal! I’ve connected with my family again, I’ve found a way to hang out with old friends, and mostly I love the digital photo frame feature, I get to enjoy all the photos of my friends because they are saved as my favorites and the best part? I don’t even have to get on Facebook to see their photos. I love this thing!!!!",New Features Bring So Much Value!!!

IPad -we don't all have IPhones or IPads to carry around. etc... We decided to give this a shot and it has worked great so far. His main screen only has the icons for my brother and I and it is very simple for him to use. No reading required or speaking which is perfect. Love love love it so far.

My parents and my in-laws have the small version and it's really funny and enjoyable to videochat with them at distance (they all live in Mexico). When I have regular videochat using just Facebook Messenger on the other party, the experience is great. The camera follow up mode is terrific! I'm  fully satisfied with the product. The sound is amazing and Alexa works great (although some functionality is missing). I'm eager to get the new functionalities where you can videoconf with whatsapp contacts.",Really good product!
