Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Jul 2020,SellerThink,"This is one of three new Google Nest Mini's I've purchased.
It was purchased to replace a black Home Mini.
The audio quality is amazing, especially compared to the original Home Mini.
I like that there are new colors, that makes it easy to distinguish which room it came out of, if it gets moved and you have more than one. 
The color looks very similar to white Chalk, thus it's name.
This 2 generation includes 5.0 Bluetooth.
The price I received at Best Buy, made it affordable enough to buy two.",Great product

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Jun 2020,CrazyLeggz,"My old roommate had a few of these strategically positioned around the house, so when I moved in to my own place I HAD to invest in some. The sound quality and volume is impressive for the size and price of these Nest Minis. I primarily use these to play music, but I'm planning on linking them up to some smart plugs I recently bought. Even for someone who isn't super tech-inclined, these are super easy to set up. Just be sure to download the Google Home app to make the most out of these bad boys.","Hey Google, You Da Best"

Be it from Google or Amazon. The great thing about the Google Assistant is overall compatibility with basically everything.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,3,21 Nov 2020,HenryD,"I purchased the Nest Mini so I could hear my Nest Doorbell ring in my Pub.  I selected the Charcoal so it would be discreet: blend in with the surroundings.  To my dismay, it was provided with a white cord that sticks out like a sore thumb.  Why would Nest supply a white cord with a Charcoal device?  A black cord, yes.  Amazon Alexa gets this.  I had to hide it below my bar where it isn't visible at all.  Fortunately I had power there.

I have only had it for a few weeks but it is working very well.

does require a quick wipe down to keep away mildew but it is worth it. I highly recommend it to you.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,4,23 Apr 2020,Renatonico,"I bought this for my daughter, as she needed more at her new apartment, and I wanted to keep mine. 
I also have an Amazon echo. I use both to listen to radio stations (local NPR and a couple of 70's hits stations). Although both devices operate and look the same, I found that ""Alexa"" seems to work more consistently. Nest needs to be unplugged and plugged back in to recover from deafness sometimes. Also, to be very specific, I listen to ""Classic Hits 99.3"" from the Finger Lakes area of New York. This is a ""Tune-in"" listed station, which both platforms use to play several radio stations. Well, Amazon echo (""Alexa"") plays it, but Nest Mini (""Hey Google"") does not - it understands it as another station, and there's no way to fix that.","Good, but the Amazon echo dot is better for me"

This is a problem when somebody makes an announcement for example.  Caught this on deal that they also, bought it on a whim. I replace the Alexa at my office and I absolutely love this Google device.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Feb 2020,gweempose,"This is my first 4K TV, and I have to say, I am absolutely blown away by the picture quality. Coming from a top-of-the-line plasma, I was worried that I wouldn't be happy with the motion handling on this set, but my fears were unwarranted. Motion looks smooth and natural, and the TV also does an excellent job of scaling lower resolution sources like cable TV and DVD up to 4K.

While everything looks great on this TV, the set really shines on Dolby Vision and other HRD content. Because it is able to produce such a high peak brightness, HDR looks fantastic! This is a huge advantage that this set has over even the best OLEDs. The only negative I can think of is that you will sometimes see a little blooming in the black bars when watching wide aspect movies and TV shows. This is mostly only noticeable with HDR content, and it really isn't bad at all. There is virtually no blooming at all when watching SD.

Overall, I simply can't say enough good things about this TV. I bought it when it went on closeout, but even at full price, this TV is worth every penny. It's obviously not cheap when compared to other TV's in this size, but like all electronics, you truly get what you pay for.",Sony has done it again!

Functionality is pretty good. Having a usb-c on an apple device is a little hard to get used to. I would personally like having a finger print reader as opposed to just face I.d.

However, I purchased two of these to use with a Google Nest Hub Max, as I wanted music in every room. You are supposed to be able to just cast music to a speaker group and have it play everywhere. I created a speaker group with my Minis and the nest Hub Max. However, there is some kind of software bug and you are not able to do this. It will not play to every speaker. There is a workaround that I found after researching for a few hours, but it is a work around and annoying. After looking at mine, it seems like there are many people with the same issue and Google has not updated this to work even though apparently this has been an issue since last year. If you are buying this so you can have music in every room, then I would not bother. For any other reason though, this was a okay product.","Decent, but buggy for speaker groups"

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,2,23 Dec 2019,Avery,"I got both the Alex and Google Nest mini; I actually bought several of each. It took me a few hours to really set both up, but I'm finding the Echo Dot to work better and actually do as I ask. I got the Google Nest Mini mainly for Youtube as I have a Premium account on Youtube. The employee at Best Buy assured me it would work great with Youtube, but apparently that information is false as at the moment there is an issue with this device working properly with Youtube. I know you have to be specific with what you say, but it doesn't play the right song half the time, or at all. It got the music right about 35% of the time if it is a popular song, while the rest of the time it played songs I never heard of, when i asked for something else. It won't play songs on my Playlists, even after looking it up and putting in the proper routine for it; it tells me that can't be played/work right now. reading comments from others online, I see they have the same issue. I will be returning two that I purchased as I was promised they would work for Youtube, when in fact they don't. I'm keeping my third for help with questions, as this device is still good for random questions and information, but I'll be relying on Alexa to play the music I actually listen to.",Doesn't work As it Should

It can be a little tricky to set up with the network, especially if you have multiple Nest Minis. For example, one may take over the other when you're playing music (e.g., Spotify) and that can be annoying. 

Sometimes I'm in my truck and all of a sudden the music will change because my kids are using the Nest Mini at home and it overtakes my phone! So I'll change the music and then I'll take over the minis at home! These sorts of interactions are common and highly annoying.",Nice Little Speaker

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Jan 2020,Madamoiselle,"Let me start by saying that this may be the first review that I’ve ever done. I gifted this to my 78 year old mother who is not gadget literate at all. I plugged it in, downloaded the Google Home app on her cell phone and the device prompts you the rest of the way! It connects to your home WiFi. The Google mini literally responds to most any request, within reason, that you ask. She loves it! Music, searches, YouTube, Pandora, ETA, traffic, recipes, etc. Did you know that the Google mini will call any number in your phone contacts upon request? Yes! I would just recommend setting up voice recognition and or making sure that it is in a private setting to maximize security. This way, Google recognizes your voice. This is an awesome little gadget. So affordable especially around the holidays. I have them in nearly every room and I have the Google Hub and newly the smart clock! The Hub allows you to see your request on screen. All the items are awesome. Truthfully, I do own 1 Alexa but I own 6 minis and 1 of the first google homes, which is the larger one and two hubs or displays. Trust me, there is a reason for the imbalance. Two years ago I gifted all my family members minis because they are so affordable and they didn’t believe what it could do. I forgot to mention another awesome feature. If I can’t get my mother on the phone, I can record a message from my phone to broadcast over her mini, at her house (small setup)! Awesome, I know! I have never done a review and no this is not paid lol. I just really enjoy the product and maybe I’ll be back after I receive my smart plugs which will work towards making my simple home smart. I just want to say that I live in a regular house and live a regular life. At Christmas the minis are usually bundled with something and you get them free or less than $25. This year, the mini was free with a tv that I purchased from BestBuy around Black Friday. My sister’s mini this year was bundled with a purchase that she made. So I do have several minis but they are absolutely affordable! Hope this helps. 4.99999 out of 5 only because if you don’t want it to sit flat on the table, it won’t sit up right because it’s round. You have to purchase a mount which is only $5 bucks. The new one I got this year had a mount included in the package.",Awesome gadget and User friendly!

I got the Google Hub for Christmas and was able to link them as a ""speaker group"", so I don't have to pause my music when leaving the bedroom to go down to the kitchen. But, I can also have it so that the music only plays to the speaker that I want it to. 

So far, I have used it for so much more! I can start and stop music; find out the name of the song playing; lower the volume; and set timers when baking, all without touching anything.  I'm sure there are a lot of other things it can be used for as well.

I use my minis mostly for listening to music in my two bathrooms and in my dining room.  I have one problem with them however.  I have being using the new ""Move Music""  command as I move around my apartment.  I can move music to my mins with no problem, but I can't move music from the minis.   I don't know if I have a setting set wrong or if the mins have not been updated to execute this command.  I think it is more likely a software problem.  Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Jan 2020,Terry,"I feel like the 2nd gen mini's have an upgraded speaker.  The sounds seems better.  As always, Google just makes a better speaker than Amazon.  It may not have as many apps as the Echo, but I feel like the quality of the device is just a little better.  And like cable, at some point the added apps on AMZN just lost their value as an incremental feature.  All the big features are available on Google home.",Adding speakers to nearly every room
Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,4,23 Feb 2020,weeag,"Easy set-up and good quality. Decent sound when playing music/audiobooks. 

The only negative is that if you have an Android phone, there are problems with which device acknowledges the voice commands. Example: sitting in my office with my phone and nest mini and say ""Hey Google, send a text to dad"" - instead of the phone doing the task, the mini takes over and says ""Sorry I can't send texts yet"".

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,4,23 Dec 2019,JoseAlfredo,"Let me start off by saying, if your expectations are to have a smart speaker that also sounds like a jbl or Bose Bluetooth speaker, this speaker will disappoint you.  The google nest mini does a great job at being a smart speaker and also your basic Bluetooth speaker to stream music but it will not wow you if you are a bass head or a Bluetooth speaker junky. When speaking to google assistant, it has enough volume for you to hear it over something like a microwave in the background or the tv on low volume or even a frying pan when using it in the kitchen like I am. I personally have this speaker attached under a kitchen cabinet with a Velcro strap and so far it has responded 7/10 times I’ve spoken to it. With that said, if we talk about the sound is while playing music, it sounds decent. Clear highs, okay mids & just enough bass to meet my expectations for a speaker this size. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to take a step forward into the “smart home” and “smart home accessories” world. For the price, it can’t be beat.",Met my expectations for a smart speaker.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,5,23 Jan 2020,BigIP,I received the 2nd Gen Nest Mini with another purchase and am happy that not all that much has changed from the first version.  I am told the speaker is a bit different and it has a different proprietary power cable (not so happy about that) but I am unable to tell the difference too much.  I mostly use my Sonos One for listening to music and the Nest Mini is mostly a backup device.  Setup is really easy through the Google Home app and alltogether I was happy to receive this for free.  I am not sure I would pay $50 which is the advertized price for this item and I think $20-30 would be more appropriate.,Works Great!  Not sure what's so different from V1

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,4,23 May 2020,Hill,"Given its relatively low price, the sound is extremely impressive and loud enough for a big area of space. However the Google Assistant still needs to integrate better with other devices such as my phone. They sometimes responded together (like when I tried to adjust the volume of the nest mini, it adjusted my phone instead).

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,3,23 Aug 2020,Egeracejr,"One of our Nest Minis keeps unlinking from my Google account. Every day, sometimes multiple times per day, we (myself and the other person in my Google Home) get a notification saying one of us has unlinked the Nest Mini from our account, but neither of us did.

""xxx@gmail.com unlinked Living Room speaker from your home""

Once that happens, the only response the Mini will give is ""Please login through the Google Home app""

We'll re-link the Mini to our account through the Google Home app, but within 12-24 hours it will automatically unlink itself again.

We have already...

- Rebooted the Mini
- Rebooted our WiFi
- Factory reset the Mini
- Factory reset every Mini/Chromecast in our house
- Completely deleted our entire Google Home and set it up from scratch

...but it is still unlinking itself. We have two other Nest Minis in the house and they work perfectly. Only this one in our Living Room is having this issue.",Doesn’t connect

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,4,23 Mar 2020,SilentSea,"I got this on sale at Christmas, and it sounds better than the first generation Home Mini that my daughters have. However, we cannot both play music from the same Google Play music account at the same time even with music that I own. They say that this is industry standard, but it still seems crazy to me since if I owned multiple CDs and two CD players, I could definitely listen in more than one room at the same time.

Also, if you don't have a YouTube Music subscription, you can't request particular songs even if you own them. If I ask it to play ""Hot Blooded"" by Foreigner, it will reply with something along the lines of, ""That song is only available for YouTube Music subscribers, but here is a playlist based on Foreigner."" I can, however, use a phone and the cast feature to send a particular song to the Nest Mini, but then it becomes a little less useful than a Bluetooth speaker in the sound department since not all apps support this feature.

In other areas, it excels, though. You can ask it for weather, news, or other any information that you would ask Google Assistant. Still, if I have to have my phone handy to cast music, I could just use the phone to ask questions...","It's nice, but it could be better"

I'd give it another star if I trusted it not to spy, even with the voice features disabled and the hardware swicth turned off.  Google will always find a way to spy on you.

Nest Mini (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Charcoal,1,2,23 Jun 2020,KiingTas,"I almost never review products that I purchase, but I couldn't stay quite about this smart speaker. It has some pros and cons, but for me the cons outweighed the pros. So let's begin with the pros.

It is a great product if all you are doing are asking questions, using it as a reminder tool, alarm clock, shopping list, spotify music, controlling your smart plugs and smart lights. And that's about it.

CONS:

One of the biggest reason I returned this product is because of it's bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth would only pair to devices once, and then it would say ""Something went wrong, unable to turn on bluetooth pairing mode, please try again later"". If you wanted to pair new devices, you would have to unplug it and plug it back in for bluetooth pairing to work! 99% of the time, it would not connect to paired devices. I had it connect to my laptop, and almost immediately, it disconnected and never reconnected to my laptop.

Google owns YouTube, and it's quite ironic that you couldn't cast YouTube videos to this smart speaker. If you wanted to watch videos and listen to music from YouTube you would have to connect it via bluetooth which barely worked for me.

Setting up smart lights and smart plugs was also annoying. I tried pairing C By GE lights, and it never recognized the devices, when the C By GE app recognized their products immediately. A setup process that usually takes 2-3 minutes took me almost an hour. Once connected though, turning off lights and the smart plugs worked everytime.

I was not expecting such a hard time with a product that was developed by one of the biggest tech companies on the planet.

I was very upset having to return this product.

If you want a smart speaker and an assistant for within the $30-$50 range, I would highly recommend the Amazon Echo Dot. I exchanged my Nest for the Dot, and it has yet to disappoint me.

Would not spend my money nor my time of google home products again!",Buy at your own risk
