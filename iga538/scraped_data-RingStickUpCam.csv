"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Sep 2020,Jason Reid,"These little cameras are pretty handy.  Great picture and I've got six of them that are solar powered and they want amazing I don't think I will ever buy one this plug-in again I have not had one minutes problem with any of them and these cameras have saved me from two attempted incidents already on my property.  These are expensive as hell ($150 camera and solar panel) for what they are but WELL worth it...  Quality ain't cheap... Cheap ain't quality!  Guess you have to decide if your items and family are worth the150, hard,  sweat equity earned dollars...

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2019,Brad,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this, but this is my experience!  I bought one of these to test out, and it works great. I hung it within the 30ft range from the wifi router, and it gets a clear a great signal.  It works as expected. I purchased 3 more for around the outside of the house and they all work great. You have to have a good wifi signal and they recommend if you don't, to use a repeater.  i don't have to do that in my circumstances (even though one of the cameras is located about 45 feet away and switches between weak and good signal.  I can perform all setting changes on my phone which is great, and i can see all 4 cameras - live at any time.  All my cameras are on the outside of the house.  I can remotely activate an alarm if necessary, I've tested it and it works.  I can talk through it as well.  You can specify separate zones within each camera and turn off motion detection using your phone if you happen to be doing yard work for instance and don't want it to record so it doesn't waste battery.  I love these cameras because my kids come home a few hours before i do from work and i can see them when they are outside the house.  If something were to happen, at least it will be recorded.  This won't prevent someone from breaking into my house, but they will sure as hell be on camera if they do.  Also, it will cost $3/month to use the cloud recording option, and if you have more than 3 cameras like I do, i recommend the $100/yr for that service.  It's worth it!",It does what it says it does - as long as you follow the rules!
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2019,Mark J,"1) The lack of customizable motion zones is a huge disappointment. If angled downwards, mounted ~9ft off the ground, it misses a lot of motion detection coverage towards the upper half of the lens. Wish it had motion zones similar to the Ring Doorbell Pro. Such a shame for an “all-new, gen 3” version of this camera. Is it wishful thinking to see a better motion detection zone coverage in future firmware updates? 2) It stops recording too soon even with the motion verification feature turned off. 3) Battery life is said to last 6 months to 1 year in the product info. At current battery drain rate, it’ll be 2 months max.",Poor Motion Detection Zone Coverage

Ring use to be amazing, now they are Junk.  Terrible customer support. Good Luck EVER trying to talk to a live person. ""Product Support is temporarily unavailable.""  Two weeks???  That's NOT ""Temporary""! I have two Ring commercial accounts, I own two full ring alarm systems, and each has a dozen or so sensors.  I also have 18 Ring cameras at two locations.  All the outdoor cameras are located under eaves or overhangs, and work fine.  I tried locating one out in an unprotected area, and the first rain storm it flooded and no longer works properly. And yes, it was installed 100% correctly.  I've tried repeatedly to get help from Ring, to no avail.  Customer support is now just a computerized loop of canned support answers.

They recently changed the design and you can’t swivel it to mount on a roof. They want you to purchase a $20 kit.  They also don’t give you the tools anymore.

I called Ring support and they told me first that they would turn it over to engineering, then told me that they were working on it and tried to give me two options.  The first was a ""work around"" to where I have to treat this device differently than the 3 other Ring products I have while I sit back and wait for them to do something to fix this.  The second option was to buy a new battery, to which I explained I would have to climb up on the side of the house to swap a battery that I had no idea was not going to put me back in this same situation 4 months from now.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Jeremy Teran,"I didn't need a doorbell camera so I was looking for something I could mount somewhere on my porch.  Setup and installation was very easy.  The battery life has been great.  I turned off notifications, which is supposed to help with battery life.  The only 2 drawbacks I have seen is the Live Mode doesn't takes a while to come up, if it comes up at all, despite my router being less than 10 feet from the camera.  The router is indoors and there is an exterior brick wall between the router and camera, but that shouldn't be enough to degrade the signal as much as it has.  If I wanted to use live view to communicate with someone outside, I don't think it would be an effective option.  The other drawback is that the video quality isn't great when you zoom in.  So if someone walks by the house and does something to a vehicle, or the mailbox, it would be very hard to get enough detail to identify someone.  I still recommend the product though, just know it may have some limitations that could be a showstopper for some use cases.","Good buy, limited WiFi and zoom detail."
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2020,Linda Schriber,"Installed cam, and after it did its software update, got message that “battery is critically low”.  Interesting, as it is a WIRED cam. Got a hold of support, had me do a reset, which meant had to get ladder back out to go reset it.  When it first came up, no live video and after a second reset, got video, but critically low battery message still there. Can only get live view with my iPhone but not with iPad Pro. Deleted and reinstalled app, no joy. Joined a Ring Community thread and found that almost every cam has the same issues. I have been copied in on literally hundreds of emails from user’s experiencing same. This has now been almost 3 weeks and Ring, (an Amazon Company, I think), does not appear to have any ability to fix it, much less issue a statement on their site that acknowledges the problem. I have several other Ring products, and have been very satisfied, however, I won’t be buying any more products or recommend any until they get their act together.",HUGE SOFTWARE PROBLEM
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Oct 2020,Single Dad,"Purchased two of these but so far only have put up one. Purchased the battery version this way when the power goes out the cameras are still active as long as your router and modem are active.  Our modem and router are on a UPS or a uninterrupted power supply so as long as the power the modem and router are working the video will the recorded when the cam motion sensor detects someone there. My complaint is the mounting bass which is screw to the wall the mounting holes go horizontal but the studs in the garage are vertical.  To make sure the two screws were in solidly mounted the base sideways.  Not the best mounting because what is the bottom comes a bit away from the base. Those who designed this should have considered putting another vertical hole in it as well, that the bracket could be mounted to a vertical 2 x 4 stud. Will be also adding a DC power adapter with a smart plug to occasionally top off the charge on the battery so it's always fully charged. According to ring you can't do this but I have already tried it and it works fine but the DC adapter that's available is a little too strong so you have turn off the power to prevent the battery from being overcharged.","Camera works well, mounting on vertical studs a fail."
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 May 2020,RichardS,"I finally caved and bought the Plug-In version of the camera. After installation it shows an error message that the battery is critically low and live view is not possible. This is the PLUG-IN version and it does NOT include a battery. Googling the issue you'll find many people with the same problem. Ring gives this as the solution: ""Confirm the device your have is the Stick Up Cam Plug-In, and that the battery is not installed in the device. If you have a battery operated Stick Up Cam, please create a new thread on your concern. Next, ensure the power source field says power outlet or electrical socket. Try removing the battery from the Stick Up Cam Plug-In, leaving it out for a minute or two, and then inserting the battery again. While this is a Plug-In device, you can twist the bottom of the compartment to remove and re-insert the battery if applicable."" Note that they ask you to verify it has NO battery. Followed by the advice to remove the battery in the next sentence. Again, this is the plug-in version and it does not include a battery. I do hope that they will release new firmware for their device, clearly the firmware it updated itself to is not meant for this camera. Unless you're planning on spending more money and getting a battery for your plug-in version I would not recommend buying one at this time. Update: I decided to buy a battery to see if it resolves the issue w the battery. It didn't. And the battery wont charge up either. Made no difference. On top of that the camera starts recording a few seconds after beginning of motion and sometimes not at all. My kid riding her bike in front of it didn't set it off most of the time. So it's going back to Amazon and I am trying out a different brand. Bummer.",Major Firmware Issues
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2020,Tony,"I bought one of these on Black Friday and since day one, intermittent signal, it would not show me live view, it would disconnect from the modem and not work at all. I called Ring customer support and they tried to fix my issues. Spent 3 hours on the phone with a technician diagnosing all the issues such as going into my wifi router settings and reserving an IP for it and countless other things that I dont want to bore you with. In the end, they told me the problem was not the camera, it was my router because they were able to connect it through my Cell phone hotspot. PLEASE, do yourself the favor and just order a replacement if you are having problems like me. As soon as I got my new replacement the new camera worked flawlessly. There seems to be quality control issues with some of these models especially the black Friday ones so make sure you get a replacement and dont take the Ring support “it’s your router” problem.",If Your Camera Doesn’t Work Read This
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jun 2020,Chris,"Update: Thanks to Jason of ring, i was able to get this matter resolved. He walked me through some troubleshooting and determined the camera was in fact dead and sent us a replacement. So here are some basics if you are considering these cameras for yourself. Alexia: So when I first bought these for my grandmother, I had them working on my amazon account, but unfortunately at the time and possibly still as of writing this, there is no way to have motion alerts brought up on a single alexia. So I was getting alerts for both my camera and my grandmothers. To fix this i made her a amazon account of her own, and migrated her ring cameras to another account. Battery: My camera only needs the battery swapped out once every month unless there is a lot of traffic in front of my door. I recommend buying an extra battery and when you know you will have to swap out, charge it the night before and change it in the morning. you'll be able to see how much battery is left via the app and Ring will email you when its time to charge as a reminder. Solar Panel: I had no luck with the solar panel given my location, I can only recommend a solar panel addition if you are in a really sunny area and/or the camera gets sun. Plug in: The Plug in comes with a cord and a outdoor adapter. The outdoor adapter can act as a extension cord that gives you a giant extra length of cord to give yourself some room to play with when setting it up inside or out.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2019,David S.,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already.  I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't.  None.  Not a single thing. It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways.  I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed.  Nope. I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house.  Nope.  There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not.  They are not location aware in any way.  The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already. I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording.  Nope! The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours.  Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts. Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever. Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room.  I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on.  This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%.  This is with all the 'battery saving options' on.  This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off. With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording.  So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing.  I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down. Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices. This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality.  The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind. ***UPDATE*** Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera.  You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then.  Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't.  Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras. This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera.  The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support.  Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future. ***ANOTHER UPDATE*** From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"".  This will be a great update and should have been available on launch.  I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way. ***ONE MORE UPDATE*** Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days.  It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration.  With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set.  They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away.  For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off.  You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc.  Or any combination.  The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can.  This is a great improvement.  They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'. I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5.  This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras.  I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home. ***LAST UPDATE*** Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now.  All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night.  Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad.  I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation.  They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.",Zero Integration with Ring Alarm

They’ve replaced routers twice and the modem.  They are looking to return theirs as well.  Had a co-worker who bought Arlos.  His internet is much much slower than mine and he has his cameras spaced further away from his router than I do, much further.  Guess what?  He has had no issues at all. ZERO! FINAL UPDATE:  I know how frustrating this gets but I stumbled across EUFY cameras.  These work great!  I actually installed them in the exact same spot the ring cameras were (rings kept going offline because of “weak signal“).  The connection is great and they are working fine.  Homebase and two cams cost slightly more than two ring stick ups (like less than $20). Extremely pleased with EUFY.",Don’t do it!  DO NOT BUY THESE!
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Feb 2020,Paul,"I purchased a second battery cam on Jan 9th 2020, my first battery cam was purchased back in April 2019.  This new version has not functioned reliably since installation.  Live view does not load consistently and the motion detection is intermittent.  I have been on the chat with Ring support (which is very good) and gone through the typical troubleshooting steps.  At this point, they are ""going to get back to me"" with a possible fix.  I am not sure what they intend to do, but it is very obvious they cost reduced this new version with a severe impact in reliability and functionality.  My first battery cam purchased back in April 2019 works flawlessly, it is very unfortunate that Ring decided to ruin their reputation for a few extra gross margin points. -------UPDATE March 16,2020--------- After working with Ring customer service, the issue was resolved.  A new firmware was released that resolved the live view issue.  The new camera works as well as my previous camera and is fully functional.  Normally a 4 star would be warranted, however, the customer service by Ring sets the bar for excellent customer support in my opinion so I am updating with a 5 star rating.","New version has serious flaws - UPDATE, March 16, 2020"
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jun 2020,bluesy,"UPDATE:  Update - I updated my review from four to one stars.  Here's the reason why.  I have a RING Stickup and a RING Spotlight covering our pool and backyard.  Both are battery powered with attached solar units.  I've had some issue with the company that chemically treats our yard for weeds etc.  I knew they were coming a few days ago, so when I got home I pulled up the videos from our backyard (the aforementioned cameras).  One recorded him coming into the backyard but not leaving.  The other didn't record him or alert that someone had entered a motion zone (it was obvious from the one camera that he had in fact entered motion zones for both cameras).  I called RING Tech support and spoke with Mel.  Pleasant enough guy but not helpful. We started with the discovery my recorded length was 20sec when it should have been 30 which is the default.  I asked where I could change that and he gave me instructions, but the options he quoted were not available on any of my cameras.  He told me to delete the app and reinstall.  I did but still no joy.  He then said he could change it from their end.  Then we discussed zone settings and he said my RING Stickup camera had five zones with one turned off.  None of my cameras have five zones, they all have three.  I asked him for clarification and he repeated ""from my end, I see five zones on the stick up camera and one is turned off).  Now, how does he see five zones and I see three?  We then tried to trouble shoot why the cameras were detecting motion but not recording.  NO CLUE, said he would have to escalate the problem (means throw in the white towel) but said he would send me an email outlining our discussion and assuring me he would continue to trouble shoot.  Got the email - basically said I should consider two step authentication (which I already had set up).  Replied that I was not satisfied and the one time I really needed the RING to work, it didn't.  He did reply and restated he was going to continue troubleshooting the issue.  Long story short - three of my battery RING cameras have proven unreliable.  The only one that seems to work worth a darn is the wired RING door bell.  Total waste of money. Not an easy install because of the limited movement allowed by the base.  Speaker is terrible and this is for either hearing what is going outside or speaking to whomever is in camera range.  Would not buy this model RING again.",Waste of Money

I rely a lot on reviews. Im here today because despite some negative most recent reviews , I still bought this camera. A lot of complaints about the battery. The battery comes not fully charged, I left it charging overnight. Next day it was fully charged and from the time I had it on to finally having it installed it was only drained by 1%. I dont have many notifications because where I live there isnt much activity going on but from 12pm this afternoon installed to midnight right now, still at 99%. I tested out the sensitivity on the motion control and its great. I have a ring doorbell and its very similar. I would say this is a lot better because it has two modes , indoors and outdoors. I have it set for outdoors and the video quality is great. Great sound. Great notifications and sensitivity on the device. Anyone who complains about the device or has issues with the device, im not so sure if they know exactly how to operate one or their expectations are way too high. I went with the battery instead of solar panel. My ring doorbell lasts about 3-4 weeks on a single charge. I dont expect the same from this outdoor camera but I know I wont be let down.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,Sev,"At first this stick up cam worked great for my front door but after I moved it to the bedroom area for some reason it stopped responding and kept getting an ip address conflict. My two other indoor cam and elite cam outdoors (which replaced this) had zero issues since day one. I even tried doing a hard reset and setting it up again. It started working fine after that but the fact that it started giving me these issues discouraged me from wanting to keep it. In doors? Get the indoor cam. Outdoors? Get the elite. The one thing I do like about this version camera is that it comes with a nice long cable that extends for power. I am not a fan of battery powered devices. I don't want to keep going back to a device to replace and recharge battery every few months for most of the day. One aspect I do not like about this camera is the fact that it has no motion zones that you can customize. You can only turn off 3 different zones and increase it's sensitivity/range, that's it....that was a bummer. The indoor cam has this AND has color night vision. Same with the elite that I got for outdoors. Kinda disappointed with this one but it's likely I may have gotten a bad one and need to get a replacement. The device should not act up just because I moved it's location and it needed a hard reset. For now I will return and maybe i'll get a new one later.",Better off getting the elite for outdoors or indoor cam for indoors..
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Oct 2020,Rfm,"Ring is basically a bunch of over priced junk with sleek marketing. I have a Ring Doorbell that seemed to work pretty good for the first year and a half, or so I thought, and I added the Ring Stick Up Cam.  Having two cameras now made me aware of how much motion each camera was missing on a regular basis.  The Ring Stick Up Cam is on my driveway and the Ring Doorbell is obviously at my front door. Often the driveway cam will pick up motion and when the person walks to the front door...nothing on the doorbell cam unless they actually press the button.  This happens in reverse also. It’s very “hit and miss”.  Lag time to answer on the app is ridiculously slow.  Now my Ring Doorbell takes itself off line on the regular and recently started ringing at random times all by itself.  There is no security if the cameras only randomly work.  Today, we packed a car in the driveway and drove out....absolutely no motion detected at all, I checked the app and it was online and gave me a Live View so it wasn’t a connection issue.  Both cameras are hard wired and have excellent WiFi signal.  I’ve adjusted settings and everything else I could possibly do without success.  My guess is Rings server is subpar.  A yearly subscription fee for what?  Odds are if an actual crime occurs these cameras won’t pick it up. Packages get delivered and Ring detects nothing, so obviously a thief could just as easily steal the package without triggering motion detection.  So my advice is save your money for something else if you want a true security system....this isn’t it!",Nothing “security” about it.

The Ring Stick-up Cams w Battery seem to work fine - a lot like the Ring Doorbell 2 w Battery. The setup was fairly easy... but... most likely, you will have a bit of difficulty getting it to link to your wifi and to join the Ring network.  I followed the setup instructions exactly... and... it seemed to connect to our ATT wifi network fine (about 30-40 feet away through walls)... but... it wouldn't complete the connection to the Ring network, without some intervention, which should have been in the instructions, or easily found on the Ring web site.  I couldn't find the solution, without calling Ring Customer Service.  But... with their help... I easily completed the setup and the cam seems to work fine. It takes a few minutes for the firmware to update automatically, and then seems to hang on completing the connection to the Ring network.  Even after following the instructions to ""reset"" the device, it still had problems connecting.  Ultimately, after a couple of attempts, I had to remove the battery and reboot the device.  Once I had completed that process, it connected to the Ring network and began working just like the Ring Doorbell. It's working fine now. I'll try to remember to update this review, after it's worked successfully for several months.

After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars. If anything changes I will come back and update.area of the issue. February 9th 2020 update. This is the most unstable camera I have ever used. every day since this has been installed I have called ring because the camera goes offline or it takes an hour and a half to reset itself. last time I called I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half and they said that the device was defective. They sent me out a new one that was installed yesterday. At 4 p.m. by 6:25 p.m. the camera was not working again. I called ring this morning and it went from defective camera to it's my internet. If that were the case and it's my internet the ring security system wouldn't be working the ring chime wouldn't be working the ring doorbell 2 wouldn't be working my cell phone wouldn't be working my TV wouldn't be working etc etc etc. I'm ready to fling this flipping thing cuz I'm just playing tired. I called this morning and had to escalate my call to a manager while they're very nice at ring and I've said that from the get-go when somebody calls you every day for two weeks with the same issue and then today you're being told after all this time that it's not their camera and now it's my internet and it could be a firewall and it could be this then wouldn't it firewall for every single ring product that I have which is multiple? So I finally got the manager to agree to send somebody out here to figure this out. I am legally blind this morning's phone call was they wanted me to climb a ladder and reset the camera which is about 10 feet up. No can do. On top of that I've paid somebody three times to come out here to install their products to replace the cameras to install the cameras I can't keep doing this.They have agreed to send me a coupon code and communicate with Amazon home and they will send somebody outwell I'm very appreciative that they are doing this I am so frustrated with this camera. At this point I would not recommend that camera for all the money in the world now the other ring products that I have I think they're awesome. So I will update as time goes on if this can't be resolved then I'm going to send that camera back because it's worthless to me. so I dropped my review from a 5 to a 2 at this point and we'll see what happens I had a ring stick cam solar and a ring doorbell two wired installed last Saturday. The video is awesome the motion detection is excellent not going to lie and say I don't get some false rings but that's okay it's not a lot. What I really like is the ability with both the stick cam and the doorbell to speak to somebody who's at my door. Excellent sound excellent quality of each item. I would highly recommend and as a result of this installation  I am going to do the security system for the inside of my house. I have a wired camera system for my exterior I feel ring is just as awesome as those cameras. If anything changes I will update this review.,I'm back to liking it very much
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2019,GuitarRebel,"Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions. Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product. Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all. Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement. A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring. Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised. ***UPDATE*** Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices. Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well. Observations. Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool. I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent. I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once. Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete. I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic. Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.",Read this if you're having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties  ***UPDATED at end***

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Oct 2019,MinN,I rarely write reviews. I was really excited about this product so I ordered two. Just got them today and spent 3 calls with support and they don’t work as intended. I had a breaking on my property two weeks ago. Support tried to help with both and unfortunately hours later nothing. The issue for me is that the notifications barely work. It’s a hit and miss if they do. What’s the point if your devices do not get dependable motion notifications? Customer service was nice but unable to help at this point. I had been burglarized two weeks ago and was expecting that this would be great. This is my second review. I have to wait for an appointment next week after an email I received today. I didn’t go into full length yesterday because I was upset. First they told me my first device was defective and to open the second one and that I would get a replacement for the first after a hold of 1 dollar on my card. I wanted to test it looking out my living room window. I’ve had no alerts since at all. My neighbors kids came by and knocked on my door and nothing. If you want to watch a live camera all day and night this is for you. We come and go and I pay ADT to monitor my house. I’m angry because I lost a lot of tools and if this doesn’t do motion alerts whether home or not just find something else.,Notifications aren’t reliable at all.
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2019,Thomas,"Updated review after 24 hours post-installation: I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with Ring’s new release. I pre-ordered this camera primarily due to the price and I now see why this model is $70 cheaper than the Gen 2 at regular price. To start, mounting hardware is no longer included. Amazon is now selling a separate kit for mounting (security screws and screwdriver) for $20. To be fair, I feel like if someone is installing these cameras in their home, it’s a good saving to pass on to them. However, my biggest issue is the build of the Gen 3. Once you plug it in and run through the setup, you can tell that it is inferior to the Gen 2. The field of view in this new camera is a lot smaller as follows: Gen 3 Stick Up Cam (this model) field of view 110° horizontal, 57° vertical Versus Gen 2 Stick Up Cam Wired field of view 150° horizontal, 85° vertical Therefore, you have less coverage (e.g. if you are trying to see a big back yard) and require multiple cameras. The Gen 2 covered my entire back yard with its near fisheye view. I would require two of these cameras to provide equal coverage. Motion zones is no longer editable like it was in the previous model. The motion zones is similar to that of the first Gen Ring Doorbell. It is a semi-circle from the bottom of the screen and you can only make the circle bigger (extending motion zone) or smaller (shrinking motion zone). The top half of the screen is completely exposed and cannot be used to detect motion. The Gen 2 allowed me to have different motion zones and allowed me to customized the zones to cover anywhere on the screen I saw fit. This is important as I do not want my patio to be within the motion detection zone since we are relaxing out there quite often. My issue with the lack of POE as stated in my quick review below stands. Lastly, the quality of the image, while it is claimed to be 1080p appears to be less of that my Gen 2 with POE. It’s possible that the WiFi signal can be blamed (there is a noticeable lag during live view that I contribute to the WiFi),  but the location of my camera is directly beneath my router (~3-5 feet away) therefore cannot be blamed for everything. I have up to 400 mb/s down and 25 mb/s up consistently. I wish these specs were easily available when the pre-order page was still present. I probably would’ve ordered more Gen 2 than these new Gen 3 had I known. Cost cutting is great and always welcomed, but it should NEVER be at the expense of quality on a once excellent product. Naming this camera as part of the Stick Up line is extremely deceiving since it is so different. I would’ve rather they kept the build and cost the same as Gen 2 since they also released the budget Indoor cam as well. Original quick review post-unboxing: I pre-ordered this stick up cam PLUG-IN without the solar power option and received it today. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon/Ring removes the POE input and replaced it with some type of DC plug. I am extremely disappointed and wish I had purchased some more of the second Gen cameras!! Do not buy if you want to use POE.",NO POE (Power over Ethernet)!! Gen 2 was better!
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2019,#LiLV,The picture quality is great and the range seems to work well (mine are 50’ from my router).  My complaint is regarding battery life.  The product description says 3-6 months battery life.  Mine lasted 1 week.  The solution was buying solar panels to mount beside the camera. Purchased a 2 pk of solar panels for $66 from Wasserstein.  Ring wants $49 each and only had white available when I went online to purchase.  Overall I’m pleased with the cameras but the battery life is a scam.  Order your solar panel with the cameras.,Battery life is poor
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Oct 2019,Sara Murphy,So the camera is okay if used outdoors. Read others reviews for why exactly indoor use is not great. The biggest disappointment when used outdoors is you cannot set specific motion notification zones like you can with the flood light cam or the other outdoor ring camera. All you can do is slide a sensitivity bar over a general area within the cameras field of view. Does it work...sure...but without zone control its not that great.,No Zone specific options!
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2019,TC,"I work with cameras, WiFi, mesh gear, microwave technology, 4G, etc.  I stream audio and video and work with complex systems.  Every time I read a Ring forum person write in about a Ring issue, Ring never accepts blame.  My Ring doorbell signal is less than my stick up cam and it works great.  I am on my second stick up cam, and it has serious flaws. Let’s just say, I can push WiFi down my street, but a stick up cam in the same room, as my router, doesn’t get a decent signal!  Folks, we have here a company that has failed to get the bugs out of their firmware.  The doorbell works fine, the indoor cam mounted in the garage works fine, all my other cams works fine, but a simple stick up cam doesn’t.  No Ring, there are not too many devices on my network, I turned them off just to see if your excuse was even viable.  Bottom line is your firmware needs work, a lot of work, even your motion detection has issues, video playback has issues and it’s only on the stick up cam.  How do I knows this?  Let’s just say, when you try one cam, and it doesn’t work at all, you call Ring and talk real tech, they say send it back and get another, that tells me it’s an issue with the devices, especially when the second one starts up fine then begins to have issues.  I even borrowed another indoor cam, and tried it, it worked fine. Stop pointing the finger at people who buy this and blame them for its issues.  It appears your older generation device stick up cams work better.  There is a flaw somewhere in the string of code and every new one going out and getting updates will have these issues.  I would have bought several of these, but they don’t work.  Thankfully I can fall back on other competitor devices in the mean time till you get it right.  Don’t be ashamed to stand up and say you made a mistake, stop saying it’s people’s internet or WiFi strength, maybe your WiFi  receiver or antenna in the stick up cams has the issue.  I can stream some serious bandwidth at 30fps, and not even lose a frame, but yet a $99 camera can’t even stream 5’ from router with serious upload and download speeds.  Like I said before my doorbell works perfect, maybe I should mount a few of them around the house, flush them into a concealment, and disable the button.  I bet no one has used multiple door bell and small hidden cams yet.  They seem to work great!  Why is it I can walk down to my mailbox with a streaming WiFi camera I have, and your stick up cam, and the stick up cam drops out, yet my other camera doesn’t?  No it’s not arlo, it’s a simple WiFi based camera.  Go figure, I bet you got a deal on some second rate WiFi receivers and board antennas hoping 50% or more worked, just look at the amazon feedback, that should support my argument.  That’s all..... After my review was written, Ring tech support reached out to me.  Jason, and I spoke for an hour and he gave me a few options.  One of the options was to replace my Stick up Cam with the POE Stick up Cam Elite.  I was hesitant because I didn’t want to run a Cat6 cable where I had the stick up cam at.  He talked to me and asked me to try it.  He sent me the Elite version and I tested it.  To my surprise it worked flawlessly, so I did the full install. The Elite version allows for much better motion zone control, and since it’s wired to a switch with a POE injector, the activation response is super fast.  Because most of the ring cameras are a bit grainy without ambient light or the assistance of additional lighting, I opted to add a dual 500 lumen motion light on my back patio. Walking anywhere near it not only activates the light for a few minutes, but allows the elite stick up cam to get a clear picture.  This not only solves my problem, but serves a purpose with the additional lighting.  The Elite stick up cam, is the only POE version they make, but if the Ring flood or spot cane POE, I would go with them. My sincere appreciation goes out to Jason, from Ring.  He is fast to respond to emails and gets involved problem solving.  I appreciate his help and his concern.  I will continue my use of the Elite versions as they work for my applications.  I still will return the original stick up cam as it didn’t work for me.","Ring, stop blaming everyone else and look at your own gear *****UPDATE*****"
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Oct 2019,DL Ward,"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good. Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday. I gave it three stars because I like what is potentially capable of, and I am realistic about a brand new product on day one. It may take a little time to work out all the bugs so patience is required for the first few months. I should also add that the support rep spoke very poor English and it really got to the point I just wanted to get her off the call. I probably understood about two out of three words from the representative. This was more disappointing to me than the actual failure, but she was able to help me get it resolved - with various request to repeat things. Update day 2: Camera has disconnected from network again, which means I have to go out and push the setup button again and reconnect it to the network. I don't really want to call their support number again because that was such a painful experience. I really want this to work so I am going to have to think about how much patience I have versus my frustration and desire to return it. End of day 2 update: after connecting to the network again this morning at 10:30, it had dropped off WiFi by my return at 5:00 pm. I also noted the battery is down to 75% after two days of “not working”. This is stretching even my patience. Despite the issues I have experienced with this device, I remain a fan of Ring products. I did receive a nice note from Ring customer support offering additional assistance, but he only works on weekdays so I cannot pursue the issue until next Monday. In defense of Ring, they were extremely helpful with my doorbell last spring so I have high confidence this will be resolved - if I can handle the shorter than expected battery life. Beginning of day 3: I placed the camera on my desk, about 3 feet from the wireless access point as a test to see if wifi signal strength is the culprit. Reconnected it to the WiFi network. Battery strength on this beginning of day 3 at 61%. Even if I get this working correctly, I don't believe the battery life will satisfy my expectations. End of day 3. Disconnected from WiFi after a few hours, sitting right beside access point. Discounts signal strength issue. I will work with with support next week to figure this out. FINAL UPDATE: After working with Ring support, they assessed the camera as faulty and had me return it for replacement. Sadly, the replacement worked exactly the same way. This suggests a problem on my network (even though two other Ring cameras are working fine) or a faulty batch of cameras. After working with Ring support again, they forwarded me to a second tier support rep. During our efforts, it stopped responding to the setup button so I was no longer able to work with  this camera. At this point we returned the unit. I was disappointed with the battery life and since they couldn't product a unit that would work on my network I decided it was time to fold. I remain a fan of Ring products in general, but this second example of the ""Stick up cam"" failed before we could do any extensive diagnostics so we will never really know what the problem was. (oh - for you networking folks out there, I did set the camera's mac address to a reserved IP address in my DHCP server. Worked fine for the usual 5ish hours and then lost the network again.)",Poor English by tech support / multiple units fail to remain connected to network (UPDATED)

The app told me since the solar was plugged in to put it on wired and then the camera worked fine and had notifications from about 40 or more feet away.  After HOURS on the phone with Ring Support, all they said it was a battery issue and to put it on battery mode and not wired and now I can barely get alerts 10 feet away from the camera.  There should NOT be that much of a difference between wired and battery mode.  Almost wish I would have paid for a more expensive camera maybe it would have worked better.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2019,J,"UPDATE 11/15/19:  I've had the camera for two weeks and overall it has performed fine with respect to recording and in freezing weather. The only issue with it is the battery life, if you are planning on putting this camera outdoors GET THE SOLAR PANEL! I've had it up without one because I wanted to see how long the battery would last after being fully charged and for our normal usage. The settings I have it on are: Motion Detection: ON, Motion Frequency: STANDARD, Motion Verification: OFF. Video Settings: Live View - ON, Tap Camera Preview - OFF, Audio streaming/recording - ON, Infrared Lights for Night vision - ON. I also have it linked to the front doorbell so that when it detects motion it triggers the doorbell to begin recording. The traffic in front of the house is steady but not crazy, normal subdivision. With these settings and at the 15 day mark of being up the battery on this camera is currently reading less than 10%. It's a shame that the battery life is on the ""meh"" side, so you either need to have another battery pack as a back up on stand-by or use the solar panel.  I'll be adding a solar panel and will report back how it goes with another update. ------------------ ORIGINAL REVIEW: Overall, I like the simplicity and ease of the Ring system. This is NOT the high-end camera so all you people expecting that at this price point need to get a reality check! READ THE SPECS before you order it, if it does not meet your situation spend the $ and get the high-end one. I already had doorbells (hardwired and battery) along with the security system prior to getting this outdoor camera. The set up was simple enough, just like their other products, it was easy to link it with the alarm base, and set up the motion detection. One feature it does have is the ability to link it with the other doorbell cameras and cameras that I have. For example, if the front doorbell detects motion I can have the camera begin recording and vice versa. You need to really look at the settings in the base unit (if you have the alarm system) to understand what options there are. The camera comes well-packaged and the instructions are very straightforward, the camera is small and very easy to put up. This being said, I do believe it is overpriced, it should be the same amount as the indoor corded camera that is around $59. I have my motion notification settings on ""standard"", we'll see how the battery life goes, will probably get a solar panel for it at some point. The picture quality is pretty clear and the adjustability to get the angles you want are very easy to do with the basic mount it comes with, the package includes all the hardware needed to install it. I would suggest you have someone hold up the camera where you want to mount it at and then look at your phone to see what the view actually looks like BEFORE you actually mount it. The night pic on the camera is decent, a bit better then the DoorbellPro that I have, gives me a nice wide view of the porch, the driveway, part of the street in front of the house, all the way across the street to driveways for those houses. This was a pleasant surprise for such a small camera. The motion detection is simple, it allows you to adjust a zone that you want monitored fairly easily within the app. You will need to charge the battery fully prior to use, the pack has two lights on it, one amber, the amber one will go out once the battery is fully charged. Everything you need to set the camera up with comes in the box. It is small, but solid, camera weight less than 1 lb. I replaced a bullet style that I had with it. The two-way sound works good as well, it picked up a conversation my neighbor was having on his porch and of people walking past the house on the sidewalk. I will probably be getting a couple of more of these, just wish that Ring would bring the prices down a bit. Overall, pretty nifty little camera that does what I need it to do without having to run a bunch of wires all over the place.","Nice Little Camera, Does the Job"

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 May 2020,Joanna,"In the past I purchased the first gen of the stick up cam for my driveway. Due to too much interference even with a WiFi extender, I ended up returning that camera. Now, due to someone or something in my backyard at 2am that my dog alerted me to, I decided to try this third gen. My back porch is much closer to the router so I was hoping it wouldn’t have issues. Let’s start off with what can be improved. Previous Ring items I purchased included the drill bits necessary to mount into brick and concrete. This does not. However, the nails and anchors to fit into the drill bit I used for the ring doorbell. But if you don’t have one of those, you would be out of luck and need to purchase a masonry drill bit set. As for the motion sensor zones, there are three fields of detection that you can turn on or off. I just wish the range went further. What would be even better is if the motion sensor detection could be customized just like the front Ring doorbell. Furthermore, wifi connection is just okay. Though I did expect better since the router was just 15-20 feet away from the camera. However, even when the signal was considered weak, the camera did happen to still go to live view quickly and capture and notify me walking out onto the porch. Lastly, the battery does take a long time to charge. About 4-6 hours. I do recommend getting a second battery so you have one on hand when one gets low. When the system first started up I got a notification that battery was low. I thought it was odd but it then it corrected itself and is at 100% charge. Now, on to the good stuff. Overall, I’m fairly impressed. This third gen has sturdier parts. First gen had a flimsy mount and face plate that could easily crack. This has a sturdy rubberized plate you mount to and the rest of the camera easily slides onto that. Set up was much faster than expected. Just a quick press of a button and scan of the QR code and it was done! You do have to wait about 5 minutes for the camera to do an internal update. I wish we could still post pictures with our reviews. The image quality is crystal clear. Day and night time. Even better than that of my Ring doorbell pro. Finally, I do love that they kept the feature that you can set off a siren from your phone. It’s not obnoxiously loud but loud enough to grab someone’s attention or scare off some crooks.",Decent camera for a decent price

T he y should disclose this information in the description.  Kind of annoying you have to buy extra equipment for this.  The whole purpose is for it to be wireless meaning nothing plugged in.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless WiFi if you still need a WiFi device placed within a few week.  If they’d work on this glitch it could easily be a 5-star product.  3-stars for all the issues and complications.  It does work better now with the WiFi extender. This is the second one I’ve tried. Worked great for the first few days. Then all of a sudden it would say “activating” while continuously circulating unavailable to show live view. Also says “error retry”. I think they screw you on the device if you don’t pay the monthly recording fee. I don’t need this to record. I just need the live view which doesn’t require a monthly plan. I called customer service 3x but they are clueless and useless. They tell you to delete the app and reactivate it which doesn’t work. Waste of money. Will only work sporadically. I checked my WiFi connection and it’s working fine with a good signal. I have no issue with any of my other devices on my home WiFi connection so there’s obviously a defect in these things.

I purchased two Ring stick up cameras, both of which failed to connect to my wifi network during set-up; at the point during setup where it attempts to connect to the wifi network it would fail with the message ""unable to connect due to a problem with your internet"" and flash a red-blue light. I methodically followed all the troubleshooting guidance on the Ring help page but this did not resolve the connection problem so I contacted Ring support, who simply followed the same troubleshooting process. After two separate calls with Ring support I was advised that there must be something wrong with the camera units and to exchange them. After exchanging for two new cameras I encountered the exact same connection failure and had no choice but to give up and return the cameras as both the troubleshooting guidance on Ring's website and technical support were not able to provide an explanation for the failure. There is clearly some compatibility issue with my system/system components and the Ring stickup cameras that Ring's troubleshooting page and technical support is incapable of addressing. Given that other Ring components and every other device I use connects well, I have good network connectivity with settings in-line with Ring's setup instructions, and new modem and router, I have to assume that the problem lies with the camera design or software. After reviewing several online forums it seems that others are experiencing similar connection problems, so once again suggests poor design on Ring's part with this camera. It also seems that Ring technical support is essentially incapable of providing any help beyond what is already listed on the troubleshooting website, so if you've gone through the troubleshooting webpage I would suggest not wasting time calling the support line. In the end I wasted several hours troubleshooting this connection issue and would suggest to others that they simply cut to the chase and return the camera if they run into similar connection issues during setup.",Unable to connect to Wifi during setup and Ring technical support incapable of resolving

I bought this stickup camera and solar panel to be able to watch for people dumping in my alley so I can prove it is not my stuff and not get a fine.  I made an agreement with the city that I would install a camera if they would not fine me for the recent dumping which had taken place.  They agreed and I have Ring so I bout this thing from Amazon yesterday, it arrived this morning. I charged the battery and spend about 40 min going through the setup process over and again.  I looked up the process on line, it was different than in the manual, i tried those.  I called tech support and they hung up right after it went on hold.  I called again and I got a rep within a few moments. I explained the situation and he walked me through the process yet one more time, actually two more times. Then he asked for the MAC address without telling me where it was located.  I waited but he was just silent so I asked him where the MAC address was.  It is on the outside of the box in very very small (for an older person) to see. I finally got a magnifying glass and told him the number, he did not repeat it back but said he could not find it, we verified it and it was correct.  I also found it inside the battery compartment and it was easier to read and was the same as on the box and as I had read to the Tech guy. He  then asked where I bought the device, I guess because not having a registered MAC could mean it was a pirated device. and I told him ""Amazon, the company that owns you""  he said, ""okay I have to go ask someone what to do.""  He had made sure he had my number earlier so he could call back if we got disconnected.  I waited about 15 more min (as I packed the thing back up figuring I would have to return it anyway) and then the call dropped.  I did get some type of callback but when I answered that it was not the fella i was talking to, it was a recording from Ring that said i would be connected to a recording or something i did not quite understand, the pone went silent, no hold music.  I waited for another 5 min but figured it was useless and hung up.. Look. I am the customer, it is not my job to fix obvious production issues with Ring's product.

I guess during the time that my camera was not in use, Ring updated the system to fix the connection issues. Since using my camera again, the motion settings in the app have improved. You can customize the zones for motion detection which is great because I didn’t enjoy receiving 15 notifications an hour just to know people were driving by my house. My only issue now is how long it takes for the app to load when I click a notification. By the time the camera opens, whatever and whoever is gone and then it takes a few minutes for the review video to be available",Has improved
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2020,CommonSenseTest,"This review is for the package deal Stick Up Cam Solar plus the Solar Panel.  Overall, meets my needs, happy with it.  A few thoughts on it after about 1 month of use: - FWIW, I’m pretty new to Ring (installed Doorbell Pro a few days before installing stick up cam), so I’m not all that familiar wihh th product terminology - Example, the two items were split into two shipments, and the first thing that arrived Was the solar panel.  The solar panel package says “Only for Spotlight Cam Battery,” with a picture of a different camera than the one I ordered in this package deal; this concerned me, so I chatted Amazon to confirm this panel would work with the camera I ordered...the Stick Up Cam Solar.  The rep was trying to be helpful, but clear they didn’t understand my question, and couldn’t really help me out.  So I decided just to wait until the camera arrived, and will see for myself - a couple days later, camera arrives... and it’s just called “Stick Up Cam Battery”, with no indication it works with a Solar Panel... - Libyans behold, the panel works just fine with the camera...I know it’s a new offering, but as new Ring customer, it was a bit confusing that the packages didn’t appear to be what I ordered, but at the end of the day, it was exactly what I thought i ordered once I got everything opened up and connected - camera works pretty well...seems not quite as advanced as the ring pro doorbell camera, as the motion detection zones are a lot more basic and less customizable, IMO.  Motion detection works great at Close range near my back door where I have this set up, but hard to tell how well the motion detection works a little further away.  My hope is this thing would detect someone at my fence line, but I don’t have that dialed in yet. - I’m happy with the night vision capability, obviously better at closer ranges as well. - I just tested the microphone the other day, sounds quality is “so so”, but I think it would be sufficient to communicate with someone at the back door if needed - so far, solar panel works great...it gets about  6hrs of direct sunlight per day, and best I can tell I’ve never seen the battery below 99% - the only thing that doesn’t appear good is the WiFi connection...I often see poor connection on the app, but I don’t really notice any performance problems.  My house is pretty small, and actually this camera is closer to my WiFi router than my doorbell, and doorbell signal is excellent... so not sure what the deal is.  But for now doesn’t look like a major problem, will continue to monitor.",Meets my needs

I chose it because I wanted to mount it inside to oversee my front door through a side pane of a bay window. Besides it's general unreliability, at night, through a window, the reflection off of glass made it functionally blind.  I do have another ring unit, a flood light/security cam and it is mounted outside and works both reliably and 24/7.  And on the same network as I attempted to use with  the Ring Stick-up cam 2.

The motion detection is HORRIBLE.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2019,Kenneth H.,Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes.  Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door.  The video quality is pretty good.  Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup.  Not sure why people couldn't set up zones.  It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps.  I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty.  Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back.  A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached.  Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected.  I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps.  They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed.  Will update this as the days go by. Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up.  Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!! Phone apps are pretty good so far.  (Samsung note 9) Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed.  At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off.  After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Works okay so far but the Windows apps doesn't work at all
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2019,R Olson,"I have a 2nd generation wired stick up cam.  I decided to add a second camera and bought this new version of the stick up cam assuming that there would be some improvements over the older version.  Boy was I wrong!  The new camera is inferior to the 2nd generation in every way.  The mount is a flimsy all plastic thing that can't be mounted overhead and allows for less adjustment than the old model. Instead of a dedicated outdoor power cord, this cam has a dual purpose cord with a connection in the middle that is guaranteed to allow moisture into  the cord.  The field of view of the camera is much smaller than the 2nd generation model and there's no way to adjust individual motion zones like you can on the 2nd generation.  There's no option to set this camera to person only mode either. So if you adjust the motion sensitivity higher you get an alarm for every cat and bunny rabbit that cruises by and if you set the sensitivity lower you can drive a truck into the driveway and the camera doesn't see it. All in all this New version of the stick up cam is one big disappointment. I'd send it back if it wasn't so much trouble to uninstall the thing. Update: My opinion of this camera hasn't changed but I would like to say that Ring customer service is excellent.  After my original review Jason at Ring emailed me and offered to help.  He offered to replace my camera with the older version of the stick up cam and I gladly accepted.  It's nice to do business with a company that believes in customer satisfaction.",A step down from the previous generation

It enables us to confirm our guests and house cleaners arrivals and departures since we are not present when this happens. It also adds a level of security which we desired. The phone app was simple to download, set up and adjust to the specific criteria I wanted. I also have the monitoring shared with several other people who receive alerts and can get a ""LIVE"" view anytime we desire. It only took less than 30 minutes to mount the solar panel and camera. It does require WiFi and if your WiFi goes down, which ours did recently due to a storm, you will lose camera functions. I am pleased with this purchase.",Perfect for what we needed!

Doesn't always connect, I Have to hit the connect button over and over and over again. Then I just give up. If it does connect, it's too late to see whatever the motion Detector picked up. It will detect that FedEx or UPS has pulled up in front of the house, but then you don't see anything else. You don't see the driver or them pulling away. Because it stopped recording. After 30 days you have to pay. For the cameras to record you can only live view well as mentioned above the motion detector will alert you there's motion. But by the time it connects you can't see anything. It's already over. Or gone. So for $10 a month, you can get recording for 1 camera $120 a year. I bought three cameras. So this is just an ongoing expense. The cameras I had before these were REOLINK. They had micro SD cards that could be viewed. Either live or take them out and look at them on your laptop.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2019,Scott B.,"I've used a couple of the first-gen Ring Stick-up Cams for a couple of years now. For what I paid, they've done the job pretty well, alerting us to activity on our front and back porches, though the picture quality could be better. When I saw this new version with nice bells and whistles for a lower price, I jumped on it to install on the second story of our home to capture the backyard (we have that older stick up cam on the back porch for the blind spot created by the awning). Installation was much smoother than my first-gen cams as far as getting it prepared in the app, did not have any of the maddening issues that I had back then. Attaching the mount to the house was also simple. The camera took about 15 minutes to update its software and was ready to go. I like that I can link this camera to my existing back porch camera so that if it senses motion, the porch camera will automatically start recording, and vice versa. The picture ... in daytime, it's great. You're not going to be able to make out someone's face from 30 yards, but it'll do for when they're closer, and is definitely clear enough to monitor things going on within its range. Unfortunately it still suffers from Ring's lackluster night vision. To be fair, our camera is positioned to where no one will ever be very close to it, and distance is probably not to be expected for a sub-$100 camera. Overall I'm satisfied enough that I am buying two more -- one for our driveway, and another for the other side of the house. Ring's tradeoffs in picture clarity are acceptable to me due to the sane pricing of their products and services. I don't have the Ring alarm system, so I can't speak of how it integrates with that.",Great camera for the price
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2019,SierraTJ,I purchased these cameras before their release and was very excited to receive them. After my initial installation that went very well I began to become less and less pleased. My first and most frustrating issue is the motion detection zones. I completely understand how they work and how to adjust the parameters but their function does not match the settings. My street side camera which is pointed below the street with the motion zone 6'+ away from the street still picks up every car that drives by. My front door camera that has the motion controls maxed out will not pick up me walking down the sidewalk directly in front of it until I'm within 5' of the camera.  Both cameras have proven to be frustrating at best and mostly useless for their intended purpose. But they look nice...,Less than stellar
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2019,Richard L. Patience,"After I wrote this review, I was contacted by Jason from Ring on 12/20/2019, who offered to resolve my problems.  One month, one replacement Stick Up Cam and one (free) Chime Pro later, we finally have a system that works! So Jason was fantastic, the system works well now, but it should NOT be this hard. I stick by my initial comments below - the regular support people were useless, and the Cam can be temperamental.  So my advice to purchasers of this product is that it works well when it works, but be aware you may need additional technology (e.g. a Chime Pro), and you may want to keep Jason (help@ring.com) in mind if you run into issues... _____________________________________________________________________________________ Firstly it took ages to set this up. The product support people are useless. I spoke or chatted with four of them. They are clearly just reading from a script, so they just tell you to do the same things over and over again, even if you did them 5 minutes ago and they didn't work. Then this cam just started working for no good reason after many hours of trying, and after the nth time doing the same installation thing. Who knows why? I didn't do anything different. So I breathed a sigh of relief and thought the worst was over. But no. Now it goes to ""sleep"" after a period of time (which can be anything from a few minutes to an hour), even though the app says everything is working, and nothing will wake it up, except taking the damn battery out and starting again. And as I said, the support people are useless, they don't listen to what your problem actually is, and just repeat the same spiel over and over again. It's a waste of time, a waste of money and a waste of effort.",Incredibly annoying and frustrating - update on 1/22/2020

Yu,"**Updated on 11/8/2019 After two weeks of use, the stickup cam couldn't connect to my wifi extender while all my other devices are perfectly fine, including 3 other security outdoor devices. Tried to reset the stickup cam but it couldn't connect to Ring 53 for setup, called technical support who instructed me to press the orange button for 25 seconds, finally the cam completed update, I was so happy to put it back up outside the garage, however, it lost connection with the wifi extender again, though still can do live view, but no motion alert. At this point, I am disappointed and had spent enough time on this product, pack it up and return.  Hope Ring will improve the product so I will purchase again. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Easy to install and connected to my wifi in no time, the only problem is that the location of this camera is on the outside wall of my garage, far from my Internet modem/router, RSSi reading was 68-77, sometimes is hard to get it online.  With the help of a wifi extender, I can improve the RSSI to 53 and now it works well. There's a few seconds delay in reporting event or bringing it up to live view, but not a big problem for me. This is the 2nd day after installation, so far so good, no problem at all.  Battery during the day with solar panel is about 100%, will drop about 1% or less per hour after sundown, depends on usage I think. This is an update of my review.  On the 3rd day, there are two event recording had a completely black screen, cannot see anything but the letter ‘ring’ on the left side of the screen.  There were also two events that had no alert or recording, that’s when my husband went in and out of the garage, there might be more missed event/alert that I didn’t know of. Called Ring technical support, the technician just kept saying what she wanted to say, may be she was just reading her instruction manual, she didn’t listen closely to what I was trying to tell her.  She asked me to delete and reinstalled the Ring app, unplug and reset my router, there’s nothing wrong with my WiFi signal, all my other devices were working well.  Finally, I ran out of patience and asked for her supervisor, her supervisor asked me to take the camera down from the outside wall and reset it as a new device again, then it’s working, no more missing alert, however, the Motion Snooze function doesn’t work on the app, it says unavailable because Alert was turned off, but the alert was on.  They couldn’t figure out why, this function is not important to me, so I didn’t want to spend more time on this issue. Technical support was not very good, first of all, the back ground was very noisy with many people talking, connection was bad with static noise on and off.  I asked why it’s so noisy at the background, then she did some adjustment and there was less background noise, I think she had her phone on speaker.  The technician was not knowledgeable and not familiar with the product, it was a waste of time talking to her. Today is the 4th day of use, found out that the recorded event footage takes a long time to process, need to wait at least a minute or more before you can view it, kind of inconvenient when you want to see what just happened right away, at least it should show a short preview of the event like other security cameras do. Also, the sensitivity cannot be adjusted, even I move the sensitivity bar and the blue area becomes smaller, but it still alert me of an event when someone is walking outside of the blue area.  Again, I don’t want to waste anymore time talking to their technical support, will give it few more days and see how it is.",Sadly i have to return it after two weeks of use!

The battery life is advertised to last 6 months, however we have to charge our batteries WEEKLY. Of course ring says high traffic areas where the camera is used often can drain the battery life quicker. But 6 months vs 5-7 day battery life is a HUGE difference.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2019,Mark,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now.  It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance. The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength. What I absolutely love about this camera is the customer support that comes with it. After my initial poor review, Ring customer support reached out to me in an effort to help and to pass feedback on to the design team. The representative that called me was professional, competent, and effective. My specific camera may have an issue, but they are ready to swap it out if none of the solutions work. Components can fail at any point, but as long as the customer support still backs it up, I still consider it a good product. The solution the tech representative suggested was to perform a factory reset by holding down the setup button for 30 seconds with the battery in.  Then, set up the camera as you did before.  There's no need to remove the old camera from the app since it will get over-written after the factory reset.  He mentioned that he's observed the freezing problem with this model, but so far the factory reset has solved it.  It's a simple process that takes a few minutes so if you are having similar problems, I suggest you do this. The tech rep even followed up to see how the cameras were doing after the factory reset, so like I already stated, the customer support is top notch. Bottom line is that it’s a cheaper camera so don’t expect it to perform like the spot or floodlight models. However, it still performs sufficiently in proper use cases and has good video quality. The customer support is top notch and is what ultimately made me change my mind to recommend this camera. Update 28OCT: I’ve upgraded the review to three since the motion detection has improved from the first few days and the fogginess was from an especially wet day.  However, one of the cameras stopped working and now fails to detect anything, turn on with linked devices, or give any notifications.  I’ve removed the camera and tried to reinstall it several times but it ends up in an endless “updating its software” loop. I’ve waited about 20-30 minutes for it to finish but it doesn’t. I can’t access the camera or any of its features until this “update” process finishes, which it won’t, unfortunately. It seems like I have a bad camera. Their support has reached out to me, which I appreciate, and I’m curious to what they are going to say. I initially thought the motion detection was horrible but I consider it average now. It has a much narrower FOV than a lot of the other Ring or Arlo cameras. However, it’s a much cheaper camera than these alternatives but you get what you pay for. I’m not sure if it’s worth the money, though. I have a pair of other cameras I just purchased that I’m going to try out and return these if they perform well. ——————————- Original Review: I can not recommend this product, primarily because the motion sensing is bad. I’ve been testing two of these cameras the past 2 days in both day and night conditions and they work maybe 10% of the time. If you watch the video I’m including, I walk directly up to the camera, wave my hands, and absolutely nothing happens. I have daylight videos showing the same thing but I can only post one video per review. Another problem I noticed is that the cameras have bad WiFi antennas. I placed the cameras in the same location of the Arlo cameras I’m trying to replace and the Ring cameras are having a connection problems where the Arlo ones were perfectly fine. Yes, I could add a Chime Pro, but that’s another $50 expense that could be better spent on a more expensive Arlo camera. The cameras fogged over completely in the morning, but I live in Washington, which is incredibly wet. The Arlo cameras fared much better but they still had some fog issues. I did like the integration it has with my other Ring products such as the doorbell and alarm system. The video was good as well. However, with the severe motion detection and WiFi problems, I can not recommend this product. I’m going to give it another few days and probably switch back to Arlo.",Average Motion Detection but Outstanding Customer Support

I wouldn’t depend on it for a major security purpose. I have this hanging from the overhang by my garage at an slight angle about 9 ft from ground. Daytime quality: Great. Motion Detection: The daytime picture shows where the camera first picks up motion. It’s a similar distance if walking up from the street. If someone comes around the back side of my house to break in the parked car, it’s not being picked up. What I don’t understand is how you can make a doorbell that picks up every moving vehicle on the street, yet this doesn’t make it beyond 10ft for detection. Because of this, I have my doorbell set to pick up all the way to the street & also trigger this camera when motion is detected. It doesn’t do much good though since my entry is enclosed and the doorbell only picks up a small section. Night vision: If you’re trying to get a good image of a criminal’s face at night, it’s not happening. (See image - not an actual criminal lol) Although my driveway does have great resolution, I guess because it’s not a moving object. I would return it, but on our house, it was a pain trying to get the wire run through the attic so it’s not worth pulling down. I honestly think this camera probably has better quality at a face level, 90° angle, but the only way I would mount like that is from inside my house so it’s out of reach from theft/vandalism of the camera itself.",Motion detect & night vision leave something to be desired.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Aug 2020,J.O.Elmore,We already use a ring front door camera. It’s worked so well and it’s easier just to stick to the same brand for home security. We wanted a camera that could be used inside or out since on limited budget. This does the job. If my kids are outside in our backyard I just place it on a chair or picnic table. It easily covers the width of our yard which isn’t that small. It comes in handy for “crowd control.” What I mean is when their friends from the neighborhood come over to play I just friendly remind all the kids that the camera eye sees all. I haven’t had to use any recordings to resolve any issues and hope to never have too. The camera is used mostly indoors and I put it In the a certain spot that sees mostly our living room and kitchen. That way I can check in on our dogs when not home. They can hear me talking to them and one of them usually will walk up to it. By now they’re used to it. For the price and to get a working idea on where I might stick outside or inside cameras this camera is great. No need to screw anything. I usually just use some tape just to try out camera positions. Basically dry runs till I bite the bullet and buy more. If undecided about what to do this option is perfect. Especially for being on limited budget. The duality use is great. Drawback is yes the remembering to bring it outside and inside.,Perfect camera for using inside or out.

First thing I have to say that when you receive something from Ring the packaging screams quality. No cheap of flimsy box; everything that is in the package is well protected and yet easy to get out. Before I installed the camera I ordered a battery for backup. After installing the battery I set the camera up following the directions. The Ring android app made it extremely easy to get the camera connected to my network. Once that was done I took the camera outside and found the location where I wanted to install it based on the area of view I wanted covered. By the way, I did order one of the Ring ceiling mounts for it, but the more I looked at the area I wanted it to cover the more I realized that I could use the mount that came with the camera. There is a single screw that holds the stand on. I removed it and moved the stand/mount to the back of the camera. In order to do this you do have to removed a weather seal where the mount needs to be placed; be sure to put the weather seal in the bottom of the camera where the stand/mount was located. It is easy to do, after removing the seal just place stand/mount in the hole, put the screw back in place and you are done. Took me less than a minute. I then marked the location where the detachable part of the mount need to go, drilled a couple of pilot holes, put the screws in and the base of the mount was in place. Snapped the camera into it and put in the security screw. After getting it mounted I plugged it in and it came right up. Used my phone to view and adjust it to cover the area I wanted covered and I was finished with mounting it. Probably took me a total of 10 minutes. So, how does it work? Great. Since I already had the app open I went to the setting menu and turned on the Record Motion and Motion Alerts feature. I turned on Motion Verification and set the Motion Zones the way I wanted them. I then set the Motion Detection and I was done with the setup. The camera has been up for 3 weeks now without any false motion notification, which is a great thing. My wife and I have looked at it quite often. It comes up quickly and the image is great for a security camera. If a friend or family member asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be absolutely. The things that stand out in my mind are: 1. The quality of the packaging, but more importantly the quality of the product itself. 2. The ease of installation. 3. The features and function of the app and the camera. 4. The fact that I don't get false alerts, but at the same time it does alert me when it should. 5. Ease of use.",Ring Stick Up Camera Plug-In

Bought within two months of each other and the same model.  However, they are very different from each other with the user interface. Cons: - Live view is horrible.  Because you are not connecting to your camera directly, rather, connecting to your camera via the internet and then circle back to your camera, often times it simply will not link up.  Motion detection alerts you to an activity.  By the time you can actually see live, the bad guy has beat to blob and stole your house. - 30 to 60 seconds of recording time.  As I said, two cameras, two months apart and the first one records up to 60 seconds.  The newer one only 30 seconds.  Either way it's BS because 60 seconds of recording will only prove to the court that a person was caught on your property and no proof that they beat to a blob and stole your house. - Price.  For the first two items, this product is not worth the money. I cannot recommend this product until they fix the first two issues...  make connectivity instant and increase the recording time for as long as there is activity sensed by the camera.",Won't buy again

This camera has no motion zones at all. Just one that you can set the sensitivity but that seems to be a joke. I cannot get it to alert to a person walking up my driveway until they are about 25 feet away but I get notified of cars going by on the street about 60 feet away. Do not buy this camera since having motion zones is the only way to tune a camera to your specific location. Terrible, I either have to send it back or hope ring puts out an update to all zones.",This camera is a big disappointment

Wrong. It is useless and actually damaged our battery. I had to purchase a second battery and NOT plug the solar in. It fries the battery and within 24 hrs you see messages that the camera is offline and battery is drained.  Makes absolutely NO sense as the sun is pointing directly on it in CA all day.  It's as if the sun overcharges it and damages it instantly.  Brand new second battery, dead 24 hrs after plugging in.  Seriously irritating.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 May 2020,David Kilper,"Let me start with this being a nice camera, with some issues, but manageable. The biggest issue with our outdoor outlet model is that the system is not angle-able, mostly.  Wherever you place it just make sure it's almost perfectly pointed the area you want to cover because it's not designed to be pointed down more than maybe 10 degrees or to the side more than about 15 degrees.  I have to make a wedge to remount it properly. Where the AC adapter plugs I to the back I'm not exactly reassured in any way that water won't get into the electrical port. Don't expect it to capture a license plate more than 10-15 feet away. It will ignore motion detection instances on purpose and you have to actually change the settings to report ALL motion detection moments.  Beyond that, it's more than sensitive enough to detect people walking 200 feet away and the mic pics up even subtle, quiet sounds. It is a pain to setup as there are multiple steps that are not integrated in the startup process.  The image quality is decent and the mount feels like it's pretty durable. The pluses are numerous once the limitations are compensated for.  The software is overly complex and sometimes crashes (apple and android) but it works, and working is more important than intuitiveness in my opinion.",Limitations that need to be addressed.
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2019,Sqoopi,"Pros: 1. Motion detection works well, if you set it up with motion verification, and once set, it picks up as soon as a corner of my coat was in the zone, so it records the whole motion, while the Arlo pro has serious lag sometimes records video with the person already left the view. 2. Batter life seems to be good, I didn't have it fully charged, like only 53%, and after 4 days, it triggered around 40 times (mostly we walked in and out of the house), and it still has 40% juice. 3. day light image is good 4. won't send false alert for tree branches or falling leaf 5. I don't have a paid subscription for cloud storage, but so far, whenever I got an alert, I was able to go into the app and see the complete video, not a snapshot like Nest which is useless if you don't pay Cons: 1. Wifi connection setup has some problem using the app, it said to have connected, but won't show any video, finally figured out to go to setup and connect, then it REALLY was connected 2. Motion Verification is a better and duplicated function of Privacy Zone; Privacy Zone block the areas (2 only) that you don't want to monitor, Motion Verification select the area you want to monitor, and Privacy Zone shows you a video with black boxes that is really annoying 3. Night vision is quirky, when there is street light with IR turned on, it is showing dark screen, turn the IR off, the picture looks better 4. Wall mount base is plastic, so if you mount is on a uneven surface, you will have hard time pushing the camera in, due to the base will flex and the notches are not flat to align the bottom of the camera So far, it is doing what I want in a wireless camera, which is monitor only the area and not sending false alert, the others either failed or need to pay for the feature, so I was going to give it a five star, but little Cons above drops 1 star. All in all, still a good buy for the features.",Works better than the other 2 brands that I have

The issues i had with this model. 1- The camera does not let me stay in live view longer than 5 to 10 minutes. Don't know if this is a app standard or user specific problem . Not a good idea on a security specific product. 2- Connecting to the camera is very hit or miss, loading time will spool up and reach an infinite loading bar at times. I am on a 5Ghz network and tried using both 2.4 and 5 options without success. *** Edit *** The fix that worked for me was reseating my ring camera battery and turning my home router firewall security to a lower setting. Next Forward the correct ports listed for your client and ring device. 3- Cant login to Live Feed with multiple people, only will let one person view at a time. *** Edit *** This changed after fixing settings as well. 4- The quality of the talk to camera feature is low. cant hear it very well. The good. 1- Motion detection and recording worked fine. Once i set the sensitivity correctly, It seems to know when motion is detected 2- The quality of the picture is clear enough to see whats going on in front of the camera. Feature recommend / request 1- Auto show camera feed when motion is detected. 2- Notify all app users when someone logs into live view (app toast notify) 3- Windows app- Turn off Auto Silence other programs when logging into live view. 4- Instant Widget like shortcuts to open live view directly. 5- No timeout on streams",Strange Problems with this model
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2020,James A.,"This is my third Ring camera (door bell, inside camera and now this outside camera), and I have become sold on Ring products.  This stick-up plug-in outside camera exceeded my expectations.  I mounted it on the side of the house under the eaves.  Physical mounting was very easy, and the cord was long enough to reach through the eaves to an outlet in the attic without needing an extension cord. The ball-and-socket joint in the mount allowed sufficient angle adjustment that I didn't need a separate mounting bracket.  The angle of coverage is generous, the image is crisp, and the Infrared night vision is incredible.  It's easy to connect to WiFi, although be advised: when first connecting, it upgrades the software and tells you it could take up to 5 minutes.  Mine took 10-15 minutes with a high-speed router, so be patient.  There is also a wide range of parameters for the camera you can set with the Ring app, making it even more versatile.  I highly recommend it.",Great for monitoring outdoors around home

So installed by the roof to get the sun, and away from tree. The application is unstable, and get confuse, when you use the scheduling mode. It never went back to normal after I used the schedule mode for motion. I did not sign up for the subscription. I purchased this late Oct 2019. I have the floodlight with the subscription. It was great in the beginning (installed 2017?) but the updated firmware, or what they claim enhancement, also caused the application to be confused. Was addressed to Ring, but the light quit turning on when motion is detected and recorded at night.  My issue is, when I changed network after getting a new provider. To change your wifi network, you have to press reset button on the camera that is installed way up there by the roof. I have other security cameras, I do not have to press any button to change the network name. It is all done in the app. Their excuse is for security. Really??? Your security of more revenue?

The outdoor stick up cams can have blind spots even though no specific only motion areas are set and mine are plugged in. My settings are set at max for sensitivity which can detect almost anything (too many notifications) but once you enable the People detection option, it can miss even detecting people at times. Sometimes two people can be walking 5 to 10 seconds apart one after the other and you won’t see detection until the second person pops up into view. The first person is already exiting the area. I have had strangers come to the property to leave ads or packages and I only get to see them as they leave, missing footage from entering the same line of sight in broad daylight. I am only aware that someone entered by spotting them in another cam or scrolling through the pictures. I already have three of these cams.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Feb 2020,RM1111,"I got this because my neighbor and his guests are usually up all night making noise, have come on my property and broken into my car. The sheriff says I have no proof and is either too scared or lazy to answer a call. The deputy told me to get this camera, so I did. Since then, the neighbors have stopped parking their cars in front of my driveway and seem terrified by the very presence of my camera (he keeps adding layers to the fence). But other than that, it doesn't actually seem to work. I hear loud noises outside and try to see if anyone is there. It often takes 10 or more seconds for the ""live view"" to work, so if I did want to catch anything on camera, that time is lost. That's more than enough time for someone to completely pass by and go into the back yard undetected. Other times, live view just simply crashes. You just never know when its going to let you actually use it and see what's happening. All the more reason to have an actual functioning motion detection. I have it set as sensitive as it can be, So its going off every minute during the day, but picks up nothing at night, ever. I have a camera by another brand that is picking up a lot of activity in the street all night long. My neighbor sets that camera off a minimum of five times a night. So I have no ""proof"" from,my Ring camera for law enforcement when something happens. Overall, the whole ring/law enforcement relationship is sketchy to begin with. Everyone knows these are privacy nightmares. Its more expensive than other cameras and makes you pay a minimum of $3 a month to be able to keep your recordings. You can only see them on your cell phone. I don't even want to think about what information the Ring app is collecting from my phone. It claims to be the best and it doesn't really work, at least not anywhere near the level it should for the cost in both money and privacy. The only positive I have is the video and audio quality is way better than my other cameras, but useless if it doesnt record anything at night. When I searched to see if other people have this problem, they do, so apparently its not just my camera. Most crime happens at night, so a security camera needs to be able to work then. That's a given. I wouldn't know that this camera doesn't work if it wasn't for the fact that my other cameras do.

Setup was easy.  The image clarity is excellent.  But the included instructions warn that camera performance will be degraded is used through a window.  In my case, I was using it through double glass.  I got an OK image, but the motion detection did not work.  Also, battery consumption maxed out at a week.  Not worth it in that particular application.  But the doc gives fair warning. But mounting the camera outside changed everything.  The image was sharper and clearer, and motion detection is excellent.  I even was able to back it down a bit.  The battery life is at about 3 weeks.  For some reason, the app on my iphone will often lag when I tap the image for a current view.  Sometimes, it times-out.  That isn't always reliable.  It's a problem.

Ring support says they are working on the issue but I don't believe them. Time will tell. They don't seem to care that people use these devices at home and laptop monitoring is a much simpler way to monitor and control your devices when you are at home.

Pahule Jr.,"I really wanted to like this device as I have a lot of other Amazon services that I currently use and though this would tie in nicely.  I liked the size of this camera and the ease of use and setup.  It is on the larger side as it is about the size of a soup can. The biggest complaint I have is that you cannot deactivate the blue indicator light on the device when it detects motion or when you are viewing the live view.  Now others have said to just put a piece of black electrical tap on it but who really wants to buy a camera that you have to modify right out of the box.  This could easily be done in the software to enable or disable that indicator led, it is so bright others notice the camera and it is distracting when you are outside in the dark, all you see is this bright blue led. The other thing is if you want to mount this on the ceiling you have to order a separate mount, which it should come with.  There is a universal mount adapter which they should just include in the packaging in the first place. Their is not charger that ships with the device, yes it comes with a USB charging cable but not the wall adapter you have to have your own or go buy one separately in order to charge the battery.","Blue indicator light cannot be disabled, lacking mount options and charger."

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Apr 2020,Stephen,"4/8/20 Update: This is the final update.  The firmware upgrade resolved my issues.  It is working fine.  So I upgraded my review to 5 stars.  Here is the bulleted summary.  The original review, and the previous update, appear below unedited. * Excellent support.  They reached out to me to help me when they saw my original review.  Had that not happened, I would have just sent this back. * You cannot flip the video if you mount this upside down (like hanging it below a roof overhang, for example).  It must be mounted right side up.  I don’t know why, as the indoor cameras can be mounted either way. * The integration with other ring cameras in the app is excellent.  The upgrades to the app that occurred recently allow one to set “modes” and enable or disarm various cameras in various situations.  Handy. * Unlike the indoor cameras, this outdoor camera has limited control over motion detection zones.  You can activate three different set zones, but you cannot draw a region like you can with the indoor camera.  The motion detection works fine, but I’d rather be able to activate a particular area as opposed to picking from set regions. * The firmware upgrade was problematic, and was the source of the issues I had. I don’t know why, but with the support help I got, it updated fine and resolved my issues.  If you get one of these, and when you install it tells you it needs a firmware upgrade, make sure that happens.  You can ensure it does by seeing the blue light on the front flash on and off after you set it up (and the update starts).  Despite repeated attempts on my end, that did not happen until I was on the phone with support.  The update does take a while, so be patient.  But if the blue light is not flashing, try power cycling the camera until it does. Bottom line: recommended. 4/6/20 Update: This is an update to my previous review.  This is still a work in progress, but progress has been made.  I increased my rating to 3 stars, but will revise it again after I am done testing.  After posting my original review (below, unchanged), a Ring support person saw it and emailed me.  Which I did not expect.  We arranged a call, and he helped me get the software update applied (which, for some reason, was never properly applied).  This appeared to clear the issues.  I had moved the camera indoors (to eliminate any network issues on my end) and tested it all weekend, and had nothing but problems.  I convinced myself through that testing that the camera was defective and figured I would return it for a replacement.  However, now that the software update was applied, it seems to be working fine.  I moved it back to its outdoor location (which weakens the wifi signal) and am testing it now.  Hopefully this solved the problem.  However, kudos to the Ring support to help with this.  They reached out to me and the person I spoke with was quite knowledgeable.  Very helpful.  I am confident at this point that, if this camera does turn out to be defective, that a replacement will work fine.  Hopefully this problem is solved for good, though.  I will update this further after more testing. The original review appears below, unedited. --- This camera (the stick up outdoor camera, powered by plug in) was completely useless.  I have three other indoor ring cameras which all work fine.  This one was flaky from setup.  Like my other cameras, it setup easily with the app.  I connected it and set it up indoors initially (the installation was to be outside).  Once connected, it immediately wanted to do an update.  Fine.  I wait.  No flashing lights, nothing.  I wait and wait.  After a lengthy period of time, I decided it was done.  I continued through the setup and did a live view.  It was very sluggish, but it worked.  I figured, cool, it’s ready.  So I unplugged it and went outside with an extension cord, plugged it back in, and started fooling around with location while using live view.  Was working fine (however, it was here where I discovered there is no video inversion for this particular model if you want to hang it upside down - this is not true for the indoor stickup cameras, so beware of that).  I leave it plugged in and sitting out side, and I return indoors to get something (I actually went inside to confirm via the internet that, yes, this camera really cannot be mounted upside down).  I go back outside and try to reconnect to live view and it refuses.  Claims poor connection.  Complains about my phone, complains about the camera.  Nothing changed.  Not even the location.  I had just spent several minutes up and down a ladder and screwing around with placement, all with live view.  No problem.  I finally decide to just remove the device and re-install it.  So I do (this time depressing the button inside to put the camera in setup mode).  I eventually get the same message, in the same place in the installation process, about needing an update. So I do the same thing again.  This time I am doing all of this outside, because that’s where everything is now.  Eventually, after (I think) the update is complete (it’s not like it tells you) I try live view.  Doesn’t work.  Well, it sort of worked.  It worked initially, then when I tried to go back to it, it would not reconnect again complaining about a poor connection.  I finally decide to try this one more time.  I delete it again, move it all inside to sit right next to the wifi access point.  I redo the install again (delete the device, put the camera in setup mode, re-install as before).  I again get the need to update message.  This time I just let it sit there for a good 20 minutes so to make sure it installed the update (or thought it did).  So here I am typing this, with the camera sitting on my desk.  It is in live view but constantly stops, complains about a poor connection, and so on.  When I pop in and out of live view, it takes quite a while to reconnect.  All of my other cameras are nearly instant.  But not this one.  All on the same network.  The upshot?  I have no idea if I just happen to have a lemon here or what, but this thing is useless.  It won’t even work 4 ft from the wifi access hotspot.  I can literally see it from where I am sitting.  Every other device I have works fine, including other devices connected and sitting outside (an older security camera, a weather station, .... - all connected to the same network, the same wifi access hotspot).  I am returning this today.  Very disappointed since the other indoor ring cameras work so well.","After some difficulty, works fine"

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Sep 2020,J. Talley,"So very disappointed in this products set up instructions. I have two other cameras the instructions were right on.  I installed a fully charged battery, Scanned the new device into the Ring App. Then set up software asks to switch to a power source, Battery or Power Outlet. Why not both? Looks like it DOES NOT Charge the internal battery, but it does.  Very poor wording in the App setup instructions. So I called, Spoke to technical service for 30min asking, ""Will this camera charge a battery in Power Outlet mode, I think it won't? She stated after much discussion it does not, admitting my suspicions are correct, it's battery or power. BUT not both. A total show stopper....  BUT!!! Still not convinced I went on-line and found this statesmen which changed everything. ""Stick Up Cam Plug-In comes with an AC adapter that plugs into standard power outlets, and you can also purchase a Quick-Release Battery Pack (sold separately) for dual power. With the battery pack inserted, Stick Up Cam Plug-In will be powered by the adapter and will use the battery as backup."" GREAT that is what I hoped. So the problem was a poorly educated technical gal and the wording in the app at set up. Not the actual operation of the camera. I took a battery at 50% from my Ring Door Cam and installed it to see what happens through the day. And (YEA!) it does charge ""very slowly"" from 50% to 88% in about six hours. Be very careful not to pull power and the battery as I did thinking it had static memory, NOT!  In a couple of minuets all the set up memory is lost and set up must be done all over again. DON'T loose the ""Scan Code"" you may need it for the setup process again. All in all it's working as designed. Only reason for the 4 stars is programing is very convoluted to figure out. Be wise and do your homework. Technical support is normally great but in this case RING did a poor job training the agent. Hope this helps?",First time set up is not worded correctly in the Ring APP

However, one of the cameras they sent could not get through the setup.  Called support and they could not get it to work either.  At this point, there is no point continuing this.  It is my view that this model of camera from Ring has serious issues and should not be on the market.  Jason from support sent me return labels and I will be returning to Ring for a full refund.  Good on them for giving me a full refund, but they obviously have some serious issues.  Obviously my one star review will have to remain one star. Update 05/14/2020: Have to give kudos to Ring Support.  They saw this review and I received an email and then a follow up call from Jason.  We reset the cameras and re downloaded the firmware for the cameras.  They both started working.  However, within 24 hours, one of them went into the same non-working state.  No error messages, it just stops recording and no live view.  Jason is now replacing that camera.  However, while waiting for this camera to ship, the other one went down.  Same issue.  At this point, I cannot chalk this up to a defective camera, but rather an inherent issue with the stick up camera model in general.  I am waiting for a response from Jason, but at this point my intention is to ask for a full refund for the cameras and my subscriptions for both cameras.  I am really disappointed.  I was hoping to be able to come here and revise my review with an increase in stars, but I cannot at this point.  Maybe when Jason gets back to me, there will be a positive resolution and I can revise this review again.  Time will tell. By the way, I have no issues with the Ring doorbell at this time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If I could give negative stars I would.

This morning the app informed me I had a plug in model and did I want to activate the better video options available for the plug in model. It prompted me to put the camera in start up mode (pushed button inside battery compartment). I went thru the guided set up, including much more detailed motion zones.

I have mine all linked for extra security. My only disappointments was long lag times to access LIVE video sometimes. Rapid Ring app seems to have solved this problem. It is a very basic app that you can use as a supplement to the original app. It has only 2 functions live video access FAST and it can send notifications. You will probably want to disable the notification feature as they are basic and cannot compare to the original app custom notifications.

I wanted more of these, but this is such a hassle.  There doesn't seem to be a command, verbal or online where I can say ""activate all cameras"".

It’s the 11th day today and the batteries have died so I’m stuck with no ring surveillance while I’m having to recharge them. If this is their way of forcing you to purchase additional batteries and waste more money. Shame on ring! Honestly save your money! Invest in something better! 7/21/2020:  I purchased 3 of these cameras. After much research they just seemed the best option with the best reviews. However, now I feel pretty fooled. We’ve installed 2/3 cameras and I’ve noticed their motion detection isn’t good. I had my settings set at standard recommendation which is what is recommended to apparently conserve battery life. However, today just one day after installation I noticed these cameras will not catch important footage if someone were to break in to my home at a quick motion. I received a notification of motion when my husband entered our home and when I reviewed the image all it had caught was the door closing. It did record me right after entering behind him but it totally missed his entranced. Now I went and adjusted the motion settings to More frequent However I was instantly warned it will shorten my battery life by doing so. The whole purpose of me buying the cameras was to feel safer knowing the cameras will aid with surveillance. I did feel safe after installing them But after today’s motion detection incident I really am disappointed. I did increase the frequency to see whether that will help with the motion detection. However, I’m pretty concerned with the battery life. I tried looking up back up batteries and that’s another  $30 for each camera I’d have to waste. Now I’ve already paid 120$ for each camera and it’s mounts. Not to mention I will have to pay monthly for the cloud. I’m really debating returning these cameras. At this point I wouldn’t recommend.

The camera overall is a great value but there are some shortcomings. First it's strengths is that is provided a decent picture rated at 1080p especially during daylight. I had no problem connecting to WiFi currently using a nest wifi router. If you have a ring doorbell and Amazon show; product intergration is good. Alexa can show video feeds in about 5 seconds average for me. Ring app is good and neighbor app is ok. The biggest complaint for me is that the motion detection is not great. Its range is some what limited and inconsistent. Maybe 10-15 feet. Fast moving objects like the guy who broke and ran through my backyard to dodge the cops chasing him did not get detected.  Zone detection not good u can pick 3 zones and can't customize it. Not great if you have a tree or moving objects near your camera. Overall it's just ok,Great value but not perfect

They were ok and did the job but I just wasn't that happy with them. I was looking at going with Nest but they are just crazy expensive, $200 or more per camera?!?! I had four cameras total and that was still $40 cheaper than just one Nest cam. But, you do get what you pay for. Those took forever to connect on the app, their desktop app didn't even work at all and were powered by USB ( at least the ones inside) which made me have to use an extension cable and have ugly cables going everywhere. I thought I'd give these cameras a try since they were battery powered. I was a little concerned since they weren't recording 24/7 but after actually using them, it's not that big of a deal. The motion detection works pretty good and the fact that you can view live video almost instantly is great (the cheapo cameras took FOREVER to connect). Plus, the video quality and field of view is fantastic. I'm sure the more expensive cameras probably have a better field of view but honestly, these are great for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this camera if you're looking for the middle ground camera (better than the cheap Chinese cameras but not as expensive as those $250+ cameras), also has the benefit of being wireless. Oh and on that, I've had them installed with some pretty heaving motion detection and have gone down only 6% for the cameras outside over two weeks and the inside cameras 10% (a lot more activity).",Great security cameras!
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,The Smith’s,After installing a new entry door on our home we decided to get into the camera doorbell game. We decided on the ring 2 doorbell. It worked so well that we decided to ditch our Front Point security system (still under contract mind you and paying monthly) and go all in with Ring ( security system full protection option/ doorbell / two stickup cams . We wanted full video surveillance outside of our home and went with the ring stick up cam plugin x’s 2 (latest edition). Set up was a breeze as I would have expected. I am kind of a tech nerd so to speak and generally understand technology. Worked well for around 7 hours then the trouble began. In almost 30 days I have yet to go a full 24 hours with both stick up cams running and not dropping out. I have spent two to three hours on the phone with Ring ( very responsive btw). This is on top of 8-12 hours troubleshooting on my own. I spent the amount of time I did because I wanted these to work so bad. They elevated my troubleshooting to the upper level and the same issues are happening. All they say is that it’s a network issue. I have a an rsssi (WiFi strength number) of 40 to a high of 50. Every time the cameras  go to “sleep” I have to get out a 8 foot ladder in Ohio winter mind you  and unscrew the bottom and put in set up mode and start all over. . I got the plug ins for this reason so I would not have to go out climb ladders and recharge batteries. I have zero issues with the doorbell dropping out. The WiFi  mesh system In my home works flawlessly. The tech support leaned towards blaming the mesh but I’m sorry more than 30 devices in my home say otherwise . Never ever an issue. I will not be changing my network for two bad apples that won’t perform. Fortunately I am within my return window.  Unfortunately I cannot deal with the performance and will have to return.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2020,GregT,"I got a pair of cameras and mounted them in front of my garage, perhaps 25 feet from my WiFi router.  Couldn't get them to connect to the router at all. I was able to put my phone near the cameras in airplane mode and then connect to the router without an issue. It even claimed to have a full three rings of signal, but I'm not sure how meaningful that is. I bought a Chime Pro repeater to help boost the signal that I originally installed about half way between the cameras and the router. That was good enough for an intermittent connection, but to get a reliable connection I had to get an extension cord and move the Chime Pro to the other side of the wall where the cameras are mounted. Now that it's only about 6 feet away from the cameras (closer than the power warts that are separated from the cameras by an 8 foot power cords, so I'm I'm sure I have the distance right) everything finally works reliably. But a WiFi range of 6 feet seems incredibly short even when that 6 feet includes an exterior wood frame wall. The motion detection isn't remotely as nice as the Ring doorbell. The camera has three zones (left, center, right) that can be individually turned on or off, rather than the user drawn polygon of activity in the doorbell. Even with ""motion verification"" turned on, one of the cameras is constantly triggered by blowing leaves that appear in all three of the available zones. So I turned off alarms for this camera and now I get lots of nice videos of blowing leaves and the occasional car or person in that part of the driveway. Fortunately I was able to adjust the other camera so that it had a useful motion zone with many fewer leaves that only rarely trigger the camera. After I posted the above review an agent from Ring contacted me to discuss the situation further. She asured me that an RSSI of about -60 dB is acceptable, and I don't disagree - the camera works at this signal strength. We talked about the relationship between the different components and she suggested trying other placements of the Chime Pro. After asking for permission to look at my devices she also pointed out that I have two Chime Pros and only one of them is being used as a WiFi repeater. She offered to swap the newer one (only a couple of weeks old) for a simple Chime and give me a credit for the difference. I took her up on the offer. After the call ended, I also moved the Chime Pro to a different location. It's now further from both the access point (downstairs instead of in the next room) and the cameras (15 feet away versus 5 feet away) than it used to be,  The RSSI reported by the Chime Pro is a bit worse (no surprise) but still very good. The RSSI reported by the cameras, however, improved by about 15 dB. I'm now wondering what's inside that (uninsulated) space inside the eave that separated the previous Chime Pro location and the cameras. But I'm also happy with the result. Another update to the review. Several days ago Ring updated the firmware for plug in cameras (not battery powered cameras0 that provides the same motion zone capabilities that the Ring doorbell has. This is a big improvement over the original three zones and makes it easy to avoid motion from false triggers, such as tree leaves, that might otherwise trigger the camera. Once I pulled out a ladder so that I could reach the cameras installing the update and updating the settings to take advantage of the new capability was easy.","Decent camera, WiFi challenges"

Anderson,"UPDATE: After posting this review with 2 stars I received an email and a phone call from a Ring rep who wanted to help me with my issues.  I am techno ignorant and he walked me through increasing the frequency of the recording so it will record more of the motion.  With all the ""social distancing"" and ""self isolation"" we have at the moment nothing has crossed the path of our cameras except a deer and a squirrel so I can't say yet how the adjustment has worked out, but I am increasing my stars to 3 based on the responsiveness of Customer Service.  I'll update again later when we all come out of our caves. We purchased 7 of these cameras at $100/each giving us coverage all around the outside of the house. They were easy to set up etc, the picture/video quality is good BUT once each camera detects motion it records for 30 seconds only.  It certainly doesn't show the beginning to end motion activity. So, when our local burglar approaches our house we only see 30 seconds of his treachery, instead of it recording until the motion stops.  When I posted this issue on line I found people who said to change the motion frequency to ""frequent""and then the time would increase somewhat (another 30 seconds?) but I can't find any such setting. That is insufficient anyway. It needs to record until the motion stops.  We were going to buy a couple more and perhaps later an alarm system, but won't throw good money after bad and will find another product.",Recording Time Way Too Short
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2019,C. Smith,"I have the Ring alarm system. This is the first camera I've added. Overall, I'm impressed based on the week+ that I've used it to monitor my front yard/porch. Image quality is great and it seamlessly integrates with the Echo Show family of products. I have not experienced issues with motion detection -- it has been consistent, day or night.  It was a matter of finding the ""sweet spot"" that provided good coverage but not so much that cars/street traffic were triggering the detection. I also like the fact that there is an option to have the camera powered by plug plus battery for backup. On the downside, once motion has been detected, video clips tend to not be ready for review for a minute or two afterwards. I don't find it to be a huge deal breaker since a live feed shows within five seconds of being requested - the recorded clip can be reviewed later. I look forward to deeper integration with Ring Alarm - namely motion detection being turned on automatically if alarm is set to away mode. I'd also like to see the ability to have detection automatically turn on at sunset and deactivate at sunrise. A great product from Ring!","Good, Low-Cost Addition to the Ring Ecosystem"
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Mar 2020,Meniscus,"UPDATE 4/21/2020 : It has taken some time, but with the assistance of Ring technical support (who contacted me, I did not have to contact them), I have finally managed to get the cameras working in an acceptable manner, it just takes trial and error, and most importantly, *a good wifi signal*. Motion detection technology itself still has room for improvement and I believe my initial expectations may have been a bit unrealistic. I did upgrade my router to a Netgear Nighthawk and that did noticeably improve my signal strength, which has resulted in more reliable and consistent recording; I strongly encourage you to test your wifi strength at the locations you have decided to mount the cameras, and if your reception is weak you should be prepared to either upgrade your router, add a mesh or repeater, or be willing to live with subpar performance from your camera. Here are some things I discovered in the course of a few hours of tweaking various settings: MOTION VERIFICATION - if you have this ""On"" you may end up with recordings that are ""cut off at the beginning"", for example rather than see a car pull into your driveway, driver get out, and walk to the house, you may only see the edge of the guy's shoulder move out of the picture and then a view of his car sitting there in the driveway. On the other hand, having this ""Off"" may cause trivial notifications, such as headlights passing by, insects flying in front of the camera, etc... I ended up with one camera having this turned off and the other two having it turned on to get the results I wanted. MOTION SENSITIVITY - Don't let the dramatic THIS IS GOING TO RUIN YOUR BATTERY LIFE! warning scare you, I had to set the motion sensitivity to about 70% to get my Side camera to pick up motion near the edge of the range, my other cameras were fine at around 30%. One way to think of this is, if you want to capture motion out towards the edge of the range of the camera, like a back yard, you should turn up the sensitivity; if you are using your camera to cover a smaller area like a back porch, a lower sensitivity will be fine. Be prepared for the batteries to not last ""months"", one of mine already needs to be recharged and the other two probably will by the end of May. But given the limits of current battery technology that's really not bad, I'm fine with it... just keep accessibility in mind when you mount these things because you will need to pull the batteries every 4-12 weeks and recharge them. I may pick up a spare battery. ****************************************************************************** I am very frustrated with these cameras so far. The only reason I haven't returned them (yet) is because there doesn't seem to be much of an alternative when it comes to battery powered cameras. I have spent way too much time tweaking the motion detection settings and the cameras are still doing stupid things like sending an alert when a tiny moth flies in front of the camera but doesn't detect when one of our kids gets into his car and pulls out of the driveway. If it's not going to detect someone getting into a car and driving off then so much for it being of any use as a security camera. I've relocated one of them once and the other one twice and it hasn't helped. I still get notifications and play back the video and see absolutely nothing happening, or they miss events that definitely should have been captured, I can see it being too sensitive or not sensitive enough, but how can it be wrong both ways?! It's like they are doing the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do, capturing what should be ignored and vice versa. And they're both doing it! On top of that, despite claims of battery life lasting for ""weeks or months*, one camera is already down to 77% after being in use for only 6 days; the other is at 97%. If I can't get better results from these things by near the end of my 30 days, I'm sending them back. I will update with the final verdict... but I've all but given up.",Detects flying insects but not cars moving - UPDATE 4/21/2020

My friend rode his motorcycle up my driveway, and it still didn't detect him However, a car 50 feet away going at least 30 miles an hour sets it off every time. So I'm not finding it horribly effective in terms of informing me when someone is on my property. I do like the quick snapshot photos it takes, since that would be the only way I would be able to see a trespasser. I also find the audio to be equal to that of the  Blink camera. But I found the shape of this camera difficult to position. I didn't want to drill a hole in my well so I was looking for something that I could just hide in the bushes. Again here I'd vote for Blink because there are some adapters to use to attach the camera without drilling into your wall. However, the most annoying thing about this camera is that the base slides off constantly. No matter how much I click it shut, as soon as I attempt to twist it to position the camera, the top becomes detached from the base. Or the rubber part on the bottom of the base pops off if I try to screw it in anywhere. It also does not send snapshots to my smart watch like the Blink camera does. Neither of these two cameras is perfect but since ring charges to store my data and blink does not, I'd give the slight edge to the blink. However, the blink does not use rechargeable batteries so I might change my mind after I have to purchase new ones.",I'd say keep looking if you're looking for a motion detector

Tried resetting, reconnecting wifi, reinstalling the device, battery recharging, holding the reset button for 30 secs, all to no avail. Returned to Amazon for an even exchange. They sent me a brand new one which is even worse than the first. No recording, black screens, went through the same troubleshooting process again, the thing is dead as a door nail. My wifi signal tests very good, Alexa controlled devices in every room, etc., all my devices connect with no problem with the exception of this Outdoor Stick up Cam.

Left it on overnight to see how it did on it's own.  After about two hours it died.  Battery was good, it just shut off.  No motion detection obviously.  Not what I want from a security camera.  Called Ring support, they're clueless.  All they can do is read a drop-down menu and if that doesn't fix it then return it.  They really don't care. Update:  Believe it or not but Ring representatives actually DO read reviews.  I was contacted via email by a nice gentleman from Ring politely inquiring about my review and what was my problem with the device.  We had a nice chat and he did offer his disappointment that their product failed me.  Ring is a good product and their prices and plans are about the best out there, IMHO.  He was gracious enough to offer me a discount should I care to give them another try.  After my current upset subsides I probably will.  I'm a magnet for glitches in the matrix and feel I did get a defective product; it happens, to me mostly.  I'll purchase another Ring camera and see how that goes.  I have hope.  Ring is a good company; many friends and relatives have their devices so they do come highly recommended as well.  Will edit review as events play out.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,Sharee,"Great cameras. PROS- The line of site is great. The quality of the picture/video is very good. You have to play around with the settings to get the correct angle, motion detection and proper notification as with any camera. Overall the function of a security camera is perfect. I also like that you can link your cameras to eachother that if one detects motion the rest will begin recording before motion is sensed to get a full range video of the perimeter of your home. CONS- My major problem is the battery life. When I installed I purposely used one with a solar panel and one without to see the battery life and there is a major battery issue.. The one with a solar panel looses 2-5% of life throughout the evening and is recharged during the day with the solar panel. Which depending on the sun I usually have 100% full battery until sundown. The one without the solar panel connected looses approximately 5-10% of battery life a day on a standard motion detection which is the medium battery usage selection. With that much energy used means the battery, clearly will not last more than a month before it will need to be recharged, which is an inconvenience to have to bring the ladder out every month to change the battery. Diffenantly would recommend getting the solar panels for continuous battery life. Overall these camera are perfect for home security. I would recommend",Great Home Security Cameras

This is true even for hardwired powered Ring cameras.  It has nothing to do with battery life, but they lie to you and say it does. It also limits the number of recordings in a 15 minute period you are allowed. I did not find all this out until I called their helpline to ask why my camera was not working correctly.  It turns out it is working correctly, just not the way any reasonable person would expect it to. This company is totally on the cheap.  They do not want to devote the server space to provide a quality experience which allows you to actually record video. The support for this product is also horrible.

I bought 2 of them(one wired, one wireless) and they're useless. First, the app crashes ALL the time, I've never seen an app this bad. For security purposes, when you get a motion notification you need to be able to connect to the camera and investigate. Yet when you open the app it crashes literally 50% of the time so you miss the event. Ok, but at least it records the event, right? No, what they don't tell you up front is that the camera only records for like 20-30 seconds after motion is detected, even if the motion is still happening. So it'll record the potential intruder approaching, but then it stops recording before they actually do anything. Completely useless, especially because even the corded version doesn't record long either, so battery life is no excuse for this limitation. I assume it's so they can save costs on storing videos on their servers? But wait, there's more. You get a free trial where the recorded videos are saved on their servers so you can access them. When this trial expires the cameras no longer record videos unless you buy a subscription which is cheap, but even without the subscription you can still get motion alerts and connect to your cameras and see a live picture of what's going on(if the app doesn't crash, which it will). The kicker here is that as soon as my free trial expired, I could no longer to connect to live view either. Every time I try, it tries to load for a second then says ""Live View Ended"". Once in a while it actually connects. And it's not a wifi signal issue either, the device says the wifi strength is plenty strong, and this only became an issue directly after my free trial expired, so just seems like an attempt to get people to purchase the subscription by making the product totally unusable without it. Update: I've tried reinstalling one of the cameras from scratch, including a reinstall of the app. Nothing has changed. Then today the other camera's motion zones have stopped functioning. So it's capturing motion even in areas I tell it not to. The area I've told it not to capture motion is a plant blowing in the wind, and even on lower sensitivity settings it triggers the motion sensor all the time. So, 100% unusable now.

I bought one at first just to test it out and by the second day I bought another. Easy to link into the app, install takes a minute or two, and the battery lasts a while. I’ve had mine since the 22nd of June, so about three weeks, and the battery level is at 87% still. These pick up almost too much activity which isn’t a problem for me, but for someone who has pets running around or on a busy street, this could constantly pop up with the “motion detected” too often perhaps. Fine tuning the motion settings is fun too. You can disable certain quadrants in the zone or you can increase/decrease the sensitivity. After a few days of playing around with it you’ll get it all to be where you want it. Make sure you are within distance to get a good WiFi signal. If it’s far away or spotty signal you will have a difficult time viewing the live feed or retrieving video when motion is detected. A simple workaround is to purchase a WiFi EXTENDER (not booster, you don’t need faster signal you need farther signal). $20-40 for the extender and most are easy to setup. The only downside, which isn’t a true downside, is you will notice all the animals going into your area when you didn’t realize it, or all the traffic your property might receive from people.

The camera will switch to night vision when it gets dark, but if you have it installed near a light source, and you have motion sensing lights, footage will be recorded in color. Another great feature is the ability to link the cameras. If motion is detected by one camera, and someone or something walks out of view, the other camera will begin recording. The battery life is good, that’s dependent on how you have your cameras set up. If you have motion sensitivity set high, look at live view a lot, or have a lot of heavy traffic, those options will drain the battery faster.

After I received, I must have Generation 3. Problems with this generation is that it only works with 2.4 WiFi and there is no adjustment for the motion area like I have on the door bell. ( The little handles you can grab to select the exact motion area). I have a Ring alarm system with the ring doorbell and was trying to keep it all the same. I purchased a wired stick up camera.

I get alarms every time a car goes by because I cant adjust the alert area and  when I do get an alert, it takes me a minute for the video to process. To connect the lights with the rest of the ring system, you have to buy a bridge. I think they are terrible software designers who can't figure out how to integrate their components to work together so they make the consumer buy extra crap to make it all work.

I received the replacement and it works as well as I had hoped.  I just have a few concerns. 1. My Ring doorbell which was working flawlessly, now reports that it has a bad connection even while it is literally 12 feet from my WAP.  I am concerned that the stickup cam is causing issues since they are are on same WAP. 2. I am hoping that this replacement does not end up exhibiting same performance that the failed one did. I will update if anything changes. 3-29-2020 I bought one because I was very happy with the Ring Doorbell.  I was a little disappointed  that I could not simply mount to ceiling using the mount supplied with the unit.  All they would have to do is add a threaded hole to top. Anyway after setting it all up and mounting it using a mount that I bought,  I found it was offline in the morning.  Restarted it several times.  Brought int house near WAP, restarted it once again. No joy so I reset it added back to same network that my Ring Doorbell is connected to.  Mounted it and a few hours later, again offline. Now, this is the same exact network as I have the Doorbell plugged into.  Amazon is sending me another, I will keep you posted.",Updating from One Star

Sometimes it’s good and other times it’s like I don’t even have a camera. It pretty much catches what it wants. I get a lot of suspicious cars driving by the house so I like to catch everyone who passes. Sometimes this camera picks up a car and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s like it chooses when it wants to work or not. The battery also dies fairly quickly. I only have had my camera for close to 2 weeks and already have to charge the battery. I am planning on getting a solar powered battery charger to avoid going up and down the ladder to recharge the battery, but having it die only after 2 weeks is just ridiculous. $100 is a bit steep for a camera that doesn’t even really work the way a security camera should. I also wish the recordings were longer than 30 seconds, usually you miss a lot of action after that time period has passed. The night vision at night is good though and I like the volume on it and the fact that you can talk both ways. Overall though, this camera still needs a lot of work.

Unusable outdoors. I bought this camera to use outdoors to monitor the side entrance to my house. My WiFi is in the dead center of my 2100sf home. Setup was easy and the camera seemed to work great... when it was in the same room as my WiFi router. I first noticed connectivity issues when I brought it outside to mount it at the side entrance. It would not connect. No live views whatsoever. I brought it in to troubleshoot and noticed that it still wouldn’t connect when I was in my dining room! Mind you, I could literally SEE my WiFi router from where the camera was... about 20 feet away. I get on the phone with customer service and ask what the WiFi range was. Their answer... 12 TO 15 FEET UNLESS THERE IS A SOLID WALL... IN WHICH CASE IT IS SHORTER!!! 🤣🤣 So basically the only way you’re using this outdoors is if you have a router sitting in a window within 10 feet of the camera!",Unusable Outdoors

This Ring Stick up indoor outdoor security camera is a good quality security for $99. Firstly, I went to a geek tech store and bought a security cameras set and was completely disappointed with my experience and the marked up prices. This camera is very easy to install yourself. The picture quality is great. The App is easy to navigate and for $99 you can see what’s happening in front of your property when you are away and added security when you are home. I recommend using the Ring stick up plug in security camera....comes with an 8ft and 22ft cord 30ft total... if you can drill a hole on the exterior to the inside of your home to reach a electrical outlet to plug this device in that is the best option without the hassle of recharging batteries. I tried the recharge battery mode and did not like it but if you do go the battery route make sure you get the correct solar panel (called Ring Super Solar Panel) that will help the battery life. I understand some people can’t drill holes where they live and recharging battery mode with a solar panel is an ideal option for some. Hope this was helpful.",Great deal for $99

The Ring Stick Up (3rd  generation) is better than Blink in both resolution, field of view (wider angle) and night vision but is inferior to Blink in all other categories, including connectivity, response time, and motion zone setting. In addition, the mount that comes with the camera has extremely limited movement/positioning, which limits the ability to focus the camera view on the desired area.  Also,  recording length is not adjustable.  I thought the Stick Up Cam features and functionality (particularly the 3rd generation) would be similar to the Ring doorbell cam, with customizable motion zones, etc., but unfortunately that is not the case.

You install it, and you feel secure however, do not count on this camera to ever allow you to go to live mode or expect it to pick up any motion.

When it came out and announced, I was ready for another Ring Cam for outdoor use and wanted the newer product.  Bad decision in my part and should have paid more attention to the hardware reviews. First, this product has reduced specifications versus the 2nd Generation.  I get it, Ring wanted a product with a lower price point to obtain more market adoption.  You just are not getting a good return for your purchase.  The video quality is terrible versus the second generation product. Second, “Live View” is horrible.  If you go into the Ring App and hit “Live View”, most often, the App just spins and spins saying ""Activating Device"".  Yet, most of the time, it never connects and the visitor or thief is long gone.  This is not a WiFi network issue.  The RSSI signal strength is good.  Very good.  This frustrating behavior is even exhibited when putting the Ring Cam right next To the WiFi access point. Third,  this product sounds good as the price point is lower than the 2nd generation.  Great, but not so great.  Today I went to mount on the ceiling only to find out the video is inverted and cannot be flipped on this camera in the software.  You have got to be kidding me.  What a joke.  A call into Ring Tech Support I find our that you have to purchase an additional ceiling mount kit for $19 dollars.  Well, there goes your savings.

I bought 2 of them. Definitely purchase the wifi extender though. One of the cameras has a struggle with wifi range sometimes but it's having to go through brick. That cam is actually the closest in range to our wifi. There's no way to remove blockages or move it closer either but I haven't had many signal drops on it. The one feature I wish it did have is fish eye view or more of a wider view to cover a bigger area. The sirens on these are not very loud, so don't expect that to really alert the neighborhood or draw attention to suspected creepers on your property. These cams link to a ring doorbell, which is pretty cool. So when someone drives up in the driveway, the ring door bell starts recording before they walk up. You can unlink the devices though. The battery life is what I expect them to be. I recharge these batteries once every 2 weeks probably can go 3 weeks. And that's with the dogs playing outside setting them off every 30 seconds sometimes. lol. You just have to work with the motion detection to custom it to your household activity level. The motion detection is not a far distance, about 30 feet. No big storms lately, so no idea how well it hold up. But they have experienced a few downpours.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Dec 2019,ppshakya,Had a great experience with door bell !! however the Stick up works to cover live video But doesn't work with capturing motion sensor at all...I tired spending long hours trying to figure out if its just me; by installing or setting up all possible motion sensors... Funny thing is when it detects motion .. from the motion logs it specially remove those video ( i have 30 video recording free) and top of it NO motion notification at all .. even though i am at the camera motion zone. The camera is position right and good decent placement ..not to far even fails to detects... When i came to read the review - i see same issues been reported by many buyers.. bingo... So its basically RING has ISSUES... HORRIBLE,Simply doesn't work with Motion Sensor
"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jan 2020,CyberFiberGal,"This is an updated review.  My first review was not good. I was very disappointed at how many steps it took to turn video recording on/off.  I was contacted by Ring support.  New features are being rolled out, and Support got the new features pushed to my account.  The Mode feature solves my issues making turning recording on/off a one-step process in the app now.  The video quality is really good.  There's no Alexa skill to voice control recording, at least not yet, which is why I couldn't give this a 5-star review.  But at this price point, it is a really good value.","Good quality camera, with the newest features app works well.  Alexa integration could be better"

I started with a Blink xt system which i still use .,When i got the Spotlight cams i loved the light feature and  two-way talk and siren feature being that my street had alot of car break ins.. fast forward to buying The new stick up cam..  camera works very well and has two way talk .. Ring also added 2 new features which one is  recording snap shots every 3 to 30 mins you get to choose the interval.. this is almost like 24 hr recording..  2nd you can set the modes.. say if your at home you can hit the home bottom and it will turn off certain cameras you choose.. like say the back yard if your are out there.. Now the best Part of Ring is the Uncanny customer service I received from Jason on 4/1/20..  He walked me threw everything on my system and got it up to running very fast and now everything is great again..  I would buy more of these cameras  in the future to get more areas covered  but the best thing about Ring over its competition is customer service..  bar none !

The doorbell cam is very reliable, good quality image, live view loads fast, and battery life is great. This stick up cam is downright terrible. I don't say this lightly. I have had some way cheaper home camera products that performed far better. I never write reviews like this but I'm so surprised by how poorly this works that I just had too. For starters, it only connects to wifi successfully less than 10% of the time. I have it right next to the router and it still almost never works. I've tried disconnecting other devices to ensure there's proper bandwidth... no dice. I tried connecting my old cheap security cam from best buy I got 4 years ago....instantly connected.

Sol,"The picture quality is good, the motion detection is good, setup was easy.  The biggest issue I have had with this camera and the ring doorbell is you need an exceptionally strong wifi signal for these things to work.  Forget it if you have guests at the house and other devices are being used that are connected to the wifi.  I have the best wifi you can buy for a residential home.  Initially it was hit and miss whether or not this camera or my ring doorbell would work with live connect.  Motion detection worked fine, but if I wanted to use live view, it would only connect 50% of the time at best.  I don't have a large house and the units were not more than 20 feet from my wifi modem/router.  Granted there are walls between, but the distance was not far.  To get these things to work consistently on live view I had to move mi wifi pods closer to both devices and now they work for live view most of the time.  Just beware they are not just setup and use if you plan on using the live view feature to monitor your surroundings.  The picture quality is much better than my old 720P wired cameras.  I just wish they didn't need a super strong wifi signal to work.  Also, it takes a few seconds for them to activate so a lot of the time you don't get the initial video of the person walking by.

Noise. When in live mode with the sound on, I tend to hear a lot of static. However when playing back the video it sounds normal. That's fine. Video quality: It freezes frequently. My wifi signal is ""very good"" where I keep my cameras. The image also pixelates at times. I'm using my camera to watch wildlife and see what kind of critters are hanging around my house so that's fine. People using this for security measures might find that problematic. Battery: Expect about 9-10 hours of charge time for roughly the same amount of activity. Purchase a second battery if possible. Switching Wifi connections. It's not as simple as switching to another wifi from an android or PC. It takes a few minutes. That being said, it's a handy little thing to have.

I decided I wanted a camera in my backyard and I searched for something that could be used that doesn’t have to be hard wired as well. So of course I turned to Ring again since the doorbell is so amazing. I wanted to use only one app system too so that’s another reason why I got the ring stick up cam so everything is under the same app and easy to use. One thing I would HIGHLY recommend if you are not hard wiring this product to get the solar charger for this. I did not and I wish I did. I bought the camera first just to see how long one battery charge would last. It was only a week IF that. And I have it on the lowest alert possible so it doesn’t go off all day long. The set up and the placement is very simply straight forward and easy. The battery though takes HOURS almost a whole day to charge! So, that led me to buying another battery. So when one is in there is another fully charged on deck to use when needed which has been once a week. It’s easy to change them out but it’s really annoying that I have to do often. I wish I would have gotten the solar charger because it was only 20$ more than the extra battery. Overall I would still buy this product again knowing what I do now but id get the solar charger.

There are three large motion zones that can be turned on and off, which is practically useless. And sometimes it fails to pick up motion if it’s within a few minutes of previous motion. The camera cannot be mounted sideways or upside down since the motion zone and the orientation are stuck in the upright position and not invertible.

Chandler,"I'm on my fourth of these cameras for use around my home. I've been able to cover all my major access points and a few blind spots around the property. I'd read mixed results on the battery life of this model. My results have been highly dependent on the placement. Those with less traffic like the garage and basement entries have lasted 3+ months on a single charge. Having dogs that like to spend time on the deck, it lasts about 2 months on a charge. The app makes it very easy to monitor these levels and the reminders help plan when it needs a charge. I found it best to buy an extra battery and keep it charged as it then just requires a swap out and not two trips up the ladder. The wi-fi connection to the cameras seems to improve the longer it is installed (I assume it has to do with finding the best connection point) and regularly connects to the same access point. The speed to access is my only complaint as it can sometimes take a while to access the camera or a stored video once you get a motion notification. I'm sure this conserves battery life but when trying to see if I need to run to answer the door or if it is just someone dropping off a package the delay can get frustrating.

Mostly because there is now NO support at all from Ring/Amazon. The ""Contact Support"" options on the site are gone and just suggest getting help from the ""Community"". Forums does not equal support. Second, the motion settings on these cameras are very bad, undocumented, and not consistent. According to documentation, the motion on a battery operated camera triggers a 20 second recording. Another setting will stop the recording if the motion stops. Finally, a third article suggests a new feature is being rolled out that makes this adjustable from 15 to 60 seconds. None of these are true on my devices. My devices record for 15 seconds following initial motion and then stop regardless of whether the motion continues or not. Further, they also seem to save battery life by then not responding to further motion for some undocumented period of time.

Don't record the first 15 seconds of something and then turn off for 5-10 minutes. What about that helps in a real world situation.

Setup was simple, but there was an issue with a weak wireless signal for the lanai camera. I ended up having to get a range extender to fix that, but then found this kit isn't like what Ring normally gives you. For example, the security screws are a philips screw instead of the usual ring star screw and not all the mounting hardware is included in these. Theres no ring screw driver,drill bit, or even the screws to affix the power adapter to the wall. I called Ring and they said thats what is included and tried to figure out the right mounting hardware for outdoor power brick. Without that, anyone can pull power from your camera. Ring tried to find the part and is hopefully sending them to me. These cameras are essentially the 2nd gen battery camera with a power cable. However, unlike the 2nd gen, there's no way to secure the barrel tip cable to them like the old 2nd gen battery. The Pro is the outdoor power cable combined with the plug makes a total length of 32 feet you can run your camera from and I used every inch of it on my front porch.

At first, just the ring stick with the battery signal works great off of wifi outside and inside NOT against the window ( I'll explain how to get this to work ). You can customize your motion settings, allow it to see only people, and the activation comes on pretty fast. I personally wanted to use this behind a window so it pointed outside.  Since I live in an apartment, damaging the siding is a no no.  At first, the sensor would not work at all.  I've tried everything.  I finally got to the last option of purchasing the plug to make it go from cordless to wired into an outlit.  And by God that did the trick.  The sensor catches everything now behind the window, and fast!  I guess battery only made the sensor weak?  Not sure, but it works fantastic now.

I love the option to choose ""at home"" mode, which keeps live view quickly available if I need it. ""Away"" mode is set up to detect motion and alert me. I gave a low rating for wiFi signal, but I know that isn't a flaw of the camera - it's simply the trade-off for living in an area with no neighbors (or high-speed internet services.) I really feel so much better knowing I can see that side of my house wherever I am. With my usage habits, I've been happy to see that the camera isn't using much data at all!

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Oct 2020,Mancomb Seepgood Jr,I have a neighbor who complained about my dog barking. He doesn’t bark excessively and we stop him if he starts to bark too much. But after the neighbor called the cops we decided we needed to protect ourselves and our furry family member. This works! We set it to record for 120 seconds. And it records every time he goes out and comes back in. Of course now that we have proof the neighbor hasn’t called the cops yet. But the picture is great! The sound isn’t amazing but it at least records his barking. Very happy customer. We did have to pay $30 for the year of membership so we could keep the recordings but it wasn’t too bad,Great video!

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,Jason Silver,"Having had a Ring Doorbell for years.  It's outstanding.  So, when I was looking for some security cams, the ring stick up cam was a no-brainer to choose.  Unfortunately, 1) The unit does swivel on the mount.  But, it is very limited and not enough for several of my Cams 2) The ""non-stop power"" is simply plugging in the cam.  There is an optional battery pack, which would seem useful as it would protect against someone unplugging the cam in order to disable it.  However, it is not clear whether the cam will trickle charge the battery.  When I called Ring support, the person first told me that the cam does not accept a battery, when I pointed out that the web site says the cam does take an optional battery, she rechecked and finally checked and told me that it does not trickle charge the battery and that I can expect to have to charge them every 6 months. Can't tell if I got the correct answer, but that is a disappointing situation 3) One of 7 cams blinks a slow red when plugged into the nearest outlet (but works when plugged into a more distant outlet with an extension cord). Slow red blinking is not documented. Support line claimed that it was a firmware version problem. I don't know what it is, but it is (1) not a firmware problem if it will work in a different outlet and (2) this is bad support",Somewhat disappointing for multiple reasons

If there are no outside lights to assist you might be better off with the LED spot, though I've read that there are issues with those. Not having an end without the plug attached is borderline design malpractice (aka: no one tested the damn thing).  You need to drill a 1"" hole through the wall in order to fish the line through.  and given that many exterior installations would be on block, that's difficult for a carpenter/handiman and nearly impossible for the average homeowner.

It covers a much smaller range as the spotlight cam, I would say 1/2 of the space as the spotlight does.

However after several days of use and testing discovered the motion sensing was very intermittent and we were not getting notifications for most occurrences (people coming and going to door). Called customer support again and was given a sure fix that of course did nothing to fix problem. On a whim I decided to try the camera with the Motion Verification setting in the off position(found in the app under motion settings-supposed to reduce false positive notifications). With this function off the camera started working and started picking up motion in the zones. I then called customer service to discuss the ramifications of using the camera with this setting in the off position. Talked to 3 different CS agents in tech support and not one had a clue what Motion Verification even was. One had me send him a screenshot of where it was on app. Another said if I turned it off, the camera would never pick up motion.

I followed every step by step procedure setting them up, and initially only 1 worked. After playing with the other 3 that I also purchased and getting frustrated and walking away they 1 by 1 started working without me even touching them. Once I had them all working installing them was easy. I then switched to using the solar panels and all 4 cameras died over night. I’ll try moving the panels into more direct sunlight and hope that helps. In the mean time I’m trying to switch the power mode back to battery and again running into so many complications.  Why wouldn’t these switch to battery mode on their own?  Even though I charged the battery over night, ran the cameras on solar panels until they died in one night, I still need to charge the battery before I can switch to battery mode.  I thought the batteries were supposed to last 3 months. What a pain these have become. I will say for the (very few) short hours these worked they were wonderful. *UPDATE*  An associate from Ring saw this review and set up an appointment to help figure out the issues.  From the phone call I learned my battery died quickly because I had it set to WIRE mode while plugged into the solar panel which is the incorrect setting, it should still be on battery mode.

Just look in the Ring Users forum and you will see it over and over.  Our 2 Ring Stick Up Wired cameras are basically worthless since I can't do live view and motion detection is very sparse and random.  I drove our cars in front of the camera into the garage and the camera did not sense anything.  If I get on a ladder in front of the camera about 2-3 feet away it will detect movement. And yes the settings are correct for maximum distance and as sensitive movement as possible. I have spent hours resetting the camera, options, etc and even purchased a new Mesh system to see if that helps.  It did not.  The camera will just not do a live view. I'm currently sitting next to the camera and router.  The camera always gets a ""streaming error"" when trying to do a live view. It is just a flaw in the camera. The app also report a critically low battery even though these are wired units without a battery.  Another issue Ring is aware of but has not corrected.  Ring's solution is to insert a battery and see if that works.  SMH! Our Ring 3 Plus doorbell on the other hand works just fine.  I was hoping to have a homogeneous set of doorbell and cameras but that does not appear to be an option.  I will look to another vendor for a camera solution.

Instead of editable zones, you have these triangular areas that you can turn on and off. The problem is that it doesn’t cover a wide range and you’d have to position the camera in order to get the most coverage. Disappointing.

The camera and all the features work fine but I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the new design of the AC plug. I want to use it outside which it is made for and with AC power. The issue is the design of the power cord. On one end of the wire is the plug which goes into the AC outlet which is understandably large. The new design on the other end is a right angle plug to go into the camera itself. the issue is that you have to make an extremely large hole in the wall to get the right angle plug through. My previous cameras have a straight plug so no large hole required. Called customer service about the issue and she said that most people use it in an apartment.

I don't know if I got a defective product or the technology has changed but the Stick Up Camera is by far the worst camera I've owned! It has poor range signal, is constantly trying to connect to the network (despite being right next to the rooter) and drains the battery within 5 days. I tried to check on my animals while traveling and could not view the camera via the app the entire time we were gone. It's an absolute waste of money!! If you're looking for a good, stable camera that pans & tilts I highly recommend Foscam. Just ordered a new Foscam to replace my $100 ""shelf ornament"".

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,Jaden,I like that it's a simple cylinder type camera and prove to do the job. I wanted to hang it on the ceiling but couldn't because it did not come with bracket like the previous version. I thought you can change the camera view if the camera was hung upside down. I guess wrong. The bracket they offer was pricey. I ended up going to home depot to buy my a 3 dollar bracket and brought my camera there to find the right screw that fit the back of camera to mount on new bracket.

I added this to secure the backyard and rear door to the house. We went with the wired power source instead of battery/solar option. Adding the camera to the Ring app was a snap. Just had to scan the code that came with the camera and the camera got integrated into the app. It was easy to set boundaries of the alarm area. I was able to tie the motion alarm into Alexa controlled LED lights on the patio to turn on for a minute whenever motion is detected at night. Alexa also can announce when motion is detected.

I called ring, and the customer service doesnt even know what happened to that feature and if it was taken out. And we cannot return it because the allowed return time is expired.

This, not so much. I have a blind spot with the ring doorbell so I purchased this and placed it a few feet from the doorbell. The wifi pickup shows a great reception so I installed it. One hour later I could not connect to live feed. The reception slowly trailed off and the camera would not connect to my iPhone. I took it down and reconfigured it to improve wifi reception. Placed it indoors to monitor its performance. Being 15 feet from wifi and the reception trails off to a point where I once again cannot connect live feed to my iPhone. I am not going to pay for monthly storage when I cannot even view live feed! I now have the camera facing a wall and it picks up who knows what and continually chief that there is movement, yet I cannot view live.  Ring suggests a wifi extender.

Got the box 9/16, everything looked fine.  The install location is different than the delivery location so I decided to open the box before I got to the location, check the battery and maybe do a test set-up (9/17/2020).  I'd previously read either in the product information or in an 'Answer' given by a Ring rep on Amazon that batteries are usually at least 70% charged upon arrival.  I plugged it in.  15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes.  I unplugged it from the computer and  plugged it in to a wall thinking maybe it would charge better.  60 minutes, 90 minutes and on and on.  So I didn't go that day.  Left it on the charger overnight.  The green light was on the next morning so I unplugged it, got ready to leave.  Before I left, I popped the battery in per instructions and Alexis or whoever's voice that is, lets me know that my battery should be fully charged before set-up.  HUH?  I just took it off the charger and hour or so ago. I pop the battery out, put it on the charger and sure enough the green light is gone?  Seriously, its been an hour since it was fully charged and it wasn't in the camera during that hour.  I wait for it to fully charge again, forgo the test setup and go to the location.  I sit in the car and start the set-up again.  Yep - BATTERY SHOULD BE FULLY CHARGED BEFORE SET-UP, its been30 minutes!!!  LOL.  I just continue with the set-up to make sure the wi-fi & everything works.  For over 20 minutes it said to wait up to 5 minutes for updates.  I finally closed & reopened the app and after a total of 30+ minutes it connected. Everything seemed fine.  The motion was alerting instantly while I was in the car.  By then, the install location was full of people so I decided to wait to do the install.  Popped the battery out and sure enough when I got back in a few hours later, it needed charging.  So, needless to say, I'm worried that this battery that literally won't last 2 hours, is never going to last 2 years. The soonest I can do the install now is Sep 21 or 22nd.  Then I'm leaving town (hence the install).  By the time I get back, my return date will have passed, but I already know I received one of the defective ones. Maybe there is some crazy upside down world where a battery drains slower when it is actually connected to a device, but somehow I don't think so.",Already worried

Walking in front of the camera waving hands does not produce an alert. Even picking up the camera and moving it around produces no motion alert. It’s interesting that ring has also cut corners with the camera itself. The case feels much cheaper with worse fit and finish when compared to earlier examples of this version of the camera.

On these newest stick up cameras, Ring has ruled out snapshot capture. Representatives say this was done out of fear that anybody who uses the camera without a solar charger or other external power might run down the battery too fast. But the camera already recognizes when it has external power rather than just a battery, so why not have the software allow snapshot capture when there is an external power source (either solar or plug in)?

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Apr 2020,RnB Dawg,"I have had 2 Ring battery operated cameras installed on the exterior of my home since October 2019.  Thankfully I have not had any attempted break-ins at my home, as I only recently discovered the cameras will only record for 30 seconds from the moment it detects motion (20 seconds for cameras activated since March 2020).  And I only detected this when a contractor drive down my driveway, parked and walked to my front door.  The camera did its job and started recording when it detected the vehicle on the driveway, but by the time the contractor exited his vehicle, walked to and rang the door, and my wife walked to and opened the door, Ring had already been recording for 27 seconds.  So, imagine the same scenario and the person, after exchanging pleasentries assaults my wife; there would have no recording, as the 30 seconds of recording would have ended. I jumped on the internet to determine how I could lengthen the recording time, even at the expense of battery life.  After all, I had already bought an extra battery as the promoted battery life is a farce.  I discovered something called a ""Ring Community,"" where Ring consumers can ask product questions and Ring ""Community Managers"" allegedly act as a go-between between the customer and Ring developers.  I discovered that this issue was raised by a number of Ring customers starting back in July 2019, who have since become very unsatisfied Ring customers, and now some are ex-Ring customers.  Despite the Community Managers' standard line of, ""Rest assured that us moderators are reviewing every new post and reply as they come in,  ... and take your feedback seriously,"" they ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CARE about customer satisfaction.  If they did, they would listen and enable the customer to set the record time, certainly well beyond 30 seconds. Instead, Ring spent months modifying their software to do the exact opposite; now customers have the ability to REDUCE the record time.  What break-in occurs within a time period of LESS THAN 30 seconds?  Ring customers who have been victims of break-ins have been among those who have provided feedback to Ring within Ring's ""Ring Community,"" expressing the need for longer recording ability.  But all Ring has done is attempt to pacify with their same propaganda that they take customer feedback seriously, and have achieved nothing but infuriating those who have spent their money on a very inferior product.  Eleven (11) months have passed since the complaints about the inadequate recording time began within the ""Ring Community;"" and Ring has done nothing positive to improve their cameras. If you are in the market for a ""security"" camera that will actually record the full range of activity of a visitors with questionable intentions DO NOT buy a Ring camera.  You may be temporarily satisfied with its abilities, like I was, up to the point where you realize it won't be there for you when you actually need it!  A number of people on the aforementioned ""Ring Community"" thread regarding the recording length have determined that a battery operated camera called ""Arlo"" allows the user to determine the recording length.  I have not yet investigated the ""Arlo"" camera, but plan to.  $230 down the drain, but live and learn.  For safety reasons and terrible customer service I'd give it a ZERO if I could.  So, save your money and your sanity and stay as far away from a Ring camera as possible.",A completely inadequate camera for security and a Customer Service Dept that will drive you insane

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Mar 2020,Ashley Paugh,"So, I was fairly worried upon purchasing this stick-up Security camera (as an addition to our first ring doorbell security camera)— mainly due to the fact that we live in the dessert, and it gets extremely dark where we live @ night as we are outside of the main downtown/city area. I was concerned that even if we kept the back porch light on each night, the night vision would still not be sufficient enough to pick up on movement/a person (should someone attempt to hop our brick wall fence). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this camera’s capabilities were MORE than sufficient enough to do the job! In fact, every time I go to let my golden retriever outside to go potty @ night...I’ll get blown up with the Ring app notifications I set up on my cell phone: “Motion detected in your backyard”. My dog is still a VERY CURIOUS puppy, and since he’s not used to seeing this camera in his backyard...he likes to go and check it out every 5 minutes when I let him out there, 😂. I don’t mind it....at least I know the camera is working fine & dandy! We will be purchasing another identical camera very soon for our garage. OH! And trust me when I say that if you’re reading this in search for your next system (as a 1st time owner)....you should stop looking at all of the bajillion other security cam systems now, for one simple reason: THE NEIGHBORS APP! You can see any posts made by neighbors! Basically, you tell the Ring Neighbors app to alert you of any new posts made within a specified radius of your home—and you can customize which areas around your home you’d like to include. Just select what you want to see updates about...thefts, neighborly events, suspicious activity, and etc. We (my boyfriend and I) spent 2 months contemplating/going back & forth constantly on the various security systems offered, their specifications, and blah blah blah. I wish we would’ve went with this right away! So user friendly, great technology w/easy to use apps for viewing instantaneously w/ease, 24/7 tech support available...AND the ability to see what’s happening nearby/in your neighborhood, to help protect you and your neighbors?

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 May 2020,Santch,"I don’t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have duty to write one in this case. These cameras are truly awful. Honestly, if you want motion detection, run in the other direction as quickly as you can. Now, the more thorough version: the motion detection in this camera is quite limited in its manual options (you can’t manually draw an area where you want the camera to focus its motion detection on, for example) and the automatic options are fairly useless. The motion area simply divides the picture in three (imagine a half circle with three 40-degree angles meeting at the lens, like pizza slices) and you can decide which ones to turn on or off, which is limiting to begin with, but they also don’t work very well. Most importantly, this camera never picks up motion quickly (with or without “motion verification” turned on). I have my camera set up so it covers the length of the alley leading up from the sidewalk to my front door (~30 feet). I’d say the success rate of it picking up a person walking to my front door is maybe 20%, and the success rate with someone walking back is maybe 40%. So, you will likely get no alert at all, or the alert will only show the person walking back, which is not that useful. Also, Ring has decided that they would rather have you buy a weird looking adapter than let you simply reverse the image in the even the camera gets mounted upside down on a ceiling). Finally, I’d suggest a quick search on the web regarding Ring’s privacy policy - it will tell you a lot about the company. Seriously, look elsewhere!",Look elsewhere if motion detection matters to you

No problems with those devices so far. I bought two Stick Up cams and I’m very disappointed. Both have connectivity issues — one of them simply went offline after a few hours. To the “obstruction” argument, you can literally place the cameras on top of WiFi router and it still won’t give you a live view (it shows an “Activating Device” message forever until it gives you an error), so no, the problem is not the WiFi signal or the router (as I said, I have two other Ring devices connected to the same network and they perform fine). You’d think because these products belong to the same family they would have the same technology as the Door Bell and the Spotlight but I found out that’s not the case. Had I bought these cams before the Spotlight and the Doorbell, I would have never bought a Ring product in my life. One star is too much for a piece of equipment that simply doesn’t work.

Turns out they charged me 29.99 for it and reduced the price of the camera proportionally... which sound fine UNTIL I didn't receive the camera and had to reorder it.  They were going to issue a refund for ONLY THE CAMERA which meant that I would be receiving $30 less without ever receiving the camer!  I had to call in and fuss with customer service reps for an hour to convince them to refund for the whole bundled amount and convince them that the dot was SUPPOSED TO BE FREE!  Then when they finally refunded the price of the dot as well (which it was never my intention to buy) they told me I could keep the dot too.  Well, that seemed nice....  But it turns out the dot was automatically flagged as lost/stolen and it can't even be registered to an account!

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,shoemania,"Pros: easy to install But...!! BIG CON: cannot control length of recording!! Even when it’s plugged-in and not run on battery alone. Essentially stops recording even when motion activity is ongoing. Thus important activities are always cut short and you don’t get to see what happens! Many have reported this issue on the Ring forum and judging by the responses from the Ring team, this setting nowhere close to being resolved. The most they’re willing to do is to eventually implement a 60 second recording setting on battery-powered devices (default is 30 sec on battery) but this changes nothing for plugged-in devices where the max. default is already 60 seconds. It’s been suggested by others to change the Motion Frequency setting to “frequent” so that, in theory, a new recording will begin right away if the motion continues. But this isn’t a reliable solution and still misses potentially critical activities that might occur in the seconds between the recordings. Unfortunately I’ve passed my return window on all of my Ring cameras but this is a big enough issue that I’m going to spend more money to buy different cameras as replacements. Any criminal who might be familiar with Ring cameras will know to just wait out the set recording time in order to avoid being caught in the act.

And thats if we can even connect. More times than not when we try to log on we receive an error message or it takes forever to load and it’s not a router issue.

Initially it works fairly well, however, the camera periodically (every 2-3 days) loses the ability to connect to the internet and can only be reset by physically removing the camera from its base and manually pressing the reset. Placing these cameras out of easy access is therefore challenging. The camera then works fine for another couple of days before repeating the cycle.

"Ring Stick Up Cam Battery HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2020,Yee,"The zones for motion detection are left, right and center but they are not adjustable for distance.  So unless you can tilt the camera down far enough, things that you would like to ignore, such as pedestrians just passing by will trigger the motion sensor and send out unnecessary alerts.  So the pivot is too limited to do that.  If it could do that, then you could lose the view of the action that passes by when the camera has been triggered by motion.  You might not be able to see a car service or taxi that you ordered. The night vision is pretty good with the infrared.  If big nearby objects are in the view and reflecting the light back to the camera, then the camera is blinded because it functionally drops the aperture and darkens the intruder's face. The wifi seems pretty good but it may be necessary to use wifi extenders or have a mesh system to optimize the upload speed to get a better image that doesn't pixelate because of fast motion.  This is hard to test except with lab conditions.  Sometimes people in view seem to freeze for an annoying period of important time when they might otherwise be presenting their best face during the freeze period.  The units probably can't buffer enough data to deal with slow connections. My view with limited experience dealing with this kind of stuff.",What doesn't work well
