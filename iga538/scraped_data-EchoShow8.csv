Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Jeff,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units. Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update. EDIT: The current top review claims that I (and everyone else complaining about this) am wrong and this can be disabled. While this person is right in the fact you can customize a lot of the display, the “try” suggestions at the bottom are not one of them. For the record I contacted Amazon support before posting my review to confirm this. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.","Great, but for one fatal flaw"

The ""Things to Try"" sayings are sooooooooo annoying.  And they are so stupid and do not pertain to me at all.  ""Alexa, how do you say hello in German?"", ""Alexa, rap for me."", ""Alexa, how hot is the sun?"", ""Alexa, what's the temperature on the North Pole?"", blah, blah, blah.  They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.

I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock. I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display. But I found that the ES8 does not have the same options for clock faces as the ES5. There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.",Echo Show 8: Good But Not Quite as Good as the Echo Show 5
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,Dave W. Dinges,"I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front & back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them. Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.",So easy and so good with Ring cameras
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Phil,"I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch. I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices. Sure you are getting 20 percent smaller in terms of screen size. But the difference is not too crazy. The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good. The sound is very solid in the echo show 8. I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good. Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it.","Scaled down version of the show 2, but a bargain"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2019,cacalazani,"This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening. Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience. When music is played, the lyrics scroll on the screen, so you can sing along (if your housemates and dog can stand it).  Even when playing at a higher volume level, I can still get Alexa's attention but it may take more than one attempt.  The microphones are quite sensitive and will pick me up from another room as long as there is not much background noise.  The Show 8 also has Bluetooth, so you can pair it with a phone, laptop or other device and play music through the Show 8's speakers.  I do this frequently since the Show 8's speakers sound much better than the internal phone or laptop speakers.  I did notice a bit of a delay in watching a video on the laptop, and then the audio coming out of the Show 8.  It just may be an artifact of using Bluetooth to send the audio. Rather than the recommended stand (or no stand), I purchased the ""Echo Show 8 Adjustable Aluminum Swivel Stand"" also sold on Amazon (you can see my review of the stand on that page).  A stand is recommended to allow you to position the Show 8 at an optimum viewing angle. I also purchased several of the Meross Wifi smart plugs (also sold on Amazon).  Have them programmed to link with Alexa so I can give one command (such as ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Lights"") and ALL the plugs in the Christmas group turn on at the same time.  Pretty cool!  Once Christmas is over, the plugs will be assigned other duties. The Show 8 can browse the web.  There is a Firefox skill that will allow you to open a web browser.  And if you don't like tapping letters on the screen, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (see photo).  If you have an HP printer, it can be linked to the Show 8 to print grocery lists or stuff you find on the internet. Not a deal-killer for me, but can't seem to be able to disable the ""Try Alexa <blah blah blah>"" on the bottom of the home screen.  You CAN disable the skills cycling with other topics in the center of the screen as another reviewer noted.  I have the Show 8 in my kitchen; so the display is not ""in my face"" and I am not looking at it all the time, so it is not THAT big of a deal. Have to admit I was skeptical and wasn't sure if I would find it useful....but I'm liking this device more every day.  Now an Echo Dot has found its place in our household as well.  Along with some Echo Buttons.... Like the Echo Show 8 so much that I ordered another one to give to my daughter and son-in-law!",A Great Addition to Your Home Tech
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Erick S.,"I love the way I can control Home Automation with Alexa. Was so excited to get the echo show 8, as my first echo screen unit. But as soon I powered it on, first thing I can see is the backlight bleeding so much. Is this normal to have that much, or did I got a bad unit? Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I’ll have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it’s normal or if I can get a replacement. —— Edit: Amazon it’s awesome, and it’s sending me a replacement. Will post back once the new unit arrives. —— Edit: added a picture for comparison. Second unit looks really good. Thank you.",Backlight Bleeding.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2019,G. Pounds,"So I read the comments before I purchased it stating that the ""Try, Alexa ...."" messages can't be removed from the screen.  Honestly I thought that was wrong.  But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't. There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them. Since Amazon is disregarding the input from users, the only option is to not buy the device and return the ones bought for a refund until Amazon adds the ability to turn these messages off.  Nobody buys a screen to be forced to watch ads.  Amazon if these messages truly added value then customers will leave them enabled on their screen.  The fact that you don't provide an option to turn them off indicates you realize they don't add value. I'm returning mine I suggest everyone simply think twice before you purchase one.  It truly is frustrating beyond belief that there is no way to disable these messages from the home screen.",Yes this is incredibly annoying

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,Savory Stage,"EDIT: Just when you think it can't get worse... It does. I was cooking dinner tonight and had a timer set. Once the timer was up, I said, 'Alexa, stop' and then tried about 15 other different variations of this. Alexa thought I had no timers set on any devices and the timer continued to sound until I had to unplug the device and plug it back in. Also, yesterday while watching TV, I randomly started to experience some incredibly noticeable sound distortion on my Fire TV stick 4k. Once again, after trying every other possible solution, I had to restart the device. ... ORIGINAL REVIEW: Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong. Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work. Other cons to note: -Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them. -Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at. -I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway. -The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens. -You cannot set a sleep timer Honestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",Incredibly disappointed with Alexa and Fire TV integration
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Ms. T,"I got this primarily to use as a digital picture frame in my living room and it does a great job of scrolling thru my pictures and they display beautifully.  However, it puts the annoying things to try at the bottom of every single picture and is ruining it as a digital picture frame.  People have been begging Amazon for years too stop doing this and they keep ignoring it. I have turned off continuous scroll, Discovery,  and every other setting I could find and it is still there. This is infuriating.  I mean really, by now, most people know how to use their alexa devices, so why do they think this is necessary?!?! It makes no sense that they should force this on everyone .  I have an echo spot and even a show 5 that I was able to get it to at least only show it once, but on the 8 they apparently decided it should be a part of the wallpaper itself.

Like everyone else, I didn't like the try whatever crap at the bottom of the screen, but the large clock with date was nice. So, I thought I'd upgrade to the larger screen. HUGE MISTAKE!! The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone. Time to start looking at what the competition offers. Better get on the software updates quick Amazon or you'll find people will go elsewhere for a more user friendly alternative. UPDATE 6/3/20 Amazon FINALLY got their act together and updated the firmware to display a clock with the date on the home screen! What took them so long is anyone's guess, but better late than never I suppose. My review has gone from one star to four deducting one star for the time it took them to get this right. UPDATE 6/4/20 Don't know what's going on, but the large time display with date is gone and it's back to the tiny time display without date again. Back to a one star review again too! I'm even more angry now that I was teased with a home screen time display more like the Echo Show 5 and it's been taken away.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2020,SubieNewbie,"So I bought this Echo Show 8 on a whim for my bedroom because I wanted a better sound for music in there than the Spot that I have now. Granted it's much bigger and there are no comparisons in virtually every area measurable. However, I was disappointed with two things. First, the depth of this unit seems excessive and it's definitely not best used on a nightstand. It just takes up a big footprint. I thought I had ample room but with a lamp, a coaster, and two charging pads for my phone and watch, I had virtually no more room to even put the TV remote down on the nightstand. Secondly, and most importantly, it only has two microphones on the top of the unit. Whereas the Echo and Echo Dot has four and seem much more sensitive when detecting my voice. The Echo Show 8 will sometimes barely pick up a command when the Echo Dot in the next room, which clearly has sonic superpowers, will reply back. I have two Echo Dots in my home, one Echo Show 5 and now this Echo Show 8. The Dots far out perform the Shows when it comes to sensitivity and average percent that they are correct in interpreting my request. They are all supposed to have far field technology where, as I understand it, two Echo products may hear a command but the closest one responds. This needs a lot of work. And I believe the answer is quite simply that the Dot has four microphones. Two more than the Shows. Which seems odd to me considering the vast difference in price. Now as far as the sound goes, it is really quite good for the money. After adjusting the equalizer in the settings to up the bass, mid and treble. You can also request these to be increased or decreased by simply commanding something like ""Alexa, increase the mid""  (or treble or bass). Each request increases the setting by one level. I believe there are five positive levels and give negative levels from the flat center. After tweaking the sound settings, Alexa does not sound hollow and music is full and fills a small to medium sized room. Bluetooth pairing from your phone is also simple and I like that I don't have to rely on the Alexa app to modify settings. The setup was super simple as expected. It's just a matter of logging in to your Amazon account with the touchscreen prompts. It guides you through everything you need to complete and customize your home screen/clock. Using personalized photos is a little clunky because you are forced to create an album using only Amazon photos instead of just uploading what's already on your phone's native photos app. That's actually a really big negative. Because of that, I don't have any personal photos on my Echo Show. If you don't follow what I'm saying, lemme give you an example: when you use Facebook, for instance, and you want to upload a photo, the app simply opens your phone's photos and you can randomly pick one or several photos to create your post. Here, you must download the heavy Amazon Photos app which just duplicates your already existing photo app. Then you must create a specific album of photos that you want to see on your Show. Then you must share it to the Show. I believe that changes to the album can only be done thru your phone with the exception of discontinuing use of that album all together and going back to the default Amazon screen saver photos, which you can do on the Show without your phone. But again, you cannot make changes and add or drop photos to the album you've shared without the Amazon Photos app on your phone. So here's the deeper issue. Since most Android phones are already bloated with endless and mostly useless Google apps, it really irks me that I must download another set of heavy apps to have Alexa simply turn off the lights or play some sleep sounds or to show simple photos of my family and friends on the Echo Show. I just don't like the fact that Google and Amazon can't get together on much of anything. Personally I prefer Google Photos over Amazon's but Alexa is hands down better than the Google Assistant and their related devices. If Amazon released their own phone, I'd buy it simply for ease of integration for my smart home devices and to avoid duplication that eats up valuable storage space. C'mon Amazon, forget the Samsung Galaxies of the world and introduce the Alexa Universe. Lol. My last complaint it that the Echo Show cannot surf the web like the Kindle Fire tablets or like any tablets, for that matter. Alexa decides what she chooses from the internet and from what sources. You can only choose in the settings whether you want her to use the Silk browser or the Firefox browser. But you cannot access the browser directly either by touchscreen or voice. For instance, let's say you want to know about the history of your hometown. You must ask Alexa to tell you about it. She almost always defaults to a Wikipedia article. You have no choice to open your towns own website or any other source. She does not even give you the option of links to open after her cursory relply because, again, you are not able to access a browser directly. So in a nutshell, I use this device now in my bathroom to see the news headlines, listen to music with lyrics displayed while I brush my teeth, and have Alexa turn the lights on and off in the bathroom. It really serves no profound purpose but admittedly looks kinda cool. I'm sure to keep the camera cover closed in the bathroom just in case there's some weirdo somewhere across the country who hacks Echo Show devices for his own show, if you know what I mean. I can see this being useful for someone who cooks and wants to see a recipe (that of course Alexa chooses) or for someone who may not like a smartphone to do visual calling with loved ones. And of course the sound is much better than the Dot or Spot. But really it serves no unique function that you phone cannot do sitting on a stand that costs $15 on Amazon. So I have it in my head to buy a couple Echo Plus devices and create a home stereo group on the Alexa App along with my Spot so I can have the visuals, still, but in a smaller package plus the nice, full sound in my bedroom. Ugh. What a rabbit hole I've fallen into with Amazon. Yet, once you turn everything over to Alexa, you can't go back. My fingers are crossed for my invitation for the Amazon Ring. Now that's a unique product that I can use and fills an untapped niche. Pick me Amazon! As if I need more Alexa devices. Haha.",It's Just OK. I Wanted To Love It. Read About Deal Breakers Here.

There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won’t have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That’s useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won’t play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn’t meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this. They really dropped the ball on what could have been a great device.",No Music While Using Web Browser

I know she’s “new”...but I shouldn’t have to keep finding different ways to ask the same question because she comes up with something entirely irrelevant. Mind you, I annunciate clearly. She thinks “80’s music” is saying “country music”...”ATEty (eighty)” sounds NOTHING like “cuntRY”. She regularly says she doesn’t know. It’s ridiculously frustrating. I shouldn’t have to argue with AI! I think they should have researched more instead of throwing a half completed AI bitch on the market. Also, Amazon is extremely CONTROLLING! The “TRY THIS” crap that scrolls at the bottom of the screen is annoying. Just as others have said. Time to do an update amazon and LET PEOPLE CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES if they want that! Make it an OPTION!! Also...Make better options for her name. I’m shocked that BEZO’S isn’t one of the options with how huge his ego is! The volume goes up n down when listening to music instead being steady. It’s feast or famine.

A clock, a timer, and an assistant to remind me about things! I began by browsing for the first two, as the last one seemed an impossibility. I saw different timers, felt that ones with large displays would be preferable. For the clock, we needed one whose display adjusts with the lighting so it didn't bother you at night and gradually got brighter to help you wake up in the morning. I've always wanted to have Alexa, but it seemed like a luxury and something to look into down the line. This device showed up in my searches and when I considered the combined prices of my preferences for the clock and timer, this was looking a lot more affordable. Plus, it met or surpassed the features I was looking for. Anytime I need to be reminded about something, I just ask Alexa. Seems to allow unlimited alarms and reminders. Still trying to learn all of the features and display options. Love the sleep sounds, better alternative to the dark screen videos we were playing at night. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and haven't even scratched the surface of what it can do.",like having an assistant

It took approximately 75 minutes for the agent to tell me to do everything I told him I had already done.  In the end, it was decided that the product was defective and I should exchange it for a new one. The new one came to the wrong address (home, where nobody is during the day, vs. work, which I'd requested), and was Refurbished, in a plain black box instead of the one the Echo Show should come in, with even the Refurbished sticker sliced open, and missing the power cord. When I called to complain and request a THIRD item, I was told that I'm only allowed to exchange an item once.  They would instead reimburse me for the second item, and I could go back in and order another item if I wanted to. This is a gigantic pain in the ass.",Beware if you return
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Dec 2019,Jeremy Helling,"If, like me, you thought the Echo Show 5 was fine (minus one glaring issue I'll get into later) but simply wanted a larger display to be able to see the time and temp across the room easier and thought that the Echo Show 8 would be exactly that... save your money. For some unknown reason the developers at Amazon decided that the clock & temp display on the Echo Show 8 should only be able to take up a very small portion of the upper left-hand corner of the display.  This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display. WuT?! Exactly.  Who at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to add code to limit the max size of the clock and temp on a device that costs more than the smaller version?  My eyes aren't even that bad but I can see how others with worse vision or possibly older people might prefer the larger display to be able to see the clock & temp better.  Bamboozled! In addition, the constant need to ""advertise"" to paying customers that's present on the Echo Show 5 also carries over on the more expensive Echo Show 8, sadly.  No matter what you do you can't fully disable everything that rotates on the home screen.  This means that you can't disable all of that garbage and just have the home screen be a clock and the temperature 24/7/365.  Even if you disable every option as well as the ""Rotate Continuously"" at the bottom you will still have your precious clock & temp minimize on a regular and constant basis while the stupid thing gives you ""pro tips"" of crap you can try saying. Amazon, how 'bout you give the users the option to FULLY and COMPLETELY disable this?! Enough people have complained about this and yet you persist on treating us like children.  Children with money to spend, mind you, but children nonetheless.  I don't need the hand holding that you seem to think we need.  I'm not huddled in a dark corner of my room shaking nervously frightened because I don't know how to ask Alexa to turn on a light.  You want to give new users a tutorial when they first set it up?  Fine.  This constant nagging that can't be disabled though is way, way, WAY too much. Enough people have hammered the reviews over exactly this on both devices and yet the solution has been ""coming soon"" for months.  This isn't a difficult change to implement if you really wanted to. I'm returning this Echo Show 8 due to these two reasons.  Awesome device (probably) if you can look past these issues I'm guessing.  I've already invested too much on three Echo Show 5's that I can't return so I'm not investing even more in an Echo Show 8 since it does the same BS only worse as those. If only Amazon was quicker to move on the simple requests of massive swaths of it's customers for one of their own products.  Maybe I'll go see what Google is offering in this same space now....",I bought the Echo Show 8 thinking it would be a larger Echo Show 5... nope.

There is no Home and Clock, the 8 has a wallpaper and clock and right below that is the home content where you find discovery, and you can turn it off until you turn blue in the face, it will not cancel the Try Alexa.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2019,J. D. Hyde,"First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show. It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go. UPDATE: This thing is going back. I've tried what I would think should be simple tasks, it fails. I tried to setup an album in Prime photos for changing backgrounds. It's been on the same photo for several hours although the album has 209 photos in it. I say Play a Slideshow of that album or any album. It shows 4 or 5 pics and goes back to the home screen. Also, it appears there's no way to shuffle the albums - why not? Fire TVs allow the slideshows to shuffle. I tried to see my security cams using the Monocle skill. I can now call them up with Alexa on my Fire TVs, but not the Show. I looked further into the Allrecipes skill - it's the worst. As someone said it's better to have Alexa find recipes on the web. I have many Alexa enabled devices, but this by the far the most useless. Most of the positive reviews seem to be impressed with the things that need no screen - play music, control devices and lights. The screen has little to no functional use. Perhaps if this had been my first Alexa I would be more impressed. The show will have to go.","Not Good, but the ""Suggestions "" Are a Non-issue"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Dec 2019,J. Stines,"12/9/19 I ordered the Show 8 based on reviews that said the ""Things to Try"" chryon could be disabled via the settings menu. As it turns out, that was incorrect information as has now been confirmed by Amazon customer support, as well as my own personal experience. I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior. Similar to an unsubscribe or opt-out of email setting, Amazon could offer a frequency option  (turn off, once a month, weekly, daily, hourly, on continuously). This one behavior truly ruins an otherwise good experience. If this is corrected, this device would earn 4-5 stars no question. Pros: Good sound, bright display, nice form factor, looks nice on the kitchen counter where I have it placed. Nice to have lyrics display while music is playing, local content is appreciated, good microphones, and I like the ability to see my cameras in the screen and the ability to view my home automation control (browser), physical camera shutter for privacy. Cons: Inability to turn off ""Things to Try"" is annoying, the optional stand should be less expensive, it could use more user options for what is displayed and how, and with Amazon having their own Silk browser, we should be able to at a minimum use voice to launch the browser with a saved bookmark. (e.g. ""Alexa, open bookmark My Favorite Website in Silk""  or better yet a routine that can open websites, so we could use natural language of our choosing, ""Alexa, show me XYZ."" .  Eventually, it would be nice to have natural language voice and/or gesture controlled browsing. Personal preference, I wish the closed shutter was more subtle (e.g. dark red or gray dot VS white on the black Echo show)","As of 12/9/19, Reviews stating Things to Try can be removed are WRONG!"

Maybe I just haven't figured out how to adjust that setting but it seems to me if I have live view on the Blink Mini that neither of our outdoor cameras are able to be viewed at the same time from another device. I changed all the settings so it would pop up as live view if our daughter stood up or moved but did not get an alert until I actually went in the next morning to get her out of bed even though she was already standing and moving around.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 May 2020,Scott W,"I decided to switch away from Google since they obviously have their own perception of reality with security and ownership of your data (not to mention their tilted view of the truth). So all my google devices went in the closet and I got all new Alexa stuff, ranging from multiple displays, Echo devices, door locks, therms, etc. Sadly, this is not at the Google level of automation. Amazon's choice in the way they add in skills is about as bad as I've seen. It's like modded Minecraft back in the alpha days. I can understand the desire to throw off development of their ecosystem to other developers - it's a lot of work to interface with stuff. Unfortunately, you get what you'd expect from every place out there trying to figure out how to interface up - a big mess. I'll use my Roomba vacuum as an example.  It's almost useless to think there's any integration happening. Around 70% of the time, it does not work. For example, Roomba like to come on and work right when I'm eating lunch, so you'd think I could just shout out to Alexa to pause the vacuum job. Well, that's wishful thinking. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't understand what Roomba is. Same goes for my Samsung TV and some other devices. And then there's the mystery voice recognition. For the life of me, I can't figure out why Alexa thinks I'm saying the wake word. I could say something like ""My dog needs to eat."" and Alexa beeps and wakes up. It's like it needs to be sure to listen in on every possible word. Since their developers are so junior apparently, we only get a small handful of wake up words. It must be really complicated to be able to interpret everything I'm saying once the device is listening compared to just setting my own wake up word. I'd set it to ""Hey Google"" if I could because that apparently didn't trigger near as many false times. So, if you want to play around some some Alexa stuff, it's ok. It's not where I'd hoped it was. I'm not as worried [yet] about Amazon using all my data as I am with google, so it's a rock and a hard spot deciding who you can trust.

We bought this Alexa Show 8 to keep in touch with mom during the COVID-19 quarantine. She has no cell phone and lives in an assisted living facility that we could not enter, so we were concerned about setup. We had it shipped to us and set it up with my phone on our home internet. Amazon has special Alexa-trained tech staff to help with any setup difficulties. The learning curve was pretty steep, and online tutorials weren't always  helpful, so I had to call multiple times. Each time support was friendly, courteous, and really helpful. It took a week of playing around, but when we were done, I had the device set up on a new Amazon account with no credit card, so I could give the password to staff who would set up the device. We were able to block my contacts from showing up on the device (which is somewhat public and handled by staff), and family members all had drop-in permission granted on the device. Staff only had to set it up on their internet and re-enter the Amazon account. We had them set it in a place where private areas of her room (bathroom) are not visible to the device. Now we can drop in on mom and she can see and hear us well. She doesn't need to do a thing to answer. If we are concerned about privacy we call her phone first to make sure she would like a video visit. Mom was depressed and confused about not getting visits, and has not been able to use her phone well or hear it well. The Alexa speaker is loud and clear, and works really well.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Gd-BH,"Having used an echo 5 for about 6 months, I was waiting for Black Friday pricing so I could ""upgrade"" to an echo 8, and replace my clock radio and dot on the night stand with the echo 5, and use the echo 8 in the living room with the larger screen.  Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.  That proves to be a mistake. On the positive side, the screen is nice, the sound is better than the echo 5, and build quality appears good. On the negative side, the echo 5's interface and feature set is more desirable to me. I dislike that unless I upload a picture, the backgrounds on the echo 8 will rotate through a set of them. I want one background, and for it to stay that way. I also don't like the tiny clock in the upper corner. I was expecting at least an option to have a large clock in the center like the echo 5 has (old eyes). And I agree the rotating 'try this"" on the bottom of the screen is extremely annoying, and should at least be an option to turn off. It does interact with my smart home devices as the echo 5 did, so it will at least function for the primary purpose it serves for me. While I would give the echo 5 a 4 star review, I give the echo 8 a 3 star rating because it's just ""meh"", when I really should be gushing about how it's like the echo 5 on steroids, and not a poorly implemented, sort of, almost, copy of it with a bigger screen.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2019,Ernie Beckley,"IMHO, the Echo Show 5 (FIVE) is the best all-around Echo device you can buy. It is my bedside alarm clock, and so much more. Amazon hit it out of the park with the FIVE, and I couldn't be happier. But this review isn't about the FIVE. It's about the Echo Show 8 (EIGHT), and in this case, Amazon clearly struck out. The EIGHT should have been a larger version of the FIVE. Doing so would have made up for the one area where the FIVE is somewhat lacking--sound quality. But no, Amazon decided to go off in a different direction with the EIGHT, and in doing so, made a mess of what could have been an amazing device. Is the EIGHT a good clock? No. Most of the time, the clock is shoved into the upper left-hand corner of the screen, using about 10% of the available screen space. You absolutely cannot read the time unless you are less than two feet away from the device. When the device is in night mode, the clock is shoved into the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and is about twice as large, which means you can be about four feet from the device to read the time. As a clock, the EIGHT is a complete failure. Does the EIGHT play videos? Yes; however, I have a TV, a laptop, and an iPad. If I want to watch a video, I'm going to use one of those devices. Does the EIGHT play music? Yes, and the sound is almost as good the original Echo (almost), which I still have and still use. It displays track information while playing. In some cases, it also displays lyrics. If that's important to you, it's a plus. You can also connect this to external speakers through a patch cord or Bluetooth, but if you do that, the value of the EIGHT is diminished. Is the EIGHT a digital frame? Well, it could be. It tries to be. The picture is beautiful, to be sure. It's nice to see rolling images, either stock or your own, in beautiful high-resolution color. Unfortunately, the view is interrupted by the clock in the upper right-hand corner (not a big deal) and the ever-present ""try this"" at the bottom. BTW, are digital frames even a thing anymore? I read the reviews before purchasing this, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was stupid cheap, and I couldn't pass it up at the holiday deal price, so what the heck. All things considered, the EIGHT could be great...it just isn't. Amazon blew it. It is my least favorite device and, quite frankly, not worth the price, even on sale. I'm not going to return it for two reasons. First, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, so I can't say I'm disappointed. My expectations were already low. Second, Amazon has a way if improving their devices, and the EIGHT is still relatively new in the line-up. I have expectations that Amazon will hear consumer feedback and make changes to the EIGHT that make it more like the FIVE, which is what it should have been in the first place. If you haven't purchased an EIGHT yet, don't. Get the FIVE instead. You will be far happier, especially if you want the device as a clock.",Buy the Echo Show 5 Instead
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2019,Adrian Watson,"I bought this device to use as a way to upgrade one of my seven Echo Dots to see my Ring camera and to use as an electronic picture frame.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of photos streamed from my Amazon Prime Photos account to this device.  They are washed out and have a slight green cast.  There are no controls that allow me to improve the quality of the photos as they appear on the Show's screen.  While the quality of whats displayed is very disappointing, even more annoying is the fact that there is a text line toward the bottom of the screen announcing things for you to try on your Alexa device.  I feel like I've purchased an on going commercial for Alexa.  There is not a setting to turn this text line off and when I called the Amazon Show help line they did not have an answer for either of these issues.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2019,BWV.1049,"Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review: Pro's: --Easy to set up, especially if you already have other Alexa devices. --Good sound for such a small device. --Functions just as well as my other Echo devices. Except -- this is a *video* device, and that's where it falls short. --Price and Delivery: I got this on the Black Friday sale (actually on Thanksgiving Day itself) for $50 off. Delivery was projected for Monday, but it was delivered in two days. Can't complain about any of that -- but, given the Con's I'm about to list, I wouldn't pay full price for it. Con's: --The clock. You can't alter the font or format. You can't opt for a full-screen clock. I realize for some people this is not an issue, but I'm nearsighted and wear glasses with progressive lenses. At the bottom and middle of my lenses (reading- and mid-distance) the clock numerals are out-of-focus from across the room. I wish you could set up a home screen with a large-numeral clock, but you can't. --Kitchen use, i.e., for me, mainly the timer. The countdown numerals appear when you start the timer, but then disappear as the screen rotates through its content. It would be nice to just look at the screen and see how much time is left, but you have to ask Alexa the question (just as I had to do with my Dot). --The ""Try this and that ..."" text across the bottom of the screen. You can't get rid of it. Yes, I read one review (which, at the moment Amazon is featuring as its ""Most Helpful""). This review says you can go into various sub-menus of Settings, and make it go away. I tried those suggestions. They don't work. So, I'd say, be warned, especially when the Show 8 goes back to full price. The Show 8 needs a software update that allows changes to the clock, the ""Try this..."" messages, and other functions.  It saves space on my kitchen counter, compared to my former Dot-plus-external speaker, but its potential advantages as a video device are either not realized or else compromised.",Video functionality doesn't measure up

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2019,JBDragon,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there. So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.  I also included a short Video where you can see them side by side with the light on in the room and then what happens when I turn the light off. I do like the 8"" Echo Show better.  The biggest issue I have is the size of the TIME.  Look at this side by side.  They are the SAME SIZE!!!  Look at all that wasted screen space.  I got the 8 so I'd have a larger clock.  But in a bright room, look at the SMALL time in the top left corner.  Look at the picture in the dark. The clocks are the same size, but the 5"" one is in the middle of the screen, and the 8"" once is up on the top left.  Looks at that black screen and a huge amount of wasted space!!!!  Why is this?  It's almost made getting the 8"" screen pointless. The other thing is the line on the bottom where it shows you things you can ask Alexa.  There seems to be no way to turn it off.  I've turned pretty much everything OFF and yet it's still there.  If you were using this 8"" as a picture frame, which you can do and have it cycle through pictures, great, then maybe a small clock on the screen is a good thing?  But with an all-black screen, what is the point then? I like that you can easily block the camera on both the 5 and 8 as you can see in the picture the camera is blocked and I have ZERo plans to ever use those.  Both can hear me just fine.  I can tell it when to set an alarm and it does it easy enough.  In the morning I can just say ""Alexa Snooze"" and it'll snooze for 10 minutes.  It hears me just fine.  It can play my Apple Music.  I do have a couple of Apple Homepods that sound better.  I could use them as an alarm, etc.  But I wanted a screen I could just peek at.  Apple has no other options.  I'm not using my iPad as an Alarm clock. Amazon needs to update this 8"" version to better work with this larger screen. Or at least have an option to have a larger clock on the screen.  Also at first when its night mode, the screen had this black background glow I didn't like where the 5"" version didn't.  Luckily I was able to adjust the brightness down just a bit which cured that issue.  Now I have a completely black screen except for the time.  The time is also not very bright.  It's not lighting up my room which is a good thing.",It's pretty good but there are some things I'm not a fan of.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,Joyce,"This is a terrific device except for one flaw that ruins it:  A message displays at the bottom of the screen ""Try Alexa ....."" giving instructions on different ways to use the device.  For example, this message is displaying on my Show right this moment:  ""Try Alexa, show movies with Emma Watson"". There is NO WAY to turn off the constant display of these messages.  When Googling about this, I see hundreds of customers have already complained to Amazon about this problem. But Amazon refuses to give customers a way to remove this instrusive screen display.  Apparently Amazon thinks its customers are all 10-years old and need a constant on-screen display of instructions. This ""Try Alex ...."" is also a form of advertising, albeit advertising of Amazon's products. Until Amazon removes this display (or gives customers the choice of removing it), I strongly suggest buying a different company's product.  Google sells similar products.  So does Apple.  Neither company treats its customers with such contempt. UPDATE:  After submitting this review, I found a solution.  I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around the bottom of the screen, positioned to hide the ""Alexa try ..."" messages, but not hide anything else.  The result looks great.  Those annoying messages no longer ruin the photos (or anything else) on my screen.  The only downside to this solution is it makes the screen slightly smaller.  But it's better to have a smaller screen that looks decent than to have a larger screen completely ruined by those messages.  I still recommend buying a different company's product.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2019,Ronald Epstein,"Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience. My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably. Since then, Amazon has introduced a massive 10"" model, a smaller 5"" model and now this 8"" model. I have bought all of them. My absolute favorite is the 10"" model.  If you have RING cameras in your home or you want to use this as a photo frame that will continuously show your photos linked to your Amazon Photo account, this is the only model you should be considering.  Yes, it costs more, but the extra real-estate makes a big difference. I bought the 5"" model to use as a bedside clock.  However, it was too small.  I went with this 8"" model to use as a bedside clock, though despite user recommendations on how to make it work, it doesn't operate as a full-sized clock.  The digits are minimalized to one of the corners of the screen. I am now looking at the Lenovo clock as that 5"" made specifically as a bedside smart clock display. But getting back to the 8"" Echo Show... It's a terrific unit with a beautiful screen and it absolutely is a compromise between the smaller and larger models. The problem is, it still operates the same as it did back in 2017.  There doesn't seem to be any software revisions that make the Echo Show a better user experience. For instance, no matter what you turn off, the display is always showing a rotating list of things to try.  It may be helpful at first, but it's annoying after a while. Want a news feed displayed to your screen?  You really can't personalize the kind of news that you want.  In essence, this is the heart of the problem concerning the Amazon Echo Show experience.  You can't personalize this device to display the kind of content YOU want.  All the content is generalized.  You can't make this device show you any more personalized content than your next-door neighbor can.  It conveys generic news content at its best. You would think that after all these years, Amazon would have learned to make this a device that really works for you.  While you can go into the app and make traffic reports more personalized according to your work address, you really can't do anything more tailored to your needs.  Want specific news feeds or even your personal stock results updated on the screen?  You are completely out of luck. I have the Google Nest hubs as well.  I do like the Amazon ecosystem better, though there are some things that Google does better.  You can carry on a conversation with the Google Hubs.  You can't with Amazon.  You can use the hub with Nest cameras doorbells.  I can't do that with Amazon.  On the other hand, you can't view Ring cameras or doorbells on Google.  This fierce competition only serves to hurt the end-user who is forced to buy into both platforms to use all these devices. Where Amazon Echo and all its related devices clearly win is with the number of plug-ins available for it.  There are many really cool skills that you can add through the app to make Echo even more amazing. I really like the 8"" but overly disappointed that it's not designed as a bedside clock no matter what settings have already been suggested to use.  If I were new to these Echo devices and deciding upon the very first one I would want to purchase, I would go for the 10"" model -- especially if using cameras or showing off photos.",A review from someone who has owned every Echo Show device...

There is one thing I wish they would do differently. On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me. For example on the echo show five there is an attractive nature scene with a lot of greenery and I would love to be able to put that same picture on the echo eight, but it’s unavailable. Additionally, we need a full screen clock option. Having a huge screen and relegating the clock to a small corner is not going to work for many of us. Other than these missing options it’s a winner, and I hope they will change the software soon to be able to allow for better clock face and display choices","Almost perfect, but needs a couple of small tweaks"

I like being able to see my Ring cam, listen to radio stations, Alexa even plays games.. so far my favorite is guessing the song..I tried 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. You can play with another so as well.  It’s like having a tablet without running on battery and a great loud speaker already attached. Only thing she can’t do is make me a ham sandwich lol.",The best echo device!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Mark,"The main complaint is the apps just don't work. Hulu TV gives an error message. I signed up for Food Network TV so that I could use one of the Show 8's in the kitchen, but it has no ability to do any of the live shows. It's sorta like Samsung and Apple TV's Food Network app, just some old recorded shows. Overall, it's just a larger screen that has Alexa and tells time, weather, etc. Touchscreen doesn't seem to work as well as the Show 5. I wonder if the largest Show has a glass screen. That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5. UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short. They do not explain why they refuse items or lower your value. Do NOT use the Trade-in program. Oh and the other issue with the Show 8 is it is very slow compared to the 5.",Software isn't ready for prime time

There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off the annoying feature that displays the constantly changing phrases that begin with ""Try, Alexa ..."" 2. I primarily bought this device to use with my Arlo cameras. Unfortunately, the Arlo skill is terrible. Most of the time, the cameras simply time out and will not display on the screen.

I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn’t keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn’t bother me at all. I also really like the “good morning” routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It’s simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door. Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the “try this” feature. The answer is NO, you can’t. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant “try this” on the screen. It’s ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 “cards” so it never runs out. The software must’ve changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren’t accurate for what is currently possible. If you don’t care about that/wouldn’t bother you, then choose the unit that dominates your home or the website you use the most. So which is better? Meh, they’re about the same IMO. My sons and I usually have them compete with each other to see which one can answer a question accurately or with the best info. Lately there’s no clear winner on that, but Google is usually easier to understand. The Show does NOT go completely dark at night so I could never have it on my nightstand and the clock is never full screen so that’s annoying too. I have added a seasonal photo image on my amazon photo account using a computer so it’s decorative in the living room. I’m going to be installing a video doorbell myself soon and some interior cameras so I’ll update my review when those gadgets are added to compare use. Reviews I’ve read online say both units will work fine on both the doorbell and cameras so I’ll to do the installation to judge it.",Show vs Nest - I now have both

Since I watch Netflix on Fire TV stick, I assumed I can watch it here. Wrong assumption!! 2) the clock display can not be customized. The time is shown in the left bottom quadrant. Very strange design decision 3) No much customization of the user interface is allowed. 4) Youtube can be watched (thank's god!), but only in the browser 5) Annoying ""try alexa.."" add scrolling through my screen. Summarizing: This is not a tablet. You can not run apps on it. It is not a secret that Amazon ecosystem is weak. It is not even close to Apple's and Google's ones.  I liked the fact that Amazon allowed side loading apps onto their fire phone and fire tablet. Nothing like this here. You only deal with what Amazon allows you to deal with. Somehow, it reminds me about the failure of the Windows RT paradigm. Greed is what drives this world.

Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me: 1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by?? 2) The stand is REALLY not worth 20+ dollars.  I purchased as part of the bundle and still feel ripped off.  It doesn't swivel left and right, only goes up and down in a very uncomfortable way.  Honestly, the fact that it's a $20 piece of plastic that you absolutely need for this device to be visible is insane and Amazon is better than this. I will add more notes when I get a chance to review the functionality in more depth, on the surface it seems OK.  Same capabilities as all other Alexa devices + a screen to see stuff on.  Speakers are acceptable, screen quality is also acceptable.",Couple things really bug me..

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Apr 2020,Goodnerd,"If you bought this hoping that Amazon finally listened to the tens of thousands of complaints about the annoying message of ""things to try"" randomly showing up - then do not buy this. I decided to buy this as a replacement for my Echo Spot as I went through several f those through the past couple of years because they all developed the video jittering and jumping issue - which was a chronic issue with the Spots. I was not keen on the 8"" screen because I have this device sitting on my desk where I sit 8-12 hours a day.  But I decided to buy this anyway because of the 1080 feature.  I have my Alexa network hooked to several cloud camera.  I am well aware of the annoying ""things to try"" issue. Upon unpacking this device I had to do an upgrade to the latest software version.  Note; TURNING OFF DISCOVERY DOES NOT FIX THIS ISSUE.  I had to turn off everything - weather, notifications, alerts, dropins - every option for this device had to be turned off and the ""things to try"" still randomly pops up.  At least with the old Spot I was able to set the device to constant night mode to stop the annoying ads for what Alexa can do.  Amazon:  I really have zero desire to have you remind me that you know ninja jokes.  Really??? Some of us are older than 12. Another fault is there is no way to change the clock design or face as we were able to do on the Echo Spots.  There is only one option and that is a small digital clock in the upper left corner which uses maybe 10% of the screen.  I you have this device set up to display anything such as local weather or alerts you will also be notified with the horrible things to try headache.  Whomever decided this was a forced feature should be fired. The only way to get this to not constantly distract you with their annoying messages letting you know useless tidbits is to place a piece of thick electrical tape over the bottom 1"" of the screen.","Eight generations and Alexa still constantly displays ""Things To Try"""

I was in desperate need of replacing my alarm clock on my nightstand, so I decided to go with the Echo 8 over the Echo 5. I purchased an Echo 5 as well, which will replace my Echo dot in my kitchen where I have less space, but this is about the Echo 8. I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality for starters. This Alexa packs exceptional sound quality into it's small design. I have a subscription to Sirius XM which I have synced to play through Alexa and I am extremely impressed with the balance of the bass and treble. The screen resolution is very nice for the photo displays. You can sync an assortment of photos through the Amazon Photo app or select a category for the Echo 8 to display for you. I have not tried to watch a video yet, but with the 8"" screen it would be very easy to enjoy and much more enjoyable than trying to view on your mobile device.  The Echo 8 is actually small enough to use on a nightstand and it has a night mode which will only show the clock on a dark screen. If you have a large room like I do, I would highly recommend the Echo 8. When I turned the volume up all the way it literally made me jump while I was sitting on my bed. This is one beefy little box, that is quite amazing. It's also very easy to sync all smart plugs, lights and devices to this groovy new Alexa. I cannot recommend this highly enough!",AMAZING!!!

""Alexa tell me where i can get a pizza"" really? Just stop, its visual pollution. You can not turn the damn things off. Total intentional bad design. Theres a reddit called a___ole design and the alexa team should get a gold statue from them. And the other thing is that alexa seems to wax and wain in terms of her comprehension , she was really ""getting it "" and understanding most things I asked for in dec 2019 and then mid month I think they did an update and she got... well I'm sorry it's not a mean word because I'm using it in the proper use... she got retarded. She was smart and then she retarded. I always ask for the same shows or podcasts and she usually got em but after that update I'd be like ""alexa play meet the press"" and she's be like ""I have a skill you might like called ice cream funland, would you like to try it?"" Its totally infuriating, any slightly muffled or misspoken syllable and you get a skill recomendation. Of course its impossible to turn the skill recomendations off. Overall the whole product family could be amazing but amazon is clearly forcing them to be way crapper then they need to be. The idea that you can customize everything, you can make a voice operated birdbath and call your grandmother with a word, but you can't turn off the simplest and most annoying aspects of the device, it's not an accident.

I love the the built in Alexa.  Although, sometimes she responds to an unknown question.  Note: speak at a speed fast enough for Alexa to understand.  Any hestitation will cause Alexa to disregard your question.  Another note... You can call different devices by 5 different preselected names (Alexa, Echo, computer, and others). I really enjoy using this device in my bathroom as a tv and or video player.  When you play music from Prime Music the lyrics are displayed on the screen.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2020,Jay Coventry,"Couldn't wait for my Echo Show 8 to arrive, and as almost always, Amazon delivery under-promised and over-delivered. I received mine 4 days earlier than expected! Setup took literally a few minutes.  The Echo does everything I ask and expect it to do. The audio quality is great! You go online via Amazon Silk browser or Firefox.  You choose whenever you need to go online. As far as those saying there is advertising on the screen, there is none, unless you consider friendly, short tips as to what you can do with the show to be advertising, which is plain stupid.  And while you can't eliminate the *occasional* tips that show up,you can go into the Settings by swiping down the screen, click the Settings gear, and turn the ""Discovery"" switch off.  This is not to be confused with the :discovery"" command where it searches for more items such as lights and appliances that it can control.  Then, turn Notifications off.  Below that, under Advanced Options, turn OFF ""Rotate Continuously.""  I have been using min for about 4 hours so far and only once in a while do I see a ""Try this"" tip. The Settings will revert to your home (default) page within a couple of minutes, or simply say, ""Alexa, home!,"" and it will go right to the home page, Others have complained about the size of the clock.  Its font is only about 3/4"" high, yet still readable.  However, here and there (I haven't timed it), the clock time and temperature will show up in a huge way.

I just bought 2 Show 8's thinking I was getting a bigger version of my Show 5 with maybe more enhancements AND I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I bought 1 Show 8 for work to replace my tiny Lenovo Google clock that has a bland clock face but it has large and readable clock numbers and gives you weather with condition backgrounds (rainy etc.) and NO try this, try that and the other thing.  The Echo Show 8 has a huge screen but tiny, unchangeable clock numbers, a small current temperature number and icon, none of which can be changed, and lame illustrated clock backgrounds unlike the nice Show 5 ones (you can put in your own photos via Amazon photos and/or use their nature or other photos).  If you play music or something else, the clock face totally disappears and you can't tell what time it is; e.g. if you are listening to music for a few hours, there's no clock face or overlay while the music is playing.  Also, if you are in any other function other than clock only, there is a non-stop Try This, Try That bar running along the bottom of the screen with no way to turn it off!  On the Show 5, at least you can set it so that it displays only once when you change the screen function and then it goes away.  The Show 8 does have a better screen type than the Show 5, it looks like the Show 5 has a TFT screen whereas the Show 8 appears to have an IPS or similar screen so you have better visibility off-axis.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,Cam-WA,"I was quite surprised to find this device to be mediocre.  Alexa is not as good at voice recognition as Siri, and Alexa seems to have less sophistication in recognizing slightly different ways of giving her commands.  For example, after a timer I’ve set has gone off, I have to say “Alexa, stop.”  If I say “Alexa, stop the timer” or “Alexa, stop timing,” she won’t understand what I’m trying to say. I was hoping to use the Echo Show 8 as a digital slide show of our grandchildren.  That’s easy to set up as a screensaver, but for any photo in portrait mode, rather than using monochromatic vertical left and right bars (say, black or grey), the vertical bars are a smorgasbord of colors taken from the image being displayed (it looks something like a washed out, faint version of the photo with a semi-transparent grey on top). But for me, the real deal killer is all of those (un)helpful “tips” that Alexa displays on the screen when it is in screensaver mode. It’s one thing to have those when one is using, say, a FireStick, because one doesn’t spend that much time on the screensaver, but with the Echo Show, it will be in screensaver mode most of the time. Not worth the cost, even when on sale.",Much less than I was hoping for
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2020,Purchase Person,"This HD 8 is our 2nd recently-purchased Echo Show, the other being a previously purchased Echo Show HD 5.  It replaced a standard Echo.  The sound and video are very good.  Setup was reasonably easy and Alexa integration is very good. However... It’s annoyingly quirky, starting with the settings, which are, oddly and confusingly, different than those on the HD 5.  The most annoying setting difference is the home screen “Wallpaper & Clock” selection; while you can choose different background “categories”, you can’t prevent them from rotating the multiple images (some being strange) within the chosen category, which becomes distracting eventually.  I had to change my background to “Minimal”, which is just a blank screen with a small time, weather icon, and outdoor temperature display in the upper left corner, also different than the HD 5. Another quirky/annoying thing that happens with our HD 8 is that streaming audio, from varying internet sources will just stop on its own, sometimes restarting on the HD 5 or just starting from the beginning on the HD 5, which is in the same room, but with a different wakeword.  This never happened with my Echo. The HD 8 does not recognize spoken requests/commands as well as the HD 5 or my Echo  I will try voice training to see if I can resolve this issue. Very disappointing. *** Update: Even using the ""Minimal"" background, or a single image uploaded via Alexa, the screen will blink at the same rate that other backgrounds rotate images, making me think that the HD 8 is rotating even these simple backgrounds, which can become very annoying, especially if the HD 8 is nearby, which in my case is a side table next to a chair I spend time in.  This additional discovery has caused me to reduce my rating from 2 stars to 1 and relocate the device to another room and bring back my Echo.  Had I know all this in advance, I never would have bought the thing, but now I'm stuck with it.",Annoyingly quirky

We previously had Echo Dots and had no issues with them but thought it would be nice to have the displays that the Echo Shows offer. However the Shows have been so frustrating we're about to throw them all in the garbage. About half the time when we use drop-in either the calling device or called device does not have audio. Also there are other audio issues that seem to randomly come and go. It's like Alexa suddenly goes mute. She'll display something on the screen (like the alarm when a timer expires) but there is no accompanying audio. We've ""reset"" them hundreds of times, upgraded the software to latest version and talked to support multiple times. We have a strong home network with no other issues and, in fact, changed ISPs (with different internet providers and home network hardware/software during the time that we've had the Shows. We've experienced the same issues with the Echo Show's on both the previous and current home networks. I've spent my career in IT so I'm not ""technically challenged"". No one at support admits that the Echo Show 8 has audio issues but from our experiences with the Echo Dots vs Echo Shows, I'm confident that they do. I've always been a big Amazon and Alexa fan but with the Echo Shows, I'm embarrassed that we gave such frustrating pieces of junk as gifts. And angry that we've spent so much money on devices that were supposed to give us convenience and safety instead give us nothing but a lot of frustration and wasted time.

It does have a bigger screen, however, the clock face is not as customizable as the 5.  Also, most of the time while on the home screen only shows the time, appearing to have no option to show the weather and date all the time such as the Show 5 does.

No Apps.  It is essentially an Echo Dot with a screen.  You do have to do some learning where to find things like your music and movie/tv playlists, internet, etc.  But honestly, when it comes down to it, all you have to do is tell Alexa what you want and she will assist.  It literally takes any type of typing needed away.  I wanted the internet and all I have to say is ""Alexa, open Silk"" and there is the internet that you all know with the search bar/address bar up top and when you want to look for something, hit the search bar and up comes a keyboard.  You just need to know what to say.  People have complained about the pop-ups that say ""Try this"" and ""Try that"", but honestly, I actually kind of like it.  Alexa has suggested many things that I would not have thought of and they are quite interesting.  Lastly, people have complained about how this MUST be PLUGGED in to power it.  That was a very big con for me, but I got around it by buying a battery pack (Skull Candy Fat Stash, about the size of a deck of cards $40) and BiXPower USB Port Power Cable with 4 Extra Popular Interchangeable Connector Tips.  The largest tip works with the Echo Show 8 and the cord is a couple of inches long, making portability very easy!!!  We are definitely using it more than we thought and it works great.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2020,Rami,"Clarification on some other reviewers’ comments: don’t confuse this with echo show 5–some reviewers suggest going to Home and Clock under settings to get a full clock showing and to remove Alexa skills rotation.  There is no such setting in echo 8.  Instead, it is wallpaper and clock.  And you don’t get to set a full clock face.  Just say Alexa show clock and she tells you, outright, “it is not supported on this device!” I am not sure if I would recommend echo show 8, given certain limitations I have seen, especially at the full price.  First, something that many other buyers have said:  lack of clock faces.  At night, I would hope for it to have a full clock face like echo show 5 does, but no.  All you see is a dim small digital clock.  Next, the annoying “echo does this echo does that” notices that rotate on the screen.  I have read suggestions in many forums on how to stop this, but no luck so far.  YouTube videos seem to be a natural for the 8 inch screen.  But there is no native YouTube app.  Rather, you are directed to a somewhat primitive-looking YouTube site on a browser, and from there you proceed to watch videos—which of course look quite good.  That said, the sound is pretty good, the screen in pretty good, and it does all Alexa skills pretty good.  Personally, I would get an echo show 5 and a traditional echo speaker in place of echo show 8.  A bit more expensive, combined, but best of both worlds.  By the way, I like the echo ecosystem a lot—I have one type or another in every room, and now in my car too.",Some annoying shortcomings despite good sound and good screen
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Oct 2020,Kindle Customer,"We just bought our Echo Show 8 in mid Oct 2020. So, I'm not sure if the newer software/firmware is different  from the reviewers who said they could not turn down the things to try, or if they gave up trying to minimize the effect. When I turned off many of the notifications and cycle options in the Home settings,  the things to try only come up right after I ask Alexa to do something, and then go away. From settings, select Home Content. Then I turned OFF ALL options EXCEPT: Active Devices Communications Notifications Reminders Weather Alerts Weather Forecast Be sure to turn off the last entry - Rotate Continuously Yes, it would be nice to have a large clock centered on the Home screen and more options for weather, etc, but at the prime day price (and possibly the Black Friday to come,) the 50% off value is incredibly great! We currently have four Echos and now one show in our house. Being able to say ""Alexa Announce - I'm off to the store now,"" and have it send the announcement to all the Echos all over the house and shop, is a really handy option for us. I could also make a large centered clock by activating the magnification and touch options in the accessibility section of settings (see the youtube setup for this.) The enlarged clock will go away when you ask her to do something, but for those long periods where you are not asking her, the centered large clock seems to stay put. Be careful of the naysayers.

Searching the internet has shown even the Arlo cameras don't work reliably either.  The Amazon Alexa/Echo techs have stated that the problem in my case is with Blink since Blink is responsible for the Blink Skill app. The common denominator here is the Echo Show 8.  I am changing my rating to one star and would give zero if I could! Original review: After wasting much time and effort I discovered that the Blink XT2 and Blink Skill does not work reliably with Show 8 in either Best or Enhance resolution. A real bummer as the Saver resolution is not satisfactory for me. Integration with the Blink cameras is the main reason for purchasing the Show 8. When I ask Alexa to show me the camera I usually get the OK response, a short delay then camera sound but no video. Sometimes Alexa says OK then shortly announces ""Something must have gone wrong"". Blink reportedly has actually been aware of the problem for months and is promising a fix in the future but is not saying when. If it is taking so long to fix it must be a major flaw or it is a ""back burner"" project for them. I have not seen anything in either the Blink or Show documentation/advertising that lets customers know NOT to expect integration in anything but the ""Saver"" mode. Needless to say I am not a pleased customer. I would give the Show 8 only one star based on the problem with Blink but other features work well for the most part so far.",Not ready for prime time -STILL doesn't integrate well with Blink XT2 and other Cameras

The 25 dollar 2nd gen dot works tons better. Sure, there’s a big screen. The try it stuff on the bottom isn’t that bothersome to me. It’s the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it’s waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like “ok”, and I get no lights on. I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It’s like this device suffers from a case of the “stupids”. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I’m thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review. Purchase at your own risk. Odds are you don’t need it if you have a smart phone with the Alexa app on it. If you insist, I’d wait it out a bit til the developers get their crap together on the software side of this.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2020,Randall New,"Having already owned an Echo Dot for several years and being familiar with its eccentricities, the Echo Show 8 was purchased to be a monitor for my Ring Camera as well as all the features of Alexa.  If you're planning on acquiring one be sure to get the not included magnetic stand.  It's around $20 or so recommended for the Show device.  I don't know why Show did not include one with the device.  Otherwise the device sits on the counter with a slight backwards tilt, no adjustment.  The stand allows much greater movement and viewing angles. The sound from the speakers is excellent and I would have given it a 5 star rating instead of only 4.  Due to the design of the device the speakers are on the back, firing backwards.  Of course you can hear it from the front but not as good as if you stand behind it.  Actually the Dot had a better sound dispersal than the Show.  But I didn't buy it for audio entertainment.  As I'm moving about the house doing chores or such I simply tell Alexa to play Pandora radio.  Wonderful sound to be sure but...depends on how picky you are about such.  Otherwise it integrated immediately (pleasantly surprised!) so the Dot moved to my bedroom.  Though Dot cannot show me what the Ring camera sees it will alert me aloud that movement has been detected; my Fitbit does not.  Very good for waking me at night as something outside is moving about.  So I pick up my cell phone, open the Ring app and see what's up outside.  The Show will do just that:  Show you what your Ring (probably other camera brands as well, not sure) camera sees.  Just say ""Alexa show me the front door"" (or whatever location you designate) and it does.  I can also communicate through the Show device with the Ring camera.  Love it!  As for the rotating Alexa messages as many are complaining about, yes they are there.  Personally I'm not bothered in the least but I understand their gripe and agree there should be more flexibility in display setting.  There may be I just haven't been that concerned. NOTE:  For some reason Fitbit does not pair with Ring.  If my Ring camera alerts Alexa will tell me.  Fitbit does nothing.  Due to age and hearing loss I depend greatly on Fitbit notifying me of alerts.  It will alert me my phone is ringing, there is a text, etc.  Apparently this a Fitbit problem though they will not admit such.  Though there are workarounds out there I am not experienced enough to go changing and/or writing code.",It performs as advertised.

Smith,I have the show 5 which is a nice bedroom sized device or in my case under the TV in the den. I like it because the clock fills the display and its easy to see across the living room. I actually purchased the Show 8 for my bedroom. I was concerned the time only showing in the bottom corner would be a problem but its really not. Would I prefer the whole screen to show the time? Yes but the numerals are big enough to see over several feet without any issues even when I'm not wearing glasses. I bought the show 8 because I wanted better and fuller stereo sound and for the size this delivers nicely. I like that I can tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell camera when I'm in the bedroom! I'd say this is the most perfect Echo device I have overall. I also have the Sonos speakers with integrated alexa and they do not accept commands as well as the Amazon made echo devices.

Bought one for myself and it works so well that we bought another for my wife's 91 year old mother.  Unfortunately, it is 100% impossible to configure this thing for communications (i.e. making video calls) because 91 year old mom doesn't have a smartphone (how many over-90s do you know that DO have smartphones)?  When we ran into this problem, I configured Echo Show using my wife's smartphone.  Everything seemed to work OK until we discovered that all of Mom's calls appear to be coming from my wife (because we set it up using my wife's smartphone number).  Not only that, but our other relatives can't call Mom on her Echo Show because Amazon doesn't recognize that she has an Echo Show (again because it's not associated with her smartphone BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE)!  I called Amazon Customer Support.  She explained to me that Amazon must verify the phone number by sending a text message with a one-time-code.  I told her I understood this, and asked if it would be possible to instead call my mother-in-law on her non-smartphone and read her a one-time code that she could then relay to me (just like she would do if they COULD text her a code).  Armed with this magic code, I could then assign her non-smart phone number to her Echo Show and the problem would be solved - VOILA!  I realize that we would still have to use our smartphones to make any future configuration changes to Mom's device, but that's OK because she wouldn't do it even if she did have a smartphone.  Unfortunately, Amazon Customer Support says no-can-do the simple phone call solution - no explanation why.  Their suggestion was to buy mom a smartphone solely for this purpose.  So now you know: Product = 5 stars.  Customer Service = 0 star.

It understands me and responds better than my Echo, and I can hear music from the next room clearly with the Show.

As with so many Alexa so-called ""skills,"" the Skype integration is really lackluster. You can't share your screen or photographs. It's just a two-way ""video-phone.""

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2020,Michael,"I don't like writing negative reviews but here it is. There was no love that was put into creating this device= complete failure. It also makes it a shameful disgrace for how it should have been created, since this and other Alexa devices will be used for elderly parents and everyone's everyday life. I better explain a little: This Echo Show 8 (along with every Amazon Echo like Alexa device that I have) is all show and no substance. For instance the interface on this device is not like the majority of every electronic in the world with a touch screen that has a back button and easy navigation. So sadly and frustratingly it is like trying to learn just another language that someone created for whatever reason instead of thinking about making it enjoyable for people and easy to use for everyone. Also the apps that they put in there are permanent and the interface for Amazon Prime video is horrible as you cannot do a search for videos and you cannot choose which season you want to watch but whatever season of that show that they choose to give you. (Don't believe me? take a look at the time of this writing) The worst thing about it is that when you ask this device and other Alexa devices important questions, they just pick some random Source online and put no loving thought into why a person would ask that question (no thoughtful design). For instance if you ask Alexa how to perform CPR, it's probably because you may need to use it right away, or you may need to at least know how. But what did they do? They just selected some wikiHow article that somebody wrote that doesn't actually describe the process and it is long and lengthy with hardly any substance and definitely no direct answer to the question of how to perform CPR. Also the sound projects out the back. The only upside to this device is that you can video conference with someone but only if they have this device. In essence, Amazon seems to be just another money-making entity I'm sorry to have to say. If you want to see real love in action and real thoughtful and well-researched and free beneficial education then you will want to discover the website that's available to people all over the world No Matter what Color of skin you have or what your economic or social status.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Apr 2020,SS,"IO have had the Echo Show 2nd Gen and the Echo Show 5 for a while now but never tried the Drop feature until I bought 4 of these to use to monitor an XT2 outdoor camera system I also just bought. I will be returning them and if that's not possible, I will smash them.  They are useless as the video takes forever to focus and the audio is filled with the NOISE of FEEEEEEDBACK.  My internet speed for these devices is at 250 Mbps  so that's not the problem.  I have turned the volume down and still get NOISE, so that's not the problem.  They work fine for music but not as an intercom.  I have posted questions but while people try to help, so far nothing and I appreciate their trying. Amazon?  Have not heard anything from them.  I may try calling or chatting as this is a real let down and as I said, I will return or SMASH these as I am not happy at all.  I got mad enough at Alexa's inability to learn my freaking voice that I cancelled the music right away.  I retuned and it's acceptable but really?  Video drop in SUCKS. I don't give an intercourse if it plays a movie fine, I don't want to watcha  film on a 5"", 8"" or 10"" screen, I have a modest home theater setup for that! Amazon, a little genuine help would be appreciated.  Thank you! Well, other than a very polite person via CHAT, Amazon hasn't addressed the awful feedback on these units.  I have to turn them almost all the way DOWN just to hope against hope that stupid noise isn't so painful.  I am DISGUSTED.  I had hopes for these as monitors for the Blink cameras but even more as intercoms.  Because of a handicap, I fall down a bit and I had hoped I could use these to summon help with my home.  Nope. The audio via the Drop feature SUCKS.  SUCKS  big time.  I'd be better served by one of those LifeAlert things...""Help, I've fallen and can't giddyup!""

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2019,Anthoney Baker,"Ok, so like, a decade ago I was an early adopter of the Sony Dash, it was a small tabletop alarm clock that could show you facebook posts, play music, play Netflix, and a bunch of other stuff. The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing. Within minutes I had it connected to Prime Video, XM satellite radio, and all the other stuff. I highly recommend this as an addition to any room. I am blown away!",I am blown away at the quality!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Feb 2020,TIFFANY M YORK,"I was so excited to purchase this device during Black Friday 2019. I got an excellent deal on it and thought it a neat addition to my echo product collection. Today is 19 February 2020 a whole 3 months later and I couldn’t be more disappointed. I wanted to be able to pair my echo ear buds to it but after numerous failed attempts And me contacting amazon support about the issue it was never fixed even though I was told the customer support rep was personally looking into the issue and would provide me with follow up. I never got that issue resolved but no biggie I pressed on. Sure the sound quality is awesome,l although I can’t listen through earbuds, the functions are easy and screen is big enough to watch shows on when it works.....and that is the problem, it doesn’t seem to be working right anymore. A few nights ago I was watching a tv show on the device and literally 5 minutes in it cut off. I instantly thought it was my internet or something of that nature but checked internet and it was fine. It was time to get customer support on the line. They had me do a factory reset on the device and wala just like that it started working again. Awesome right? Wrong! I had the same issue the next day, day after that and day after that. Every night for almost a week I’ve had to do a factory reset on the device in order to watch more than 5 mins of tv show. It was time to get customer support back on the line. I spoke with the support who stated I’d need to send the device in to their support team to see if they could fix it and if they couldnt they’d replace. That’s all well and good but at 3 months old it shouldn’t be having any issues. Maybe they sent me a lemon? Who knows but what I do know is after only 3 months of use it should still be working just as good as the day I took it out of the box.",Must have been sold a lemon
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 May 2020,Munky King,"Really quite disappointed with this. I bought two units for Mother’s Day. One for my wife and one for her Mom who lives 8hrs drive away. The idea was I would set it up so that my wife and Mother in law could see each other, rather than just talk on the phone. I should point out that my Mother in law is not technically ‘with it’ and can’t even do text. She has an iPad that she can’t use and struggles using her cell phone for more than just calling. Trying to set this up, I quickly realized she needed an Amazon account so that the new unit could be registered to it. So I created one for her, using her existing (little used) email address. So I thought armed with her Internet address and password, email address and password, new Amazon account and password, I would be able to make this thing work. Nope. It needs to connect to an Alexa App on her phone. Which isn’t there and she wouldn’t have a clue, how to load or use anyway. Don’t worry I thought, I can just call her from mine. No way. The outgoing call can’t be just linked to the Amazon email address that it’s linked to. It also needs a phone number. I loaded a phone number into the Amazon account and it needs a text verification. Giving the Mother in law a call, she found her cell phone and is now in the process of charging it. I still don’t know if it’s going to work this way around or not either, so can’t say I’m particularly thrilled. The wife is annoyed with me for wasting such a chunk of money on this, and I’m frustrated after spending 3hrs of my time trying to get the damned thing to work. Wish I had just bought a potted plant from my son to his Mom now. Cheaper, less frustrating and more likely not to have me in the dog house. I’m sure this is great system under normal circumstances, but if you are buying this to communicate with a distant relative who is not technically adept, right now I wouldn’t bother. Yes it has the great ‘check in’ feature,that is ideal for an instance like this, but really someone should have thought this particular use of this system through better. It’s not as though you are trying to hack into something, if you are setting it up and giving it to them as a gift.","Don’t buy for a technologically challenged family member, unless you can be there to set it up"

According to the ad page on Amazon, it's ""Simple to set up and use! 1. Plug in 2. Connect to the internet using Echo Show 3. Just ask Alexa for music, weather, news and more"". What the description does NOT tell you is that a smart phone with Wifi/the Alexa app is required for setup as well. I have been relatively tech savvy with virtually every other device I've ever purchased - this is, by far, the least intuitive/user friendly. I set up an Amazon account using my grandmother's name and email, got her to verify the one-time password and confirm the account, then logged into Alexa using that account. I added myself, parents, and siblings to the contacts in the Alexa app, which for some stupid reason won't sync with the Echo Show despite being connected to her Alexa account. There appears to be no option to add contacts directly through the Echo Show itself without connecting/verifying a mobile phone number (which, again, why TF would you need an Echo Show if you already have a smart phone that supports video chatting). If you're buying this for a family member and they already own a smart phone, you might as well just go with the video chatting via Facebook messenger - at least that is free and easy to use. This was an absolute waste of time and money. Wish I could give zero stars!","False advertising - MUCH more complicated to set up, plus requires a smart phone AND Alexa to use"

Also, you can simply ask Alexa to turn on do not disturb. It changes the screen to a larger clock and removes the “Try Alexa”. I can still see my photos changing like a digital picture frame. I would imagine the next software update may give more options to toggle it off,  have more clock options, etc. As for the normal experience of having the Echo Show 8,  what a fun and useful tool that will take a long time to explore all of its uses.

Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,DaytonaDan,"If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras. The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker. But it's really not that much better. Marginally perhaps. Also, since it has a bigger screen and the same wedge form factor as the 5, the entire device is much much larger, which might not make it suitable in places where space is at a premium I wanted it mainly for the kitchen, for calling up recipes, which are easier to see, with less scrolling, than on the smaller Echo 5 screen. Mission accomplished there, although it is so large, it barely fits where I wanted to put. And was a bit disappointed at all the other downgrades. One upside it it seems to handle wakeup better than the 5. Not sure why but the 5 always seemed a bit hard of hearing.  Perhaps because I have so many other Alexa devices scattered about the house and they were all fighting for control. The whole ESP thing that is supposed to make the closest one respond didnt work very well with the 5. This one is very responsive unless there is a lot of ambient noise.",Bigger but not at lot  better...than the the Echo 5. Worse in some cases
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,KG,"I replaced the original ""Alexa"" we had in our living room with this echo show. At first I felt guilty removing Alexa, especially since she was one of the original beta tester echoes. But Alexa had been knocked off of the end table one too many times by the cats, leaving her top a bit crooked and wonky. Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet. This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent. Alexa responds quickly and I don't have to yell or repeat myself making my neighbors think a crazy lady lives here. I'm also happy I chose the 8 instead of the smaller 5. I enjoy the screen size, and along with a nice magnetic swivel stand I bought to go with it, it looks and fits great on the end table. It would also work great on the kitchen counter or anywhere else in the house. This echo works great with our security system, I just ask Alexa to ""show me -name of camera-"" and it's super easy to make calls and check your calendar and emails if you need to. Running smart home controls is also easy to do. Touch screen and voice control are both very responsive. I also love the slide lock button to block the camera when it's not in use, it kept me from having to place one more piece of black tape over a camera lens! The lighting also dims (can turn feature off in settings) as it gets darker so it doesn't light up the room at night. However you can still see the time dimly lit from across the room, I like this feature so I haven't checked to see if you can remove the time from showing when it's dark. I'm still getting to know what I can and cannot do with this echo show, but so far I'm loving it and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase.",Alexa is looking pretty!

Liked it enough that I decided to get two for a paired stereo setup, a function which Amazon claims you can do with this device.  Unfortunately, I found it just doesn't work. If it has for others, would love to hear about it. Spent hours on my own troubleshooting. Then tonight spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support. That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair. Since I have no idea if its a bug, or one or both units malfunctioning, I'll now have to return all of it, including 2 Dots that came with the Show 8's on a holiday sale/promotion. Very disappointing. Hope they work out the bugs and get it working as is promised. Seems like a device with a lot of potential, but for me it was just wasted time. EDIT:  After hours and hours of wasted troubleshooting an Amazon staff member got back to me on their device forum advising Amazon's info on their Compatible Echo Devices page was WRONG!  Wasted a ton of time, money, and now even more time for returns because of Amazon's misinformation about the stereo pairing for these!  Ask me how annoyed I am at this moment?? Nice of Amazon to apologize on their forum for my ""inconvenience"". Lot of good that does me!!!  P.S.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jun 2020,DLM,"Since having an Echo Dot, and enjoying it, we added to it by purchasing the Show.  I'm glad we opted for the smaller, less expensive 8"" model, since it doesn't seem to be quite worth the hype. The sound quality is horrible, very muffled, and since the speaker is on the back it is quite difficult to hear/understand.  And trying to activate it usually requires almost yelling (within a 3 foot distance), whereas the Dot can clearly hear and understand a spoken word from across a room. Using the same requests as the Dot will give the same results (tell me a joke, what's the weather, etc.), but we have yet to figure out how to get the Show to play anything (like videos or television programs, or movies).  When trying to find a menu, the voice commands are useless (like talking to a third-grader) and attempting to utilize the touch menu doesn't take you anywhere since it seems to be ""stuck"" at giving you only 2-3 options. Bottom line - It doesn't seem to have any more ""useful"" skills than the Dot, so...  at the moment, it's just a Dot with a screen that does nothing more than show pretty changing pictures.  <sigh>  Disappointing, but not worth trying to return it, as it may be user error.  MUCH better instructions would be extremely helpful! UPDATE:  Since posting my review, Amazon tech support reached out to me.  While performing various checks and tests of the Show, the tech support rep & I were discussing what I had hoped it would do and what it was capable of doing.  Rachel (the rep) was most helpful and completely honest with me - instead of attempting to talk me into keeping it, she made the correct call that I wasn't really impressed or happy with the capabilities and we agreed it would be best if I returned it.  She then made sure it was a smooth, easy return process, setting it up and sending me a return label via email.  I was VERY impressed that she didn't turn ""salesman"" on me and try to sell me something ""instead"" of the Show, instead simply giving me options based on what I had wanted this to do.  Overall, I would give Rachel & Amazon's tech support a solid ""10"".

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2020,A. N.,"This has been such a great addition to my home! I have four Echo Show devices now and I use them everyday. Mine are all set to display the time, date, and weather. My favorite part of the Echo Show devices are the screens because I can use them as digital photo frames. First I uploaded my photos to Amazon Photos. For pictures on my computer and various hard drives I used the website to upload them. For photos on my phone and tablet I used the Amazon Photos app to upload. I created an album called ""Screensaver"" and then set all my Echo Shows to display the album. (Settings -> Wallpaper & Clock -> Select Amazon Photos.) The Echo Shows all display different pictures from the selected album. I have never caught them displaying the same picture at the same time. It took time for me to create the album, but you can start slowly and add whenever you have time or whenever you have new photos. I have photos from years ago up to today in the album. It's so wonderful when the pictures pop up and being reminded of the moment. I often stop to look at the pictures and they always bring a smile to my face.... I have photos of my family, friends, all my pets, the dearly departed.... decades old memories as well as new and fresh memories. Pictures of my dogs when they were puppies, my children when they were tiny, special events, everyday moments.... so nostalgic and yes, very sentimental. This has been great for someone like me who has a poor memory. I have a hard time remembering yesterday! Random stuff and skill suggestions popping up on the home screen can be disabled. Go to Settings -> Home Content and deselect the skills you don't care for. I found that after software updates I would have to go back to deselect skills because new ones were added, such as Covid related skills. The only skill I have showing on mine right now is the weather. Another feature that I use everyday is the speaker groups. This allows me to play an audio on the group of speakers, all synced up perfectly, so that when I go room to room the audio is there (wherever there is a device). In the Amazon Alexa app, go to ""Devices"", tap the + icon on the top right corner, select ""Add Group"", name your group, then select the devices to add to the group. The devices have to all be on the same network for this to work. So if my group name is ""All Devices"", everyday I can say, ""Alexa, play NPR on All Devices"", or ""Alexa, play Spotify on All Devices"", or similar. You can also control the group volume by saying, ""Alexa, volume (down to 3) / (up to 6) / (mute) / (max) on All Devices"". Saying ""Alexa, stop"" will stop the audio on the whole group. I can also use the announcement feature. ""Alexa, make an announcement: 10 more minutes to get ready."" And Alexa will announce it to the other devices. If you have other people in your ""Amazon Household"" (other Amazon accounts linked to yours, not necessarily in the same household) who also have devices, they will be able to hear your announcements and they can also make announcements to your devices. So using this you could communicate short messages to another household, like a walkie talkie. There is also the Drop In feature which I haven't tried, but I read that it could be used to monitor another room, to check in on your home and pets, to chat with others, etc. One of the favorite skills that my children really enjoy is ""Amazon Storytime"". I use it as a reward and incentive. Sometimes they will tell jokes with Alexa (Alexa, knock knock.....), or ask Alexa questions (Alexa, where did dogs come from?). They also use the timer and alarm feature often. ""Alexa, set an alarm for 5:00pm."" ""Alexa, set a timer for 45 minutes."" Alexa can have multiple timers and alarms going at the same time. The Echo Show 8"" and 5"" devices have the camera cover, but the Echo Show 10"" does not. For my Echo Show 10"" I stuck a few layers of sticky note over the camera. Overall, I love having my Echo Shows. But I'm not made of money, so I have only ever purchased these during super sale events, like Prime Day. If I had to pay the original price, I'm not sure I'd even have one single device. Having said that, these would make great gifts if the receiver could utilize the various features. Update: you can watch Hulu on this by adding the skill to your Amazon Alexa account. This also has bluetooth.",I love having my Echo Shows. We use them often everyday.

The Google worked fine as long as I was sitting next to it but if I was on the other side of the room I had to shout at it for it to respond. That is not a problem with my Amazon device, I can use my normal speaking voice from anywhere in the room and it works perfectly. The sound is amazing. The speakers are probably 80% of the device so they are large they with a clear sound And offer a good amount of bass. It's really nice to just sit down and say “Alexa play Frank Sinatra.“ And it sounds just wonderful. Plus it works with Amazon prime video, I can watch movies on it, and they sound great because of the wonderful speakers. No problem integrating it with my smart switches and outlets. I come home, I say hello to it it, turns on the correct lights. In the morning when I tell it good morning it gives me the weather, tells me what time it is, reads the news, and lets me know what is  on my calendar for the day. It’s fabulous!",Love it!
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,Ursula,"This was my Christmas present to myself. I'm a HUGE Alexa girl. I love that while I'm cooking that it can help me with a recipe (THIS DEVICE IS A MUST HAVE IN THE KITCHEN). I also love that I can watch a movie while in the kitchen now. I wanted a small TV in the kitchen but all of them that I found I found were just too big. This fits right on top of my microwave. The sound and video quality are amazing! I'm 100% happy with mine. As far as the ""Alexa, try..."" issue that people are having I actually love! It gives me some great suggestions that I would of never thought of. It's not intrusive and it's barely even noticeable unless you are looking for it. The device comes with a ton of options too. This is my first Echo Show but I'm 100% happy with it.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jan 2020,Habernewton,"Let me first mention I have no clue why so many people are complaining about the recommendations that are provided when you aren't watching something on the echo or asking it to provide a function. Maybe it's changed, but I only see those when I'm not using the echo, at which point I tell the echo to turn on the display and it all goes away. Not something that should be complained about in my opinion. I love the echo for what I use it for. It's in my kitchen and I turn on prime video while I do my normal routine and while cooking. I feel it makes my kitchen time more enjoyable. I have yet to use the recipes features, but I've heard it's very convenient. It does everything I wanted it to do, so for me it's worth every penny. The sound quality is great for my space. The video quality is perfect for its size. It responds to my voice as expected. I really have nothing to complain about, therefore, it receives 5 stars from me.",Solid sound and video with Alexa features

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,umeweall,"My specific purpose for buying this item was for working with my XT2 camera system.  I was concerned about a number of things: (a) The 'things to try' crap supposedly showing constantly on the screen, and supposedly not being able to get rid of it, and complaints that the Show 8 would not work with the Blink XT2 camera system.  Well, you CAN't totally get rid of the 'things to try' blip, but you CAN greatly reduce it, to a degree of almost background noise, by reducing the rotation rate.  It then almost becomes a non-factor, which makes me EXTREMELY happy.  As for the connection to the Blink XT2 camera, you need to do a little bit of work.  You need to have established a Blink account, as instructed by the Blink XT2 camera instructions.  After you have created your Blink account, you then need to enable the 'Blink Smarthome' skill, for your echo Show 8.  When you have gone though the process of setting your camera system up, the skill on your echo Show 8 allows you to work with your XT2 camera, with no issues, via voice command, as you would expect. Now for another comment, about the camera itself, which has really nothing to do with the Echo Show 8, but just as an FYI.  I noted a lot of folks unhappy with the XT2, because it did not notify you immediately, when it detected omtion.  This was due to the fact that it notified AFTER it finished making a recording, NOT upon start of the recording, with detected motion.  Well, at the end of 2019, that item was addressed by Blink, as stated in the following message: ""We’re excited to announce our newest feature available for XT2 users, Early Notification, provided as a Beta preview release. This is currently only available in the US and Canada but we will be rolling this out to other regions soon. This article will be updated when that happens. When enabled, Early Notification configures the camera to send a message as soon as motion is detected, then the motion clip is recorded as usual and will appear in your list. When the Early Notification message appears in your app, you can tap it to join a live view of that camera and respond to events in real time. When disabled, notifications are sent when the motion clip finishes recording. To enable this feature, go to the camera settings screen and switch on the “Early Notification” toggle (shown in the image)."" I have this new/beta item enabled on my new camera. ************************************************************************************************************************************** UPDATE After successfully adding the first camera, of my three camera system, I proceeded today to set the two remaining cameras up.  I could not get the cameras to connect to the Blink app, and I spent a good 30 min. going nuts.  I then remembered something.  My Netgear Wireless Router and myself are very well acquainted with each other.  I routinely look at the logs, to see who is attempting to connect to my system, as I have the router email them to me.  I also used the feature 'Access Control' on the router to basically deny access to my system by any new system that wants to connect.  In this manner, I control who gets on my network.  Well, I had to turn this feature back to the 'allow all systems', to get the cameras permission to access my network.  Yep, I was happy, I had resolved the problem--NOPE!!  The cameras still would not connect!!  I think went into trouble-shooting mode, and plugged/unplugged the BLINK switch a couple of times--NO GO!!  I then noticed something in my router log, the following item was showing as being blocked:  F6B85E9992C5-MYSIMPLELINK  .  I looked that up on-line and found that it was tied into BLINK camera live initialization.  The 'F6B85E9992C5' contains the MAC address of the camera, which is stated on the camera, right under the serial number.  No, the MAC address that I am showing DOES NOT match my actual MAC address, I changed it, so as not to be stupid in a public showing.  I used the router software control to ALLOW access to the 'F6B85E9992C5-MYSIMPLELINK' item, which was the camera that I was trying to install.  The camera connected, both of them, and all was well.  Making this simplified, if you cannot get your camera to connect to the BLINK app, take a look at your router log ( if you have one ), and see if something is showing as being blocked, which matches the string that I previously mentioned.  It appears that the hexadecimal part of the front end of this string will change, to match the device, but the 'MYSIMPLELINK' stays the same, which you can always change the name, to match the location of the camera.  I left the hexadecimal front end alone, and just change the MYSIMPLELINK to match the location of my camera.  CHEERS!!",Good Device and Works With My XT2 Camera System

This is my favorite by far! Terrific sound from the speakers and the microphones are the best.

Yes, a lot of Alexa’s for a 1500 square foot apartment but I want to be heard as literally everything in the apartment works with Alexa including the TV. Did you know that using Alexa instead of getting up and turning on a light or when you are going to bed have everything go off, actually distresses you? It’s been proven that automation actually takes stress away from your life and who doesn’t need that in this country? Great picture also.

My dots and spots were no where as clear. I so love that I get all the fun and adventure I had with anything amazon invents and now I can see what I ask for. The coolest feature is that I can program all my own pictures for the screen savers. Now I get my grandkids photos waking me up and I can see years past daily photos. I can ask Alexa for a recipe see it on the screen and it stays there till I’m done. It doesn’t go away till I say I’m done. I can ask it anything and usually it understands me. I can yell at it and it agrees with me. Love that. I can check in from other locations and see what it sees. I can talk to other rooms from a different location. From work I can check in at home and talk to my pets. That is funny as heck. Except for the day my cat got mad and pushed it into the sink. Sorry I don’t post tech details but that is because I am like most people we don’t know how to or really care about how stuff works we just know what we like. Or we want to try cool products to see if they will fit into our lives. I can say Alexa fits into my home seamlessly it didn’t even ask for a prenup.,Newest Coolest Fun.

I can stand next to the Show 8 and say ""Echo"" and my Echo Dot from the next room (over 25' away will answer and this one will not.  There are often times I have to say ""Echo, Echo, Echo"" before it will finally go ""ding"" and listen to me.  I do like the screen and the added functions that offers but the mark was missed on this.  I have friends with this product that have the exact same experience as we do.  The sound is better than a DOT but only marginally.  Not anything close to the Echo Plus or the standard Echo.  There really is no comparison.  Hopefully it's a software issue that can be resolved and not poor mic placement.  Also, the only thing I don't like about the screen are the terribly annoying ""try this with Alexa"" messages.

It’s not bad at this, but I’ve had a hard time getting Alexa to search websites more broadly as Google does.

The  echo 8 kept cutting out especially when listening to news and music.  Instead of amazon replacing it with a new Echo Show 8,  I was sent a unit identified as refurbished.  How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear. The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn’t believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun. Except it hadn’t.  The next day it was as if nothing had been done.  The Echo 8 refused to respond to the off or stop command, making it necessary to disconnect the power. A day later I am still wondering what to.  Should I call tech support and go through another remedial effort which will probably fail or should I ask for a third unit, one which is new and not refurbished?

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2020,Mike in San Diego,"It's (almost) all good doing the things that an Echo or a Dot can do, but some re-thinking needs to be done on what the display displays and how you set it up.  Its as though the designers pictured it only being used on a desk and not as an alarm clock  or, perhaps sitting under a television or other tythings that people could have thought to do with it. But it would be nice if there were a way to get rid of the ""Suggestions"" that keep turning up on the lower part of the display. It wold also be 100% better if you could make it act like a regular ol' digital clock and only chnge screens when you ask it to do something.  Unlike the the Show 5, you can't change clock faces so you are stuck with the clock face that is too small to read from across a room.  There is a larger clock face that would be OK if you could keep it on the display instead of it changing to the small one periodically  no matter what settings you change. Virtually all settings must be one on the display itself.  It would be useful to be able to change the settings from the Alexa App.",It's (almost) all good...
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,@Estuar1,"Ok... I've been using the Echo Dot 3rd Gen devices in my home for a while now, so I decided to get a Show to try it out. I have mixed opinions about it. Here goes.. Overall construction, style, and appearance: 5 out of 5 Stars - the device looks a lot bigger in person than in the picture, even though its dimensions are clearly listed in the description. It is simply a beautifully crafted and designed device. The picture quality is spectacular, it has a firefox browser on it, and you can look up your amazon prime video, youtube, and different video skills on it which look great. I had already read people's complaints about the ""try this ..."" Option showing up, and although that doesn't bother me in the least, I had read the helpful review on how to remove it already but I kind of like the option being displayed so I've kept it for now. Setup was waaay faster than the dots. Less than three mins tops. Literally plug it in and it's ready. Successful integration with calendar, email, etc, and am finding more skills to utilize. Cons: In the smart home device area, everything but my echo dots are seen and able to be controlled. My lohas smart LED lights and amazon plug are working fine from it. To use video calling you can't use video drop-in if you're device and your alexa app are connected to the same wifi network. (I disconnected my phone with the alexa app on it from my wifi network and connected to another one and video drop-in was perfect. Would be nice to disable the ring tone or sounds or display when dropping in on it, in order to use it as a monitor to check on my apartment while I'm out and not alert potential burglars of my ability to see them. At present when I drop in it rings and lights up. I had to change the wake up word to ""computer"" so as to not confuse my echo dots in the same area of the place. I do not see a lot of skills for it at present. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place? The voice response time is lagged slightly. Not as fast as the echo devices. To sum things up, I have a beautifully crafted, calendar and picture slide show unit in my office now. That's basically it. Overall: Great design, still needs improvement on functionality. 4 out of 5 overall satisfaction.","Beautiful design, could use improvement in functionality"

The hardware build feels excellent. The screen is bright in sunlight and automatically dims to a night mode when dark. Sound is different (I'd say better) compared to my echo. Drop-in and video calling features are pretty useful when communicating with family members; most of us put our phones on silent nowadays so another way to reach them is always a plus. I mainly got this to integrate with my Ring doorbell - so far so good (the Ring cloud is a bit slow sometimes, but that's not this product's fault). Cons: I put this in my bedroom, so my main use as part of my daily routine is to check the time and the weather before I leave for work. So I do wish the clock can be made full screen both normally as well as in night mode. I'd also like to be able to give it context (i.e. if it's between 7a and 9a, always show today's weather details, and show a large clock the rest of the time). These are simple software fixes, so hopefully it'll get rolled out soon because the hardware seems well made.",Worth it if discounted

For either the show or the show 8. I’m deeply disappointed with that. As what states below I have my parents my first gen show. Both of them have memory issues. I was hoping it would help reminder for calendar events and etc. however. They both are Constantly Complaining about the units not showing the day or the date. So they’re constantly asking the unit what day it is and what date it is. Which after looking up information I’m only seeing the show 5 that shows the date doesn’t make since especially due to the money that’s paid for these products. I’m highly disappointed with that and because of this issue alone with the regular show and the show 8. Not displaying the day and date on the dashboard/home screen I have to give it a 2 star. My mother’s at the point of not remembering to say Alexa show events or show calendar, which is a huge downside of me giving them the show in the first place. Amazon if y’all can fix this then I’ll give this more stars however as of now. 2 stars. If it wasn’t for the ability to call video chat and entertainment I’d give it a 1 star. Yes because of what I’m going thru with my parents I’m ranking this way down. Once they do a update that has the day and date on the dashboard/home screen the 4-5star it will be Before update.

And if nothing else, at least the same amount of mics as the Dot, or even the Auto. It's honestly less useful than the Dot. Just a background with advertisements on what kind of stuff to ask Alexa. With so few mics, it hardly ever understands what I'm saying, which makes navigating what you do manage to get on the screen impossible. It often just gave up and opened the browser and searched YouTube for the words it thought I said. And for the single most useful feature I bought it for, it is impossible to video call any other Alexa device except for the Alexa app on my phone.

Just recently got this. This is the my lest liked smart device in of the previously mentioned devices that have voice recognition. Alexa is not as intuitive as Google for voice integration for me. The larger screen of the show 8 is something that was suprising to me. I actually like it less than I do the smaller screens on the google Nest Hub and show 5. I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker. The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one.

The only thing that appears on my screen now is the photos, Time, Temperature and if I have an upcoming alarm set I’ll see that too.

The whole endeavor can be summed up in one word: Why? Why put a video screen on something that only needs audio? My NPR News briefing didn't get much added value from a 10-second video intro of the hosts, or from the B-roll footage they played while the reporters were talking. There's no Netflix browser. No YouTube unless you want to go through the crappy web version. No way to easily play slide shows of interesting things. I would have loved to say ""Alexa play a slideshow of nature photos"" or something like that... but that only works if you go beforehand to your Amazon account and set up a photo album of nature shots and then invoke that specific album. Why? There is so much wasted opportunity. Plus I didn't like how even at the lowest brightness setting, it was too bright for my room at night. I ended up turning off the display at night entirely -- which made me question why I had ever purchased this thing in the first place. Returned. Don't buy it.

But for me, having multiple ""5s"" around, this larger screen and even bigger sound brought me joy. Video calling was great with the 5, but wow, video calling on the 8 is really cool and requires less shifting the device around to keep up with us folks constantly moving around. My only regret was purchasing this on a pre-order bundled with another Echo Show 5 at a discount. But ultimately, cost me a lot of money. Suddenly Amazon dropped the price of this one to less than $100. Kind of screwed all those who pre-ordered it at full price. Lesson learned - I will not be the early bird on new devices, because that ate my future Echo Show 10 money. Lo and behold, during Black Friday, the Echo Show 10 dropped to $149, and I jumped on it. A month later, and I am still frustrated with the full size 10 and have a return request open because it drops constantly and becomes unresponsive. The Echo 8 has blown the 10 away and sounds just as good.

Windows is not a problem but this android/phone-based stuff has some opacity. I often find myself baffled about what to do. With even what seem to be the most elemental things, like re-naming a device, there's no clue, or they take so many steps that by the time I've gotten through them I've forgotten what I was trying to do. So maybe this isn't a common problem but I bet it is. HOWEVER: it is a very nice unit, has smooth sound, excellent voice recognition, and a nice screen. I'm even likely to buy a 2nd one in a larger screen size. I got it for about 80 bucks and I could scarcely believe how good it is for that price.

I was intrigued with the devices with screens, because it displays song titles (I have had many issues when asking Alexa what song she is playing).  However, I heard that most Alexa devices with displays have terrible sound quality, and I wanted good sounding music throughout my system.  So I bought the Show 8 for $99.  The sound is pretty good- it distorts a bit when turned up very high, but for regular listening it is quite sufficient  It did group with my other Echo devices to make Amazon Music or Pandora play from an  ""all speakers"" group, with was one of my primary tasks. I really don't ""use"" the screen much.  And it is always on, switching between backgrounds I've chosen and adds for Alexa Skills, news clips etc.  At night, it switches to a dark mode, displaying only the time.

I read the reviews, pro and con, and decided a lot of smoke was being blown.  The unit came registered to me, and connected to my network without any problems, along with updating the software. The voice recognition software tailored itself to my voice without any problems, and I've yet to repeat myself. The display is crisp and the colors are excellent, and for those who complain about what is displayed that they don't want, get over it, listen to the excellent quality music it's capable of producing instead.  I like the changing backgrounds when it's idle and just ignore the ""Try..."" messages.  The one thing that really rocks is that lyrics are displayed for the vast majority of the songs that you might listen to, just think, you might discover something you didn't know about a song or two.  I can live with the changing clock (from center screen to upper left), but the advantage is knowing what the weather is like outside.

If you are buying one to setup for an elderly relative, create a separate email account AND have that person’s cell phone when you setup initially. I made the mistake of setting up initially with my phone and email thinking I could easily edit it later. That was a huge mistake! It required a couple of lengthy phone calls to Amazon to get my cell phone number disassociated and their number associated. Also, on one of those calls, I had the person tell me that my Amazon account and my Alexa account are linked. They are not! If you don’t want to give access to all your phone’s contact, you can set up contacts separately but it’s not at all intuitive. It took me a while to figure it out.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2020,Dormouse,"I now have a 5 and an 8 and my review will be for both plus feedback for alexa in general. The screens are cool but it's a bit annoying that I can't get rid of the alexa tips on the screen. I know there are things I can ask alexa to do that I don't know about but a tutorial section I can go to would be enough. I wish I had the same cool backgrounds on the 8 that I have on the 5, although I do like that I can use my pics from facebook. The shows misunderstand me quite a bit more than the echoes. It can be frustrating. I'll ask for volume to set to 5 and be told that I can only set on a scale of 1 - 10, or ask for 6 and get 9. One example but not the only times I get misunderstood. Also, despite having it set to ""brief"" I still feel like she can be a bit too long winded. I'll ask for music on ""everywhere"" and the song is 10 seconds in on the other devices before she's done talking. Then there are things that only need to be said once or not at all. If I ask for music everywhere then I don't need to be told it's playing everywhere. The fact that it's playing everywhere is all I need. I wish alexa were better at learning. If I verbally ask for shuffle or repeat, for example on the white noise skill that I use, she'll boldly announce that she'll remember the setting for next time but that has never been the case on any of the devices. I always have to turn shuffle or repeat back on from playlist to playlist even. The speaker on the 5 is abysmal but the 8 is actually pretty good. As good as or better than the echoes. The 5 is basically a glorified alarm clock. Speaking of the white noise skills, they can be really hard on the speakers. It's odd that Amazon would allow a skill to be developed that can damage its devices. I wish there were better integration of 3rd party devices. My cameras are geeni and I can't view them through the shows. I can't even verbally control them except for turning them on/off. Then there are things I feel like they should do but can't. For example, if music is playing on only one device, I wish I could say ""expand to everywhere"" or somesuch and have the music switch to everywhere, or vice versa. Instead, I have to ask everything to start over. I also wish I could connect to everywhere with bluetooth. This is an issue I've had since the beginning. I want to be able to play the music that is natively on my phone on everywhere. I wish I could watch more than just prime video on the shows. Considering how common it is that screen based smart devices come with the whole gamut of streaming apps, it's odd to me that the shows do not offer this. I know my review sounds largely negative but I do like the show and the potential it has. This review is meant to be constructive.",My current take on the show and alexa.
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Nov 2020,Bo Beard,"I wanted to spend some time with this product before writing a review. In the world of smart screens, you pretty much have to choose between Amazon and Google and since I already have several Echo speakers, I decided to go with the Echo Show 8. This product has some great features but could be so much better if Amazon would listen to their users. I've listed some pros and cons below. Here's hoping Amazon makes a couple tweaks to make this the number 1 smart screen on the market! Pros: - Excellent sound quality. This speaker sounds amazing. We used to have an Echo and Echo Dot in our large kitchen but the Show has replaced them both - Home screen customization. You have a lot of control over what will display when the screen is idling which is nice - The physical camera cover is a really nice touch. Great feature that adds piece of mind - Timer functionality is really cool. Since we're used to using smart speakers only, seeing the timer on the screen is a really nice touch and there's a really neat animation for the final few seconds - Smart Home Control works really well. It quickly pulled up all of my devices and works very well with both voice and touch screen control Cons - The biggest complaint I see all the time is one of my biggest as well: ""Try, Alexa..."". Not only is this feature an eye sore but if you have a Show, you probably have other Amazon speakers too. This should at least be optional because it's very distracting and ruins the look of the device - Spotify control feels purposefully poor. I know Amazon Music competes directly with Spotify but to purposefully make Alexa dumber with Spotify is not a great move for customer satisfaction. I never had issues when Amazon Music was my primary music service but with Spotify, I consistently have to use my phone to actually get what I want playing on the Show - I was super excited to use this for recipes but unless you use the All Recipes skill, it just doesn't work. I found a recipe online and opened it on Firefox on the Echo Show but any time I tried to play music as well, it would close Firefox. I really don't understand why Firefox can't be open while music is playing. Seems like an easy fix Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase. Most of my gripes could easily be fixed with a software update so I really hope Amazon can use some of this feedback",Almost Perfect
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2020,Richard Taft,"First off, Kudos to amazon for doing right by me when my discontinued Echo spot started acting up.  They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price. So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in. The Screen is HUGE, bright and clear.  Its nice not having to watch distorted videos on a round screen.  Its a great price point between the show 5 and the original Echo Show.  The camera is the same as the Show 5 @ 1mp, more then enough for video chat.  It looks clear, with now distortions. This of course will depend on your internet/WiFi connectivity. The sound quality is very good.  Its not a $2k audio system, but its not a cheep pair of headphones ether...  The sound is rich and full and quite enjoyable.  Functionally its like any other Alexa device. Now for the issues.  The two big ones, and the reason for knocking off the 2 stars, is first, the LIMITED availability of clock face customization.  If you go to settings and select clock & faces, all you can pick is the clock background.  The HUGE face, and the time is limited to being displayed in one corner.  The Show 5 had all kinds of face options, but this one only lets you pick the backgrounds.  Yes you can have a photo or something from Facebook, a couple of ugly pictures and a single semi solid background, but that's it.  You should at the very least be able to have the time take up most of the screen to be able to see it at night or from across the room.  The show 5 has customization, why is it not part of the Show 8 as well The other one is an annoyance with every screen based Alexa device I have ever owned.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE THE ""THINGS TO TRY"" TEXT.  Its in the middle of, or on the bottom of almost EVERY card that the device displays.  You can turn off everything else, but not that....  I want to have it rotate between time & weather...  THAT'S ALL.  If I need to find new things to try I will look it up myself....  This has annoyed me and A LOT of other people for a very long time.  Come on Amazon, lets have a way to turn this off. Overall I am happy, and hopeful that Amazon will listen and get us some updates real soon...  I'll update this if anything else happens.","Very Good Device, but still has Flaws.."

I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don’t like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn’t bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don’t be afraid that it’s too much for a bedroom.

I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny. I also noticed that when I turned the lights down, the Echo automatically went into a standby mode, blank with just the time showing. The music continued to play, however. When I turned the lights back on, it woke up again, displaying song lyrics, etc. Oh, and even with the music up at its loudest, I am able to give Alexa a command without having to yell, even from across the room. The Echo does continually show suggestions at the bottom of the screen, which some people have complained about. I pretty much ignore it because I'm not usually staring at the screen for it to bother me. While it's just sitting there, it will also go through news headlines. There may be a way to change these features, but I haven't yet explored that possibility. I did, also, ask Alexa to open Hulu and started watching a show directly on the Echo, just to test it out. It worked well, and the picture looked good. I just had to sign into Hulu on the Amazon Alexa app. There's still much to learn, but overall, I can see the Echo Show 8 being a helpful and fun part of my everyday routine. I asked Alexa to set a reminder alarm, which she did, and that's going to be a huge help for me. Once I get security cameras and the lights put up, I'll be set. I resisted getting any kind of ""Smart"" device for a while, but I'm glad I finally got the Echo. I'm always looking things up on my phone, or setting alarms to remind me to do things, so this just makes staying informed and organized so much easier. I will probably get another Echo Show 8 for my room after I get the security cameras so I can check them without having to go into the kitchen. I scooped up my Echo Show 8 and my mother's during the Black Friday sale on Amazon, so I couldn't resist the price. I also got Echo Dots for my four grown daughters, and will see how they like them. UPDATE: I thought this was great. I asked Alexa for the number to Fed Ex, which she found. Then she asked if I'd like her to call them for me. I talked to Fed Ex through Alexa and the call was clear. After the call, I said, ""Alexa, hang up."" And that was it! I didn't have to pick up my phone or search for the number. I love my Echo!",This Simplifies My Life
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2020,Will,"The screen is nice and large and the sound is good. A solid update from my first generation Echo Show. I've come to grips with the fact that Kindle devices aren't as good as iPads because you pay a third of the price. But why is the voice recognition of the Echo devices not as good as Google Nest devices at the same price point? I use both families of devices in my home with a preference for Amazon's. Every day I find myself literally yelling at Alexa because it misunderstood something I said. I thought maybe it was just the older generation Echo Dots but even both my new Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 exhibit this same problem. The problem most frequently comes up with routines (e.g., ""Alexa, send the kids to bed"") and news stories (e.g., ""Alexa, what's the Hot Dog Day story?""). The Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Show devices are generally good and have become part of my everyday routine, but the frustration that comes from hit-or-miss voice recognition (probably the device's biggest selling point) is enough to detract from the overall experience.",Why is Alexa's voice recognition noticeably worse than Google's?

I can't believe how good the Echo Show is. The sound quality is amazing for such a small unit. But the standard Echo sounds fairly good (though not as good). Do I really need a video screen? There are two big pluses to having the screen. Being able to make video calls to friends and family who also have an Echo Show is a nice to have feature. But what I really love is loading all my photography into Amazon storage and having the Echo Show shuffle my 50 years of photographic memories in a continuous picture show. In between the display of personal photos, the unit displays news and weather updates from your favorite news source. I placed the unit next to my recliner, so while I'm chilling out reading or watching TV, I can glance over to the Echo Show to see a personal photo I had totally forgotten about or catch a news update.",Wow

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2019,Bichon Mom,"Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is something that I bought specifically to watch the streams from my Wyze cameras.  It does that very well but it is the “Try, ‘Alexa ----’ “  feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device. The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The “Try,’ Alexa ----’ ” is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say. I have Alexa Echo audio devices in every room along with the other leading AI assistant.  I find that I can avoid frustration when one of the AI assistants fails to understand me, or can not help me with that yet, to be able to ask the other and usually get a response. Now that displays are becoming the norm I decided to trade up.  I find it really helps to see a visualization of the response. I particularly like seeing lyrics to songs.  It is also nice to be able to set the home screen to present what one’s wants.  The sound on this 8” Echo Show is excellent. Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is an ideal size for a kitchen counter or nightstand.  It’s a handy device that makes smart home control or information gathering even easier.","Bought a 2nd one and really like the helpful “Try, Alexa---” exact wording feature"

It has a  much larger screen and I can easily read it from across the room.  The only issue I have is that I am disappointed with the Upgrade and Trade-in discount which offered me $30 instant credit if I sent in my old unit.  My old unit sat untouched on a table for a year.  It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again. Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).  If like me you don't agree to take a lower value then they just ship it back to you.  Beware!",Beware offer to Trade-In (updated 1/9/20)
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2020,Andrew Barefoot,"I had a lot of hopes for this. I had an echo dot in my kitchen which I thought was neat but I always had to bring my laptop or tablet into the kitchen if I was making a recipe and was worried about getting food on them. I thought this would be the ideal option. In reality-this to me has just been an echo dot with a screen that is not nearly as useful as it could be. My life/calendar is not integrated with Alexa as the kids use it more than I do but I do use it to tell my iRobot to vacuum-which works about 70%of the time- and to play things on my TV with amazon prime. I do like it also for listening to the news and music, but the echo dot did all that, for much less. I wanted the screen so I could pull up my recipies or new recipes and do cooking stuff and maybe even call people. And this is what it does not do well. It does stuff but you have to figure out the magic words and way you have to ask it to do stuff. My wife told me not to get it and now she just laughs at me as I try to figure out the incantation that will make it work when if it was just an app button or something like that I could tap and move on with my life. Especially since it goes to sleep and then you have to say the correct incantation again to get back to where you were. At the end of the day I guess I wanted an ipad or something similar but I liked alexa better than siri for queries as I want something that responds to verbal instruction. You can video call people,...IF they have these devices,..so not too useful. Facebook/skype are better as can be used on multiple platforms as well as facetime as most friends family have some idevice. Price is good for what it does, I have to acknowledge that. It is so close to exactly what I want but falls frustratingly short. I think I was more satisfied with the dot.",its ok

However one huge problem that will have me sending this back is that you cannot change the clock display. You are such with the small clock in the upper left corner of the screen. The only option I've found to make it larger is to turn on do not disturb. But with that on you don't get any notifications and cannot receive drop ins or video calls. I suppose shame on me for not reading the question & answers in the listing. I see that people have been complaining about this missing feature since last year when it came out to no avail. And I say missing feature because the Show 5 has many clock faces and sizes to choose from. Scraping the internet for answers the only excuse I was able to find from Amazon is that the Echo Show 8 is not intended to be a nightstand clock but rather an entertainment device in the house.

The microphone on this is, by far, the worst performing out of more than a dozen devices that we have in the house. The Echo Show 5 (and Echo gen 2) worked without any problems, but this device struggles to hear the ""alexa"" wake word. There are times when I am 3 feet away from it, and another device about 25' away picks up instead. Our acoustics of the room have not changed and I never had this problem with my last show (and only had to replace it due to the screen going bad).

But at home, I've had luck, original tower model, 2nd gen, and all the shows, first and second gens.  Even a dot or two in the mix. But the shows seem to have worse recognition for voice than the other ones do.  I have no idea why, but the 10"" in the great room more often than not mishears what I say, and the 8"" in my bedroom isn't much better.  I'm not talking with any weird accent, I'm not mumbling, I'm not rushing words out.  I'm doing the exact same things that worked nearly flawlessly with the old style echo towers, and it just doesn't recognize as well with these Show devices. Screens are nice, I like having the ability to see things, since we use them as clocks and weather stations, and they fill that function nicely. Sound is good.  Not audiophile level, obviously, but decent bass from a little box like this for music and the voice doesn't sound tinny when she talks.  Integration with smart devices is all there just like the rest of them, but again, ""turn on <whatever>"" half the time has her trying to turn something OFF.

Babcock,"The first one I bought was a convenience with which to communicate with my 86 YO mother who still lives on her own. Subsequent purchases were made due to a gift made all the more special by the inability to get basic medical care when the diagnosis was made during this COVID hysteria: they make me omnipresent with my wife as she is waylaid by chemotherapy. Outside  of that, I wouldn't have them. Here's why: I like to cook. The recipes the Echo in the kitchen shows are rarely more than inane, and usually stupidly named on the feed, turning out to be something other, either subtly or drastically, than the feed title implied. I'm a news junky. The ""news"" it will give you is always biased, anti-Trump  pap, and you're stuck with what Bezos has chosen for you to select from. No balance, no escape other than disabling it. There is really little about these that I like about these, considering their potential. You cannot customize the name it will respond to beyond those Bezos' programmers have chosen, so it's not even fun. The touch screen is barely responsive. The smarthome integration, at least with Insteon, ISY994i, and Honeywell thermostats is basic, quirky and inflexible. Ring integration is pointless. It feels to me as if they had Apple develop the hardware - it has the same ""live in our cage"" concept with little ability to ""make it yours"". But the video chatting with ma is great, and the intra-home intercom capability, though invoking it is unnatural, is useful. And the sound quality is on par with most wireless speakers.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,Mr. Eddie S.,"I was very skeptical about this here version of the Echo Show for a long time. I at last decided to gone ahead and buy it, still not truly knowing what I was getting into, even after a few videos by others whom have purchased it. The bass is awesome with no need for a Bluetooth speaker, I'm cool with the display as well as I have seen worst quality out there. This make my first Echo Show device and second Echo device in all this far. With that said, I am still very tempting to get the 10 inch Echo Show 2nd generation, especially after hearing the sound quality of the Show 8 HD in which looks very beautiful sitting atop my Trophy Showcase. One thing I love the most about Echo devices is the comfort of knowing they are always improving thanks going out to Amazon for that. The try Alexa down at the bottom of the screen isn't a bother to me. I take privacy extremely serious and the added shutter for the cam is a BIG plus. Setup for me only took about 6 minutes or less being as though I was only upgrading from my Echo Dot 2nd Gen. In which I still love of course. Eventually I will also be the proud owner of that Echo Show 10 2nd Gen. Until then, this will hold me. Update, this device is still going strong. I also love the fact that it hears me better than my Echo Dot. A few upgrades I would have like to have seen being as though this Echo Show is newer than the Show 2nd Gen, it should have came with a bigger screen but is still cool. I would have also like to have seen a screen protector that you can leave on because the screen does accepts fingerprints very well when touched. I love the fact that it also comes complete with a actual phone with dialing pad. It’s like having a network phone. Maybe one day 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 will offer free phone numbers like Google to work exclusively with Echo devices that will allow for not only making calls but receiving them to. This would make the Echo devices absolutely perfect. Another thing that I like about the Echo that I forgot to mention , especially this model, not only do you have prime music as a choice when using this device for listening to music, you can also connect your phone, laptop, iPad, etc to it using your devices Bluetooth and play your own music right through the Echo and Echo Show devices for a better listening experience. What’s even more, you have the controls right there on the Echo Show devices to play, stop and go to next song and back a song as well as song title and artist information right on the screen making it an even better choice to own a Echo Show device.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2020,read my review,"So, I'm an admitted late adopter, as in I bought my first echo dot in late 2019. I loved the sound and ease to play music and ask questions so much I thought, ""Why not get an Echo Show? I'm sure it'll be even more fun than the dot."" Ummm....nope. For me, it basically does the same thing, but costs more and seems to understand my commands less than my dot. I have to repeat things WAY MORE than I do for the dot and, even more annoying, it seems to sometimes guess what I'm saying and do something 100000000% different than my request. Here are some examples: ME: ""Alexa, play songs by Anjulie."" Echo Show: ""Ok, playing songs by Julie Andrews"" ME: ""Alexa, read me a poem by a poet from the Romantic era"" ES: I can't (or something like that.) ME: (exasperated) ""Alexa, read me a romantic poem"" ES: ""Ok, reading from Audible, The Tales of Peter Rabbit, by Beatrix Potter"" And, I have so many more examples like this. Try asking a question about something beyond the weather or simple conversions and she'll at best post some internet sites for you to read. Ugh. I can do that with my laptop or my phone or, like most normal people do...at work! What else? Well, Alexa likes to stay on. Meaning, when it's bedtime or I'm leaving for the day, there's no way I know to make the screen go black, you know to at least appear like Amazon isn't listening to me snore. And, more, like hundreds of reviews and even more people on other websites say, I HATE the constant scroll of ideas to try with Alexa and you can't turn it off. How about ""Alexa, try working like your owners want you to work""? And, there's even more this ES should do, but doesn't. If you're listening to music, that's it. You can't do anything else on your ES. If you say the wake word, the music mutes and Alexa waits for your question. If it requires a new screen, your music stops. Greeeaaatttt....even my Android phone and Windows laptop play Pandora AND, ironically, Amazon Music in the background unless I'm doing something that requires the mic, like talking on the phone...maybe even to Amazon customer service. Anyway, here's just one of the ways this single mode thing with the ES is really annoying. Alexa ALWAYS wants you to use her for recipes. Guess what: Want to cook w/Alexa? I hope you either have a photographic memory or don't want to listen to music, because you can't look at the recipe and listen to music at the same time. Annoying, right? So, what do I actually like about my ES? Well, I like the sound quality. For the price and size, and perhaps because I'm not too picky, the music that comes from the Show's speaker(s?) is nice. It's just not always the song I asked it to play. I also like the one thing I've found contradictory to its single mode mantra and that's that, if available, the ES will scroll the lyrics to the song it's playing. And, again, like I mentioned above, you might need those if Alexa surprises you with a Julie Andrews' song. I have until the end of the month to decide if I want to keep this ES. I'm still not sure. I thought it would have a clock display. It doesn't. Ok, actually, I thought it would have a display showing a minimal looking clock, day/date, and temperature. Yeah, no. Instead, those are each individual commands and don't stay on the screen long or together. Though, know what does have that all on one screen? You guessed it, my phone. Maybe I should return the ES and just mount a cell phone to an Echo Dot.",Not Enough User Control and Does Alexa Really Speak English?

Almost too many at times. But the good news is that usually means a lot of variety. The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I’d say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family. We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it’s great for the price, it’s small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust. Larger screen is a big plus with better quality picture. This isn’t a device I’d expect or demand 4K in. 1080 is fine. Nothing is generally grainy or hard to see. It’s the right size for a kitchen without being excessive and space demanding. Performance wise it’s fast. Does a great job with home automation and commands. I like the shutter for the camera and button to cut the mic off. The only ding I’d give it is it should have the option of being a true smart hub. I would love to attach my z wave devices to it and remove the entirety of a secondary controller. I know the larger show does have some of these functions but at a much larger size it wasn’t what we wanted. Add in the extra cost, the show 8 was a winner for us.

We started out by getting the 8"" Show for the kitchen, thinking that would be all we needed.  Then we realized that we needed Smart Plugs to actually control something.  Well you have to be close to a Hub for Alexa to hear you properly.  So then we bought a Dot, followed closely by an Echo.  The sound on the Echo was pretty good, so wouldn't it be perfect in the bedroom.  Let's get one Studio for the Living Room.  Now started a whole series of smart switches for the different areas of the house.  The first Studio sounds so good, lets get a second to make it a sound system in the Living Room.  I'm probably not done since there is still the T-Stat, Garage Door, and a dozen more switches to go.  I've spent my monthly allocation and have to wait a while to get more.  At least I'll have things to put on my Christmas and Birthday List. After the usual start-up pains, the occasional tight gang boxes, and figuring how to integrate the Home Theater into my existing TV, it has been pretty smooth and painless.  Each different Manufacturer seem to have their own integration APP to communicate with Alexa.  But they all operate pretty smoothly together. The Drop-in feature is a little strange.  We surprised our daughter by suddenly talking into her Apartment through her Show.  The grandkids all had a riot talking with us, even though they Facetime quite frequently.  The sound and video quality of the Drop-in and Announcement  features on the Show are pretty poor compared to  Facetime.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jan 2020,L_Speed,"The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation. The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well. The issues. 1. There is no way to have a larger clock in ""standard"" mode.  It's a small little clock in the corner, and even if you turn off all the info scrolling options like news, weather, etc. It stays this small little clock with a bunch of empty screen space. Do not disturb allows for a larger clock, but is a poor implementation of allowing it as it literally shuts everything else off. 2. Do not disturb in the menu says it turns the screen off, but actually leaves the screen on and just gives you a larger clock.  It should turn the screen off as stated and there should be a separate mode for displaying a larger clock. 3. Night mode is still WAY too bright and there's no way to adjust it or dim it down. Nor any option to configure it so that night mode is just a clock, no picture. Now, if this was a first try, these things would be forgivable as they worked through what the end user wanted.  The issue?  The Google Home Hub has been out for over a year and literally has NONE of these issues as they got all of these wrongs right.  Want a full screen clock.  Check.  Want a proper dnd mode? Check. A night time mode that properly dims the display?  Check. The fact that the Show 8 misses badly on all of these is just not acceptable.","Good device, flawed software by Amazon"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Feb 2020,Clara Agro,"I totally love this Echo Show.  I love being able to just sit in front of the TV and ask to see the front door ring device and up it pops and gives me the ability to see and talk to the person without running around looking for my cell phone or even if you hear a noise you can get a live view without going outside.  It does so many things alarm, timer, reminders, shopping list, jokes, music, etc., etc., etc... I find out something new that it does everyday.  Don't know how I lived without it. The only thing I would change is the way it reminds you that a message has been received (like a talking text) on the dots the ring spins yellow until you ask for your messages the show makes a sound and show you that you have a message on the screen but then it goes off and there is a little number in the right corner I find this easy to miss if you aren't in the room while the message is being received other than that I love it.",Love It!
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2020,R.S.,"After using the 2 Echo Dots I just received I was really hoping for an enhanced experience with the Show 8. Set up was fine. But, from the jump the Show just had trouble hearing. I have tried all of the wake words and the only one that even comes close to working is ""computer"". I used different words for each device, the same for all and various combos of two of one and one for the other. I even tried it with the Dots unplugged. The Echo Dots hear me from anywhere in my place and do not fight over which one is going to carry out the request. The Show misses its wake word at least 35 percent of the time no matter the distance and then its a fight to get it to understand what I want. Also, when I aske the Echos for the weather they sometimes make sure to tell me the city. However even though they are all set to my exact location in all three areas of the software and device settings, they give me the weather for the main city in the area not for my city which is still in the top seven for Ohio. The temp and conditions many times vary a lot between the two cities even with an only 11 mile difference. Main city is right up against Lake Erie at a lower elevation.  Accuweather, Weather Bug, Weather.com and everyone else know the difference between the two. However the Alexa software which I am told uses Accuweather can't seem to shake the problem. Customer service was no help, just told me to try a skill. I can get the correct weather. I just need the weather that is displayed on the home screen of the Show to be correct and not embarrassingly wrong. If I didn't get it for only 70 dollars with a 24 dollar smart plug it would be going back today. But no Echo Dots are available for at least a month. Then I will wind up paying more than I did on prime day without the additional freebies. Maybe they will update the software sooner then I expect.",Not impressed at all with this one.

I’m glad I got the stand - I think it looks much better on the stand. The sound on this device is impressive! I was pleasantly surprised! Seriously I love listening to music on this while I’m in the kitchen. There is one thing I need to discuss - the suggestions and tips that I see so many people complaining about. Sorry, not sorry - I actually love them! Seriously, I wouldn’t know what to do with Alexa half the time if I didn’t have these suggestions and tips! And I don’t care how well you know Alexa, I don’t think anyone can possibly know everything she can do! Who doesn’t need tips and suggestions? Ok, I guess some of you don’t, but I appreciate and welcome all the help! I love how it randomly shows me different recipes fun facts, music, it’s great!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jan 2020,minty & kevin,"I was very hesitant with purchasing this Echo Show 8 because I had never had an Alexa product and didn't want to risk spending money for something I didn't love. I essentially wanted an iPad for my kitchen to look up recipes and play music but didn't want to spend a fortune: PROS: - Great sound quality - Able to customize wallpaper/screensaver to your photos (but you have to download amazon photos app and individually select the photos you want, which was a pain) - Connects with your internet and log-ins for music super easily! I didn't have to sign-into ANYTHING at all except my amazon account! Once you plug it in, it connects to your wifi, all your amazon/pandora music, etc. CONS: - It is VERY limited to a few sites for recipes look-ups (Allrecipes.com) - It's basically ONLY voice-command (which I had to get used to. There is no physical home button and you can't do much with the screen itself....only voice.) - You have the option to watch Hulu or Foodnetwork on there if you have a subscription but nothing else. Overall, if they made the Echo Shows more varietal I would buy the upgraded version.

I am a big fan of the flash briefing - especially the weather forecast.  I love using it for timers and alarms.  I'd need more devices for the announcement feature to be helpful - but that seems way nicer than yelling for the kids at dinner every night.  The lyrics with songs is honestly one of the few things I use the screen for.  Football scores and the multi-day forecast are really the only other 2 uses I've found.  It does integrate with my Ecobee, but I haven't figured out yet if I can control it, or if I can only watch it.  My kids love that they can call people on it, but the video has never worked, which is a bummer.  I was hoping it would just turn on if they had a camera on their cell phones, but it didn't work that way.  If they have to have Alexa installed, or another Echo show -- well them I'm not sure that will ever get used either. In general, it's been fun to play with and there are parts I love.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2020,DaveP,"I've had Google Home and Amazon Echo (Dot) for the last two years. The Echo Show (8"") was the latest addition this year. I decided to go with the Echo Show because of it's integration with our Ring Doorbell. The sound is as good, if not slightly better, than the Google Home (1st Gen) that we have. I like the 8"" screen display. It makes it easy to read text such as recipes, etc. It also has a nice clear picture when viewing through the Ring doorbell. Alexa, however, seems to be much more finicky when it comes to giving instructions. For example, when I ask Alexa to ""Answer the door"" when the doorbell rings, Alexa asks me who I'd like to call and gets stuck in that mode (the correct command is ""Alexa, answer the front door""  or ""talk to the front door."" Also, it is a tad bit slow in doing so when I do give the right command. Easier and faster just to pull out the phone out of my pocket and push on the Ring icon. In the same manner, Alexa seems slightly less intelligent than Google in asking other open ended questions, which is why I am glad to have both available when I need them. I have the Echo Show and three Dots in or home along with 4 (generic) smart plugs for being able to program and turn lights on orally, very handy. Alexa integrated very easily with them. I have a couple of glitches that I can't explain though. Twice Alexa stopped recognizing all of them for a brief period (an hour or so), then the next thing you know they all worked again. It wasn't a network problem (they were still all connected) but perhaps Alexa was doing an upgrade or something, who knows. All in all, I am happy with my new addition.","Great Sound, Works well with Alexa"

I had debated between this size and the larger one, but ultimately decided this would fit well in the space I had. I have this in my kitchen, I use it for viewing my recipes, playing music, etc. This is not my only alexa device in the house, I have a dot (in my daughters room and on her account), an echo show 5 (in my office), and the Fire cube. We had to turn off the voice activation on the cube (we have an open concept, so they were fighting) which my husband hates anyway, so he didn't mind that. My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door. I've been playing music (spotify) in my office and walked into the kitchen to see if it would play on both devices, or what would happen. It picked up where the office one left off, the office one stopped, but when I went back into the office (much later), what was playing in the kitchen did not start in the office. It's not a big enough deal to me to go see how to fix it, but in case anyone was wanting that functionality, you may want to look that up. I'm pleased with the size, I was hoping I wouldn't regret not getting the larger one, but I don't. It fits perfectly, I can see the screen just fine, and I've had no issues.

All three are enjoying talking with each other in a new way. They love seeing the many photos of other brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and their kids.

We LOVE the Echo Show 8. It's size is perfect for a kitchen ecosystem, and it fits perfectly into the home as the hub of our smart home (smart switches, smart plugs. smart thermostat) nothing all that crazy. Really, you buy these devices for sound (the Echo Show 8 is excellent in this domain (good rich vibrance and resonance) as well as the screen ( the Echo Show 8 runs circles around the Show 5 in this domain). I've never had the 10 Echo Show, but honestly, I feel the Show 8 fits just into the ""just right"" category. Simply put, if you already love the Echo ecosystem, add this.

Like others, do I wish it had a way to take off the things to try...of course.  That said, am I going to be petty and mark down the entire things for that design flaw? No, I won't.

For example, it has Bluetooth but you can't use a bluetooth headset for skype calls. I found that I can listen to music with my bluetooth headset but it immediately disconnects and switches to speakers, so if you're hoping to have skype calls with headset on, you're out of lack. This is a big flaw in my opinion with no reasonable explanation. Many complain about the screen constantly suggesting stuff and advertising Alexa skills. That didn't bother me too much. The interface is quite clumsy - for example YouTube is not an app, you get it via one of the available browsers on it and it can be very annoying because the screen is not well optimized.

With Ring you can see who is at the door and have a conversation without going to the door. With other security devices you have the ability to ""show"" the state or the video feed. I also think it's neat that you can show recipes while you are baking step by step. You can also pull up videos including YouTube. You can video chat. When you listen to Amazon music you can so lyrics when they are available and album art. For those nervous about the camera you can turn it off and it has a slide cover so you don't need to worry about it. All in all I'm pretty impressed with this device.

Unfortunately, this too imposes a 10min live view timeout.  Your feed will shut off after 10mins.  This is a hard limitation Amazon has imposed on their products.  Even when paired with a Google Nest Cam which does not have a timeout limitation, the SHOW will shut the feed off after a while. Highly disappointed that Amazon does not mention this in any of their production descriptions. Imposing such a limit is a very strange decision by Amazon since their direct competitor Google does not have timeouts and you can watch a camera feed as long as you like.  If you need to monitor your feed more then 10mins at a time, stay away from the Ring product lineup.",Misleadingly advertised.  Can not use as a baby monitor.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Mar 2020,Robert G. Norris,"I wanted to add another device to my house so I upgraded with the Echo Show 8 to replace my 1st generation Echo Show. I moved my older show to the other spot in my house that I wanted to have a device with it's capabilities. The first thing I found is was a bit hard to get my Hue lights connected to the new device. Actually it might have been too easy which caused issues. I have had to delete my original lights twice to get them to work correctly. I had things set up for zones and it kept adding the lights over and over as new devices. I think I finally got it to work as I had it with the old Echo Show. Only time will tell. The second thing I noticed is that after so many people have stated their dislike for the ""Try This"" feature on the home screen that Amazon has still ignored the request to turn it off if you don't want or need it to be there. We need a switch in the settings somewhere on the Display tab to get rid of this if you don't want it there. Some people say there is a way to do it but trying each of their methods has been fruitless. It doesn't turn off. I'm thinking the ones who stated they contacted Amazon help and were told it can't be done are correct. Third thing I found a bit annoying is the power connection at the device. It's fine that you now have a connector plug instead of it being hard wired but it would have been just a touch more convenient to have a 90 degree plug instead of the straight plug. It sticks out a bit far past the body of the device and with the back end being longer already to accommodate the speakers it is a little deep and gets in the way.Overall the device seems to be a good upgrade. There must be a new processor which is speedier than the previous one because many things get done a lot faster than before. One thing I noticed is about four times faster is turning off the screen when I go to bed. The old one seemed to linger for three or four seconds but the new one goes off almost instantly. I think many other things are speedier as well. The Echo Show 8 is a good intermediate size, not too small and not too big. In fact it's new configuration gives me another inch of screen size in a body that is smaller in height and just a touch bigger in depth than the original.",Another Alexa Device
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Sep 2020,M. Jacobi,"I have a large house, which is old. So I decided to retrofit it and make it smarter. So, I have heavily invested into Amazon Alexa gadgets, including two of Echo Show 8, multiple Echo Dots and Echo speakers of various generations, as well as Ring Alarm and Ring Doorbell. The overall impression of the Alexa ecosystem for me is negative (2/10). Because, Echoshow 8 is an integral part of the whole system, it gets affected by it, as well as having its own serious shortcomings. 1. Speech recognition is way subpar to what Google offers. Not understanding questions, not having answers overall slows down this things it should  be able to handle. 2. Way too slow to connect to another Echoshow with ""drop in"" command, with annoying confirmation requests, which relies on speech recognition as well. This makes it slower yet. 3. Inability to have most popular apps installed. I mean things that are SO common, such as YouTube and Netflix. You have a beautiful screen with a good speaker, but you are being FORCED away from some most favorite and common video content providers. Lately Amazon ALLOWED to play YouTube from their browser. Which is obviously not the same experience. Netflix, however, is completely UNAVAILABLE. 4. Advertising on my screen!!! That's the craziest and most annoying part. I tried multiple times going through the settings, trying to remove everything from the screen,. Nothing works! They still advertise to ME on MY device, using MY electric energy, without my consent. I even tell Alexa to turn off the screen. It turns it off for a little while, then turns On a little while later, without any prompts. 5. Lately I receive messages that ""I might be running low"" on certain supplies, I usually buy from Amazon. WTH? That's crossing lines too. Unprompted. I feel like Amazon invades my privacy. 6. Frequent unprompted suggestions to: ""Try new things with Alexa""... New dumb ""games"" or tricks to use Alexa. These are impossible to remove as well. And they stay on the screen for a long time, ruining a beautiful wallpaper you might have on the screen otherwise. 7. Inability to play external video files - no hardware support (SD or MicroSD card readers) or wireless capability. 8. Overall poorly designed UI, with VERY few limited choices. ========= Conclusion: I attached several photos of Echo 8 , taken within approximately one minute. The amount of cycling unprompted ads and ""suggestions"" makes me wish I could return all of them. But, I cant , so this review is for those of you who think of getting ANY Alexa device. For those of you thinking that Amazon will have it fixed. I went through many forums, trying find my way around these issues. People have been complaining about these same issues for YEARS!

It shows several temperature displays when asking about weather. It will link to your Ring doorbell and display the video from it. It opens easy to read recipes with a simple request. It plays music videos. You can pick what types of data or pictures you would like displayed on your home page. It also displays your Google calendar and reminds you of tasks. It can control all your smart devices with voice or touch screen. I'm sure there's much more, but I really like the look and quality of this. I'm definitely going to be picking up more for other rooms in the house.",Very impressed
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jul 2020,I Want That,"Really...They make an Echo Show with almost twice the screen size and make the clock smaller than what was on the Echo Show 5. Who is designing these things. The size of the clock was one of the complaints on the show 5, do they listen to people and correct it in a future version, nope let's make it smaller and really irritate people.  I understand the larger screen now makes it possible to watch netflix or hulu on now but face it most people watch that stuff on their TV not an 8"" screen. 99% of the time it will be used as a clock.  You can use the screen magnifier trick but as soon as you use the echo for anything it goes back to the small clock face. A huge letdown to what could have been a nice product. I have no confidence that Amazon will listen to people and make an option available, they never have on any other product they make.",What's with the small clock?
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jul 2020,Nick C Casale,"I have two Echo devices and one Show 8.  I use ""Alexa"" as the wake word for one on the Echo devices and ""Echo"" as the wake word for the other Echo device.  For the Show 8 I used ""Amazon"" as the wake word.  The Show 8 thought nearly everything being said in the home was talking to it, even when the wake word was not used.  I changed the Show 8 wake word to ""Computer"" and it is not as bad now, but I really don't like using the wake word ""Computer"" as that word is used a lot at my place when referring to laptop computers, etc.  More wake words are needed, or better yet, the ability to create custom wake words using one or more words / names. Also, when I play music through the Show 8, for some crazy reason the sound sometimes comes out of the speaker that is Bluetooth connected to one of my Echo devices, and I have never connected that speaker via Bluetooth to the Show 8.  And, when it does that, the sound only comes out of that speaker connected to the Echo device and it is in a different room. Finally, even in night mode, with the screen black and just displaying the time late at night, the black background still projects too much light in the room so I turn the Show 8 off at night. I have had some Internet issues since I added the Show 8, but I still have not figured out if it is the Show 8 that is causing the problems or not.  That does not seem likely, but I don't know for sure yet.  Timing is right for that to be the case, but I don't know.  I do know that I sometimes have trouble getting Show 8 to play music in all devices, my ""Everywhere"" group, at one time.  Sometimes it will only play on one device even though the Show 8 acknowledged my request to play it in the ""Everywhere"" group that I created. Overall I think it's a quality made product, I like the ability to make, and receive, video calls, and the sound quality is good as well.  I also like being able to see visual items (name of song, artists, thumbs up and down) when playing Pandora music, or asking for a device (lights) to be turned on or off, etc.",Wake word issues and playing on wrong speaker
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2020,ALMS,"Not sure where to start but let's just say that I was a skeptic turned to the other side. I recently found myself in need of an intercom system to the basement where my children hang out and play. I also wanted something in the kitchen to see cameras around our property instead of running to my phone constantly. I was highly surprised when I got that plus much more. I can announce to my children that it's time to come up for dinner, I can operate lights throughout my home, I can see anyone who enters our long driveway and we can watch movie or listen to music while cooking with my kids. I have found the skills a bit annoying but I have also learned so much from Alexa displaying them. Some say there is a way to get rid of them but I haven't tried. I absolutely love that it displays my amazon photos. I have never walked into my kitchen and not smile! I can't wait to order more echos and light bulbs! I think the sizing is perfect, I did buy a swivel stand so it sits off the counter incase any of my 5 kids spills anything.",Skeptic turned to Fan

Clements,"Amazon Prime Video stopped working just ""conveniently"" after the return period. This was one of the major reasons we bought this. Have even reset back to factory defaults as well as ensured had the latest update and tried various things again and again to no avail.  Nothing works. One would think that an Amazon manufactured product could certainly play its own Amazon Prime videos as was initially advertised.  I do not recommend this echo show or the echo show 5 if you mainly want to play Amazon Prime videos.  They are both complete failures in that regard.  I did not call Amazon to troubleshoot as I doubt there is a solution other than Amazon pushing out an update.  Furthermore, I feel I should not have to call Amazon as their own videos should work on their own product. Not happy! Smh",Amazon Prime Video no longer works

I bought the first edition and thought it was great, but this one is soooo awesome. I bought one for my Mom, Sister, and neice and nephew, with kids. I can look at my 86 year old Mom, and talk to her face to face. She likes that Alexa, can call my Sister and I, should she need us. Also, because she lives alone, she can call out to, or tell Alexa to call 911, and it happens. It really gives me peace of mind, to know that she is not alone, even when she is!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,B. Arkin,"Ive tried all the echos that have a screen and the echo 8 is more impressive than i was expecting. The echo 5 is a great alarm clock replacement. The size allows it to fit well on a night stand and its handy for smart device control, podcast, video chat but its limited in what videos it can play and the sound isnt anything to write home about. The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it! You won’t regret it. I wish i had a need for another given the price.",Worth the extra money over the 5

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2019,Caleb K.,"So I’ll get the two flaws out of the way first. First is the same thing most people don’t like... the non stop “Ask Alexa...” prompts written across the bottom of the screen. There’s no way to turn them off. And they’re annoying and kinda tacky. Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it’s great. I’m apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say “Alexa show me the front door”. Kind of frustrating that it’s already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone’s at the door. Why can’t it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great. It’s the perfect side to be by my front door table. Super easy to set up. Just fix those 2 things!!",Almost perfect.

The larger 8 inch screen is great if you have poor eyesight and the sound quality is amazing for a device of this size. We started out placing an Echo in every room; now, we have Echo Shows in 3 of the 5. Amazon has done an excellent job continuing to update and add features to the Echo Show. And, what’s more, they play nicely with just about every product out there. I cannot say the same for the competition. We have a few of those devices as well. If you’re thinking about getting one of these, just do it! You won’t be disappointed.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Aug 2020,Lorraine,"I was looking for something that would allow family members to communicate with my 96 year-old father-in-law, especially during the pandemic.  The senior living facility where he stays had pretty much shut down once Covid-19 hit the States.  We could still talk with my father-in-law via cell phone, but due to his advanced age, it was getting harder and harder for him to remember how to correctly use a cell phone.  The senior living facility also allowed for Zoom calls, but we had to schedule those ahead of time. After doing some research, it seemed as though my options were pretty limited until I started looking more at the Amazon Show.  I was intrigued by their Drop In feature, which allows you to do a video call using the Show and a cell phone/tablet that has the Alexa app loaded onto it.  The nice thing about it is that the person who has the Show doesn't have to do a thing when they receive a call.  They just need to stand in front of the Show so that they can be seen.  The Show has a short time period (5 seconds or so) where the person originating the call is shown a fuzzy screen while the person with the Show hears a chime to let them know that someone is Dropping In.  This allows for the person to scoot out of the view of the Show if they are not presentable. I was a bit frustrated because there didn't seem to be much documentation on how to set up the Drop In feature.  I looked into e-books and scoured the internet for articles on exact steps for setting up the Drop In feature.  It all seemed pretty straight forward, but for some reason my setup didn't go that smoothly.  It took quite a few hours for me to figure out the settings I wanted on the Alexa app (ie: don't load all of my contacts from my phone onto my account) and how to add other family members to the Show setup so that they could Drop In on my father-in-law.  But, once everything was set up, it is working like a champ and multiple family members have  been able to clearly see and talk with my father-in-law using the Show. A few things to know about setting up the Drop In feature.  1)  You will need to connect the Show to a wireless network.  The facility that my father-in-law lives in has a wifi network.  My husband just happened to catch a window of opportunity where he could physically visit his dad one day this last June.  At that time, he set up the Show in my father-in-laws room (we used one of the wall mounts for the Show available on Amazon) and connected it to the wifi.  2)  We set our Show up so that each person who wants to Drop In on my father-in-law has the Amazon Alexa app downloaded onto their phone and is signed in with their own Amazon account.  3)  The Show is connected to my account, which I will call the Main Account.  You will need to go into whichever you designate as your Main Account, into the Communicate area for the Show that you have set up, and  allow permission for a given person (identified by their phone number) to Drop In onto the Show. Some family members were concerned about loading all of their phone contacts into the Alexa App.  Others were concerned about allowing the Alexa App to listen in for the 'Hey Alexa' key word.  Both of these features can be turned off in the user settings. We used the Show to Drop In on my father-in-law tonight.  It was comforting to see that he is still doing ok.  I felt much more connected with him than if I were talking on a phone.  This type of communication really came in handy when my father-in-law fell (during the pandemic when visitors aren't allowed) and the care facility staff were doing their assessment as to how he was doing.  During the assessment, my sister-in-law Dropped In and was able to see the staff in action.  The Drop In feature is definitely worth its weight in gold, especially when it comes to keeping tabs on the senior loved ones in our lives.",Excellent for connecting with my 96 year-old father-in-law during the pandemic

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Aug 2020,Joel L. Palmer,"Bought this item on sale because I read some of the reviews and it sounded like a solid buy for a travel entertainment system.  First. Let me say I would buy this again, but it cannot achieve better than 3 stars as-is.  If there are future firmware updates that allow for better functionality, then I will revisit this review. Pros: 1. Very gooD HD display.  Any of the shows I’ve watched have been crystal clear.  Same for the menu interfaces. 2. Touchscreen is responsive and works well with very few sluggishness. 3.  The sound is incredibly good compared to any of the Echo products that came before it.  In fact, I would compare the quality to Bose products.  It’s not as good as Bose, but it approaches it and it’s noticeable.  The bass reproduction is great!  Explains the weight of the product. 4.  Simple to use.  Minimal buttons and gadgets without sacrificing user interface.  The touchscreen helps a lot in that regard.  The manual slide switch to cover the camera lens is a good example; simple and 100% effective. 5.  The home screen is fully configurable. 6.  Aesthetics allow it to fit into almost any decor without standing out. Cons: 1. This is the other edge of the sword for sound quality: it’s weighty for its size.  I wouldn’t hog it for any portion of a star for this, however, because the trade-off is worth it.  Just worth mentioning if you’re going to use it as a portable entertainment center. 2.  Without a separate stand, the viewing angle is fixed. 3.  Here is the biggie and what cost this otherwise fantastic product one and a half stars: lack of app functionality.  The only video apps with which it interfaces are Prime Video (of course), Hulu, and YouTube (va FireFox).  The big streamer apps (NetFlix, HBO Max, STARZ, etc.) are absent and cannot be downloaded.  Further, while you can get to Google and FireFox browsers, going to the site and logging in doesn’t help.  Always prompts to download the app.  I don’t know if this is a limitation of the hardware and resident OS, streaming rights or competitor issues...or a combination of all.  I am inclined to believe it isn’t hardware or software related.  Fix this, and the rating is a solid 4.5. 4.  Lack of a travel case makes this product vulnerable to damage when traveling.  It’s a small ask and one that wouldn’t impact the price point more than 5%.",Should be a solid 4.5 rating
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2020,Kayla,"I purchased this for two reasons: a convenient way to display recipes that didn't require my phone being out, and streaming movies for when I'm in the kitchen for hours at a time. I rely heavily on streaming during the holiday seasons while I bake to fulfill orders, and while the video quality was good, and the sound was AMAZING, the rest of the device was too troublesome to be worth it. Example: Open amazon video, and it gives you 4 categories to go through, or your library. I go to my library (severe lag every single time) and I find the movie I want. I hit play, severe lag again, and it plays. Quality is not bad at all, especially for the price, but heaven forbid you have to pause. Once you pause for ~2-3 minutes, it goes to a screen saver. And when you unlock it, you have to go through the process of finding the movie all over again. It's a pain in the butt. They could at least have a ""continue watching..."" at the beginning of the prime menu, but it doesn't. Secondly, our household has 3 users on our hulu account--if there was a way to switch users through the Echo, I didn't see it. I googled it, thinking I was overlooking it, and nothing. We all have very different tastes for shows/movies, and never use each others accounts for this reason. To have not one, but two streaming services being out of the question/too inconvenient to use, I couldn't handle it. The integration was wonky at best. I have an echo dot that resides on a window sill about 3 feet from where I had my echo. My echo was off for voice recognition, but when I'd talk to my dot, it would display on my echo. This was cool except for two things: 1. It did it intermittently. 1 out of 3 times it would mirror to the echo. 2. if you were streaming something when the echo mirrored what the dot was telling you, guess what, YOU HAVE TO FIND THE MOVIE AGAIN. It was a nightmare. Maybe down the road they'll figure out a more user friendly programming for this, but until then I'm returning it. It was meant to be a gift for family, but if I, an electronic savvy 30-something, can't figure it out, I wouldn't be comfortable giving it to my grandparents, which was the end goal.",Not at all what I was hoping for

I have been developing Alexa Skills since 2018 and find it useful having the different models to test skills with. The Echo Show 8 is a good device that is basically sandwiched in between the Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 2. The audio is comparable to the Echo Show 2 and has very good bass. The camera security and colored emoji characters are comparable to the Echo Show 5 making the  Echo Show 8 basically a larger version of the Echo Show 5.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Feb 2020,Raoul Duke online shopper,"Update: Pros: When you set reminders they show up on the screen before to remind you they are coming and they stay on the screen for a short while after. This is a really nice feature. Cons: there is a basic sound mixer with bass, mid and treble to adjust the sound of the device. The only problem is the settings wont save so you have to reset them every day or every time you want to listen to music. This can be  a pain when you have several alexa devices and have to redo sound settings every time you want to play music on them all at once throughout the house. I purchased two echo show 8's when they had them on special. I an echo and an echo dot, but these were my first echo devices with screens so I wasnt sure what to expect. I mainly decided to try them due to amazing price they had that day. The size of the screen is not bad for a device. I just havent found too many uses for my echo show compared to my plain echo due to limited skill sets. Screen: the screen has nice a nice image for a device, colors are on the cool side.  It will show you the hourly weather which is nice. You can stream prime videos and when you play music it will display lyrics for some songs.  You can ask alexa to show you a map of traffic for your work commute,  but the map is zoomed out so far you cant tell which roads/route is highlighted. You are also unable to zoom in. If the map view was closer or you could zoom in this would be a great feature.  I have blink cameras and the echo show will bring up the live view from the cameras. The image looks good but the buffering time to bring up the image is a good 10-15 seconds similar to my firestick, so anyone at the door will likely be gone by then. It would be nice if they could get the buffering time down so it opens as fast as it does with the blink app on my phone. You can choose slide shows to play on the screen, for example I am using nature or you can create your own. You can go into settings and turn off the advertisements for websites and news which is nice.  However there is no way I have found yet to turn off the banner at the bottom of the screen advertising alexa skills with ""try this"" The clock is relegated to a tiny corner on the upper left with no way to make it bigger. it would be nice to be able to customize size and design of clock. Sound: The speakers are slightly bigger than the echo dot and in similar fashion the show 8 does not have dolby so the sound is more similar to an echo dot.  It doesnt sound bad on low, but any bass in the music cant be reproduced and ends up just muddling the sound. If you are used to echo dot, then you will be happy with the sound from the echo show. If you are used to regular echo or echo plus, you will find the sound quality to be less and lacking bass. Although to be fair, if you are streaming music then you not exactly an audiophile or overly concerned about sound quality anyway.  I currently have an echo show 8 in master bed and living room, an echo in kitchen and dot in basement. When playing music you can set it to stream out of all the devices at once. This is nice for when you are choring around the house, as you move from room to room the music follows. You are supposed to be able to do this reminders/alarms as well, but when I set reminders to play from ""everywhere"" it still only plays from the device I used to set it up? Camera: The echo show has a camera for face to face streaming through drop in feature. The camera is only 1 mp so the quality is pretty low. I was thinking I could use the drop in feature to use the echo show like a security camera and check in on my pets while at work. The natural tilt of the echo show without a stand directs the camera view to the ceiling. You can put it on a stand, but to get a decent view of the room through the camera the screen/echo show has to be basically vertical. Unless your echo show it at eye level, this makes using the screen awkward. So between the camera direction and low quality of image I cant really use it as a security camera to view rooms when away from home. The drop in is a nice feature to communicate with other family members or friends. Privacy features: the ""shutter"" switch to cover the camera is a great feature. Not only does it physically cover the camera but you can see that it is covered for reassurance. This is great so a friend or family member doesnt drop in while your walking around in your underwear. You can also push another button to turn off the camera and the microphones so amazon cant listen to you hatch your plans for world domination. As with other Amazon devices wireless connectivity is good, I have never had wifi connectivity issues with any of my amazon devices. Overall its not a bad device. The sound is subpar to my echo (but on par with an echo dot)and with limited skills and small screen size I dont really find uses for having a screened echo device. I can put one in my basement so I can pull up my blink front door camera when someone rings doorbell, but long buffering time means they might leave or it would be easier to just run upstairs and check the door. If the traffic maps were zoomed in so you could identify individual routes it would make that a great feature.  It could double as a security camera to drop in an check on inside house or pets if the camera was better quality and not aimed at the ceiling.  I got them at an amazing price, but at this point I am undecided if I will keep them. I might just trade them back in for another echo.",still undecided

It had stories that it offered to play--in Spanish--but couldn't play them.  I called and talked to somehow in December-shortly after getting the device and he said that feature wasn't available yet, so I was patient until last week--the middle of February--when I called again.  This person discovered that not only could it not play the stories in Spanish, but she had me change it to English and it couldn't do it in English either.  She said she'd call me back in a day or two with a solution.  A week later I realized that there hadn't been a call and probably never would be, so I called back and this time, Lance offered to send me a new device, which he did. In the meantime, after Janelle had had me update my current device, not only did it not play the videos, it took away one of my favorite features ""Explicame also en cincuenta segundos"" which is tell me something in 50 seconds.  My new device came today and it plays the stories from the screen (videos)--reluctantly-I have to touch the screen because it won't play it first time around from a voice command, even though it says it will, but it's an improvement. It still won't respond to ""Expicame also en cincuenta segundos.""  Is there any way of getting that back?  Also, they sent me a refurbished unit.  I don't feel well taken care of by Amazon Customer Service in some ways--especially considering that I've spent almost exactly five hours on the phone regarding this--much of it on hold. listening to the same, repetitive song over and over again and having to hear over and over again how important my call is. Why repeat that over and over?  I got it the first time and don't need to hear it again.  Also, isn't Amazon able to come up with a little more variety of music?--or offer ""no music"" the way Apple does? March 1st—I’m going to change to 5 ⭐️ if possible because now the device does play the advertised stories on the screen upon request and though it still no longer has the “ Explicame Algo....” feature, it has added new features to ask. Of course this device could be used in English which is a quick easy option change, I love so much the fact that Amazon has added the Spanish language as an option to the new echo devices.",Device didn't work as it was supposed to-but doing better now

I have a newly made smart home and this is a must for a smart home. I also have the fire cube which has Alexa built in and sometimes the conflict so I have turned off the Alexa functions on the cube by muting the mic. But I am a big fan of Alexa and all she can do. I haven't learned how to do video calls on it but I know its capable. It would be nice if Duo calls could come through on it. Anyway if you are tempted and have the extra cash to get one I highly recommend it.

Since it has other capabilities I gave it 5 stars. I’m new to using Alexa and personally I like it, it’s nice to ask a question and get answers rather than search on the internet myself. So my review will be broken down in certain sections based on what I use this for: The unit itself, Alexa, Amazon services like audible and Amazon prime features, and the video chat. The Echo unit: it’s maybe the size of a smaller tablet, a little awkward shaped and I will probably look for a stand for it. When video chatting we had to prop something behind it to tilt it downward because the screen kind of faces upward. The device has to always be plugged in so you can’t carry it room to room without unplugging and plugging it back in. It does need a WiFi connection so if you’re connection is slow it will affect live video, but didn’t seem to affect other content like playing movies, books, or music. Alexa: Again, it’s a very handy service. I have an iPhone and a Mac and I use Siri and I think Alexa answered given by Alexa whereas Siri says I found this for you on the web and forces you to read it yourself. Amazon services like audible and Amazon prime features: Unless there’s a way to do this and I just haven’t discovered it yet, I couldn’t find a way to actually view my audible titles or view Amazon Prime songs or movies. It seemed I had to know specifically the name of the title and then Alexa would play it. So that feature would be nice to have. But Alexa does well at pausing, turning the volume up and down, and playing media. We watched a movie from Amazon prime and although the screen is small, it was cool to watch in the kitchen. Lol I’ll move the unit to our bedroom at night and have Alexa play thunderstorm music or meditation music. Video chat: Since this was the primary reason we were going to use these units, it was disappointing. Mind you, it may have had to do with our own internet connection. We live in a rural area and sometimes our signal isn’t the greatest. But during a video chat it was like watching a movie where the words didn’t stay in sync with the lips. There was a lot of freezing in the video and obvious delay where it seemed like live satellite streaming, as if there is a maybe two second pause - for instance I say something and about two seconds later it will process it and send it. That might be normal but it’s just slower than FaceTime. Overall I feel it is worth the money. Hopefully Amazon will improve it’s capabilities in the future but right now it’s still pretty cool to use.",Could use improvement but still pretty handy
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Nov 2020,SierraPrimeShopper,"I bought this on prime day with the blink mini camera and absolutely love it. I will be replacing a couple of my Echo audio devices with the Echo Show 8. I use this one in my home office as I work from home. I have two blink mini cameras and it allows me to keep an eye on my dogs and my 14 year olds soon, who is doing remote schooling right now. I also ordered a blink outdoor 5 cameras system I am looking forward to using with this. The video display is excellent. I often listen to you tube podcasts during my work day and the quality is excellent. I have my Amazon prime photos displaying on it when it's otherwise not in use, and they look amazing, and it's super easy to see my blink mini cameras on it and the camera quality is also excellent. I will also be adding a ring doorbell to the system as well which hopefully will sync just as well as the blink cameras do. The audio on the echo show 8 is really good as well. It's a bit bassey but it sits directly on my oak desktop and I am not using the stand, which would elevate it a bit and probably help with that. I also have Amazon music HD and it sounds great on the echo show. Honestly it sounds better than on my 2nd gen echo device and it's plenty loud. One if the handy features I like is the privacy button directly on it. I can close the video camera shutter by sliding it over, and as I have no need for it right now it's always closed. And I can shut off the microphone sensor with the press of a button on the top. It shows a red bar on the bottom of the screen to signify that the mic sensor is muted. I have not used the built-in video camera yet, as I don't know anyone else who has an echo show to call, so really can't comment on that. I'll try it out when I order another echo show 8. I highly recommend this. I almost purchased the echo show 5 but day to navy complaints about the screen size and video quality and with the sales on the 8 right now it's an easy purchase choice, especially with the installment payment option.",Well worth the purchase and has excellent video and audio quality!

After setting it up, and that was pretty simple, I wish that I had bought it for the bedroom also, I love my Dot 3, but having a Show 8 or 5 would have been more fun.

I have it set up in our Family Room, sitting on you Man Chair I can check the scores of my favorite teams, I can check the weather, see what's happening at the front door, check our front yard, and the patio cameras.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2020,SDR,"All I wanted was to have a video doorbell and a display that would show when someone was at the door. So I bought a Ring Video Doorbell 3 and an Echo Show 8. Setup was more of a pain than I'd expected. I had to log into Amazon and Ring accounts multiple times to make this work, and enter passwords for both as well as for my Wi-Fi. I realize that I must enter at least the Wi-Fi and Amazon passwords once, but It seems to me Amazon could make this a lot easier. Why do I have to have both accounts? And why does Amazon insist on having so much of my personal information? I'm not happy about that at all. Now that I have both devices working and connected, I find that there are several things the Echo Show does that I'm disappointed with. -- you have to load the Alexa app on your phone to set this up and configure it. I really don't want the Alexa app on my phone; that's why I have the Echo Show. -- while you can turn off most of the alerts and notifications on the Echo Show if you want, you can't get rid of the ""try this"" on Alexa messages. They're tiresome. -- instructions for configuration on the support pages here aren't always clear and easy to follow. If you're looking for how to change certain display features, you have to sort through a lot of stuff that isn't what you're looking for. -- you have the choice of  various slide shows to display when the machine is idle. You can choose your own pictures, or nature shots, or travel photos, etc. But you can't choose more than one. All in all, it's an okay device, but it's flexibility and usability could be much improved. Edit: my original review said that the Echo Show 8 won't display day and date on the home screen. Just minutes after my review was posted, my Echo Show 8 got an update, and now it suddenly does display day and date!  Now, about 5 minutes later, it has reverted to time/temp only. So I don't know whether this has been fixed or not.","Okay, but not great"

I had a Show 5 that I really liked, but it was getting hard to see from a distance. I wasn't sure how much bigger the 8 would be from the 5, but to me... the size doubled...it's HUGE! Setup was simple and I linked my photos up so they could display in the background. Thanks to all the folks who commented on how to disable the ""discovery"", I did that. I wish that Amazon would have a site that we could send in suggestions or comments... I would have a few to put in (all constructive and respectful). For example, the clock feature and also to have a notification that a delivery is coming other than a one time tone. Anyway, I am happy with BOTH my Shows.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jul 2020,MikenzCO,"we started out years ago with the first echo and since have several generations of dots, echo plus, show 5 and this the 8"" show. as with its smaller cousin this unit works the same, does the same things. you can watch prime vids. you can use it as a clock. easy vid calls or even intercom within your home. you can manually block the camera if you don't want that aspect. if running a timer you'll not only hear it when its done but in the upper right corner of your home screen you'll see it counting down. if you ask it a question it'll not only give you an audible response but also pull up pertinent videos, information, etc. on screen for you to use. you can either tap on the screen or just stick to telling alexa what it is you want. you'll also get on screen weather, upcoming reminders, etc. fyi within the settings you can have it show you more or less depending on your personal preferences. settings can be accessed from the touch screen or using the alexa app. ours is set to auto dim. as evening approaches the screen dims and then when the lights are out it will go dark except for the on screen clock. you can however set it to go totally dark it comes down to your preferences. the audio quality is about on par with the echo plus. obviously not near the bass response but still a lot better than i had expected. it also has a 3.5mm audio jack at the rear which is nice to have. you can ask it to 'show' you just about anything. ask it what is an olde english bulldog and you'll get the audio response and imagery on screen. if you want more information just tap on one of those images or ask. we have both the show5 and this model. if you plan to watch vids frequently i definately would go with this size and not the smaller. related the screen resolution on this size is much better than the smaller show5. everything you need to get going is in the box. setup has somehow been made simpler than in other amazon devices. personally i do not see how they could have made getting started any easier. it really does walk you through each and every step with most of those being entirely automated. the two things i don't like about the device are listening and cam time out.  as to the listening to begin with i had frequent issues getting it to hear what i say correctly. the speed and how i speak where the other units do just fine this one misses words, gets the wrong ones or just sits there silent requiring multiple tries to acknowledge it heard 'alexa.' i have no accent to speak of. my speech sounds much like that you get from tv newscasters if that makes sense in regards to no accent. so i do not understand why the microphones have such a hard time hearing me compared to the others? so now i've learned to slow down my speaking and enunciate words as clearly as i can. when i do that problems listening are rare. the only other gripe has to do with the main reason i purchased this, for our Wyze Cams. once the Wyze app is enabled you can just say for example, ""alexa show me the front door."" it loads and then you are streaming to your echo with both video and audio. the image looks great but the gripe comes down to the built in 'time-out.' the video stream will only hold for a few minutes then it reverts back to the home screen. i hope this fix this soon, it should just be a coding issue. overall having the additional abilities the other echo units do not have. the combination of both audible and visual information. it is just a great design and even with the mic's not picking up as well as our other devices i'd still purchase it again. all said i would recommend this to most but due to the microphones for some it could be problematic. at least when you say something you also can see what it heard you on screen. otherwise i'd say this is a really good device and if considering say a regular echo unit or even a dot i would seriously consider this or its smaller cousin the 5"" model instead.","Very nice but with a few minor,.."

I am pleased with the quality of video and sound from the the  8 inch show.  I purchased the Show 8 with an Arlo doorbell for my elderly mother who  has trouble answering the door.  Alexa has provided my mother with easy access to news, music and  entertainment and is the main reason I decided to keep the system despite falling to meet purchasing expectations  as a doorbell system.  Where the Show 8 falls short is the integration with an Arlo doorbell.  In order to work with the Show 8 the Arlo video resolution must be lowered to the medium setting.  The HD video from the Arlo is not supported by the Show 8 and results in no video displayed  unless the Arlo door bell resolution is reduced.  There is a significan latency (delay) 20-30 seconds to connect to my Google Pixel 3 then 3-5 seconds delay in communication  after connection.  Latency with the Arlo to the Show 8 is a bit better  taking about 10 to 12 seconds to connect.  ( Wi-Fi router is between 15 to 20 feet from Arlo and Show8 )  Cannot configure the doorbell to just chime to the Show and must use the existing door bell buzzer. Arlo integration cannot not be set up to automatically open Arol app and show who's at the door.  User must instruct Alexa to ""Show 'MyDoor'"".  Arlo doorbell videos must be manually deleted  otherwise camera operation (including live view) will stop without warning because memory is full.  Therfore Operation of Arlo door bell with Show 8 is not elderly friendly  and requires frequent home IT support to keep functional.",Poor integration with Arlo door bell.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2020,Daddio Dave,"We've had a Ring doorbell for many years now. We started with the standard Ring doorbell and then upgraded to two of the Ring Doorbell Pros. The main drawback to using the Ring to answer your door is having a phone or tablet available and then opening the Ring app to be able to answer the door. This turned out to be inconvenient, so we rarely used this feature. Now that Amazon has purchased Ring and made the Echo Show work seamlessly with the Ring, the situation has changed for the better. Since we've purchased a Show 8, a person ringing our Doorbell Pro will now be spontaneously displayed on the Show. My only complaint is that the image shows for only about 15 seconds before reverting back to the background display. It would be nice if this stayed on longer (like 30 or 60 seconds). Of course it's relatively easy to ask Alexa to show the front door, which will bring the image back up (and keep it up indefinitely).  Basically, if you use a Ring doorbell, you need an Echo Show to make the system work well for answering the door when at home, and it does work well. Otherwise, I find the Echo Show 8 to be a very nice device. The music sound quality is fantastic, better than our other Echos. The image quality on the screen is also great. We use the Show as a digital picture frame with it playing our Amazon photos. These pictures look nicer than photos shown on our Google Home Hub, which sits next to the Show 8 (although the Home Hub is definitely satisfactory in this regard). We still haven't tried out all the other things that the Show 8 can do. Maybe some day :-)",Works great with the Ring doorbell

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Feb 2020,Anonymouse,"Alexa has basically ruined an otherwise decent piece of hardware. Here's the example that convinced me to write this review: >> Echo, play my audiobook. > <audiobook plays> >> Echo, pause. > <audiobook pauses> >> Echo, play. > What do you want me to play?"" >> ...? My Audiobook? > Can't find songs by Audiobook. >> ... Another? Alexa: >>Echo, Avid BB7 brakepad replacement > I couldn't find a list called ""B. P. 7."" Should I create one? >> ...no. ...? > Okay. >> ...Echo, search for videos about Avid BB7 brakepad replacement. > Here's what I found. > <displays completely irrelevant Bing search results about Volkswagen brake jobs> All of that nonsense compared to Google: >> Ok Google, Avid BB7 brakepad replacement > <immediately brings up a videos on Youtube of the process> That's the typical level of performance you can expect from Alexa. It's been driving me crazy since I bought this thing. Anyone accustomed to the Google assistant is going to be sorely disappointed. More general issues that constantly recur; * Alexa has awful keyword recognition for the news stories that Echo is always shoving down your throat. If you don't say the /exact phrase/ at the bottom of the note (""Alexa, play the ... story""), you're out of luck. Even a concise reference to the story based on the content of the title/tagline regularly puzzles it. * Alexa does not consistently interpret common requests. My request ""Play NPR news"" seems to bounce randomly between playing a singular daily podcast, and running an ""app"" (or something?) that plays a constant stream of stories and ads. I haven't figured out what's going on there yet. * Alexa, recently, has decided that I need to hear news from every single provider every morning. When I say ""Echo, play BBC news"", she will play the ~10 minute podcast. Cool.  But, then she declares ""Playing new from other providers"", and it just keeps going! Who wants that? Why would that be the default behavior? Why can't it be turned off? Now I need to tell her to shut up every morning after the end of the BBC podcast, which is the only one I care about. * When playing an audiobook, the display randomly bounces between the audiobook progress bar, and the random spam that's usually littering the display. * You can tell Alexa to turn the screen off. But you can't convince her to keep it off. * Did I mention how bad Alexa is at interpreting things? That's still the biggest issue. But, at least I can turn off my living room lights without getting off the couch. Well, as long as I'm careful to specify my ""living room"" lights. Alexa will have an aneurysm otherwise...even though they're the *ONLY* lights I have set up in the Alexa app. I just can't get over how behind Amazon is compared to Google (and I assume Apple) in voice assistant tech.","Alexa is a frustratingly bad voice assistant, and the display is sadly misused."

It works less than half the time which is frustrating. 2) When Alexa does understand my request, it takes about 5 seconds to actually pull the image up, while I'm just staring at it waiting to see if my kid is awake. My solution? I can pull it up on my phone reliably every time in less than 5 seconds.. 3) I have to tell the screen to turn off every night. I don't really use it at al anymore, so I don't understand why I keep having to tell it to turn off the screen when I'm never telling it to turn on the screen. Plus it keeps asking me which device (I only have 1 device with a screen), and when I say turn off screen on Echo Show, it takes multiple attempts before Alexa finally understands what I'm asking for. So all in all rather frustrating. And for reference, I speak perfect English, natively, with no regional accent.

I use this in our master bedroom for typical Alexa stuff (controlling lights/lamps in our room, playing music, weather checks, “show me the front door” with Ring doorbell, news updates, so on). I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you’re considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It’s not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It’s a good in-between option and I’m thrilled Amazon launched this version. I was also thrilled to use Amazon’s trade-in platform to send in my original Echo Show and apply the gift card and discount toward the 8.",Great in-between option

I am even listening to my Kindles on my Echo Show, instead of reading them. There is no text on the screen so I can sit back with eyes closed and sip on my scotch relaxing. Yes, you can do this on the Kindle too, but the sound is better and I believe more natural too. When I switch my “reading” from the Echo Show to my Kindle, or vice versa, the other product picks up the story where the other ended. It even goes back a page to help you remember the story during the pause in reading. The Echo Show even has the lyrics to some of the songs scrolling down the screen when the music is played. Simple commands like, “Alexa, what are my orders” show me the products I ordered in vivid color. I can keep on forever, but now the problem. It doesn’t work very well with my Ring door bell. I am certain I have it properly linked with the Echo show. My Alexa app on my cell phone shows it is linked, but I can’t get it to announce, “There is motion at your front door.” Nothing happens if someone rings the door or is outside. I only hear this on my other Echos and my cell phone. I can say, “Alexa, show me my front door and it will 75 % of the time show me a live view of the door and the person outside, but there is a lag and often the person is gone or is out of view. When I ask what the weather is, it will also display graphs of forthcoming temperature as well as indicators of wind, rain, etc. Much more comfortable have the sense of sight as well as hearing to grasp all this information. I feel I can live with this problem of not announcing motion at my front door. I still have my other gadgets doing this.","One issue, but still 5 stars."

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Aug 2020,JeanMarie,"This is my second Echo Show I had previously purchased a 1st GEN Echo Show for my home office. It did run into a screen pixelation issue about 10 or 11 months after purchasing, but Amazon repaired it free of charge and it has been going strong ever since. So when I saw the newest generation of the 8 inch echo show on sale I decided to give it a try. So far it has been great. I was able to set it up in under 1 minute. I really like the way the screen goes completely dark when you turn out the lights. Besides all the capabilities you would expect from an Echo, you also have the ability to display your photos, watch videos and movies, monitor & check home security cameras (e.g., RING, Arlo, Blink are ones I can confirm), check on loved ones, etc. I personally think the Echo Show 8 makes is a great bedroom companion, not so much for its ability to watch movies and TV, but it's great for checking security devices, time and weather, listening to music, a book or a podcast or other non-intrusive activities while lying in bed, getting ready for bed or getting up for the day. The 8 inch size is not too big nor too small for the bedroom. You can use this in conjunction with cameras to easily monitor your small or sick children (or parent or other loved ones) during the night wherever they might be. I find it great and easy to use to checkin and communicate with my aging parents. Both the video and sound quality are surprisingly good. While not videophile or audiophile quality, it’s extremely good and surprising for a compact device and price point. As for the size, the 8 inch screen works great for me. I am not sure that I would use it as a replacement for a larger screen TV. However, for what it does and for those spots where you want video capability without the size and potential headaches associated with placing a TV or larger monitoring device this is the way to go, So far, I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend. It frequently goes on sale since Amazon wants to be the dominate smart home assistant provider, so buy one then if you think the Show 8 meets your needs and wants.",Great Product - One of Amazon's best in my opinion

I use it primarily to pull up recipes, listen to music and turn on/off a variety of lights/devices in our home which are on smart plugs. I've had it for a little less than a month and am by no means familiar with all of it's capabilities. For online recipes it's terrific. I can ask it to find a recipe for X on website Y (or just look across the web), and it'll display all the relevant recipes. I can scroll through them, then pick one to see the details. It even links the ingredients to the shopping list in the Alexa app. When using a recipe, the display stays open and you can easily scroll through the different steps. It sits at an angle which makes it easy to read ( I didn't get a stand). Much better than using my tablet, which times out after a few minutes, so I have to keep logging in. For music, it visually displays all the available playlists, which I can scroll through and pick one. It displays the current song and performer. So much easier than using an Echo Dot.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,TJM,"First,for the one glaring annoyance everyone seems to comment on: Older reviews claim you can get rid of the banner at the bottom of the screen that recommends various Alexa Skills to try.  That may have been possible at one time; it no longer is.  The one review often pointed to which provides instructions is not current - it describes Settings menus that do not exist as of the date of this review. I have found that turning off everything under “Home Content” reduces the frequency of - but does not eliminate - the banner.  Also, the banner appears while certain Skills are running (such as playing music). It’s a mild annoyance. Beyond that, I’m enjoying my Echo show. I purchased it primarily so that I could view the live video feed from my Ring Doorbell. I also enjoy using it to display photos using my free 5Gb of Amazon Photos storage (and photo file sizes can be reduced before uploading since the Echo Show display is limited, which means you can upload a LOT of photos. I have used it to play music via Bluetooth and SiriusXM.  Sound quality is decent for a little box. I need to buy a tilt stand for the Echo Show.  It sits with the screen angled slightly upward, which might be fine if it sits beside you on a desk or counter. We have ours on a bookshelf, and would prefer for the screen to point straight forward.",Cannot Turn Off “Try Alexa Skills ...” Banner Despite What Other Reviewers Claim
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2020,R. Richardson,"I got this to integrate with my Eufy wi-fi front door camera. I have it in my family room. I installed the Eufy Skill which integrates with my Eufy Camera app and Alexa. Now, if I get a notice that someone is at my front door, I just say, ""Alexa show front door"" and within a few seconds I can see the front door and who is there. I read some complaints about the delay in showing the front door... with any wi-fi camera, there will be a slight delay. In my case, the Eufy camera has about a 3-second delay and the Show has about a 3-5 second delay connecting with the camera. So maybe a 5-10 second delay total for me. The sound quality is quite good for a rather small device (I have the 8"" Alexa Show). Screen size is perfect for me - not too big or small. I have it connected to my Amazon photos to play slideshow. I disabled the ads in the settings - just say ""Alexa show settings"" to get to settings. I will eventually disable the Alexa hints that show at the bottom of the screen. For now, it is interesting things you can ask Alexa to do. The clock is a nice feature - shows time in upper left corner. When it is dark, the screen goes dark and shows time larger in the lower-left corner. When watching TV with lights off, the screen dims but still plays slideshow. Occasionally, I will say, ""Alexa turn off-screen"" and then I get a dark blank screen (no clock). I'm not sure if there is a way to just show a dark screen and clock - no slides. I still have my Alexa Echo Mini in the same room - on the other side of the room. When I ask a question it depends which I am closer to for receiving an answer (or playing music). So far, I am very happy with it. I have the camera blocked with the sliding shutter for privacy. I may get my father one so we can talk via Show and see each other - hands-free talking. Maybe next time there is a sale.","""Alexa, show Front Door"" - works great with my camera."
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Aug 2020,Arnaud T.,"I got this device with the sole intent to display my pictures stored on Amazon Drive, and it is a very disappointing experience. * The setup was not very straight forward. Clearly displaying pictures is a side option, not the main point of this device. * Pictures are displayed in the inverted order they have been stored online (most recent ones 1st). There is no shuffling/randomization option. I have over 50,000 pictures so that was a BIG disappointment as I would have loved to be ""surprised"" by which picture comes next. * Picture displaying speed never changed despite changing the settings on the device. * The device got stuck on 1 picture after ~1 week of use. Once I restarted it no pictures were displayed at all, despite still being connected to my amazon account. Clearly some low quality programming here. * I couldn't get rid of the AI interface even if I will never use it. The best I could do is turn off the camera and microphone. But I get a very visible red band at the bottom of the screen and occasional written messages on the screen to ""entice"" me to use the AI (""Have you tried saying ...""). * This is very surprising, knowing that competitor devices have been able to display pictures for years very well. Very much feels like getting a flip phone when you ordered a smartphone. * I couldn't find another device to display my pictures stored on Amazon drive. This is making me consider moving them back to another cloud provider.",Highly disappointing to showcase pictures
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jun 2020,JC,"June 2020 – I have had my Echo Show 8 for around a week now.  Overall I am pleased with it. The screen is clear and sharp and the speakers are solid with no distortion. It is easy to set up and use especially if you already have an Echo device. Positives: Picture Frame – clear and easy to use.  The source is your Amazon Photos and it is extremely easy to change the albums you want to view. Lists – your various lists are shown nicely whether it be your shopping list and your to-dos. I have a number of lists I set up and it nice to be able to see them. Calendar – again shows nicely on the screen and you have the ability to scroll down or pick out a specific date with a voice command. Music – works nicely with Sirius XM and Amazon Music ( the latter giving the extra bonus of seeing the lyrics.} Video Calls – I tested it and it works but with so many other options I don’t think I will be using this feature very much. Video Streaming – here again, I tested it and it works very well with Prime Video but again I don’t believe I will be using it to watch shows. Negatives: Personal Videos – If you have taken a video of a child’s concert or school play and stored it on Amazon Photos, it will show the video but not include the audio.  To me, this is a major short coming and disappointment. There is a work around by opening Google “ Open Google” and going to your Amazon Photo account but this is awkward and time consuming.  You should be able to ask Echo to show you the specific album and watch and listen to the video. Customized Q&As on Amazon Blueprint will not show on the screen. They will be read like any other Echo Device but not shown. This, too, is a disappointment. Recipes – I have not found any echo skill which can accommodate these.  I was hoping the Customized Q&As could but not useful without seeing it on the screen. Recap – Pleased with the Show but it fell short of my expectations as mentioned in the negatives. Therefore, could not give it a 5 rating but still pleased with it …. So I gave it a 4.",Good but with short comings
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jul 2020,colleywog,"I got this because it said how well it went with Ring.  I put it in our bedroom in the event there was motion detected at night, i could easily take a quick look at the activity without having to find my glasses for my phone.  Well, it integrates with Ring, but do not expect to get anything more than a verbal  notification  as it will not connect with Ring's camera.  So, pretty much useless to me.  It does work and show other cameras i have, so maybe i need to put them next to the Ring's...  seems sad to think about. As a side note, The Alexa app, echo's and this show has failed me in many connections from August door lock to the current Ring issues.  I don't see the value that others see in these items. Update:  after fiddling for weeks to try and get a ring camera picture to no avail, I have finally gotten it. I do not know how. Amazon Support called and left message yesterday. Today I went to look at the echo to be better able to explain the issue (I am assuming that is why they called) and one camera was showing on the screen.  Now about a week ago one camera went through an activation and I thought perhaps a firmware update as I have had no problems with the Ring doorbell camera itself  Once I saw that camera working I manually did another camera activate This morning and lo and behold, the picture showed up on the echo show!  I have given it 4 stars now over the 2 I had and will accept that it is working as it should.  If only my August lock would work now....",It’s OK
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2020,Mary Kate,"OMG!  This is one of the greatest inventions!  My husband and I love it.  We have first had one Alexa Echo that I adopted in the family room which doubles as my sewing room and it has a kick-ass speaker so I could blare my Amazon music when nobody was around.  It alerts me that my packages have arrived, tells me the latest headline news, plays jeopardy with me, and after I installed the Ring Video Doorbell, Alexa tells me when someone is at the door and it also plays the doorbell chime I picked out and many, many other things.  Then I decided to get the Show and I set it up next to my husband's side of the bed.  He thinks he is so funny because he tries to ""drop-in"" on me but Alexa alerts me to this so he's not as sneaky as he thinks.  Then like a child, he asked Alexa to fart and holy cow!  He is just like a child laughing hysterically when Alexa farts.  So my husband adopted the show and loves asking Alexa to show him who is at the front door.  He set it up so his FB pictures shuffle on the screen and he really enjoys that.  There is an unlimited amount of skills that can be enabled that I don't think we will ever know them all. It's a great product that I recommend for every household.  Just buy it and you will be surprised at everything it can do and SHOW you!",We Love our Alexa Show

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jun 2020,amazoncustomermj,"I just now set up my new Echo Show 8. Took less than 5 minutes as I already have account. Nice big horizontal screen. I got this to replace/augment the Echo Spot, that resembles a round clock. I had that for 1 1/2 years, & it started jumping on screen lately & talking outloud to me when I didn't ask it to (room was quiet). I put that in living room where I practice guitar to jam along with it or to help me remember tune of song I'm learning. This 8"" rectangular Echo Show is lovely & the screen background constantly changes; Go to Settings, & pick the ""Wallpaper"" or background you want. There are 2 speakers, 1 on each side of the ""Show"" which helps the music really Rock, plus words come up for most part, which is cool. The only thing so far I don't care for, is the tone to Alexa's voice is very BASSY. I picked it up & held in my hands to see if it sounded better, but it doesn't. There is no knob to reduce bass or increase treble. Perhaps after a few days, it will straighten out. It has a nice big digital display of the date, time & temperature which I can see from bed better than with the ""Spot"", but I miss the Clock feature with the second hand, as I need to take my pulse for 15 seconds daily. I'll just set the timer. You can change sound of the alarm in clock in settings, & you can add your pictures from your cell phone or from Amazon Photos, if applicable, as well as several other things. Came with a little directions booklet. Anything you don't know how to use, just ask Alexa, or go to Support on your tablet or cell,etc. I'm so glad I got this. The price was reasonable & better than most retail prices I've seen.","Beautiful, but a Bit Bassy"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2020,Gregory F.,"I've got several Echo devices...this is the first time I've had one with a video screen.  I received it as a Christmas present, along with a new generation Dot.  First, the Dot is VASTLY improved over previous versions.  The first Dots I had were pretty much useless without connecting them to a ""real"" speaker...the sound quality of the original Dots was pretty primitive.  However, this new Dot isn't bad at all!  I put it in my workshop and it's great for that application.  As for the Show, I really haven't used the video screen for much except for monitoring my Ring cameras, which works great.  The sound quality is better than the various other Echos I own (larger/stereo speakers).  I work from home and have the Show on my desk.  It's nice to be able to monitor my cameras for deliveries and so forth...and I pretty much listen to talk radio or music all day while I'm working.  Others have complained that constant content on the screen is annoying...and that there's no way to stop it.  It doesn't bother me...I don't sit around staring at it.  But I've found that you can tell Alexa to turn off the screen and it goes blank, without affecting what you're listening to.  I think you can also make it display your pictures in a slide show?  Anyway, like I said the screen content doesn't bother me, personally.  All in all, I'm very pleased with both devices.",My Echo Family Has Grown
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2020,daalisia,"I've purchased three of these so far, and will probably purchase more when the price-point drops again.  I gave one each to my mother and my mother-in-law, and kept one for use in my office.  I also have a full-size second generation echo show, two echos, and several echo dots, in almost every room of our house.  They are great for video/audio calls to grandparents/grandkids, for making announcements throughout the house, using as an intercom system, and working as a whole-house stereo system when you are home alone.  I tried the echo show 5 before, but was greatly disappointed at the quality of the speakers - they were tinny, and the microphones didn't work well either. At first, I thought it was just a defective one and sent it back for a replacement, but the replacement did the same thing, so it must've just been the design.  So, I was hesitant when I first ordered the echo show 8, but when I heard the superior sound quality over the previous echo show 5, I was so pleased that I ordered the other two for gifts.  Our kids and our mothers are all happy that they can easily make video calls to each other just by voice command.  I highly recommend integrating the echo dots into your household as well.  Our mothers have them (echo show and many echo dots) throughout their homes too, and it gives us all peace of mind knowing that if something happens and they find themselves in distress when home alone, they just have to speak loud enough for Alexa to hear them and help is on the way.

I have 5 dots and even a Show 5 and all do fairly well with voice recognition from around the room.  The Show 5 is not as good as the Echo or dots but still far better than the new Show 8.

The screen is the right size - not too small and not huge taking up too much space.  The display opens a world of options - from recipes to games to current events.  Some don't like the constant suggestions, but to each his/her own.  I like discovering new things and this is a nice way to stay informed.  The video capability is nice - my wife had to have one since I got one :-) and we can video chat when she's upstairs working and I'm in the basement working.  The audio quality is very good, tonal quality is not too thin and not too bass heavy.  Even comes with a built-in camera cover so you can close and disable video until you want to be seen.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2020,alex smith,"Love the idea. Bought this so I could video chat with my aging mother out of state. It was simple enough to set up, except when it comes to doing what it is supposed to do, you are on your own to figure it out!  First thing, DO NOT IMPORT YOUR CONTACTS!!! You cannot delete them if something changes, like a divorce or breakup. All you can do is block them!! Next, sometimes it will call my cell phone, other times it calls my echo dot. It asks you which way you want to call the persons phone. If you want a normal voice call, it works fine. If you want the owner of the echo show to video call you, again sometimes it goes through Amazon and other times it doesn't!  To make a video call, you are supposed to tell it to ""call using amazon devices""  Well, when we tried this, it called my echo dot in Atlanta, while I was standing in my mom's house in Arkansas! Then we tried the same thing again, and my iphone rang like it was supposed to! The when we tried calling my wife's iphone, it asked about calling her phone, or Amazon devices, we chose devices, so..... it called the echo dot! When we say ""call phone"" it is just a dark screen, but we can hear her talk!! There are ZERO instructions and most videos we tried to find were absolutely no help!","Make sure you have a lot of time to figure this thing out, you will need it"

So, it was a no brainer for me to purchase the Echo Show 8. It was especially a treat to find out I could trade in my first gen Show. I am one who keeps the original box and takes good care of my devices. I returned my first-gen Show in the original box, by the way, it was working when I unplugged it and put it in the box. I was expecting to receive $30 for the trade-in and received $5 because the item was not working. To my surprise, that was the response I received.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2020,mommyroy,"I am not sure how many people sit and stare at the ECHO in their home.  That is the only way the suggestion would bother you.  I have one in the living room and one in the kitchen.  I can turn my lights off and on, my kids call from school (which is awesome) and I can watch my front door (Using a Blink camera). If I don't need it, I am not looking at it, and unlike Google home, it doesn't just speak randomly.  Alexa could use some updates on slang and search results (has trouble with historical references we ask during movies) but other than that, it works great.  We have Echo Dots in every room so we can give our kids wake up calls and remind them of lights out.  Its fun and does what we need it to do. The set up time for Blink/Cell phones/Dots all took less than 2 minutes.  Power plugs take a little longer (10 min) and require a separate app (which is a pain in the beginning) but once set up, you never have to do anything again. Loosing power does not require new set ups or passwords to be entered. I now choose smart home extras based on whether or not they are ECHO compatible.  Stay away from the cheap import knock offs.  Spend the extra money and buy ones Alexa is already set up to be compatible to.  Worth the money.",Love the Echo 8 that I bought another for me & one for my sister
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jan 2020,Nicole A.,"The pictures show how simple set up is. The screen and images are beautiful and stunning! (Sorry my pics are kinda blah but I have a disability that causes me to shake so this was the best I could do. Believe me they don’t do the device justice! The display is gorgeous, crystal clear and definitely HD!) Ok, so now for my review...I finally got my first Amazon Echo Show 5 with Alexa for Christmas. I am kicking myself for not getting one earlier! I have fallen in love with these devices and their many capabilities so much that I Immediately bought a dot, 2 Echo Show 5’s an Echo Show 8 and the new Echo Show 8HD plus stands! I am LOVING  all the things Amazon’s Echo Shows do. If you don’t have one and you’re on the fence here is the breakdown, pros and cons: Breakdown: super SUPER easy to use. Plug in the power cord and follow the on screen steps to set up your device to your liking. There are multiple clock faces to choose from, sounds for alerts and you can pick a background or use your photos from Amazon’s photo app. (I also was new to that app and Alexa. Both were super easy to use! My pictures synced faster than any other photo cloud storing app hands down. Plus as a bonus you don’t need to pay for storage. There’s no limit and zero fees!!) Once you’ve set up the Alexa app (I recommend the  Smart Life app that’s compatible with smart devices/plugs and Apple Watch!) you just ask Alexa what you need and boom, it’s done! I asked her to calm down my dog and she put on music! I am amazed. You can make shopping lists (No more searching for a pen and paper in my kitchen), Ask for recipes, play videos, surf the Internet, find out the weather, watch your photo albums, make phone calls to anyone who has the same type of device (like most of the world does by now). It’s seamless and I even had my 8 year old set one up because it was so easy. I love the parental control platform it allows for too! Pros: Super easy to set up Beautiful looking with or without the swivel base Amazing picture Great compatibility with phones, smart plugs, Works perfectly with smart devices and apps Better than FaceTime for video calls Loud speakers with excellent sound quality Alexa, Alexa, Alexa! Alexa’s voice recognition is so much better than Siri! Siri can’t understand a thing I say (I don’t even have an accent). If I ask Siri for the weather it gives me traffic. Super frustrating. I think that’s why I was hesitant at getting one of these. Man I wish I knew how much better Alexa is! Everything I ask is instantly understood and taken care of!! Music, calls, drop ins, weather...anything! The value for the price is unbeatable Everything about this device is a Pro!! Cons: It’s constantly listening. But honestly, I don’t worry about that. I’m sure the government listens in and sees things just through WiFi, the Nelson rating TV system, Arbitron ratings in your radios, computer cameras and cellular/mobile devices. This isn’t the only thing out there and really it’s so worth it for everything you can use it for. Besides, anyone that paranoid about what they’re saying is probably on The Hunt with John Walsh. LOL The final analysis: BUY THESE DEVICES!! Get them for each room. Enjoy the capability to make your day to day life easier and more fun! Play music, dance and sing and be silly. Display your photos, try a new recipe and make sure that your prepared for rain, snow or heat. The Echo devices are like having a personal assistant that’s holding a computer screen. So enjoy your new found “tech” if you don’t already have any and you’ll be amazed like me at what these devices can do!",I LOVE LOVE LOVE MY AMAZON ECHO SHOW 8HD!!

I’m new to this thing so I’m sure it takes fine to learn and get used to but as of right now, my ONLY complaint is when you ask Alexa to say play music while you have a recipe up and in the middle of cooking, the recipe completely disappears. I’m assuming you have to ask Alexa to play music over the recipe. Idk but i was in a sheer panic that i wouldn’t be able to find the same recipe. Other than that, this thing is great.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jun 2020,Elswiki,"We have too many of these echoes installed and now we are running out of wakeup word. Echo show 8 was way bigger than I expected and more than 2 times bigger than echo show 5. I was expecting to have a higher resolution so I can see more stuff without scrolling especially for the smart home devices, but it seems like just shows things bigger than what you see on echo show 5. Also, it doesn't seem to go to sleep when it's even dark, I constantly turn off the screen when we don't use it but it tends to kick itself on just by any motion. It's always useful to have this one nearby and I hope Amazon keeps improving on the interface and usability. The internet speed in our house is too slow to pull up the ring video on time but it's neat to see who's at the door by the voice command and the calendar interaction with Google calendar is also pretty convinient. There's are a ton of stuff you can do and save your time with the automation and sometimes Alexa reminds me to lock the door when it's not locked before going to bad. I switched over to echo show from Google home because of the ring video doorbell compatibility but echo show doesn't automatically shows the camera even when the doorbell is pressed unlike the Samsung smart refrigerator.

I did purchase the magnetic base which makes it easier to adjust the angle for better viewing on occasion. This has been integrated into our system and works well with our 3 Blink XT2 outdoor cameras, Simplisafe security, Aladdin garage door opener and August door lock. We moved our little Echo Dot another part of the house, and it’s easy to make “intercom “ calls between it and the Show 8. I haven’t tried making video calls with it yet, but it does have a switch on the upper right hand corner that allows you to put a shutter over the integrated camera for those times you don’t want to transmit video The default ads and pop-ups can be a bit annoying, but with a bit of research you can get rid of those. Sound quality is excellent, and the display is crisp. It was easy to export photos from my iPhone to use as wallpaper backgrounds. All in all, a well-built unit... make sure you take time to learn the features and do some research, as it really doesn’t come with any documentation telling a new user how to get started on anything more than very basic tasks.",Solid
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2020,Caroline Haley,"PROS: • Great sound, especially coming from a basic Echo Dot. The bass is much deeper, and the sound is rich and deep. • Alexa works as well as the original Dot. • The screen is nice for recipes, etc. It's also a touchscreen so that's fun. CONS: • You kinda really need the base for this, which is an additional $25 (seriously?). The Show is HEAVY and it sits, naturally, tilted back so the screen faces up more or less. So when doing a video call, I had to prop a 1"" chunk of wood under the backside to tilt it down enough for my kiddo to even see the screen when it was set on a kitchen counter. •  Video calls only work if the other person has the Alexa app. So to make a call to the grandparents, which I thought would be easy for my 7yo, I have to alert my parents they will have an incoming call via the app (ON their phone, but only via the Alexa app). The best scenario is to communicate Echo Show-to-Echo Show (so I guess I'm buying one for them too–way to upsell me Amazon!). But this also means it's not portable (like a phone) and the placement/viewing issue (above) is still a problem. • The buttons on the top are very small and hard to see. It would have been nice to have different colors for volume up/down. Since there are 3 buttons, I never remember which two go with volume. The other one is for blocking voice activation. I'm constantly pushing all of them randomly trying to turn the volume up/down.","Cool new product, 3 issues:"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,NVanPutt,"After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution. When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool."" Then he started tweaking the settings and the home screen and added a background photo. It was all very easy. I use Amazon Photo storage as a backup tool for all of my family photographs. There are currently around 20,000 photos that are thankfully loosely organized into albums. I spent a good 4 hours creating a new 250 photo Echo Show album and then because my husband is a family vault member and can see all of my photos he can add photos to the album. The slideshow feature is really his favorite part of the whole Show. He loves the music, he loves Alexa, but he really loves having photos on his desk. The Echo Show's first week in his office was a success and when his boss stopped by his office, she loved the Show so much she ordered her own. My husband is able to listen and sing along to his music and see his family. We ordered a Show for our kitchen and my parents ordered one for their kitchen so we can easily make video calls between all of us during the day. Now if anyone can tell me what to do with all of these Dots, I would really appreciate it.",Music and Photos With Built in Video - What's Not to Love

I picked up the Show because it was BOGO and, well, I was curious. The Show 8"" joins two generations of Dots and the OG Echo in the house, and while I am 100% against ""more screens"" I am also 100% pro Show. I love that it can act as a physical remote control for smart home devices so you don't have to blurt out commands in the middle of the night (although Alexa still responds ""ok!"" which is *super* annoying). The audio quality on the Show is actually pretty remarkable which is nice because I use her for music playback frequently. Related, it's kinda nice that when playing music from Amazon you frequently get lyrics, and that's cleared up some household discussions. And, I totally bought into personal photos as the screensaver, so it's fur babies 24x7 at my house. The activity/light sensing works great, and I love the faux sunrise that accompanies morning alarms. I have a couple minor complaints, but I suspect it's stuff I could tune out or modify if I really cared that much. So, clearly, I don't. I'm happy enough that if these end up on super-ultra-sale again I will probably replace the two Dots I have. I feel like I should really be opposed to Amazon, but you know, you make my life easier and I just can't quit you.",I hate that I like this thing.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,BobH,"I have deducted a couple of stars because of the lack of documentation.  There are several Kindle how-tos's on Amazon, but inclosed documentation is less than what you see in the item description.  It has many great features, but getting everything working right will be frustrating if this is your first Echo/Alexa device.  The first thing is that ""skills"" replaced ""apps"", and you will be disappointed if you are expecting this to look and feel like a touch-screen Android.  Essentially, it is a speaker system (Echo) with added video, controlled by voice (Alexa).  If talking to a computer is good for you, then this would be easily 5-stars if they provided documentation that you could at least print out on a computer.  Many, many features once you figure out how to use them, and the video and sound are outstanding.  Once I was able to add my SiriusXM and Hulu accounts everything is good.  I'm certain there will be many more uses in the future.  Unlike computers that you buy to solve a problem,  an Echo Show provides an ""Easter egg hunt"" to discover what it can do for you, probably many things that you would not expect.  For example, if you whisper to it, it whispers back.  Recommendation: When you buy your Echo Show be sure to order the how-to book at the same time.  You will need it.",Clearly 5-star... except this

For ex, when I ""Drop into"" my friend's Echo Show, it always goes his livingroom and can’t be redirected to his kitchen.  When he “drops in” on me, the DROP IN call will show up on randomly on one of my 3 devices but it is unpredictable as to whether it will be on the device in livingroom, diningroom, or kitchen.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Nov 2019,justme624,"I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the “skill” for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon’s devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a “problem” as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo’s screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple’s customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of “ads” on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn’t have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this. UPDATE- I decided to call customer service since I was not happy with seeing the selling price go from $129.99 to $99 and now to $79.  I usually never call for things like this but I was very happy with the agent telling me that I will get a promotional discount which is very good for me since I am on a very small fixed income.  Thank you Amazon your customer service is always good!",Not Just A Glorified Alarm Clock...
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Feb 2020,cjr,"The 8 inch is our favorite size and fits well anywhere and still is a decent size for video. It responds better to voice commands better than my dots. Amazon nearly got it right with this, but there are a few things that make me hesitant to recommend it. Audio quality is close to the full size Echo, and a significant upgrade over the dot. Prime video and displaying simple commands is nice, using the browser to watch YouTube or do something quick online is doable, but not as simple as it could be. There are two things I hate: 1. Looking at other reviews it's clear there is a need/want to further customize the home screen. From clock size, to even widgets like the weather always up, HUNDREDS of people have mentioned this would be great. It still has not been done, and in theory would be relatively simple to roll out. 2. I don't think they could make a less intuitive alarm clock. When I find myself struggling to turn it off and not snooze it, or even check to make sure it's still on for the following day, that means it's poorly designed. Want to get frustrated to start everyday, and then wake up the family because it was on snooze accidentally and you're already in the shower? Well then you'll love using this as your primary alarm in the morning. Would I buy it anywhere close to full price? Never.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2020,Anonintex,"I bought this because i wanted a dedicated bedside device i could use to monitor security cameras. I usually do this with my ipad or phone, but i like to use those for other things, so wanted something specially for that. So disappointing; The echo has a great speaker, but you cant play music and show camera footage at the same time even when the microphone settings on the camera are off. When Alexa plays music the screen only shows the song playing‘s album cover, not even the clock, or a rotating photo album. You can only show one camera at a time as well, even when camera app has multiveiw  capabilities. The touch screen is anemic, you have to download the alexa app to do almost everything, and most controls are through your phone. I feel i would have been happier with a cheap android tablet. I will say the speaker sounds great. But even on special, $89 is too much for what amounts to nothing more than a gadgety  alarm clock with a good speaker.. also though I have some cameras that do work with Alexa viewing anything by having to ask Alexa to show it, instead of just touching the screen is a tedious process at best, with no option to record or use the 2 way microphone. And the cameras that i bought it for(because they were advertised with them on the amazon website!!)  just buffer, rarely showing footage at all. If at the least it scrolled through the different camera views id probably be happy, but having to say “alexa show camera one“... “alexa show camera two” is pointless. The echo show 8 inch takes up too much real estate on my nightstand and doesnt do enough. And being able to drop in on my dog sleeping on the bed while i work during the day?

I just installed a couple of Ring Doorbells - for example - when someone pushes the button, their face appears on the Shows and I can engage them verbally. An Echo Dot, of course, will still tell you that someone is at the door. And they both can tell when a person is in view, whether they rang the bell or not. Another example is shopping lists. The Dot will record and tell what the items are. The Shows will well, Show you what's on it for good visual feedback. I like that. Then there are the news videos and entertainment options.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Dec 2019,ELH,"I bought the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift for my wife, who wanted to use it in the kitchen. She was a bit heartbroken over the the ""things to try"" scrolling non-stop across the screen, we were going to return the unit. However, Amazon must have gotten many complaints because they reduced  the ""things to try"" down quite a bit - But is still a device that I own and I should have control over the content. Mounting: Our kitchen is tiny, so the only option was to mount it below a cabinet. Note that there is no provision to mount it this way. I had to make a mount that curled down and around the back to the bottom. There is a metal plate on the bottom of the Echo Show 8 and it can be secured with a large magnet.. which is what I did. Because we are tight on counter space, I made the mount on a rail that allows the whole unit to be slid back under the cabinet to get it out of the way (you can see this in the pictures I included.)  If we had a bit more room we would have just set it on the counter or picked up one of the many mounts available. The good: The screen is bright, clear and adapts nicely to changes in ambient light. The clock is useful. You can load your own pics so it rotates through them, making a nice picture frame (my wife loves this.) When you ask for the weather it gives a nice display of the hourly temps/forecast, or a weeks overview, depending on what you ask for (see pic.) The speaker is adequate. Alexa does all the things available on Dot or other device: runs routines, turns lights on and off, has the Guard feature, etc.  The Echo Show 8 is useful for viewing security cameras, we have some Wyze cameras and we can just ask ""Alexa, show me the entrance"" and in a few seconds, its on the screen (see pic.) When you play music, the Echo 8 displays the lyrics. If you set a countdown timer while cooking, it remains on the screen. If you set two timers, it shows the one that is going to go off first, then shows the second: my wife loves this for cooking (she used to have to keep asking Alexa ""how much time is left on the timer?"" as she tried to coordinate multiple items being readied. You can watch movies on the Echo Show 8 as well, probably not the best screen for viewing, but it does work. To be frank, the Echo 8 earns its keep just on the above features. The ""could be better"": When looking up recipes, the Echo 8 displays them one at a time. It is exactly like an Echo Dot, except there is a picture - the screen could be utilized to show multiple possibilities and cut the browsing time down tenfold. There is no provision to enter and save your own recipes, my wife still gets out her Ipad and uses that.  Amazon says there are thousands of skills, but the majority of them are at best, kinda lame (having the Gordon Ramsey skill make rude comments about food was funny for about 15 seconds.) Like the recipe function, very few of the skills are optimized to work with a screen in a helpful way... this is an area that really disappointed us. I was expecting something that could work more like a tablet in capabilities. We have multiple Alexa Dots throughout the house, and their capabilities have grown tremendously over the past two years. Many of the capabilities were unexpected and very useful, such as Guard and geofencing, both of which we now use daily.  I suspect, and hope, that the Echo Show 8 evolves in the same way. And I hope Amazon gets rid of the ""things to try,"" which keeps this review at 1 star","AMAZON: PLEASE TURN OFF THE ""TRY ALEXA"" TEXT"

I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one. The problem seems to be the software. It keeps hanging up and the only way around it is to disconnect the power and then repower the unit and hope you can get through the part that hung up on you before. One menu required moving my finger up, to scroll down, instead of the usual moving the finger down to scroll down. That was totally weird. I am disappointed because I ordered the two Echo Shows as my main Christmas presents to myself. I wanted the 10s but I read they weren't very good for the almost double price. And the 8 is really big enough for what I want it to do--if it would do it.

I do like it, but it would be nice to see Amazon listen to its buyers regarding features.  Hardware is solid and build well, screen is great, sound is good, but software is where Amazon fails its customers.  It is difficult to implement videos like Youtube, you have to go through a browser, which is a pain.  Also, which is ALMOST a deal breaker as it is so irritating, that is you CANNOT remove the Try Alexa notices at the bottom of your screens. Several reviews say it can be removed by going into settings and turn it off, but that is NOT true.  I have done that, turned every help, notification and option off....it is still there.  I have the newest software version, and it apparently is something that Amazon insists will be there, even though they are aware that everyone hates it and some people return their device because of it as well as others will not even buy it because they know that Amazon feels that they must shove this down the throat of those who give them money and pay their salaries.  Whew!  I guess I vented, but it really is a huge irritant that Amazon knows their customers absolutely do not want, but still force on them.  I will keep mine, because I do like it, but I do not encourage others to buy it if this type of belligerent Amazon behavior is too hard to swallow.  This should be an easy choice for the client, not be a forced display item.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2020,BHPhD,"The ring app for mac and ios are able to automatically show video when motion is detected. Somehow, amazon hasn't thought it prudent to allow the echo show to do this. It will only show you video automatically if someone presses the doorbell. This is a serious inconvenience for the doorbell and other motion ring cameras. Furthermore, there is a big lag time between giving the show the verbal instructions to show you the video and the video coming on. It would be faster to get up and walk to the window and look. Finally, there are no buttons on the show or screen that you could press in order to just show video once you are alerted, again you have to give a voice command which you may have to repeat. If you are getting this for the Ring, I would recommend getting a used dedicated tablet instead. As for voice commands, these are hit or miss. Google does a MUCH better job at voice recognition and at finding what you're actually looking for. I regularly have to repeat myself several times with my echo devices in general to get the correct song or action to appear, and I am a native English speaker. Finally, as many others have mentioned, the customization is very poor and you are forced to watch whatever they decide to feed your screen. If you aren't looking for Ring integration and it's on sale, then it may be worth it.",Poor ring integration
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2020,Zach S.,"Really like the Echo Show for the most part, but it definitely needs some tweaks. The main reason I got the show which I upgraded from my 2nd gen Echo Dot was to integrate my Ring video doorbell together. What I wanted was if someone rang the doorbell the Show would automatically pull it up. Well I found out later after buying it that's just not possible. You actually can do that with the Google Nest Hub, seriously Amazon? Get on that! You guys own Ring now, it should have been done long ago. I am able to give it a command, but I'd like it to be automated. The other thing I wanted to do was to use it as a big clock. Looking through the options, you just can't do that. After doing some research online, figured out it can't be done at all (and a lot more people wanted it too). Pretty surprising to me, that's not an option. What I want is the option to set the background to a still image, have a big Clock Face and nothing else on there. Right now I set it so the display is off outside of when I'm using it. Disappointing Amazon again. I had a tissue box right next to it and found it to pick me up worse then my Echo Dots. Talking with a friend I gave it some space and it's def improved (but still not always 100%). If they could add the 2 above features that'd move it to a 5/5 from me. Right now it's a solid 4/5.",needs some tweaks

One of the main reasons I purchased the echo show for the kitchen so I could ask for a recipe quick and not have to google something on my iPad and set the ipad up in the kitchen, just seemed like it might be a little more convenient.  Well the thing is so stupid, it gives me recipes for things i didn’t ask for, answers question to things i didn’t ask, and its favorite response is “Im not sure about that”.  I even asked it if it could answer a simple question and it said “ Im not sure about that”. Sometimes it doesn’t answer at all!  Every morning I ask it to play the same radio station, and every morning it gives me the same WRONG station, completely different from what i asked for, then i ask again really slowly so it can understand the words that are coming out of my mouth...and it defaults to Tunin (And i cant find anyway to disable Tunin) and tells me that station isn’t available on Tunin and i have to tell it to get my station from IHeart radio, which is set as my default streaming service anyway.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Oct 2020,Ken325,"I like playing music on this device.  My favorite feature on Alexa devices is to use voice commands to play music.  I like the play everywhere feature where I can sync up music in multiple rooms. I also use it as my alarm clock and to control smart devices.  Alexa devices are great for setting alarms.  My biggest complaint is also related to using it as an alarm clock.  That is if your playing music or doing something else then the clock is not visible. That is not acceptable.  If I look at the clock I want to see the time not some screen full of garbage I am not interested in. I want something done so the the clock is always visible.  Time, weather, and checking ring cameras are the only things I use the screen for.  I want to be able to see the clock or it doesn't function as a clock.  I also join others in hating things to try.  Alexa works well for a few things.  Setting alarms, turning on-off smart devices, and making list.  I will occasionally use it for math.  Everything else is clunky and hard to use.  Simple internet questions like how old is some actor or what is the date works fine.  A complex question like when is the first day of early voting will not work. Amazon needs to stop pretending that Alexa can do complex things.  Just get it to function as an alarm clock and radio.  If we can do that it is a good device.",I like it but it could be better.

On the surface the potential for the product is tremendous...however, for whatever reason, Amazon has chosen NOT to provide any documentation on the products capabilities nor any instructions on how to correctly use and take advantabe of all of the product capabilities.  In the first two days with the product, I have had to call Amazon Support 4 times to get instructions on how Echo Show works with Amazon Photo. to do basic things like upload a photos, creating photo albums and adding additional photos to these photo albums...and these are all fundamentally basic capabilities.  In total, I have spent more than 3 hours on these 4 support calls because after about 30-45 mins of fumbling around, the Amazon support person has told me that they are really not that familiar with the Show product or with Amazon Photo product and they transfer me to someone else...who has more knowledge of the products.  These new support persons have access to ""step by step"" instructions (or can direct me to the Help section) with these ""step by step"" instructions to do specific tasks.  But even then, they cannot find or direct me to any ""step by step"" help to work with things like Photo Albums... If this Echo Show product is going to really be successful, Amazon needs to provide users like me with documentation on all of the products features and ""step by step"" instructions on how to take advantage and use these features.  For a product with such great potential, I am about to throw it out because it has been so difficult and frustrating to use.

I decided to return it, but changed my mind:  Because we have thousands of photos on Amazon, they are showing on the Echo Show all the time; we love this feature.  We're seeing pictures we had totally forgotten about.  Every time we walk through the kitchen we both check to see what's showing now!

I got this thinking the numbers would be bigger and easier for me to see without my glasses. The numbers are not bigger, so that was a fail. But I do like the bigger screen. My problem is that this Echo seems to more apt to glitches than other Echos. (As mentioned, I also have the regular Echo and the Echo Show 5.) As an alarm clock, more than once I've snoozed the alarm only to have it not go off again. It does NOT recognize a sleepy voice at all. At times it's gone unresponsive, which means it won't perform some basic tasks that should not require a connection.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2020,Ms McGee,"Works great with my Ring doorbell. The Ring view outside comes up very quickly when I say ""Alexa show me the front door"", much faster than viewing on my phone. When I get a notification there's someone at my door, with my phone I have to first unlock my phone, then get to the app, then tap the app to open it, then click on Front Door Live View, then wait for the connection. So you can see the difference in speed of view right there. Echo show only takes a few seconds to connect to Ring. The sound on the Show doesn't compare to the sound on my Echo Plus, but when I ask the Show to play a song, the lyrics come up on the screen which is a bonus especially if you are a musician or a karaoke singer!  I recently learned you can slide the camera lens to ""closed"" which I did. I only realized you can do that because of the little tips the Show displays on the screen. I like that it always has the time and temperature, and suggestions of what you can ask verbally on a line at the bottom of the screen which changes every 10 seconds.  Show gives rotating on-screen suggestions for recipes, tending topics, 4 day weather, suggests videos, Show can connect with other Show users & is especially useful if you want to drop in on Mom to say hello or check on her visually is you have it set up that way. There really is no limit to the capabilities of Show. The only thing I yet have to figure, since I have both the Show and the Plus in the same room, is how to make my music play b only on the Plus if I don't need the lyrics since the Plus is such a better sound system.  I sometimes say Alexa play (this song) on the Echo Plus, & most times she will but not always. Then I'll try Alexa play (this song) ""Everywhere"" & sometimes music plays on all 3 of my Echo devices, & sometimes she tells me I need to sign up for Amazon Music to do that but I AM signed up for that.  I would like to figure out how to make my Echo Plus the default music player unless I tell it differently. I tried working with the settings in Alexa, that's where you can do it, but it didn't do it. I tried it verbally, to make the Plus the default. Nope. So I will continue to tell Alexa verbally to play it on the Echo Plus until I can figure it out.

Just turn the only device named bed on. Second the media displayed is annoying. When I’m in bed I really don’t care about a recipe on making cinnamon buns.

If I ask one device 'what is playing', it may not know anything is playing if I told Alexa Show to play pandora everywhere. Echo Show executes tht command, but then cannot execute the command to cancel playing pandora everywhere.

Alexa has plenty of skills, way more than I need, and I can play music and watch NBC, tubi, Prime Video, Food Network, Hulu, and Red Bull TV.

I got my first echo show 8 in May of this year. In those three months I have needed to reset this device for various reasons. Sometimes screen locks up, sometime Alexa doesn’t hear me or it won’t play music. This last issue I had is much more serious and when it happens it renders the device useless. The problem was, Alexa could hear me and would attempt to perform the task, but no audio followed. I was not having this problem on my other show or any other device. I tried unplugging it from the back of the unit and resetting it, but no help. Tried unplugging it from the wall (why this would be different I don’t know but someone suggested it) and the problem continued. I finally had to do a factory reset, which deregistered the unit from my account so I had to go through the initial set-up all over. This did clear the problem (for now) but it is not a fix. If Amazon can’t fix this issue (which seems to have been going on for years) then the show is just a “dumb” device with a screen. Google home must be loving this lack of action by Amazon.

It's just not ready for prime time. Its comprehension of every day tasks seems so limited, that it's hard to get it to do what you want. Skills are barely usable, and are so cumbersome, that most of the time you can do what you need on an app on your phone faster than you can get Alexa to do what you want. Support for touch enabled skills for such large screen as the Echo Show 8 is virtually non-existent. It makes you wonder why they need a touchscreen. Things like volume and navigating media are the easiest things to control by voice, yet they have dedicated buttons, and touch controls, but not for much of anything else.

I like to treat my Alexa devices as a ""set and forget"" type device (like most people I'm sure) but I find myself logging into the Alexa app nearly daily. The EQ is always set weird, where now every time I start to play Spotify, the treble is all the way up and bass is set to the lowest setting (this is not how I set it every time). Alexa has a cool ""Play Everywhere"" feature that is DOPE but beware, the moment you add an Echo Show to the mix of Echo Dots, the ""Play Everywhere"" feature becomes bugged beyond use. It's a hassle to start, and when you get it working and feel like changing the song... HAVE FUN getting it back to play everywhere when you skip a track! I've always learned Alexa Skills just take a plunge when you add the Echo Show. The classic ""Alexa play thunderstorm sounds"" Skill is extremely temperamental now. Also any video camera you use indoors claims to work with the Show 8, but the support on both Amazon's side and the Camera's side love to pass blame leaving one spotty, laggy connected camera to the Show 8.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,Chris S.,"When I first heard about the Echo 8, I got extremely excited. Finally I could replace that first generation Echo Show I have in my kitchen.  And in almost every category this is a huge upgrade, except the camera.  Music sounds great, Videos look very good, but the camera is absolute garbage.  1 mp?? Really Amazon? However if you just use it to watch videos, check weather, and listen to music then this is perfect. But if you use it to video chat, I would say stay away. Oh besides the camera, my one other complaint, LET ME MAKE THE CLOCK FULL SCREEN! That is all.",Almost a huge upgrade.
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Dec 2019,Elena Schott,"So far about the best use of the show is for things I can already do on the dot.  Adding a picture and a lot of nagging ""Did you know you can ...?"" does not make an improvement over a dot.  The only actual *use* for a screen is youtube, and that's gimped because of the apple/google fight.  I can't use the screen to queue amazon music, only press pause or play on what's already coming out.  I can't see a list of anything from TuneIn only say play or pause for what I queued by voice.  I can't see my DISH dvr recordings on the side, only say play or pause as if it was an echo.  I can't select or play from my Washington post subscription except via the website.  I can't, I can't, I can't..... I didn't expect the world, but if you're not into picture slideshows this is so far great potential, no results.  I'm just betting that like the early echo, it improves over time, at which point buying it for $80 during cyber Monday will turn out to be a good, not bad choice.",So much where a tablet is leaps better
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2020,CT,"I got this so I could watch TV at my desk and  my kids could easily video chat with family. I appreciate the physical slide to block the camera when I want to. Sound and picture is great. Hulu is not as great as online or on the tv because you can't search at all and only some categories show. One missing category is the 'My Stuff' one, which astounds me they would have left that out. I also noticed some shows that I see on my TV I don't see on the echo, which is also odd. Even when you look at Prime Video you can't search for anything. Lack of a simple search feature leaves both Hulu and Prime Video really underutilized and feeling partially unfunctional.","Step in the right direction, but leaves out a few things like the ability to Search in video options"

Well that is the one feature were it’s lacking, you can not use your blue tooth headphones with video chat not sure why but it completely ignores your headset when on video chat.  You can use them for everything else.  This is disappointing, we have now gone back to using FaceTime on IPad’s for video chat.  We have kept the show’s in hopes they do some sort of firm ware update to fix this (emails have been sent and not answered).  The video quality is good, the sound quality when playing music is surprisingly very nice for these reason we moved the show to the kitchen and are using it as our main Alexa device in there for the time being.  I love that you can close off the camera option with just a flick of a switch.

Duke,"My children/grandchildren bought me the new Echo Show 8 HD for my birthday. I have been using an Echo Dot in my kitchen and got them all one at various celebrations. This is a big step-up! I can see my shopping lists by asking, add or delete by touch screen (or by asking Alexa to do it). I can search for recipes (like I usually do on my laptop) right from my Echo Show. If I find one I like, I can ask ""Alexa"" to add the ingredients to my shopping list. We have a granddaughter who is Vegetarian, so I am always looking for recipes she might like. I can make phone calls to others on their phones, but, unless the person I'm calling has an Echo Show, I can't see them when talking. There are so very many things that it can do and I haven't even touched the ""tip of the iceberg."" The grandchildren love it and can play with it when they come.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jun 2020,Zepolka,"I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I bought this for my father who was in the nursing home on palliative care as a way to ""drop in"" on him as (due to distance and family obligations) I wasn't able to visit him more than once/week. Then the pandemic hit and the nursing home went on lockdown. I was no longer allowed to visit him in person BUT this device allowed me to use the drop in feature to connect to his echo and essentially have a video call with him at any time! (Of course I had gotten permission from the nursing home for this device and feature.) I did these ""drop ins"" by using the Amazon Alexa app on my iPhone. I also created a photo album of various pictures of my father and family that had been taken throughout his life using Amazon Photos, and was able to set the album as the home page on his echo, and the photos of the album would cycle through like a slide show on his echo. I figured this would give him some comfort during a time when family wasn't allowed to visit. My father has since passed away. I am just so thankful for this device which allowed me to ""see"" him during his final days. I now have his echo show sitting on my kitchen counter and I am also loving it, and constantly discovering more cool things you can do with it. (This is my first echo show.) Lastly, the photos of my father that I created in the photo album continue to cycle every day on the echo, and it is like a never ending memorial to my father. I couldn't be happier to continue see his smiling face and his memories every day!",An Amazing Little Device!

Skype integration needs more work to improve performance.  The $10 guide should be included in the box.  Who ships a product without instructions?  Amazon... that's who.  Not everything is electronic - particularly if you don't know what to look for online on how to get the full value out of this product.  The speakers and sound quality falls a little short of expectation, but it's a major improvement over the dot.  You shouldn't have to buy the echo show and a separate speaker system to get the full sound that should have been built in.  I'm not saying that it should sound like a Bose, but something better than a portable radio should be the standard.  The screen quality is very very good.

I upgraded to it from an Echo Dot. I had seen one at a friends house weeks prior but i just knew it was probably going to be too pricey for another gadget in addition to all I already have, but I am really happy I happened upon this nifty device. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and the set up took less than 10 minutes. Once it connected to the Wi-Fi it already had all the settings and information from my previous device. The Alexa phone app immediately recognized the new device and using it was seamless. Besides the large 8"" HD display, the sound quality was the biggest surprise with this device. The sound is comparable to a BOSE system it is rich and the subwoofer makes it sound like a much larger device. I enjoy interacting, playing music and the visuals are crisp and easy to work with.

I like watching mini news stories while cooking or cleaning, listening to music, and asking questions. The only downsides are that the speakers are only on the back so if you’re trying to watch/hear something looking at the screen, it’s actually louder on the other side. No big deal if you have the echo show on the counter up against a wall, but can get annoying because the people sitting at the kitchen table behind it hear it a lot louder than whoever is watching the screen. Somethings I’ll see a prompt to ask Alexa to play a news video or read a news article but then she looks something random up on bing video’s search engine. Sometimes she doesn’t understand what I’m saying (I swear it only happens to me and not my husband) which can be annoying especially because we have lightbulbs connected and that’s how we turn the lights on and off.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Mar 2020,Patrick A.,"We are dismayed with what we feel is rather misleading claims by Amazon. Or maybe it is GLARING omissions of features they decided to leave out of the Echo shows. We live in a modest apartment and have enjoyed having an Echo Dot in two of our bedrooms with our living room in the center of the apartment with our Echo Plus. What was great was the ability to pair all 3 Echo devices so we could play something and have it broadcast to all 3 devices. Amazon sells the Echo Shows as if they are EQUAL or near equal to the regular Echo speakers. HOW WRONG! There is ZERO ability to pair Echo Shows (at least not the Echo show 8) with each other. We bought two Echo Show 8s and are no longer able to pair our 3 rooms. We bought the shows for what the screens can do. And in just a couple of days, we have been impressed. The sound has been very good as well... AS SINGLE STAND ALONE units. Amazon, do something to fix your blasted units.

The clock size is about 3/4 inch for a bit, then it moves and becomes tiny. You also cannot control the color of the clock other than maybe dim it at night. I would watch not videos on this.

You would expect Echos - with there fancy mic setup - to offer better sound quality to the listener on the other end but it's like a bad 1980s speakerphone. One other thing - a nitpick, but - the art screen saver is one of the best, if not the best, that I've ever seen.  The scans are excellent and the variety of art is impressive.  HOWEVER - they don't tell you what each particular painting is (ok, reasonable choice not to clutter the screen) BUT Alexa also CAN'T TELL YOU what is on the screen even if you ask her.  This isn't a setting issue, the option isn't there.  So when my 5-year-old points to the Show and asks, ""who painted that"" I can not make it a teachable moment (or even, Amazon, a here's  good use of Alexa moment) I just have to shrug and say, ""I don't know, but it's beautiful.""",It's Alexa with a screen - sound is about the same except

I love the Spot and the clock is easy to read from across the room in the dark with the night setting. The Show 8 just doesn’t seem to provide the same clock face nor visual acuity level. Second, you cannot simply ask Alexa for settings. You have to physically touch the screen to change settings. With the Spot you simply ask and Alexa brings up the settings.

Given what I know now about this device I would be hard-pressed to pay full retail.  The reason? When querying Alexa there's a delay in response time and it doesn't seem to have the number of microphones as in our Echo Plus (I ""think"" the Plus has four microphones and the Show 8 has two). We have to be closer to the Echo Show 8 to speak to it than we do the Echo Plus.  Also, when we invoke the wake word for our Plus, the blue ring immediately pops up.  On the Show 8, the blue line at the bottom of the screen seems to take a bit longer. I'm not too bothered by the ""Try 'Alexa...'"" suggestions at the bottom, but I do hope Amazon pushes out an update to allow users to disable the text. There are pros to this device: When playing Amazon Music the lyrics (If available for that song) scroll on the screen and we also have been enjoying reminiscing over the older pictures of our daughter during the Amazon Photos slideshow. The Echo Show 8 also has a small footprint for the kitchen counter, and the Food Network app videos played just fine. I also installed a weather Radar skill and it's rather nice to see the radar and have Alexa to zoom in on the map. Hopefully, the next Show 8 iteration will have more microphones and increase the response time. Helpful tip, to turn off the screen just say, ""Alexa, screen off.""",Can you hear me now?

The second was to go to Settings and turn off all the scrolling suggestions that I didn't want to be seeing.  I chose Art for my wallpaper and enjoy seeing the various paintings that display. I also listen to a lot of music and find the sound quality better on the Echo Show than on any of the other Echos and Echo Dots I have owned.  In fact, partly b/c of that I traded in one of my Echos for a second Echo Show 8. There are a couple of suggestions that I wish I could make to Amazon's engineers.  While I'm sure that there are many users who like to see song info and lyrics on their screen while listening, I'm not one of them.  I wish there were some place in settings to change that default to immediately return to my home screen.  As it is, every time I start a new radio station or album, I have to say ""Alexa, home"" to get the display back to my home screen.  A small thing but an annoyance.

With the trade in offer from Amazon, I decided to upgrade to this new Echo Show 8"" model and I can say easily it is a vast improvement over the original. While the original could be slow at times processing voice commands, this new model boots and runs at least twice as fast. The audio quality is really where the new Show 8"" sets itself apart. The new model does away with that flat boxy sound profile and now has clear sound with good bass and decent highs and can actually fill the room much, much better than the original ever could. Another design benefit is the larger LCD screen with the speakers in the rear of the Show. The original had the speaker in front and the tiny holes it had for the speaker grill used to fill with dirt that was nearly impossible to clean well. Definitely a recommended upgrade.",Vastly improved over 1st generation

I was hopeful Amazon had listened to their customers and provided an option by now. To the ones that say there are no ads, I'm not sure what else to call something that is encouraging me to buy something on Prime Video, for example. Not all are incoming producing for Amazon, but they are still ads. To those saying turn of Discovery in Home Content .. this has NOTHING TO DO WITH THINGS TO TRY! It is turned off and I still get the ads. Besides, it's not on the home screen where it is most annoying. It is, for example, when listening to music and in other skills where it appears and is totally unrelated to what Alexa is doing at the time.

Douglas,"We've had every other smart home speaker and screen but while the assistants on each have pros and cons, in the end they and their ecosystems are not that useful. One (I don't think I can name them here so will let you connect the dots) has a great sounding speaker, no screen devices and the dumbest assistant possible. The other has a super smart assistant and some nice but older devices but can't do that much because it's ecosystem is really limited (security, cameras, home devices). We ultimately chose Alexa and the Echo Show along with several ring devices because they work well, Alexa will show my front door or cameras on the Show, and also read books to us using Audible! This is in addition to all of the things you expect - setting timers, turning lights on and off, telling you the weather. I've seen some negative reviews regarding home screen hints and tips but I actually prefer them. On that other assistant device, it is just a blank screen with a background, but Alexa provides (mostly) useful information, tips and reminders. Example - we always somehow usually forgot to order dog treats until after we run out. Alexa on echo show reminded me I usually order now and may be running out and she was right - with a voice command I ordered more and it was simple. This feature can be customized from what I've read. My only issue now is that Alexa can do so much on the Echo Show that I need to spend some time learning her capabilities and what the device can do to take full advantage of both. I highly recommend the Echo Show and Alexa.","Have tried them all, Alexa on Echo is the best"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2020,Mary Ann,"First off, don't rely on customer service since this item is new in their arsenal when it comes to pairing with the Blink mini camera. Trust the CS people at Blink.  After wasting close to 3 weeks and talking to 9 different people, I was able to resolve the lack of connectivity between the two devices this way: DO NOT name the camera with more than one word.  The directive must be: Alexa show me the <<<< (whatever your camera is named.) Even though the device gives you different options for the wake word, the only one that works consistently is Alexa. Don't let them blame your internet service, your computer/tablet, etc. The command has to be short and sweet. There is no one I spoke with over there that came up with the right solution. On a positive note, the HD 8 is wonderful when it comes to customizing content and the ability to show me all of my thousands of photos during the course of the day make it a keeper.",Follow my advice when it comes to setting up your device

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Sep 2020,NoGrillingTonight,"I like this for the kitchen or any place I need to quickly get weather reports, check the latest news briefings, the stock market or listen casually to some classical music while whipping up a sous-vide ribeye steak and all the fixings on the side. It's a great companion device that breaks the silence while you weave your magic cooking up the next meal. It'd be also useful in a laundry room where you are folding clothes while dancing to the latest Taylor Swift album. Wait, her last album (as of this review) is ""folklore"" and most songs are not really danceable to. Outside of that, the usefulness of the Ring and Amazon Camera integration allows me to see who's outside or in other parts of the house as well. Just need to make sure my son isn't sneaking in my beside table swiping a $20 bill from my wallet. Wait, where's he going to go blow it on anyway if all the bars are closed in our city due to the pandemic? Nevermind! This isn't a device for a main media room or anything else. I wouldn't use it in my office either since it might pick up some sensitive work conversations and I don't want to give Bezos any additional insight to competitive advantage work that my company is focused on. Pick up the 8 instead of the 5. The larger screen size is ideal for those of us who were born before 1980 and whose vision is slowly fading, just like that Def Leppard song where it's better to burn out than to fade away!",Decent device for a kitchen or utility room
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Dec 2019,Nacman,"(As of 12-25-2019)  I just received and installed the Echo Show 8 several days ago. It soon upgraded itself to the latest software. I had read many Show reviews, including complaints about the constant ""Things to Try"" notices on the screen. Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off. So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen. So I tried the steps others had earlier listed. NONE work now at this time.  Over several hours I tried everything, no joy. So I got Amazon Help online and started the Chat (with ""Tech""). After 10-15 minutes of delay and ""Thanks for waiting"" and ""Let me check on that"", etc., the expert said the actual tech folks said that at present there is NO WAY to turn that off. But they would surely take my ""suggestion"" into account for future upgrades. UNBELIEVABLE! If this will not irritate you, the Show 8 is otherwise a very powerful tech addition to your Echo house (I have 9 other Echo devices at home). IF they do allow the ""Things to Try"" feature to be removed in the future I will update this... 1/1/20 Indeed if you turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" it will no longer display the maddening ""Things to Try"", although if the device is doing something for you TTT will activate during that time. Device is slow to shift gears but after a few seconds it will return to the screen with only the clock and a moon icon. If you have personal pictures as a background, they WILL continue under DND.  Now a great device, lol... UPDATE: OK, you can now do away with ""Things to Try"". However, over time I found another flaw. The Show 8 does not understand me as it should. At times I have to repeat commands, at times it spouts garbage from the web instead of responding to a command. My main Echo has no such problem, and I use the same commands and tone of voice. Frustrating...","One major flaw, otherwise good"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Sep 2020,Mike K,"The functionality on this is terrible. It mis-hears half of what I say or just ignores it. My Echo can pick up my voice if I mumble. I have to *raise* my voice for this to hear me. One time I got so frustrated that it wouldn't respond correctly, I just unplugged and restarted it. The touchscreen isn't sensitive enough along the edges. I was playing a Youtube video at full screen and when I tapped on the resize icon to make it smaller, it took about 15 taps to do anything. If it's playing a video and I tell it to add something to my shopping list, it leaves the list up over the screen with no way to go back to the video. I said, ""Alexa close shopping list."" It asked, ""do you want me to delete your entire shopping list?"" The only way to get back to the video is to close everything and start over from the home screen. One good thing is that the sound is awesome. Heavy, full bass and clear mids and highs. It makes for a good music player, but little else.

Design is simple and unobstrusive, and there are just a few button controls and cable connections. Best for those with Amazon Prime who use its other services and devices. We are using it in the kitchen primarily for quick access to the front door Ring doorbell camera, but we will also be using it to access Amazon prime video, music and photo services. Music quality played through speakers is very good. Alexa voice command is very responsive but may not always respond as expected. Setup through the Alexa phone app can be frustrating. Part of the problem is that the quick start manual included with device lacks sufficient detail and there is no full user manual available online. There are also no detailed instructions for connecting with non-Amazon services with which the device is supposed to be compatible. Amazon customer support phone line is very helpful if you run into trouble, but I would prefer to be able to look up the answers I need on my own.",Multi-functional - high quality - easy to use

I'm enjoying it so far however I wish it was more customizable between how the clock is displayed (my #1 purpose for purchasing this was for an all-in-one nightstand clock) to how quickly the information on the screen is transitioned. But what truly has caused me to write my first review so quickly was - for the love of God, Amazon - please turn off the constant ""Try 'Alexa'...."" suggestions. They're horribly distracting. When I viewed Echo Shows in the store I guess I foolishly thought they were in a demo mode for those suggestions to have appeared on the screen constantly. I really just wanted the ability to have a great sounding and great looking yet customizable digital clock on my nightstand.

It integrates my iPhone apps perfectly and opens my favorite podcast and music without a glitch. The sound is amazing. I am adding an echo speaker to the mix and my security cameras today’s. I tried the option to see the inside of my home from the camera on the Echo show 8 and was able to see my dogs being good while I was away from home. That is a real bonus to view inside the house when away. So far all is above my expectations. Also I accidentally ordered the 8.  My sister has a smaller screen size and thought I ordered that but mine is bigger and I am very pleased this happened. So I would assume the 8 means 8 inch screen and so on. All in all probably the easiest set up on a very useful item I have dealt with so far. I also added my Roku to the echo show so I just ask for any channel on my existing roku and I can watch tv from my Echo Show 8. Love the Apple Music and have 100 % accuracy on song titles and bands. Even when I am not talking super close to it or speaking as clearly as you think I need to.,Perfect in every way!!!!!

Yes, but only if you bought the music from Amazon.  If your digital music collection contains music purchased elsewhere, Alexa won't play it.  Amazon says that's for security reasons.  So the policy is not to force you to buy all your music from Amazon.  (Apple does essentially the same thing with its devices.) Alexa can read your calendar, email and contacts.  Yes, but only if you pay extra to access your mailbox if is on a Microsoft Exchange server, which is the most common mail server in the world.  Amazon says that's because Exchange servers are used by business.  Yes, businesses do use Exchange mail servers.  But lot of private users like me also use mailboxes on Exchange servers.

If I use the Wyze app on my phone, I can keep it on basically indefinitely.  From what I have read, too, only Amazon cloud cams can run continuously on Echo Shows.  I don’t know.

The speaker keeps making a popping and screeching sounds. I thought perhaps I have the volume up to loud but, when I checked it was not even up half way.

I recommend purchasing the stand with it to give you more viewing flexibility.  Alexa voice recognition and AI stills needs improvement.  My 89 year mother with early Alzheimer's disease lives with me and uses this Echo Show every day.  The voice recognition makes it easy for her to call family and friends, listen to music, news, audiobooks, etc. However, she and Alexa sometime have mild arguments when Alexa will not do what she wants her to do.  (It is pretty funny to here Mom & Alexa arguing.) I have also set up the ""drop in"" feature on this device. It allows me to ""drop in"" via the device and see & hear what is going on in the room where my Mom is without her having to ""answer"" the call.  It has come in quite handy a few times when Mom has called and said she did not feel well, or was worried that she lost something.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 May 2020,Jeff Wright,"I've got a number of Alexa-enabled devices in my home, most recently a Show 5 and a Show 8.  I mainly bought these for voice control of my home automation setup but also the timer features are useful for cooking. But I have two major complaints... First, I've got the Show 8 in one room and the Show 5 in another.  And within the last few months, unless I'm within a few feet of the Show 8, the Show 5 in the other room responds.  Almost.  Every.  Time.  Obviously some firmware update that had some other purpose but managed to break the coordination between devices that's supposed to be happening.  ANNOYING! Second, that ridiculous ""try this"" scroll on the bottom of the home screen and lack of whole screen clock.  But I guess there's been enough said about that on other posts... UPDATE: Reducing from 3 to 2 stars as didn't realize I hadn't posted 2 stars first time. More context on my first issue (wrong device responding to voice commands), I know that the Show 5 and Show 8 are aware of each other as, for example, when I'm in the same room as the Show 8 and trying to control a timer, the Show 5 (in the other room) is the one that responds and is able to control the timer on the Show 8 (I'm having to specify which device the timer needs to run on, which is VERY ANNOYING).  Perhaps my Show 8 is just a faulty device?  I suppose, but seems strange that it worked fine for a while then started doing this almost continuously.  But I guess it could be an issue with this specific device as opposed to some overall design fault (i.e., somehow microphone degraded, etc. and now it thinks I'm farther away than I am and that the Show 5 is closer because it ""hears"" me better).  I certainly hope it's not because the Show 5 is just faster to the punch and a superior product...",Not impressed...

I like the they have the speakers in the back vs front to save space, but when you have objects in the back of the device the sound becomes distorted a bit. It also doesn’t feel premium like the original show. There’s just something cheap about it with the screen. What I do like is the ease of set up. It’s pretty much plug and play with most of your profile info already loaded. If you already have an Echo device. I didn’t have to enter or setup WiFi password, which is good.

It started with the Amazon Firestick. Then I moved on to the Amazon Echo, which replaced our Google Mini. When this thing went on sale, I debated for a couple of days, then decided to go for it. So glad I did. It is happily ensconced in the kitchen, where I use it to play music while I'm cooking, display recipes, set timers, and amuse myself with trivia games. When I'm at work and the dogs are home alone, I can ""drop in"" on them using this and let them know Mom is thinking of them. If I need something from home or for the fiance to do something, I can drop in with a quick message that he actually hears (unlike his phone, which he usually has set to vibrate). Some people complain about the Alexa skills that scroll across the bottom of the screen. I like them, and use them to learn more about the world. Alexa has access to so much knowledge, why wouldn't anyone want to learn more? It's not like it takes up a huge part of the screen. Technically speaking, I have the unit turned up to about 30% of the volume, and it is plenty loud for my music. If my neighbors ever have one of their parties til 3am again, it might get turned up to 100 at 7am, just for our amusement. But seriously, these are great little gadgets that provide plenty of uses for a decent price. For anyone wanting to know the size, the screen is the size of a Kindle, with a ""backside"".

I canceled a countdown timer a few seconds before expiration, and it went off anyway. At that point there was no way to cancel the annoying beeping, because there is no timer to cancel. I had to unplug the device to stop it. 2. It encountered bugs when playing Amazon Music. It wouldn't play the song that's currently selected, but kept going back to another song we stopped earlier. I had to unplug and reboot the device 3 times in the span of 10 minutes because of these bugs. So still some work to do there. Update: I ended up rebooting the device 6 times the first day.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2019,Firas Khalil,"Upgraded from the original Echo Show (1st Gen) Easy set up and installation -> Grade A+ Screen clarity and Display -> Grade A+ Smart Home Integration -> Grade A+ (Several Ring and Arlo Cameras as well as ADT Security System) Device is set up in the kitchen. Unfortunately, in comparison to the 1st Gen Echo Show i realized that the far-field microphones are sometimes not picking up commands or are totally misunderstood. My first gen Echo Show had never any problems, even from the other side of the room to understand and get everything. Even when the wake up word is understood, then Alexa just stays idle and just doesn't to anything: ""Alexa, add Bananas to my shopping list"" was misunderstood. Adding other items sometimes, Alexa stopped after the wake-up word. I have realized that the Echo Show 8 is very sensitive to background noises, i.e. while the first gen Echo Show did understand everything with a lots of background noises (somebody speaking on the phone or my kids playing), this version of the Echo Show 8 leads to ""Alexa confusions"", so it can't realize if this is a command or a background noise. Sound quality. I can't understand the reviews about the sound quality from some people here. It is correct that the Echo Show 1st gen did not create a room-filling sound quality. However, in comparison, my old Echo Show sounded in general a lot better and louder (probably due to the Dolby). I will try to retrain the voice models for my two users although when i connect my old Echo Show (1st Gen) back i don't have any problems with recognition of voice commands. If this doesn't get the speech recognition fixed, i'll probably return it and keep waiting for the next gen of Echo Shows.","A little bit disappointed after upgrade from Echo Show (1st Gen), other wise OK"

I like it! For now, I am using it as a glorified alarm clock in my bedroom.  But it has a ton of uses.  For instance, I have it set up for once I am awoken by the alarm, to immediately give me the weather and the top news stories.  It is great! You can also use it as a sort of digital photo frame, should you upload photos into the amazon storage.  It will cycle through and show off your memories. It also has the ability to play Amazon Video, so that is a pretty cool option to also have.  Would be awesome if it had youtube or netflix capability as well, but it does not.  I can eventually either move this, or buy a new device, into my kitchen to have an echo there at my disposal, and to see cooking how-to's as well.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Apr 2020,Patrick Morrison,"Thank goodness Alexa devices were deemed essential going into Covid19!  We got this just as Amazon announced shipping delays due to the pandemic.  It was a replacement for our previous older Alexa show. We stay connected with grandparents through this video device.  We use it when kids ask weird questions that have great learning opportunities (like: Mom and Dad- what is Mount Rushmore? Or How many kinds of frogs are found in Wisconsin?). We use it for recipe ideas.  We use it for music (with lyrics).  We use it for shopping lists linked to our phone. Of note- we don’t use the voice recognition very much that I am aware of.  For example, my wife taught Alexa her voice.  But then, when she calls out, the device asks: “who shall I say is calling?“  Why does that need to be clarified if Alexa has learned her voice?  So, we don’t completely understand that feature.",What can I say.  We are an Alexa device house!
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jun 2020,BridgeImages,"Due to other echo devices, I have the camera turned off and the unit called Computer, rather than the traditional alexa. Pros: The device seems to be well made, have decent video and audio capabilities.  It has the standard Echo capabilities plus the ability to see certain answers on a screen.  The 8"" unit is a very good size choice for me. Cons: The screen keeps coming on for no reason and requires manual (voice) shut off.  The screen always shows the time, which would be ok if the display moved around like most screen savers.  As it is, I would think the time would burn in after a period of time. I do really wish there was a wider choice of trigger names for the echo family of devices.  ""Alexa"", ""computer"" and ""echo"" are too common and cause a lot of ""False"" responses from the devices.  If the devices can learn speech recognition, it seems like they could learn trigger names other than the three provided .",It does it's job.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,George,"I bought the 5 inch on Prime day. I like it. It's a great bedside clock and it does things that need a screen, like finding a book or music playlist. But the screen is small. The 8 seemed huge when I opened the box. Just huge. But it's a very nice screen, and very suitable for the free Prime Video stuff. I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one. Sometimes when I ask for a shopping suggestion, I get really good and in-depth information. But not always. I use it in the kitchen, so it's great for timers and I'd like to find good recipes. It was worth it, for me. Honestly, my $25 Dot seems pretty worthless now. The Dot had decent audio, but this is quite good.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Mar 2020,Ray F.,"I used the Echo Show 8 at home office for a while and then took it to work to use in my office for listening to music and also to have my family and travel scenery pictures rotate on its display. It was a really nice touch that pictures on Amazon Photo can be shown on a rotation on this device. The sound quality is good. It is not very high quality, but it is definitely not bad either. The display is really good and many people in the office have commented on the quality of my photos. The reason I took one start off is that sometimes the display stops on one picture and seems to have locked-up. But the Alexa voice part still works. The only fix I have found is to reboot the Echo Show by disconnecting and reconnecting the power. Then it works fine for a few days until this happens again randomly. Other than that, it's a really nice device. The Alexa voice recognition works really well also.","Nice display, good sound"

Yep, yep, it's working pretty good with Amazon Prime things, such as music, video, radio stations, and on and on and on. If you know how the Fire things work, then it's just one of them, and they're pretty much the same things. The main difference may be its speakers, and its HD sound quality is awesome. I enjoy listening to very loud music, pop music for example, whenever I'm allowed to do so. This thing does a crazy job. For the sound from 1 to 10, I believe 5 or 6 is loud enough for me. When it's turned louder than that, I can feel sound waves moving all over on the floor, and I don't think my neighbors would like it. LOL. Yeah. The HD speakers are amazing. It's also good to see music lyrics coming up on the screen when music is being played on. Its HD 8"" screen is just okay. I don't do video chatting with this, and I don't watch Prime video on this.

They work good and integrate with smart home features and alexa nicely. I already had the Echo Show (2nd Gen) 10.1” screen which I love. I do prefer the larger screen on my older model over this new 8, but they perform similarly.  Overall good and now I was able to add more units around the house. You may read a ton of reviews about advertisements, but they are not ads, they are alexa skills. Alexa skills are like apps that you can add to your device to offer more features. The ""advertisements"" as people are calling them are merely suggestions of skills to consider so you know there are more options out there. My older Gen 2 also has these, but they don't bother me. You can Google alexa skills if you want to learn more about those. They are not required, the echo show can answer tons of questions, give sports scores, add reminders and lists, etc. on it's own without adding skills.","Slightly smaller screen than my other model, but same features and works great for smart home"

You’d think with technology that it wouldn’t be so heavy but not a big deal. 2:The plug is way bigger. I understand it needs to be 30 watts instead of the old 21 W but can we come up some technology so it doesn’t have to be the only plug in an outlet? 3: The most important point, I feel- Why doesn’t it come with the stand? For the price I think this is a minimal option that they should definitely include. I think that’s the only real issue with any of these is the angle and not being able to adjust it to see people. We primarily uses for communication to our family that spread out over the US. But even if we wanted to watch a show or something on it you really need to have an angle adjustment.

I would like the ability to answer incoming phone calls on it but the voice calling out feature is excellent and allows a large number of contacts.

However, there is no Group calling unless Portal or Nest, and also there is no support for Youtube or Youtube TV. You must be a Hulu person. It is missing a lot of video streaming apps. Apple Music support is mediocre. The idea of Skills is like 2nd-rate Apps. I would must rather they called Skills->Apps and allowed developers to create a more intuitive experience. The main problem is that you have to memorize so many commands and Alexa doesn't help you out with her touch screen. Overall, I've bought a lot of these for family members bc they do serve some valuable purposes.

Immediately, I noticed a huge flaw. The sound only comes out of the back of the device so it makes it very difficult to hear if you're trying to watch the screen and listen. You literally have to turn it around so the screen is facing backwards to get the clearest crispest sound. The device is slow and laggy often as well, often taking 10-30 seconds to connect to my ring doorbell. (with a 500mbps internet speed) You can watch Amazon prime video and Hulu but the device does not do a good job syncing with other devices on where you left off during a show so it makes it really difficult to pick up a show or leave off. It just doesn't work. Also the navigation inside those apps is next to nothing. You can choose from the most popular categories but there's zero discovery available. One thing I really wish it had the ability to do is customize the home screen beyond what Amazon deems as news. Yes, you can select types of news but can't select your sources.

I recently got the echo show for the kitchen to have hands free assistance while cooking as well as having recipes on the screen, videos of techniques too.  So far it’s been a great addition to our kitchen. We also love that it is fully integrated with the echo spot in the bedroom. One of my favorite features of the show is the broken glass detector. Having cats means that things get knocked over at all height levels and Alexa has alerted me twice so far about sounds that might be broken glass with a full recording of the sound each time. So cool. Thankfully nothing broke either time, but it’s helpful to know that sort of thing. She detects smoke also which is awesome. I’m a bit leery about going full out with the amazon home devices like lightbulbs and wall plugs, but they’re definitely tempting me with all these gadgets. Alexa is taking over the world and I’m sort of here for it. Haha!",Beautiful design that’s perfect for a cooking/organizational companion in the kitchen!

Even figured out how to mute the motion alerts part on all my Echo devices, so at 5 AM it doesn't scream out throughout the house that my husband set it off as he was getting the paper. Love the manual way you can turn off the microphone and the Camera cover. You can have privacy and make sure it's real. Lots of videos you can watch. Even YouTube! That got added as an app just after I set up my new Show. I do think they could do better with the videos offered. The Prime offerings are a bit weak when you are looking for your list, not all shows and not all episodes available. I figured out how to use one of the two possible browsers (FireFox in this case) and had hoped to be able to access Netflix, so I could watch ALL my shows on this Show, but nope, Netflix will not even work through the browser. That's a disappointment, but overall, I love this thing! You can add your photos from the Amazon Photo Storage as a slide show for the background, that's also cool! I am looking forward to how this thing gets updated and evolves.",This is a great little interactive video screen!

W,"I purchased and echo show 8 for the living room and an echo show 5 for the bedroom. Set up for both was easy and came linked to my Prime. I set up the show 5 first and found the software interface to be very friendly and lots of features that suited my needs. I especially liked the various clock selections. Went into settings and turned off all of the options for notifications which seemed to minimize the ""try alexa"" messages on the display. Went to set up the show 8 and was disappointed to find that the software is different than the show 5. Most noticeable is the lack of selections of clocks and backgrounds. I like both but wish the software in the echo 8 was the same as the echo 5. Both are linked to my Blink cameras, Gosund smart plugs and switches, Our Groceries app, and Vizio TV.

We have many dots but I purchased this show on prime day because the deal was too good. I was surprised by the size of it (in a good way) and how sturdy it felt. The screen size is perfect. I am amazed at the sound quality, nice base, my kids ran into the room asking where the music was coming from and would have never guessed from the show. I love that I can watch my amazon prime shows while getting ready for work without having to run down the battery on my phone or tablet. It has a great feature where you can shut the camera lens for extra sense of privacy. It hooks up well with my ring and other cameras around the house. I also like that the screen goes darker at night so it's not too bright. The only thing I would say I am missing is more tips on what Alexa can actually do!

You can have so many named timers running and SEE them.  So nice when you have a lot going on.  Can watch you tube when you cook, or videos.  The sound is very nice.  I can check in on my kids and make face time like phone calls using my phone.  My kids can make phone calls with their voices.  It is so much less than a laptop and it just integrates so nicely in our home and family.  I have two of these and they get a lot of use.  Once on my desk and one in the kitchen.  Keep in mind you pay once and the service which is where the real value is (servers at amazon) are the real value.  The service is basically free and ongoing.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 May 2020,Uprooted Philosopher,"So far it's been a mixed bag of expectations met & not met.  I only bought this, 2 of them, so that I could send one to my father at his assisted living in order to stay in touch... and give him some company (books read to him, music, look at photos, etc.).  I have not been able to test how this works since he was hospitalized shortly after I bought them.  However, in setting them up in my home, I've come across many user unfriendly features among other things.  The biggest unfriendly feature is figuring out where to manage everything.  Everything from contacts for phone calls to apps to music to books. Sometimes you do this, manage, on the device, sometimes through the smart phone app, sometimes on a website, sometimes through 3rd party... really really off putting to say the least.  For a device that is supposed to simplify or enhance your life, it is the opposite due to these management issues.  Even more maddening is all the commands that have to be learned verbatim.  This is not going to go well for my father, I can already tell.  I could print out a list of commands but then again, he's losing his sight.  Real life seems to take a backseat in a lot of how this device works, but I digress... So far having books read to me (still testing it until my father is out of the hospital) & looking at photos, are working.  However, if you make a mistake in signing up for Amazon music on the phone app, then you won't get family, and the device will not play different music on diff devices at the same time. And if you try to change it, it won't let you til the trial period is over.  That some people might die, literally, before that happens doesn't seem to have even been considered.  Just another example of user unfriendly features. Audible on the other hand, is awesome and responsive to customers changing needs.  Thought I'd at least highlight something positive.  Although, a couple of the books I've chosen don't play, but again, I've been able to swap them out thereby, grateful somebody was thinking of people & real life. Long story short, if you only want to buy stuff, have books read to you, look at photos, listen to music & have no family, then this device is for you!  (have yet to test calls & drop ins) This device could really benefit from developers & QA testers who have families, friends, and elderly parents (who they don't live with).  I'm being partially sarcastic, tongue in cheek if you will, trying to keep it light, making lemonade out of some big lemons.  Guess I'm super unique in my wants & needs.","Works for some things, not for others."

It doesnt tell you to try alexa on top of every picture. I believe this is subliminal messaging that Amazon is using to try to get people to USE Alexa more, by forcing them to literally always think about it whenever they look at the display, which is ALL THE TIME... Please Amazon, I know you have so much money you could probably give these away just so people will be a part of your ecosystem, BUT for those of us that paid money for these please allow us to disable this TRY ALEXA nonsense that really clutters the screen, which is the main reason people by this over a standard ECHO etc. Thank you SO MUCH for listening Jeff!!!!

We both have many Echo devices and he has several different Show’s around the property. I finally made the choice and ordered one. Absolutely love it. Sound quality is very good and having a status screen for different functions is very handy. If not for the price, I would have them all over the house. I use it for new recipes, checking the weather and displaying travel photos. Rather surprised that it automatically reads my calendar (How did it do that?) so my upcoming appointments and calendar events are displayed. Very nice feature. Amazing device. My home is very automated with the Alexa ecosystem. Several Echo devices throughout along with smart lighting and appliances. 95% of my lighting is controlled by voice and I never touch a light switch.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jul 2020,Collin Nioi,"I’ll start by saying that I moved from google home products to Amazon Echos a few weeks ago. I have this on my nightstand and I really do prefer it next to the nest hub mini. The slightly bigger screen and much better sound quality really make it a win for me. I really love that I can hookup earbuds via Bluetooth for late night watching next to sleeping hubby.  It overall has had way more functionality to me than the hub mini ever did and I sincerely mean that. There are, however, some weird things. 1. The “Try Alexa” feature really is pretty much impossible to turn off. If it is, you’re not going to be seeing info flashing across your screen which is really annoying and frustrating considering all of the complaints. 2. the screen doesn’t Get nearly as dim as I’d like (and hub mini did). Don’t get me wrong, it gets decently dim, but you’ll definitely see a bit of light in the room. Works for us though. 3. There’s no way to make the clock full screen. I saw others saying this and thought “they just don’t know how to use tech lol”. If there’s a way tell me because I can’t find it and I’m a huge techie. The overall wallpapers are not that great. I did however get a echo show 5 for my office desk and it has a TON of customizable clock and wallpaper features that I can’t find on the 8 4. Alexa App and overall UI in general is just a bit... eh. The “skills” take is strange to me. Having multiple user profiles is a nightmare if you want to use more than one amazing account (can you?) The google home UI is extremely simple simple, app, accounts, and all. Overall, I feel like I’m nitpicking, and I am. I’d buy this over and over.

That is the Echo Show. I actually bought two of them in 1 week. This one and the 10"" one. The sound is awesome coming from such a small box! The setup and integration with other Alexa devices is also better than expected. I bought this one as a clock for the bedroom. I listen to music at night and wanted good sound (and a clock). Here's the rub. This device has an 8 inch screen. On my little phone I can see the clock and what's playing. On this comparatively huge screen, I have to pick either ""clock"" or ""what's playing"".

The calling feature is also neat, even though I don't have any friends. Cons: I was expecting something more like a smartphone with chunky Bluetooth speakers attached.

If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio. After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down. All that said, it works fine, if you don't mind having your calls recorded, your phone compromised, and essentially allowing a sophisticated eaves-dropping device in your home.

Primary reason that I bought the Echo Show. Have 5 Nest cameras around the house and it’s nice to be able to ask to show each one instead of whipping out the phone to view them when I get motion alerts. There’s a bit of lag but that’s expected since you have to link the accounts and there’s some latency. One thing to note is a simple rescan of devices in the Alexa app will not detect a newly added camera. For that you have to disable the skill then reenable it to relink the account and detect the new camera. You’d figure a simple rescan should find the new camera but not that simple. The Echo Show compliments other Echo Dots and Echo around the house. The screen quality while watching videos and Prime movies is really crisp.

So now I turned off notifications for our bedroom Echo dot, but that also disables its ability to be used with the Drop In feature. So now when I am in the kitchen I cannot talk to the bedroom Dot with drop in , as It is disabled.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2020,Seth C,"I really thought this would be a game changer for our house. I bought two of these during the Cyber Monday sale. After a couple of months, I can say that these devices don't live up to their potential. It's all about what you what you are looking for in a product. When I see an 8"" HD screen on an Echo, I assume I will get good use out of that screen. However, watching videos is not something the Echo Show 8 does well. You can only watch videos with pre-installed apps. So basically, Prime Video and Hulu (for now). If you go to websites using a browser, you still can't access any videos. It looks like Amazon purposely limited these devices with apps and abilities. The screen does add some nice features. You can add your own background photos. You can view visuals of weather and time/timers. I do enjoy being able to keep a recipe on the screen while cooking. Unfortunately, the screen also seems to serve as an advertisement display for Amazon. You can't get away from the ""Try Alexa..."" permanently on the screen. There are also a ton of ads for recipes, trending stories, etc.. Luckily you can turn some of those off. It mostly seems like a waste of a screen with today's technology and apps. The speaker is definitely a plus. They sound better than I anticipated. But there are plenty of good speakers for this price or less, including Amazon devices. Voice command technology has only come so far. There are still a lot of commands that return a ""I can't help you with that..."" despite the simplicity of the request. The bottom line (from my experience), don't waste the money on something that could be a lot better for the price. You'll notice the Echo Show 8's limitations more than its abilities. If you want voice command and a speaker, get a dot or Echo. If you're looking for video integrated with voice command, it's not quite there yet. If I could do it over, I probably would've rather customized a tablet that can do everything.",Should be better
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2020,Stylishchica,"So this was supposed to be a great way to stay in touch especially during quarantine. LOTS of people have posted problems with ""The contact is not available"" and hanging up immediately but the solution on Amazon says things like check your wifi and stuff but never answers the question. This problem occurs when using voice, if you use the touch screen you can make the call. BUT another problem is if you share Amazon Prime with your mom, when your brother tries to call your mom the Show calls ALL devices on the prime membership. Even my 2 Echo Plus and my 2 dots and my mom's Echo Plus and my mom's Show devices. UGH. We may return all 3, or maybe just deal with it.

I have used the echo show 5 for the last year and have enjoyed it a lot. A few things I have noticed right away on the echo 8 (outside the obvious larger screen). Set up process has been reworked since the echo 5 I has been reworked a bit and the keyboard layout for the 5 is so easy to  work. The Audio is better! less bass distortion during audio play. I did notice the official stand for the echo show 5 does fit the echo 8 as well. I'm using it until the stand for the 8.

I was nervous with everyone complaining on certain features that can’t be turned off like the suggestions, but I love them and you only see them shortly after interacting with Alexa. I had no idea Alexa could do so many things so her suggestions are very helpful in that matter too (plus there’s an app too for customizing shortcuts and commands). Usually I see landscape pictures and after awhile, the screen just goes black with a white numerical clock displayed after a few hours of no interaction. She can hear me in the living room (open concept) with no issues and even down the hall if I’m loud enough. We have it hooked up to our Ring device and response time is really quick.

Germain,"I use this Alexa Echo on my home-office desk, and it is a handy assistant.  I can just ask Alexa little things that I might ordinarily look up.  It saves me the time and distraction of opening a new window on my computer.  Alexa plays WQXR for me during the day and always posts something like an album cover or some kind of illustration that informs me of each musical selection that is being played.  I can ask Alexa to calculate numbers or define words or whatever.  I can ask Alexa to remind me of deadlines or important to-dos or set a timer for certain things.  The video component will allow me to see news clips or explanatory YouTube vidoes through Firefox.  I can ask for suggestions for Dinner tonight and she will offer a few recipes, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and then save the recipe where I can pull it up later for reference while cooking.  (Of course, this requires taking the Alexa Echo to my kitchen.)  Oh, and I love the classic art selection that scrolls across the screen.  It is significant to point out that the Alexa screen is not dark when not in use - it scrolls a selection of pictures in accordance with the subject matter you choose, along with news headlines and little suggestions of trivial things you can do with Alexa.  I am sure there are other neat tricks that I have not discovered yet, but it is fun to try things as I think of them to see what Alexa can do, and it is very nice to have the video option.",Nice desk companion

Granted, I haven't tried out all the features yet so I may update this later.  The two items that knocked the two stars off were the SiriusXM and Amazon Music song displays. While the Echo plays SiriusXM fine, it fails to display artist or song information.  One of the main reasons I bought this device was for that feature.  I even found in the customer Q&A an answer that it would do this.  Every item in my house that has a display shows song and artist, so I'm doubting it's all that difficult to do.  Please add this in any future software updates. When playing Amazon music I can get the words of the songs to display, but this feature times out after one minute and goes back to the home screen.  Why in the world would you do this?  I can't imagine how the developers thought this was a good idea.  Another thing to fix, please. Other than these two items I've had no issues, but these were big items for me.  If neither of these are a concern to you than I would fully recommend this device.",Nice Item with a couple of flaws

My 8 year old Granddaughter set it up for me, it's that simple. The images on screen are sharp and clear, her voice is the same. It integrated with my other Alexa devices without issue and to date has been so much fun. My Grandgirls have played all sort of games and watch several program from Amazon Prime, they enjoy it very much. I'm still learning all that Alexa can do and help me with. I ask if she could clean my house. She said she would but didn't have arm, so to compensate, she offered to play 'Cleaning' music.  It made me laugh, the music was great but didn't motivate me to get things done. Oh, I forgot, it works exceptionally with the Ring. I highly recommend purchasing, you won't be disappointed.",So glad I purchased
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Aug 2020,Steve M,"Bought the Echo Show 8 because it was on sale, even though I already owned the original Echo Show.  However, after a few days of playing, the Echo Show took over my old machine’s place of honor. In short, the picture is better, the sound is better, and the Wi-Fi radio is MUCH better. The days of Alexa sometimes dropping a word or two from a song because her Wi-Fi was weak are OVER:  the Echo Show 8 has never dropped anything.  Voice recognition is better too — probably because of the radio issue, but maybe because this machine is smarter.  And the speakers sound great, even though they aren’t front-facing like the original.  Original Echo Show is moving to my office, where the wireless signal is much stronger. Get this one!",Better than the original!
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2020,Joshua Awesome,"I was hoping this would be more of a tool instead of a screen alexa. The forced ads on screen are so obnoxious. Having a picture frame would be wonderful but the pretty picture turns into ads or ""news"" which I have no interest in. Basically Amazon is putting visual ad devices in our homes. If I had paid full price, I would be very unhappy. For the discounted price, I am okay with it. The sound is decent for the small box and when I am listening to music, it is fun seeing the name of the track on screen. I have 7 alexa's around the house and this one is the most annoying one. My dream was that I could pull up my entire spotify account and scroll through my playlists and control them.

What's the point of purchasing this, if there's limited content available. I've search for the best apps out there, and there's nothing spectacular or new. Just video conferencing, a clock, limited weather, etc. I would think there would be a map feature, since it's so visual. Nothing. Would I buy this again...I don't know. Probably not.

Will be gradually upgrading our echo dot 3 to Show 8's as sales come up.  Didn't jump on Show 5 as it was too small of screen and didn't want to shell out big bucks for Show so the Show 8 is a great value especially with current free Dot 3 promo.

Also the clock display need more customization like the 5”.  You can’t even put the date on there.  Only time and weather.  That bites bad.  Hope they do software update and fix this.

As penned by Carole King and Gerry Goffin (and recorded by The Monkees), there's a line that directs your attention to Mr. Green who is so serene he has a TV in every room. It's 2020. We need to update the line to ""he has Alexa in every room."" I do. I love the convenience. In the pandemic, Alexa has become my research assistant, my best friend and--even though she only responds ""That's really sweet"" when I tell her I love her--my better half. My favorite, though, (don't tell the others) is the Echo Show 8. The sound is phenomenal for a small unit and it doubles as a desk clock, temperature gauge and recipe book. I can look up maps and driving routes for when it's safe to leave the house again. And if I had any friends, I'm sure we'd be talking on video calls. Plus, by using AmazonSmile, my purchase helped benefit the ASPCA. Win win. It was an excellent Prime Day purchase and I'll probably get more to replace the other Echo devices eventually.

Brackley,"The larger screen is great for an older person like me. The camera angle is a little high and not adjustable...so when you remote view (drop in) on the Show, you get the ceiling so its not good for monitoring a room unless you plan on sitting the device on the floor. So the camera was made for video chat more than it was for the purpose I needed it for. The screen contents that others have mentioned in other posts is a little annoying. I do wish I could contribute my own content, my own news feeds, etc. So I ended up disabling just about everything but the weather. Photos are limited to Facebook and Amazon. I do NOT want any of my systems integrated with Facebook, but as an Apple iCloud user, it would be nice to add iCloud Photos to the options. The screen is a little bright for a nightstand device, but I have gotten used to it. I do like the way--I think--it senses motion and provides additional details on the screen. Or maybe its timed?? But it seems that when I enter the room, the screen brightens the display and shows the weather. I do wish the home automation controls were easier to access direct from the screen. The navigation takes some getting used to...the down arrow at the top is dedicated to device settings, and the arrow on the right used to accessing the information panels. I would like to be able to add a Panel for the home automation and specify which devices I want to see. So far it has accomplished what I needed...a clock radio :-O for the bedside that can access my music (iTunes) and activate my security cameras by voice. The ability to drop in on the room was missed by the angle of the camera, and the lack of custom controls/display elements I hope will be added in the future.","Nice screen, but a few things to work out for me..."

After setting up and using for a few weeks I am overall disappointed as it feels more like a prototype than an 8th version Pros -Good voice recognition -Speakers are great -Works as a good clock -Works with Ring Cons -Overall choppy. Alexia can’t do a lot of things. Also freezes regularly and I have to unplug and plug back in -I wanted to use as a baby monitor with my foscam. I was only able to set up 2 of my 3 cameras for some reason as the 3rd camera wouldn’t discover. When I view  the camera it stays up for about 5 minutes then the screensaver comes on.

If you are a Spotify user, I would seriously reconsider using echos if you plan on using them for multi room audio. There are multiple page threads of echo users complaining about this. Amazon says it is a Spotify problem, and Spotify says it's an Amazon problem. I'm pretty tech savvy, but this isn't something users can fix. I had to pick up an Amazon music subscription to get around this. 3) there is no way to set a default volume for Alexas voice. If you went to sleep with low volume, she will whisper responses to you the next day so you can't hear her.

That being said the sound is great, i use it by itself or i have an echo dot plugged into my stereo i can accompany it with, i really love the setup. If you want a show for the speaker get the 8. If you just want the functionality i recommend the 5. I got my parents both 5s and they’re actually more customizable and faster loading than my 8. When i use my dads and then mine the 8 feels pretty sluggish, which is only an issue if you’re watching videos or navigating menus, things i don’t do often. The big display is nice, but you’re severely limited on face options. I want to say the 5 has at least 20-25, this one has closer to 5; several picture themes, an option for a single photo, or an option to shuffle an album. After seeing all the faces on the 5 i was very excited for the customizability on this but it just isn’t there. These are all downfalls i can live with though, it wakes me up, tells me what i need to know, and sounds good. That’s all i need",Speakers are better than the 5 but that’s about the only thing

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2019,T,"Says it’s compatible with Netflix and YouTube. It is not, but If you want a kindle that plays good music. Then thats what it basically is. What’s up with the camera on the side, didn’t they learn from people’s complaints on echo show 5. Also why do people have to jump through hoops and navigate all over the web to find someone to guide them so the annoying suggestions get removed from lower part of the screen.  Stop making it so difficult for people to remove your advertising. We already purchased the item, stop using it to try to sell your stuff, its not right. Instead of teaching alexa to tell new jokes, teach it to understand common requests. Still needs work and if you have a kindle 7 or 8, use it instead.",Its a kindle with better sound.
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2020,Massage,"Have used this for few months now. Not sure if the item was returned or was new due to packaging. It wasn’t registered to anyone so I assume new. It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That’s very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don’t bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can’t fully use the device. Hopefully future updates make things run smoother.",Bulky and glitchy

Nothjng is outstanding but it gives you the convenience of a command center with a screen. Alexa's way of operating with skills is just not as easy to operate as using Hey Google. You gotta remember the skill name and tell Alexa exactly what you want Alexa to tell each and every skill to do something. Its not natural and you will have to memorize the name of skills, as a person who uses Google and Siri. It just doesnt make sense for me to have to learn and remember all the skills.

It has lots of bass, but little mids or highs. -the screen use is still very basic. for ex. It has no idea what's on the screen saver images So mine would cycle through famous art and I would ask it what I was looking at and it had no answer.

Easily linked with my iPad, iPhone, doorbell camera and security cameras.  My only complaint so far (and the reason I knocked a star off) is that it is difficult to stop the ""try this"" suggestions from popping up on the screen.  After some online searching I found that this seems to be a common complaint. The only way I found to get the suggestions to completely stop has been to keep the device in ""do not disturb"" mode all the time, which then means you cannot drop in on the device from another room. I don't mind if the Echo device on my desk advertises Alexa's abilities,  but I want the ones on my nightstand and living room table to just be a clock when not in use.",Quick/Easy set up.

But every time I try to make a call, it only calls the person's cell phone instead of their Show device.  I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.

What I like about this one: beautiful screen and great audio. What I don’t like: issues with video skills (Nooie cameras, Euphy doorbell) - often times it has a hard time connecting, or drops out. Also, even if I am next to it, if my echo in the next room hears me, it will often respond that this type of device can’t show the video skill I am asking about. In general, the integration between all of the devices should be much much better, I often find myself getting more frustrated than it may be worth, and end up pulling up what I need on my phone.

Sometimes slow in responding and has to be told same thing multiple times.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jan 2020,S. Lee,Our son in law got everyone in our family an Echo. We live in different households in different towns so it’s great for connecting with family.  Our favorite feature is the photo album feature. The screen continuously goes through our Facebook photo posts or our Amazon photo library.  It’s great a moment around the house when an old photo pops up. We also like some of the basic features like the lists we can create by talking to Alexa and the local temperatures.  The speakers are good quality so my husband listens to his favorite music on the Alexa even though we have built in speakers in our home.  There are still some features we haven’t familiarized ourselves with but with what we experienced so far it’s great.  The only drawback is the screen is tilted so we have stand in front of the kitchen counter where it’s located. I understand there’s a separate swivel stand you can buy but I don’t really want to pay extra for it.,Love the Alexa Echo
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2020,Brian,I love the Alexa products. I've got one in about every room and I'm slowly replacing dots with shows. Super professional and tidy packaging which I love. It's big and the screen is great quality. The only issue I have the echo shows is that the angle of the screen makes it so that the camera always points up so depending on where you're mounting it or setting it it's always impossible to get anything useful on the camera whether I'm dropping in remotely or video chatting. This is why I chose 4 stars. Otherwise it's been great. I can watch prime video or Hulu and more while I'm in the kitchen. It's fast and haven't had any funky speed issues. I love it.,Awesome product. Only thing I don't like is the angle of the camera. Otherwise it's great!

The integration between Echo Show and my Wemo switch and Arlo was super easy especially given this is my first time trying out smart home stuff.  Everything was done in 5 minutes.  Speaker of this unit is surprisingly great.  Sound is clear and rich better than my portable Marshall speaker.  Quality of the 8"" display is very decent for the price.

Physically, the device has a bigger footprint than I'd like. I think it should come with a base or have the angle adjustable without one. The video calls are pretty good though, nice and clear, somewhat easy to use so that was exciting. The camera cover is an excellent part of the design. All devices should come with that built in! And the fact that the cover is bright so you can see when it's activated from across the room is also smart. I like that it can show visuals of course but am so disappointed that it doesn't seem to show webpages or my files.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Nov 2020,Norbert F.,"Surprisingly displeased with the quality. This is supposed to be a 'smart' device but Alexa seems to have a massive headache problem to do the simplest tasks like pairing to a device to control. Unacceptable old style bad interface. I had to research for 30 mins + around the web every time I needed to add something like my TV. Alexa would not recognize my password that was 100% correct. When I did, functionality is extremely limited, can't actually turn on TV, only control when already on - can't tell it to open Netflix or Hulu at a particular show, have to go grab the remote after that (what's the point). Have to provide lengthy specific instructions ""Alexa, ask LG to go to Living room TV and play Netflix"" Can't actually watch Netflix on Show device screen, function limited to Prime video & YouTube. Even then with YouTube, it's via a painfully slow browser. The whole interface is like and old 2005's weird tablet. Horrible Alexa fails to recognize voice constantly, sometimes have to scream for detection. I have a Google assistant device right next to it that never fails for recognition. Overall, this is clearly in infant stages and not worth the money. I really thought that owning one of these would be like having the most revolutionary current stage of tech for a 'smart' home - turns out it's so bad that for the most part you're better off doing things with the existing actually good tech like smart phones.",Wait for more generations before considering buying
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Feb 2020,Tlctoni,Has good sound.  I like display setting and size of clock.  I like news info the scrolls across so I’m case I want to hear about new info I can. It won’t do this if you are viewing your camera or calendar or on a call.  You can go to settings and home content and just uncheck what you don’t want to see.  You do have to pair your iPhone and go to Apple.com and get a temporary password to link your iCloud calendar but it worked.  I did have to change the name of two camera.  Alexa did not understand the word Wyze.  I had to add app for photos but got it done.  It is quicker to open a camera on echo show then grabbing your phone and opening and app and scrolling to correct camera if you need to see who is outside in middle of night.

I think those that would get the most use from it are families that want to connect via video and all have alexa.  I suspect it makes for a nice world intercom.  Sadly other features are just too unfriendly and i would prefer to access them via other means or too limited to be attractive.  I think the show is probably a couple years away from being a really good investment for most people. The device is attractive and what it does is pretty reliable.  With amazon behind the product this could easily swing the other way quickly and there are still probably a fair number of people who would find value here.,promising device but not ready for prime time

I'm very disappointed with the lack of support for this problem. Update: After going around and around with Amazon Tech. Support with this issue I've been left with that it's all basically ""user error"". In other words somehow the way I took my photos was why the show could not ""show"" an unblurred photo.

But if I upload multiple photos from the same device the pictures were taken from  to the show via the Amazon photo app the photos are blurred on the borders and sides.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,Tommy's PopPop,"We live out beyond the suburbs in the rural hinterland with marginal internet connectivity. So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release. Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well. Negatives: can a review be only good things? Well, thinking hard, the two things we ""dislike"" are the plug end of the power cable takes up a bit of room at the outlet but we managed to squeeze it in; and the integrated camera / display / base unit is fixed - so you either need to be standing in the angle of view for the video chats, or tilt the Echo Show forward and place a pencil or ruler under the back edge to adjust the field of view.  It's not a problem when reading or surfing - only for the video chats. Bonus: I did not realize that the Echo Show would know about the Echo Dot we have upstairs. The first time the Grandkids called, the Dot reported ""call from the Bean"" so we knew to run downstairs and take the incoming video chat. Nice integration, nice online help that explains all the things you can try (or not).

As several have said the screen constantly suggests new uses for Alexa.  This doesn't bother me as I don't intend to watch the screen when I am not using the unit.  My only con for the Echo Show is that it must be plugged in to use.  No USB or other charging.  Absent that, no complaints and highly recommended.  Jeff, how about a charging port next time?",Useful tool and easy to set up

Used the comments from other reviewers to disable to Alexa hints at the bottom of the screen that many reviewers complained about.  Our Show rotates nature or travel pictures automatically, showing a large time display when in non-active mode.  When we asked Alexa for information or other skill, the Show will rotate through the various items we have set up to display (local sports scores, weather, etc.), and then it returns to the rotating pictures and time display until the next command is issued.  We just love the Show 8's size, performance, and visual display.",Great Addition to Alexa Family

The audio is superb considering it’s coming out of a small case. It’s not “Bose” or “Infinity” but good sound for sure. It’s nice to ask “Alexa” for a movie and get it.

The product itself is quality.  It has amazing sound.  I'm not too fond of the navigation though.  It's not hard to navigate just awkward in my opinion.

I like that you can turn the camera off for privacy.  We have an Echo in the living room for music, firetv for the tvs in the living room and a firestick in bedroom.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jun 2020,Steffi,I am really pleased with the Echo Show 8. It’s the first Show I have tried.  I am an Echo user so I am pretty well versed with the usual Alexa commands and capabilities.  I really like some things gained with the show like the visual countdown on a timer... easier than asking Alexa how much time is left although you still can! I enjoy the recipes that you can pull up instantly.  The ability to add ingredients from the recipe to your shopping list is helpful too.  I’ve been setting up my slide show with all my photos from Amazon photos. I love video calls with my family too.  My only wish was that I could have afforded to purchase the larger sized one. I love it so much It’s smaller size is the only downside.,Great addition to echo family!

If you're even on the fence about getting one, DO IT. Granted, I'm a little more techy than most and now have an echo device in every room of the house (even the bathrooms), but it's such a great device to have. I love that it always displays the time and temperature outside and can scroll through my pictures from Facebook. Plus, the sound is out of this world. It rivals my Level speaker from Samsung. Sometimes I'm worried my neighbors are going to come yell at me.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,Raul,"What I like about the Echo Show 8. What I most like is that it has a display. I already had a echo 1st generation and a echo Plus. I put off buying the echo dot due to it’s tiny size screen, so I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 due it’s screen size and sales price which included a free echo dot. Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn’t see on the other’s such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8” screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking. I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show. It’s also nice to have the ability to see the other person you call when both have echo devices with videos capabilities, leaving my phone free for other use. Resuming; what I most like of the echo show 8 is that it has a decent size screen which is the only thing that distinguish it from the others echo devices which does not have a screen. Voice recognition is no better then the others echo devices and I find the the sound quality is not better then the sound I got from my Echo plus even if it does have stereo 2.5” speakers on either side. What I most find disturbing of the Echo Show 8 is the Constance, annoying messages which appears at the bottom on the screen and which their isn’t any way to eliminate. Amazon please do a download update within the menu options to turn this feature OFF. It is stressing me out.",It has a decent size screen.

The picture quality is great. 3. When I ask a question, the answer is on the screen as Alexa reads it. Great for someone with hearing issues! 4. Most questions I've asked have been answered well. Sometimes I don't phrase a question quite right, I guess. 5. It looks great on my kitchen counter and doesn't take up a lot of room. Any complaints? Haven't found any yet.",Love it!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2020,Kmac76,"I don't write many reviews, but I almost didn't buy this because of the sort of dire warnings from some reviewers about the supposedly horrible ""Things to Try"" that are forced on buyers, like you're paying Amazon to have them furnish you with a never ending commercial. I bought one anyway. Two elements of important context as to why this is helpful for me is 1) I am one of the many people who have been turned into 100% work from home employees when i used to be 33% work from home, and very much miss the dynamic of interaction and getting out of the house. Disclaimer: although I am grumbling about this, I feel very lucky to have a job, and would feel badly if someone read this who has been laid off, affected by COVID, and wished they too could be ""bothered"" by all the meetings and the paycheck that comes with it. With that said, I have found the volume of online meetings I participate in stressful and unpleasant. I have managed teams in the past, and were I a manager at the moment I would limit my team to 4 meetings a day, max. Whenever I am doing my best work, ie focused work that requires a lot of thought and blocking other things out, I was finding I was missing meetings, which is very embarrassing, bad for your professional reputation, and just the sort of thing that sucks...it ruins your day to a degree. I love the flexibility of being able to integrate Microsoft personal, Office 365, Google, Apple, and/or on Premises Exchange Server-based calendars to my Alexa app, and have my echo show announce when I have meetings coming, and to display my calendar for the day visually without having to open anything on my laptop. I haven't had my Echo show 8 long, but I can say, the last missed meeting I had was the day prior to my Echo show arriving and taking up residence on my home office desk. I read yesterday that later this year, Zoom calls will be supported on the echo show and that's even better. The cost of personal Webex devices , Microsoft Teams soundbars etc makes it the sort of thing that's executive only in terms of the company footing the bill, and yet having a separate, dedicated device, which I have had in the past, makes a big differences. It is impossible to explain, you have to experience it to understand the difference, but it is somehow less stressful to join a video call on a dedicated device - I mean a LOT less stressful than using software on you pc, mac, or especially a mobile device. The second reason this was worth it to me, is that I have invested a lot of time and effort over the past 2-3 years in smart devices in my home. When building a home in 2015, I was the only one on my new street who did not invest in an alarm system. My builder thought i was crazy. But that was when alarm systems were thousands of dollars, and much less functional than what's available today. Now, I have a Nest Outdoor IQ cam on every side of my house. These are expensive devices, and yet the combined cost is a fraction of what a security system would have been. I use a lot of Phillips Hue bulbs, and it's noticeably reduced my energy bill, and also given Alexa Guard motion senors for the 3 areas where i bought them for hue reasons. I have a bunch of other smart home devices, but right there I have a great use case, and there's many more like it. Kind of like the dedicated video device, you cannot verbalize properly how much more effective voice assistants are made when you add a visual display on top on them. It makes them, in my view, about 10x more useful. At less than $100, I think this is a bargain, and an excellent device.",Great Product for those who work from home and/or are invested in smart home products

Just would be nice if you can activate echoes voice when touching the screen. That is the only annoying thing to me. You are able to stop most advertisements. The only one that does not turn off is the one before the screen turns off. It only stays on for less then a minutw than goes away. The screen adjusts according to the lighting environment. Its a descent size. Not too big and not to small. I have one in every room of the house. I leave the camera shutter slide closed on all of them so the hackers aren't able to see me. I like the product. Hopefully they can make an update to activate Alexa's voice when having touched the screen to activate it. The speakers sound good for the size of the item.

For my use I mainly use them for home automation and for listening to Amazon music.  But lately I have been using them for keeping up on the news and watching other videos on them. This device works very well and if on a budget it's the best one to go with as it performs very similar to the show 2 just with a smaller screen and slightly less powerful speaker.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2020,Jonathan Okie,"I bought a Show to replace my original Echo device and I have found the experience to be lacking. There's no point in getting a show as the visual and UI elements are not well thought out, buggy, and lack functionality. It's amazing that you cannot ask Alexa to show you pictures of something; nor can you ask to show videos. If you want to do that, you have to load a browser on the show and enter a search using the keyboard. And, simply asking to open the ""browser"" doesn't work. You have to remember which browser you installed - Silk or Firefox. So that's about as far as I got - asking to see images and videos - before realizing this thing doesn't do much. The stuff that I'm used to using like Flash Briefing no longer work. Show freezes while trying to play.

The smudges are instant and precipitant.  If you use the Show 8 regularly, you will need to clean it two or three times a day.  If you happen to use a lotion, count on even more frequent cleaning.  The auto dim feature is a love-hate relationship.  It's good to dim the screen at midnight, in the dark but when it happens at 3:00 PM in a dim room, it is very annoying.  On the other hand, the speakers are excellent for this type of devise.  The screen resolution is adequate for viewing almost anything.  It's not HDR, 4K but it is a very watchable view.

At first I thought the tag to try new things was irritating, but they piqued my curiosity. I have tried some new recipes and resurrected others. It interfaces with the Amazon clock. Very handy if you use an air fryer toaster combination where toast and fryer items can burn quickly. Probably my favorite feature is the timer interface between the Fire Cube and the Echo Show - I can turn off timers from either of them. Haven't tried with the Echo Dots or Flex yet.

Before I  bought the Echo Show I had a echo dot in all rooms of house except kitchen where I had the tower style echo. I had no issues in over 2 years with any of them.  I replaced the one in kitchen with the Echo Show and things started going down the drain fast. 1. Occassionally it will wake up on it's own with something out of the blue, like ""it can not find on audio"" or it will just start playing some random music. 2. It will play all my play lists on the everywhere group except one titled ""me"" this one will only play on the show. 3.  Tring to get it to print something like my shopping list is 95% of time a fail. It will say ""ok printing your shopping list"" then nothing happens 4. I can be just 4 inches from the show facing it but the echo dot in livingroom which is about 30 feet away, responds instead. 5, 30% of time does not understand me","Lack of response when close to show, but a echo dot far away responds instead"

The Show 5 is on my desk and the Show 8 is in the kitchen and is easier to see when used for recipes and videos. I get my morning Flash Briefing now on this device and it has advantages over my Echo Plus. The main being a few of the segments have videos that are not able to be seen on the Echo Plus of course. I like the way the Show devices not only tell you the weather but give you a screen with a few hourly forecasts. The ability to see a short video on the recipe prep is also quite handy. I like to say Hi to friends in the morning while I am making breakfast and it is certainly better with video.,Larger screen than my Show 5 which works better in the kitchen...

For some reason, these options are not available on Show8 I planned to use this device as speakers for my FireTV stick and projector.

It was easy to set up. Alexa doesn't know everything and it's somewhat disappointing that she doesn't understand some things I'd consider obvious. One of the best features for our family is no more paper shopping list! Simply tell Alexa whenever I think of something, and the list is updated on the Echo and my phone; a simple tap as the item is purchased removes it from the list. The Alexa app is like an extension of Echo. It makes the lists available on both our phones. Be cautious of some of the apps, or skills, used by Alexa because they're not all free and you don't know in advance. I'll get a pop-up in the app and am still uncertain how to opt out. I still have some security concerns but overall we are having fun with our new Echo and can't wait to try all the features.",Caution: Can Be Addictive

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jul 2020,Optimus Prime,"This is my 10th Alexa capable speaker device and my 4th Echo Show device.  With each iteration, for the most part, the Echo Show line continues to refine and improve upon its predecessors.  Actually the Echo Spot took a backward step since it can't (won't) run Hulu - how weird is that (inserting gratuitous complaint on this issue here).  All crickets at Amazon on Hulu as to why since it was playing Hulu a few versions prior. Back to the 8.  Its great.  Sound quality is super.  Still a bit of directional responsiveness with the microphone resulting in Alexa not understanding a command on occasion resulting in her assuming she heard an entirely different command thereby pursuing to act upon it causing stress, anxiety and general panic from her commander.  I'll confess to not having spent to much time adjusting microphone sensitivity and experimenting with other optimization methods.  Bottomline is 99% of the time she understands what has been requested.  On occasion, given certain ambient noise conditions such as a fan running and given the relative angle when speaking to the device, Alexa can get a bit confused.  Try to encourage her to do better and tell her its not all her fault citing the possibility of a hardware issue beyond her control. I would recommend to the product team to continue to optimize space through miniaturization of electronics and speaker placement in order to pull some of the base ""fatness"" off the platform. If you don't have an Echo device, or any Alexa based device for that matter, I recommend getting an Echo Show 8 in order to add the visual dimension of Alexa's world.  It also makes for a great small screen streaming machine including watching television and YouTube streams.  Great in kitchens, garages, bathrooms, etc.",8 is Great!

From  asking what the current weather forecast is to creating a shopping list to asking to play music is a snap! There were a few instances that my questions were not understood with a response of ""I don't know that"".  Which was easily rectified with rephrasing the question.  The other amazing feature  is you can video chat with another through  the Alexa app from your cell phone.  I can see I will gradually rely on Alexa more and more to help me with the things I took for granted in the past (I'm 60 years old and didn't grow up with the internet)  so having to look up everything myself will definitely alter my future.

It doesn't even work great locally in my house from upstairs and downstairs. I'm a network engineer and have designed two of the networks in question and I'm positive it's not the networks fault, but probably the wireless capability of the device its self. My other two gripes are this is a Alexa device and i should be able to fully manage my Alexa equipment and features from one of these. In my mind it should have all of the features of the mobile app. It clearly doesn't. I've witnessed Google homes work flawlessly crystal clear and super high quality. Also I recently added a IOT wireless vlan to my home network. I. Officially have 7 Alexa devices in my household. I should be able to change my wifi for all of my Alexa devices from one location not manually using three different methods across the various devices. I value being security concious and using super complex passwords and changing them frequent enough to make sure I'm rotating through them on a certain intervals.

Sound is great, Screen is great. Drove myself a little nuts trying to set up bluetooth the old way through the phone not knowing there were settings onscreen that took care of that. I hate the ""Try this Skill"" suggestions but everything I found so far is an enhancement to the tall tube type Echo. I thought the Echo Dot was included but looking back Amazon wants to make sure you're paying attention and press a button to get one. If you're giving them away to Show 8 buyers then give everybody who orders a Show 8 a Dot. Bottom line is this is the best Echo so far and if you want an Alexa buy this one.",Another great Alexa

Romero,"I purchased the Echo Show 8 HD smart display with Alexa for my college aged son to use in his apartment. He uses  an Alexa Dot in his bedroom and I thought this would make a useful addition to the kitchen. It took a little more effort than he thought it should to get connected. However, after a few attempts he made a video call to me. The picture is not the best. He did say it is more grainy than expected. However, the sound and durability is good. He has owned it for approximately 4 months and still uses it regularly. I am going to buy another one because I really like the one that I purchased for him. ***I do suggest purchasing the stand with it.",Quality made

First of all it IS compatible with my Blink cameras. It IS compatible with Kasa light switches. I went away for a few days and turn the GUARD on.

I can also Drop in on my device and my family member who has an Echo or Echo Show for face to face, you have to set up permissions on drop in for security and can set up times allowed.

This Echo Show also is much more responsive!! For example, one of the prime reasons I was an early adopter of the first Echo Show was to watch cooking videos & see my Security Cameras while cooking. This new Echo Show almost immediately displays my security cams on command while the original almost always failed to connect without being rebooted first. I really like the privacy switch to cover the camera without having to place electrical tape. The sound quality is good, not like a home audio system, but still good.

Good quality for the price and easy to install. The integration with all the other devices was really straight forward. Only issue is to receive video calls from alexa installed in the phone that is giving a couple of errors. Update, a flyer was included in the box saying that upon completion of the review a GiftCard will be sent. It was.a scam, and thisnleads me to have doubts about the quality around the fulfilment and boxing of Amazon products. I was told afterward Amazon does not offer incentives to provide feedback, hence, the only reason now is that nobody is checking if inappropriate material is included....

It was a gift for her so that’s all that matters. My 2 year old constantly wants it to play songs.  It recognizes voice way better than the traditional echo I bought her.  The sound is great too. I don’t think it’s that great but I don’t really get into technology. It plays music and stuff on voice command. It can control your lights or automate your house. I think that’s kind of stupid and lazy. It’s cool to just pick a song or something but it just seems to me to be a gimmick that doesn’t do much. It’s worth buying on Black Friday or cyber Monday. That’s when I got it.,It’s cool. I guess.

It's great for eating breakfast at the kitchen counter and watching a video. SO much better than reading a cereal box! The sound is quite good but a little to much bass, even after adjusting the equalizer. It is a good size screen, easy to watch. I'm glad I didn't get the five inch version.

I decided to move this one to my master bathroom and get the new generation Show 10 for the kitchen.

The sound will not play. When I did a bit of searching, apparently this is a common issue where the fix is to unplug the Show and plug it back in(even then sound may go out from time to time).

I also purchased one for my daughter who is away at college and we video chat several times every week. When playing music, the sound is pretty decent, but I've hooked up stand-alone speakers which makes it better. Also have one in the bedroom we use for alarms, announcing the temperature and weather forecast for the day and headline news to start the morning. When one of us is in the bedroom and the other in the office on the other side of the house, we use Alexa to talk.  If you are worried about privacy, you can block the camera and mute the microphone.

As a whole this product is a great addition to the product line BUT it clearly is fleshing out issues. 1) Doesn't listen as actively as the traditional echo. Has missed and misheard a lot. 2) you have to update the settings or the screen will make you feel like it has some type of spastic disorder. The standard view moves too fast and tries too hard to tell you too much until you fix it. 3) I have had a few weird issues technically with the product connecting to Amazon music or connecting my phone.

And installing the device is insanely easy. What I don't like: - I really hate that being rivals with Google, they won't integrate Google search or play YouTube directly. You must first open a browser. - One important reason for why I bought echo show8 was to be able to monitor my front security camera, but sadly I found out that when it does, it buffers the video like 15 seconds... no good when I need to see right away who's knocking the the front door. About echo show itself is very good. Sound is acceptable for its size and price. But overall, it's a great buy. I love the fact that I can fiscally shut off the echo's camera.

I can also play Prime video shows, play music and see what the latest weather is.

Uses the same resolution as the full sized model, and has comparable sound quality.

I love that the routines can be set up to activate different features with only a single command... and its TOUCHLESS! Wooo! Each morning, after I dismiss my alarm clock alarm by voice, Alex plays the date, time, weather, and my flash briefing, which you can customize to be anything you want.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2020,Ben - Scrubs and Stuff LLC,I really wanted to like these things.  We bought 5 for the office to communicate and also integrate with ring.  When you make a call between devices the sound does not work on one or both devices.  Unplugging and plugging in does seem to work to reset the device but it just ends up happening again.  It does not end up being a reliable communication device.  Happened once with the ring doorbell as well.  Video appears but someone can't hear the other person and sometimes both ways.  Amazon tech support (remember this is made by Amazon) their only advice was a factory default reset.  I was hoping tech support would say - this is a known issue and here update the software and it will be fixed.  It is clearly a software issue that will hopefully get fixed at some point but enough people will need to complain before that happens.  After spending 90 minutes with tech support and no remedy (and no offer of any kind of compensation on these brand new devices) I suspect most will just grin and bear it and unplug their device and just deal with this poor functionality.  The tech guy acted like I was nuts when I called and a simple internet search shows people all over the place are having this issue.  Amazon always seems flashy and has some cool tech but I feel like it is consistently a disappointment.  Alright rant over - don't buy if you want to try to use this for calls or integrate with ring - it is not consistent.,Good intent but functionality not there - huge sound issues

If you have owned any of the echo products in the past, you pretty much know what youre getting here. Its Alexa with a screen. I picked up the Show 8 right after Christmas. It was bundled with a Dot for $79.99, and at that price it was a steal. The sound is pretty comparable to my gen 1 Echo Plus, and the 8"" touch screen is the perfect size for a kitchen or living room. It integrated well with my Nest home security system. I can call up a live feed from any camera and have it display on the Echo's screen. I also like that it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which enables me to hook it up to my stereo system and turns it into a front end for my hifi system. I'm taking away one star, only because it still lacks support for video apps like youtube, and many of the apps still need to be optimized for this device. Hopefully as updates roll in, support and screen intergration will increase. Overall I am very satisfied with my Show 8, especially at a sub $100 price point.",Great Overall

We have one in our bedroom and living room. I love that it has a shutter to physically close over the camera. We keep these closed constantly since we don't use it often. I love the sound of the speakers. It recognizes both mine and my boyfriends voice and addresses us by name. It is definitely creepy in a good way. The biggest downfall is what everyone has mentioned...the ""try"" this CONSTANTLY at the bottom of the screen. Other than that, it is great.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Jan 2020,InspectMyGadgets,"I bought this to compliment my Blink XT2 and I've read so many posts that it does not connect correctly, or only has audio feed but no video feed. Here's a few tips to get it to work properly. 1.) Make sure you have a strong wifi connection with proper bandwidth. 2.) Set your video quality resolution on the XT2's app to ""Saver"". There is a small noticeable difference in resolution/definition but if you want to show live video, this feature must be set to Saver mode for it to work. Until Blink or Echo Show updates it to accept high res. This is the only work around. The speaker is phenomenal, full amd rich that's comparable to the Echo itself.

There are many more good things versus bad things but there are 2 bad things that prevent me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. The most annoying of the 2 bad things is the constant message on the screen that says ""Try this ........"", if there is a way to remove this, I haven't found it and it's absurd that it never goes away. The 2nd bad thing is that it needs a built in stand. I know that Amazon wants to make more $ by selling a stand separately but without a built in stand, the price that Amazon wants for the Echo 8 isn't as great of a value as you would expect from Amazon. Without a stand of some type, the camera is useless unless you have something on your ceiling that you want the camera to see.  I created my own stand because I'm not giving Amazon more $ for something they should include.","if not for the constant try this message, I would probably give it 5 stars rather than 4"

Amazon—-Give us the capability to remove that. Supports web browser.  Not all cameras have “skills” so that they can be used.  However, I can access my cameras on the screen using the Silk Browser.  It would be nice if I can tell, in a routine, for Alexa to start the Silk Brower and start on a specific page or shortcut. Some of us want to do things that other people may not care to do.  However, if we can do it manually, or with our voice, then provide a way for us to do that in a routine.","When adding features, the Alexa app should support integrating those features into routines."

Now I have a smaller screen with fewer capabilities. I usually check that a product does what I want before buying, but considering that my phone, smart TV, laptop, desktop, and fire stick all have Netflix capability, it seemed pretty reasonable to assume this would as well.

I hate this. I should have kept my gen 1 echo that I used in trade in. Don’t buy this. Also it is missing simple features that the echo show 5 has such as the ability to customize the clock display. Instead you are forced into their boring idea of a layout and can’t add date or weather to the display. Echo Show 5 has these. Doesn’t make sense that developers would cut these features.

It's easier.  But it's a machine like any other; you have to learn how to use it.  Once you do it is truly amazing.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2019,JongBali,"I would say this is the best echo. It’s screen is just right. Not too small (echo show 5) and not too big (echo show). As I put it in my office desk it is perfect size. The sound is good, not great for its size. It has good bass when I set the bass to max in the equalizer sound setting. Having echo with screen is really helpful especially for me that I like listening to music, where I can see the lyrics when playing song on Amazon Music. I like to play music on different device not on my MacBook because I use my MacBook for coding, so playing music on dedicated device help me save some memory. The only issue I have is with youtube. It’s not easy to watch youtube as there is no youtube integration with the echo show. Opening youtube from the echo show browser is not straight forward. I wish amazon can work with google to have youtube integrated in the near future.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2020,Rick,"I received a Google home nest mini and wanted to add a smart screen to my lineup. I purchased two smart bulbs and a smart outlet to have some home automation. I decided I wanted to look into getting a smart screen/speaker and did a lot of research before my purchase. I like how a lot of devices work with Alexa. From my research I found that Google assistant has fewer choices for smart device compatibility but still a fair amount. I decided to purchase the echo show 8 while it was on sale. I figured if I didn't like it, I wasn't out the full amount. I opened the box, set it up and had it going in about 10 minutes. It seemed to work well and recognize my voice decently when there is zero other sounds in the room. If a tv is on or music is playing, even at a low volume, it has trouble understanding what I ask around 30% of the time. It can be very frustrating. The Google nest mini understands me way more often under the same conditions (roughly 90% of the time). I know the nest mini is a smart speaker but I would expect the same from a speaker as I would a screen. All in all I will most likely be sticking with Google products over Amazons products. Update. After a couple of weeks I still have issues with the echo show picking up my voice. It definitely seems that if there is any added background noise, it has troubles hearing my requests. Still no issues with the Google nest mini.",Troubles hearing me over minor other sounds.

Ferrante,"Overall, very satisfied with the Show and all its features with one exception, the audio. Alexa’s communication is somewhat unclear (too much base, muddy) although not nearly as bad as the echo dot 3 yet not as clear as the echo dot 2. There is a way to adjust sound for music play but apparently this does not apply to Alexa so understanding her requires concentration and repetition. It seems to me that this can easily be corrected by having the equalizer settings apply to her as well (this should also be done for the dot 3 which I no longer use due to the very poor muddled Alexa audio).",Alexa Audio Quality

The sound and picture quality are great enough so we don’t even connect them to our speakers to enjoy music. We ended up getting two show 8s and one dot.  Now with Amazon music unlimited Family plan we can ply music in each room. Drop-in feature is a plus. The screen size of Show 8 is good enough for us to do video calls and  picture slide shows at all times. Not too small and not too big to compliment our daily lives in our living room, bedroom and the kitchen. Wish they come in wireless though... I recommend Echo Show 8 !",Echo Show 8 over the second generation

If you are deeply embedded into google products, especially google photos I would stick with the Nest Hub.  Your google photo collection will not pair nicely with Alexa, you will have to transfer everything to Amazon Photos. If you need a camera, you have to go with Alexa.  Also the Alexa has way better speakers so if you want to crank tunes, Alexa blows it away.  Other than that VERY VERY similar.",Very nice smart display

It has good sound quality and it was easy to connect to our existing network, but if it can't understand what we're saying, it's got to go back.  Also, the times I could get it to check the camera, it wouldn't disconnect from the camera, so the camera was ""busy"" all the time.  This just won't work for us.",It has trouble understanding us.

First, the microphone is WAY too sensitive - which is a big problem if you have multiple Echos. I'll be speaking directly to one Echo, it'll light like it hears me and then not respond, and off in the distance I'll very faintly hear this one talking. It's pretty annoying. I have ESP enabled and it still does this. The other thing is that Amazon keeps showing a list of things to try at the bottom, even though I turned that off in settings.

The show 10 was just too big for my needs in an office setting. Everyone at work loves it too. Voice recognition is very quick and responsive. Set up was super easy.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2020,Anakin16,"In my opinion the Echo should never be 5 stars since the whole concept is to constantly learn and improve upon Alexa’s abilities. The hardware (Echo Show 8) is great, a little heavy & sometimes ‘glitchy’ (nothing unplugging and plugging back in won’t fix). I think the Show should come with a stand as a standard vs an additional cost/expense (sitting directly on the counter makes it more prone to spilled liquid etc).  Alexa always gets smarter and there are more skills it seems daily. I do feel a little confused on how to expand the system by adding an Echo Dot, Smart Home functions and the integration of all these items.  For example building groups/rooms etc was confusing and how to play music everywhere... the same station or different stations and can the Echo Show control all of that? I find myself physically turning my Echo Dot off in the other room because I don’t fully understand how to get my Show to make those adjustments.  I know it is possible but a high level blueprint or matrix would be helpful.

No more searching for lightswitches or trying to handle those with full hands. The Show has a big enough screen that when trying to find a recipe I can read it on the screen.  Big enough to enjoy making calls with.  Have been watching videos on it and enjoying those.  Important part of our home now.,Love the Echo and now the Echo Show

It will play movies and videos from available sources and the sound quality it great. The picture quality is really good as well. I really enjoy how everything I want to look up is so easy to access.

The only thing that bothers me is the issue we have with all our Dots, it will activate and start spouting information when it is triggered by a similar word to it's wake word.",We like it a lot

I started with the little disc ones and now have progressed to the Echo 8 with one in each room  I like that when you use the Ambiant noise, the fabulous choices come on the screen for selection with Amazon Prime. Good sound for everyday radio talk, and very convenient to be in any room and be able to ask time, weather, recipes, talk radio, music streaming or meditation mode. There is an off camera button to slide on top as well as a sleep mode that will sense when the room goes dark and dim down for sleep. Alexa still has a lot to learn, over all this is a great price for all she does.",Works great

The show will even suggest (in text) “skills” you can try. It is has enabled me and my family (who also have Shows and also live in different states) to easily stay in touch through video, voice and text messages. It’s like having your own private social media network. Also, I really love how the Show 8 ( not sure about other models) has an actual physical shutter to shut off the camera. I use my Show 8 daily, I use voice command to tune to my favorite local talk radio station , set timers and reminders, check the weather and check out current news events and I’m learning new stuff the Show 8 can do all the time.",The Show 8 is awesome!

I bought this before Christmas when they offered special pricing and paired the deal with a free third generation echo dot. I think this device is more responsive to my voice than my original dot, and commands are promptly and accurately delivered. I love to use this for cooking new recipes, viewing lyrics to songs I love and listening to my favorite authors and music. I can use this without external speakers, but when paired to my TVs sound bar the sound is amazing. I absolutely love this and wish I had done it sooner. The new dot is also useful in my bedroom for announcing the time, weather, music and news while getting ready for the day. I think I got a fantastic deal on this duo ☺️.",Everything I need in one powerful device!

It has a lot of features and can do a lot. Favorite is shopping list. No more forgotten items. Tell it and check the app on your phone at store. Down side is there are lots of commands to learn - exactly. No real instructions. I thought it would open to Facebook but not really. (They have their own device.) Texts show up on screen. Had some trouble with setting up video calls. One great trick - my mother forgot to hang up phone, I got busy signal for hours. I sent message to Show that said ""Hang up phone.""

I gave the Echo show 7 to my parents in Florida, and they love it.  My son will be going to college in 2 weeks and he wanted an Echo show, so we bought this 8 inch one for ourselves and will give him the 10 inch one.  My wife was concerned that the bass on the music wouldn't be as good as the 10.1. Much to her surprise, the music, including the bass, is  awesome.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,Ben Studer,"Overall, a nice device to integrate into our home setup (more than 2-dozen smart devices, in an IoT integrated home). We've had the first generation of Show devices since they came out and I was excited to see the upgrades. Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out. Mostly, I was disappointed that my app didn't allow me to add this to our home and that the device doesn't allow some of the new features (like stereo pairing) with older devices. This seems lazy to me. I didn't like that I had to enter the passwords of our account into the device multiple times to set it up. Overall, if I don't have to change configurations too many times, I think I'll like this. But if it is as much of a hassle to change wifi passwords requiring multiple accounts, I'll probably ditch the whole Alexa line-up.","Improved sound, improved form factor, poor backwards integration.

I must say that as far as voice recognition and sound quality, the echo dot was much better.  The Show 8 just can't seem to hear at the same range.  Sometimes I can be just a few feet away and it won't hear me, but the dot which is now 25ft away will. The screen is decent, except it is always putting stuff on the screen that i don't want.  I don't want it telling me what to try and the bottom all the time. I also don't need to see the score of last nights game all day long.  Maybe give me an option to acknowledge that I've see the score by tapping on it.",Not good at its main task.

I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife (she has it on her vanity in the master bathroom) and loaded a bunch of pictures of her with our daughter on our Amazon Photos account so it uses those as wallpaper. She checks the news and listens to music on it every morning before work while she's getting ready. When you're ready to crank up the music, the Echo Show 8 is ready!

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jun 2020,C.A.B.,"I was concerned about the chore of having to reconfigure all my connected devices, smart light bulbs, light strips plugs and thermostat.  That turned out to be a non-issue.  I unplugged the old Echo Show and then plugged in the new one, connected to my home network (wi-fi) then signed into my Amazon account.  Everything was there and working, even the apps on my iPhone that adjusted light colors and thermostat settings all worked.  No need to do anything... it was Great.  The new Show  looks much better and takes up less room on the counter and has a sleeker design and larger screen than my old one.  The picture quality is better (not vastly better - but noticeable) and the sound quality is much, much better.  Deeper and richer sounding than the old Show.  It's not on par with a Bose home theater system but, for a small counter top device, music has a very good, quality sound.  My old unit was a first gen Echo Show and that was a good device but this new one is far better all the way around.  I would highly recommend upgrading to this.  Also, I took advantage of Amazon's trade in and got a $30 credit plus a $25 gift card toward the purchase of the new device.  With $55 off you can't go wrong !  One last thought, I bought the stand for the new Echo Show separately, It's not really needed but it's nice to be able to adjust and tllt the unit to avoid screen glare.  It fits on the bottom of the unit perfectly and is magnetic so it stays in place.",Seamless replacement for older Echo Show

It looks so much better than the old Show. But honestly, this one picks up the wake word ""Echo"" maybe 50% of the time, leading me to yell at it and generally not believe that it'll hear me. In comparison to the 1st Gen Show, which worked 99% of the time, this is super disappointing and leads me and my family to shout at it constantly.

The setup was easy, voice recognition is great and the display is stunning -- as well as entertaining.  The display is constantly changing with respect to backgrounds as well as select information reference news, weather, current events, etc.  Additionally, when Alexa is asked a question or given a task, the display often enhances her answers or adds to a skill, such as timers.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Feb 2020,Mike L.,"We have both the Echo dot and the Echo Show 5 as well as the Echo Show 8. Having all three devices allows for a great comparison. Each device has its place and each is an excellent value (what it will do for what you pay). Buying them when they are on sale is the way to go, given that they have frequent sales (worth the wait). But of the three, the Echo Show 8 really blows the others away. First, having the video screen brings significant advantages to the Echo Show 5 and 8 (the number represents the approximate diagonal size of the screen in inches). Being able to watch videos, see news as text and have the words for songs show up (they do for most Amazon Music songs) makes the Echo Shows well worth the investment. The sound on all three Echos is excellent, but the Show 5 has deeper bass and better volume than the dot and the Show 8 has about three times the volume of the Show 5, with excellent bass. And the larger screen on the Show 8 is not only larger than the Show 5, but much brighter. We have chosen to put the Show 8 in the kitchen and it is the main unit we use (it easily fills a large room with high quality sound). The Show 5 works well in a bedroom and the dot is perfect for a hallway, bathroom or smaller space. All three seem to pick up our voice from anywhere in the room very well, unless you also are listening to TV or other sound-producing devices - but that is as I would have expected. One unexpected advantage of the Show 5 and Show 8 (haven't tried it on the Dot yet) is the ability to make calls WITHOUT pairing with a cellphone. You can ask Alexa to call the number you speak - and it will make the call. Although I have not tried it yet, I assume this would also work with 911 - which would be great for older adults that might fall or otherwise not be able to reach a phone or emergency button. Having a voice entry system is a huge advantage. We plan to purchase the Show 5 and Show 8 for family gifts at birthdays or Christmas, we are so impressed with them. We have also found them ideal for older adults that live alone and would like to have ""something to interact with"".  My mother-in-law is 93 years old and nearly blind, and she LOVES the Echo dot. She is unable to see the TV screen anymore or operate a remote and for that reason the Echo Shows would not be a good option for her. But she uses the Echo Dot constantly to ask about weather, news and other voice-tasks, and loves being able to ask it to play music from her youth (the Amazon Music subscription has been an excellent investment for her as well). We watched many comparison videos (check them out on YouTube) between the various Echo models as well as comparisons with the Nest and other competing devices. I would recommend the Echo Show 8 as the best choice for most individuals or families. The extra cost of the Echo Show 10 is hard to justify unless you are using it to control a number of smart home devices. But, for the modest difference in cost over the dot or Show 5, the enhanced sound and viewing of the Show 8 is definitely the way to go!",This is an amazing device!

Where it really shines, however, is as a major player, or even the central hub, of a whole house connected ecosystem. Augment it with a network of Echo Flex devices (and their various attachments) throughout the house, and with other connected devices such as the Blink Mini (Amazon's indoor camera) and a desktop with the Echo Show 8 on it becomes a command center for your entire living space.",Great hub for a connected home

She will respond with okay and then I have to wait a couple of minutes before she will show the front door. By then whoever was there is gone.

Redman,"I was doubtful this was more than just a luxury and we'd probably never get one, especially since my wife was initially very creeped out by the reported 'snooping' of these machines. Anyway, we got her mom one for Christmas and she changed her mind; so I just got her a dot and show for her birthday. She likes it a lot and it's growing on me, especially as a route to modernizing some of the core household appliances/routines. I was able to very easily connect the wifi outlets I had purchased from TanTan which control some key lamps around the house. We connected a few bluetooth devices and even the two Fire Sticks we had previously. There is some learning to do on both sides. We need to learn how to ask questions the right away and Alexa will learn about our habits, etc. We're still struggling to work out the video calling feature. I'll update on this feature if/when we get the resolution/answer. Connecting/uploading your photos to Amazon photo allows the Show to play through slide-shows when you're not using it for other things. This will connect to Amazon Music, but we have yet to get iTunes connected. (Not sure if this is allowed on the Show.) Impressive how it learns. BE AWARE, the MyQ garage door opening system from Chamberlain requires you to pay them monthly to use their opener with ANY other smart-home device, app or service, such as IFTTT, Google home, Alexa, etc.., Terrible decision! steer clear of their device; there are many out now that will work with other bring your own device smart-home systems/standards. The manual slide to cover the camera and the manual 'mute' button for the microphone is an added bonus but I still wonder if that is more cosmetic than anything else.",Really Impressed (so far)

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2020,Tadd,Well this is a long story but I promise well worth reading! Ive been in a wheelchair for 30 year's and I am with the most amazing woman in the world! And she is all about getting deals & clearance sales..lol We were just watching T.V together one evening and they were  Advertising About Amazon day's. And she told me we she at leaat take a look. Well she knows I really miss my momma every since she moved away but more so now that she's older & lives 9 hours away. And I'm unable to handle that long of a drive & even half way would be pushing it. Not to mention my sister's want to see her as well & they wouldn't be able to either. I love my momma so much & miss being able to see her when she came to see us all. So we both were on our cell's & I came across the Echo Show 8 & half off a Smart plug-in. And it was one of the prime day sales. And I told her hey look at this and what it can do! Do you think my mom would use this? She said aak her..lol So I had to call her & told her. I wanted to buy one for her & me but she didn't want me to ir let me pay for hers. My better half seen Echo Dot 3 w/ half off on a smart plug-in. Whixh she LOVES music and cooking and has been wanting to get one. Well after looking a little while longer we came across a doorbell camera wich she found made by someone else and I have respect for the makers of all the echoes so I will not say who it is but it isAlexa compatible. With me being in a wheelchair I can't see who is outside if someone comes by. Well due to the prime day's & have Amazon Prime membership wich does get you even more off on some thing on sale (not often but it happens). And it was all for under $200. And if we had got it without prime day's it would have been $399 & im not sure if that's before or after tax but either way amazing deal! And my mom said she was getting the Echo Show 8 also.  Well at first it said it was going to be something like 3-5 weeks. Well it was around a week. Still waiting on the Echo Dot 3 & both smart plug-in. But my momma surprised me by making a video call to me one day! And I was taking a nap so really caught me off guard. It was AMAZING  the sound was almost perfect the video waa the same & I'd had few people that said it will drop your call well we talked for 3 hour's!! I hadn't seen her in a long time & it was like she waa sitting beside me &my wife was sitting with us as well. It waa so great to be able to talk & actually see each other & when you're talking about something you can just show them! THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!  I would pay full price if i hadn't seen it on sale. And now my little sisters can see her as well. But more importantly to me she xan see her 6 grandchildren!! I do not have any kids but my niece's &  nephews can see her. 3 of them are 4 years ago or younger. I just want to say thank you to the makers of such an amazing idea! I know that you can use your cell but its hard to see and then you have to move it everywhere so they can see eaxh other. So the show is well worth the money. Amd not to mention it has so many features & Alexa can do more than you can imagine. (Sorry for such a long review but I want the owners & the people that make and sell it it to know what good they are doing for people like myself & my family) Thank you!!!  👍,Bringing family's together!

We spent hours trying to set up an account for her. First they said I would need to link a smart phone number to the echo show in order for Alexa video to work. My grandmother does not have a smart phone, which is why we bought the echo show, hoping to be a video call platform. Eventually we linked it to one of our smart phones and were told we can just “drop in” to the show if we wanted to talk to my grandma. We could not get the video to work on the show, only responded to the smart phone app. I thought it would be an easy set up and I thought my grandma would be able to use it for video calls. Turned out to be a lot of work invested in setting it up, watching YouTube videos on how to set up, contacting amazon support, and still did not work. Returned the product. Bought it with a promotion credit thinking a big purchase like this would be worth it and lost that since couldn’t be credited a promotion credit. Disappointed.",Not as easy as advertised.
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Feb 2020,Daniel B.,"My family has 5 of these, two spots,  an echo show 8 and 5 as well as the Echo.  The echo and the spots are great and solid devices. The Echo Shows on the other hand are less helpful. The Show 5 is cool, it allows you to customize the home screen and clocks. It fits well on the nightstand, and does what we need done well. The Show 8 was a gift, and intended to be used as the main Echo for the home. We love the display, size, sound, and design, but both our Shows have a really hard time hearing ""Alexa"" even in a quiet room or moderately noisy one. We never had to repeat the wake word as often with the Echo and Spots like we do with the Show 5 and more particularly with the show 8. Our TVs sound bar has alexa and is able to hear and respond faster than the Show 8, but we later disabled the sound bar because its too sensitive to the wake word. Ive noticed the Show 8 and 5 only have two microphones, and man not having 4 or more it really makes these devices much less user friendly.  It would seem Amazon has made some changes to the wake word because with the last update the issues has become more prevalent. Overall, we love the Echos, its allowed us to truly make our home a smart home and integrated  well with the plugs, and lights we own.",Poor Sound detection

Recipes, video, weather and the alarm clock for cooking, all that we have used the Echo for so far has worked great. I can quickly have Alexa stream the video or music to the TV in the living room via the fire TV stick/stereo in there or even in the bedroom. I wasn't too sure what I'd use it for at first outside of calling Family but it's become a good tool in the Kitchen and I'm very happy with it. Sounds pretty good for it's size, it isn't Bose level of sound quality but it's fine for some tunes and other utilities.",Easy and useful

During a recent sale period, I did purchase the Echo Show 8, and am very pleased with this latest edition.  For my needs (weather, sports scores, YouTube videos, and using it as a Bluetooth connected speaker), the Echo Show 8 has shined.  For me, the 8 inch screen is ideal with a relatively small form factor.  All videos are vibrant, look great, and the 8 inch screen is big enough to show details.  My favorite tablets are also in the 8 inch screen range.  I am very satisfied with the sound quality of the Echo Show 8 as well. Overall, I am very happy with my Echo Show 8 purchase, and highly recommend it.  If you can purchase it during a sale, just more icing on the cake.",Happy with my Echo Show 8 purchase

I expect that I'll eventually buy a couple more to replace earlier, more limited Echo devices I own that are spread around my home. One knock I had on the Echo Show 5 was that even at its highest brightness setting, the images, etc., seem too dark to me.

The screen is much more practical in my view than the Echo Show 5.  I was impressed that I could stop the cycling of comments and pictures.  I have it where my handicapped wife can see it and I can use drop in to check on her.  She was bothered by the changing screen.  The fact that I could turn that off made it great for our purposes.  The only thing I would prefer is if I could turn off the notification sound when I do a drop in to chech on her when she is sleeping.

Admittedly, I thought I’d be able to pull up any recipe I wanted to and it would go through the steps. That’s not the case. Instead, you have to get a subscription to Food Network.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2020,Angela,"I bought 3 Echo Show 8 this holiday season - primarily so my 4 yr old nephew could get ""face time"" with remote grandparents.  I actually like it on my desk more than I expected and my stepdad (who hates phone calls) seemed to enjoy the video interaction. What could be better -  automatic tracking of the person.  Half the time his face was cut off as he moved around.  The video was also sometimes dark.  Kids dance around, auto tracking would be great. I recommend buying the stand, it makes adjustments easier.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Dec 2019,Jay Martin,"The Show 8 lacks customization options that the Show 5 apparently has.  You can change the background and what data scrolls through, but the size of the time, the temp and showing today's date at all are not options.  You also constantly get Alexa suggestions.  Many tips on customization seem to be for other devices as there is no ""Home and Clock"" setting on the Show 8.  The only clock setting is 24 HR.  My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.  But then the misleading tips on using the Show 8 didn't help that misunderstanding. The frustrating thing is that the Show 8 is almost a very good product. It just lacks basic customization which takes away from its other features.  If it had the UI of the Show 5, likely this would be a 5 star review.  As it is, the Show 8 screen just doesn't give much value add.",Lacking basic screen customization

I had a chat with support in which they said ""it has already been escalated to be fixed in a future update"". They HAVE a switch (see pics) to turn it off that simply doesn't work on the Show 8, it does work on the Show 5.

Sound is definitely not good compared with even the very first Alexa. That might just be because of the direction the speakers face but it’s pretty noticeable. We had hoped to do video calls with the grandparents but so far after a month we still haven’t done even one. I would have thought with the video offering there would have been an easier - go to tool or app on the device that we could navigate through.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Feb 2020,Enrique Olmos Jr.,"The Echo Show 8 is a good quality device, easy to set up. The sound quality and  video are good. My only issue is that, we use YouTube, disney + and other streaming services that the Echo Show is not compatible or wont integrate. It does have Hulu, but now a days there are so many different streaming services that if this device was compatible, it would be a solid 5 star. Also as far as more features, it would be nice to have a maps feature or a better search engine integration. Hence that is  where the google devices are a bit better when it comes to searching directions or certain restaurants near you. I tried this with the Echo show and Alexa was not able to find a detailed list like a google device would.  Besides all this , I am happy and keeping my Echo Show.

This design choice (to remove a feature, just because of a larger screen by +3"") is surprising and disappointing. I'm not able to use the unit as I originally planned to do so.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2020,johng,I’ll admit. Coming from an original echo show it is a much nicer device. The slim bezel compared to my old one gives me more screen and less speaker grate to look at. I don’t use it for anything other than music and a digital picture frame in the kitchen.  My only gripe with all echo devices is the lack of ability for it to optimize a search engine to answer more questions. I tend to stump Alexa a lot with general questions when she really has the whole internet at her fingertips to find answers.

You can even use the Amazon Alexa application to link SKYPE with Alexa and then when you receive a call thru Skype Alexa informs you on all your Amazon Alexa units. It is just a beginning and it is up to you to investigate the Amazon Alexa.,good sound and easy to use

I got it before the holidays and it was fun to see the lyrics displayed along with the Christmas music being played.  I've used it for recipes, weather forecasts, news briefing videos, etc.  It seems to have a better speaker than any of my other traditional Echos (I have 4 others).  Do yourself a favor and get the larger 8"" device along with the magnetic stand which lifts it a few inches off the counter/table top (get the one that swivels and tilts - you'll be glad you did).",Love my girl Alexa!!

I also like to listen to the news articles that scroll across the screen, and save some of the recipes that pop up. And I LOVE calling out items to add to the shopping list. Soooo easy.

Still learning about this viewer and hoping to find some other uses that might make me glad I bought the thing.

I wish I kept the box because I would return it.  I have many echos in my home.  The show seems like a pumped up speaker and that's about it.  You can only watch Prime video and a couple other apps, none of which I have.  You cannot connect to any TV.  Sling and Netflix are both not able to be accessed on the Show.  I really do not understand why this would be.  I have 5 firesticks in my house,  another ""Alexa"" device.  I use Netflix and Sling on these all the time.  Why would you not be able to access the same apps on the Echo Show.  Even accessing a browser is crazy.  My kids figured it out.  If I say Alexa watch Youtube, then a browser will open up and I can access the internet.  If you ask for a browser, she tells you it's not available.  I don't need a video screen to listen to music.

We live 1000 miles away and I am unable to visit (I’m a front line worker).  When we first saw each other again, it was tears of joy.  My mom is elderly and we were able to set the unit up so I can “drop in”.  We are still working on her using voice commands, but we are getting there. All in all, it has been a real blessing. Alexa sets timers, reminds of appointments, keeps my lists. She’s a good helper.  A few things I would add, day and date on screen always, ability to set monthly occurring events instead of just one time and perhaps color codes for the buttons to make it easier for old eyes to see.  A little red nail polish worked from that standpoint. Again, thank you Amazon Alexa, I got my mom back!","A blessing, my mom and I can see each other again!"

Amazon says the Echo Show and the Blink software doesn't allow that. That renders it useless. And the Try ""Alexa"" suggestions that CONSTANTLY appear across the screen are driving me batty. There's no way to stop them, it just makes me want to take EVERY Alexa device in my house and throw them into the garbage bin. I should've listened to the other reviewers.

There were a few things that reviews online did not emphasized and actually place Google as the winner between the 2 and I have a different opinion because of the following.  I think Echo show is a better option for some because of the following... 1.  Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen than Google Nest Hub.  Echos Show 5 is about $20 less the Google Nest Hub. 2.  Contrary to beliefs, Echo Show 5 and 8 are capable of showing YouTube videos via the Firefox Browser. 3.  Echo Show 5 and 8 have 2 accessible web browsers.  Google Nest Hub does not have an accessible web browser, which you can use to view websites. 4.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Prime videos.  You can't on Google Nest Hub. (Althouth you can watch youtube tv on the Google Hub, which you can also do on the Echo show 5 and 8. 5.  You can also link your Hulu Service to Amazon Echo 5 and 8 and watch Hulu on it.  You can not watch Hulu on Google Nest Hub.  Although there are some workarounds on casting from device to device.  You are better off just getting a streaming service device on your television than have it cast and bog down your wifi.  I have both Google and Amazon infrstructures at my smart home.

For me, it was money well spent.  I love my new Echo 8's.  Only drawback - you don't get a manual that tells you things about the device.  Amazon has a manual, but they charge you extra for it.",Great addition to my technology library

Set up was a breeze and it easily integrated with the Echo Show 5 on my network.  I recently discovered I cannot reset the timer sound.

The Show 8 has a bigger screen and the speakers are better but I purchased this  as a smart clock for my night stand and for this purpose only the Show 5 is much better.  The Show 8 has no clock faces so you cannot customize the clock, the clock sits in a conner and the clock size cannot be changed.  Worst is the night mode, the Show 5 was great, my wife loved it.  The Show 8's night mode is too bright even with the brightness at minimum and again the clock sits in a conner, why not in the middle?  The wife hates it, saids its too bright.

I live in the UP of Michigan with very limited internet connections so when we FINALLY got WIFI 6 months ago I knew I needed to get music into our home!  I was able to pair our SIRIUSXM subscription to it and can now listen to everything I want without being in the car!! It was easy to hook up and I love the FAQ I have found online for help.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jul 2020,Sathy,"Paying more and having a screen I was hoping this screen to be an actual display... But it's more like a settings UI, or a wall paper/screen saver. It cannot open Youtube and play a video for me. I bought it hoping it will have a smooth integration with Ring video door bell, but it's stupid that it doesn't open the live view when some one rings the door bell. You have to give a voice command asking it to show the live view and it take a minute or so to open the connect you - meaning the person at your door has to keep waiting for you to open the screen and see them.

Most was going well... alexa voice was clear and crisp, the screen was pretty good. It was a bit frustrating that some things i couldnt manage in the device but had to use the app. But then.... i asked it to play music and the clear, crisp sound turned into a muffled, shifting balance that would oddly raise and lower volume.

I weighed buying the 10 vs. 8 and I am really glad I chose the Echo Show 8 as it's the perfect size for my desk and the screen resolution on it is great - I think the 10 would have been too big.  Some of the things I do every day are :I  play my flash news briefings from my fav news sources (I like the fact that I CONTROL WHAT SOURCE plays from this news list); I also play Amazon Music from my play lists or just listen to spa music in the background on low when I'm on conference calls.  I also  find sometimes that I can listen to podcasts when I have pages and pages of documents to scroll through, although when I have to pay attention to what I'm reading, I find the podcasts too distracting so I tend to switch back to spa music, but I always have something playing now and I'm finding I really enjoy it.  I also enjoy listening to my favorite talk radio stations.  I'm really impressed and would recommend it",The Echo Show 8 is my new office companion

We ask our echo about the weather or any other question we have.  We have our echo dots linked to our Echo Show for music in every room.

We have this problem with both Apple Music and Pandora, so I'm not sure what the answer is.

My sister will be returning hers.  We spent much time on the 800 number, but they conceded there is no way for more than one of her 5 children to use it due to the way Amazon set it up to work.  I believe it is a scam to bring in more money by getting folks to order amazon products off of it.  Also I have accidentally ordered music service at an $8 monthly fee, as well as another monthly service I do not want.  I will keep the 2 but will use it to visit my mother only.

I uploaded few family pictures into Amazon photos app and used the album as screen saver and it looked great. There are various settings to adjust to fit to your need.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,james johnston,The alexa show 8 and all alexa devices still have an issue. They allow you to create a group so you do not have to get specific with device names but this is not true. You still have to get specfic with device names or other alexa devices will still try to control other devices. Also im not so sure when someone video calls you through the alexa device and it rings your devices and your phone is a good idea..,Alexa devices

First off, the screen and speed of the echo is excellent compared to the first gen that is slow and lower resolution.  Commands are better understood and dimming options improved too! Cons: While it has an enhanced screen, Netflix and Youtube is still not easy to get to due to the platform battles... Price:  Good price but given we are locked in the Amazon world (not bad but ....), make sure you get these on sale (50-65$ range). Trade in Program:  Was told my value would be $30 for older show, email notification without any details cut it down to $5.  Online agent told me the screen was cracked (untrue).  Net:  Don't use the trade-in program unless you are ok with the value offered not being honored and Amazon making up a reason to cut %85 of the value.",night and day better than 1st gen echo 5 but Don't waste your time with Amazon Trade-in

Second is the screen does not truly dim at night, it will put out enough light on it's dimmest setting to light my bedroom enough to see everything in the room clearly.

Not any better than an echo dot just that you can see a nice screen that tells you 'I dont know that'.  A lot of the commands are not very intuitive.  The display does not dim on its own.  You need to tell it to go to home screen and then turn off display.  It gets annoying. My biggest pet peeve is that I need a cell phone for it to get my contacts list.  I dont have a cell phone because of being in a rural area and no cell service.  I dont need an electronic leash, so I dont have one.  renders most 'features' UN-usable.  No voice calls, No video calls, only drop ins.  There are many 'little' procedural issues they could clean up and make much easier.

Not that we like to watch on that small screen and we have a 32 inch in the kitchen, but it fits the right spot and is easy. Just say Alexa tune to Fox News or HGTV and it brings it up.

The main problem I had with the device was it would constantly stop playing music in the middle of a song or if it was connected to my group it would pick and choose which songs it decided it wanted to play while my other devices (Echo 2nd and 3rd generation and Dot) continue to play music. This device must have been programmed by an angry wife because the “Alexa” on this device does not listen to a word you say or at least my device didn’t, I get the chime at the start of my request “Alexa volume X....OK” or sometimes she won’t even acknowledge my request.

I don’t remember much of what he said because I busy ordering my own device at the same time. I also ordered one for my mother as well and she absolutely loves it.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Oct 2020,DrMom,We bought 3 of these for us to be able to see who is at the door. We were excited about being able to see on the Echo Show 8. It has showed someone maybe once or twice in 4 months. We don't use it for anything else. Your phone or tablet is much better at anything this device does. The ONLY thing I would use this for is to reach a relative who doesn't have a cell phone or is in a home.,The biggest waste of money ever

I'm not impressed by anything so far.  My Echo Dot picks up my voice better than the Echo Show 8.  I think the audio and microphone issues is due to the fact that there is no stand (but this is just my guess).,Sound quality is bad

I finally decided To buy it. I have to say this new unit is way better than the original. It is much faster and snappier and the screen is larger. Also my WiFi connection seems more stable. The sound is probably twice as loud. There seems to be new features as well like gradual wake up and better night feature.

Picture quality and sound exceeded expectations. Problems were finding/introducing skills and connecting with other services. I know this is not because of Echo 8, but if you can't figure out meaningful activities for it to do it really isn't any better than an Echo sound-only. Better instructions on finding/installing activities would greatly improve the Echo 8 value and my Overall Rating.","Start up Good, Ongoing operation ??"
Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2020,Ryan Kloman,"I'm not much of the normal Alexa user. I don't want it for music, I don't shop by voice, I don't really want it listening in at all really. I did want integration into some key smart home devices, primarily my Nanit baby cam and Blink security cameras. Alexa wouldn't find the Nanit initially, and the issue was on the Alexa side for sure - Amazon support was pretty terrible. I did figure it out on my own, and the Nanit Show skill is finally working so I can view my baby cam. Blink integrated smoothly in terms of discovery, but motion when detected doesn't route to Alexa automatically. You have to click into the camera each time, with a pretty long buffering period that sometimes fails. IFTTT integration is even worse, rather than closing the gaps. This will ultimately be a clock/weather display that doubles as a baby cam - was not impressed.",Integration skills are meh

I use the Amazon Echo Show 8 to monitor my Ring home security devices.  It is faster than using my android cell phone and gives me large and clear live pictures of the various outdoor and indoor scenes upon command.  The ability to activate the speakers on the various devices is a definite plus.  This feature allows the unit to be used as an intercom between rooms and enables security monitoring of other family members in any room wherein a security camera has been installed. My Amazon Echo Show 8 also controls my Amazon Smart Plugs to turn on/off various lights in my house, the same way  as my Amazon Echo Dot.

It'll sure as hell override whatever you're listening to if you can magic your way into getting it to hear you, but more often than not, it's completely disconnected itself from the rest of the network.

No matter how I set the equalizer, the sound was either muddy or tinny.  I have two other Show 8's and while the sound on them isn't all that great, it's better than the one I returned.  My Echo 2nd Gen has a much fuller audio quality.  As a side note, the advertising on the bottom is distracting at times, but not a deal breaker.",Awful sound!

I see a lot of other bad reviews because of the ""Try Alexa"" at the bottom of the screen which i find to be just silly. I like that I can call other alexa shows in my house and essentially use it as an intercom only with video as well. I didn't give it 5 stars on everything because I've only had it for ann hour or so, but I know I'll enjoy it for the reason I bought it.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Oct 2020,TR,"I have approximately 10 different Echo devices.  My original Echo dot and Echo several years ago were the first two.  They both still work exactly as they did when I purchased them and I was satisfied with the quality of the device compared to the price I purchased them for.  After having a bad experience with the Echo Spot screen flicker that so many other customers have experienced I became more sceptical of the Echo line.  Somehow I convinced myself to purchase a Show 8 and of course, my concerns for product quality were true.  It has been replaced once for the camera failing to turn on when I use the drop-in feature.  The replacement device fails just as much as the previous device.  My advice for any future Echo customers, stay away from the devices with screens.  You will avoid disappointment and likely have a pleasant experience.","Great Concept, TERRIBLE Engineering."

After one year of use, I am down grading my review to two stars. This show seems to work less well than our echo, it frequently hears something totally different than what we have asked, ...it is like previous version rather than a newer version. Perfect size.

The Echo promotion advertised that one could get 25% off of a new Echo, plus be eligible for $30 rebate by trading in the old one.  I placed the order and filled out the trade-in info at the same time.  The 25% discount was not applied, and when I phoned, was told that it would be applied as a gift card after the trade-in was received.  The trade-in was accepted, but the 25% discount was not applied.

They have issues using tablets/computers so the ability to just drop in and video chat was very promising. First month was good. Still, every other week the drop-in video calls will not have audio or video. We call them but they cant hear us, or vice versa. After researching this issue online and on forums, many other people have this problem and there is no fix. Amazon just tells you to update (already updated) and check internet and router settings... You can get the calls working again but you have to unplug and plug it back in again, which isn't easy if its located 3 hours away in another state.

If they give the 8 what the 5 has for features this rating would go up. Voice recognition and command functionality are not perfect but I also understand this is a fairly young technology. I want the understanding of the system to increase so it can better it's ability to fulfill requests. Such as 'Alexa, randomize my thumbs up list on pandora.'

In addition, the night view sets the background to an adaptive ambient lighting which you can't turn off, so you get the lighting whether or not you want it.

Beautiful screen, great sounds, not to mention the wonderful Alexa integration and tons of skills that grow every moment.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,A Careful Consumer,Alexa is by far less usable on this device than any other I have. Alexa regularly performs the wrong activity when given a command. Alexa does not understand the stop command on this device. The device frequently takes on a mind of its own which requires unplugging the device to make it stop. The sound quality is at best sub par. Voices when playing something as simple as the news are bad at any kind of elevated volume. The screen is fine but the much less expensive Dot is a better device.,Not up to par with other devices.

Echo Show 8 -- HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2020,Lisa,Great purchase for my older parents.

Too bad, as I just got off the chat with an Amazon rep.  You CANNOT pair Amazon’s own Echo Buds with this device!  The rep told me I needed to buy a Non-Amazon set of Bluetooth earbuds in order to pair with the Show 8.  Even though in the Alexa app, it states that the Buds are a wireless option.  AND, the Alexa app designates the Echo Buds as a “gadget” to work with the Echo Show.  But they WILL NOT PAIR.  And the Amazon rep confirmed that.  Literally told me to buy a non-Alexa requiring set of Bluetooth earbuds not made by Amazon.  Not cool, and a horrible design flaw in the Show 8.  Bad move, Amazon.

The screen size is fantastic. We can easily read the weather from a good distance away. The alexa integration is as good or better than what we've come to expect from the echo devices.

I did get the stand and it makes it look so much nicer. It’s great overall. But when alexa starts talking or ur listening to music you start to hear the speaker really raspy and thats on half the full volume. The hulu app: it doesn't let you pick from ur own profile and doesn't let you pick episodes. It helps to tell alexa “play so and so season 2 episode 3”. Not to many  video apps.
