It was a good purchase especially for $9.99.",Great little alexa for the garage
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,19 Nov 2020,73brewcrew74,"I bought this Echo Flex because of the ""add ons"" you can attach to use it as part of your home security system.

Of course, you must have an internet connection to use this device.","An inexpensive, ""Alexis"", voice activated device."

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,20 Nov 2020,AirJoel,Great price and works well for what is intended for. For music and audio this won’t replace a dot or echo.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,cahavey,"This item works great!  It's a cheaper, but less pretty version of the echo dot.  It only cost about $10, but has a lot of the functionality of the echo dot.  We use it for controlling smart plugs/lights, and the kids use it for asking questions (like about the weather).  At about half the cost of a dot, it's a handy tool.","Cheaper, less pretty version of echo dot"
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,4,20 Nov 2020,Gman,I own several generations of the Echo Dot already and thought I would give the Echo Flex a try.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,RandyV,"These are so functional and fits any room scenario. If you want to listen to music, I won't brag about it but it works. They are dirt cheap too so you can get about 10 for the price of a standard Echo. If you want music to sound good I'm pretty sure it will send signal to Bluetooth speakers. Try one if you haven't!",Echo Flex for anywhere

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,MiRV,I've read a lot of reviews talking about the poor speaker quality. Granted it's no Sonos or even a regular Echo speaker.

It's a keeper.,Echo Flex works better than advertised.
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,22 Nov 2020,Jason,"Easy to set up and use. Although a lot of people complained about the speaker, I found it suitable just for casual commands.

We love it!,I love how easy to move Echo Flex around my home!
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Dneal,"These work great for your bathrooms because they can plug directly into your outlet and not have to be on your counter in the way.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,22 Nov 2020,AZAVER,"Originally purchased to use with a motion sensor but on its own this gives you all the functionality of an Echo at around 10 bucks (on sale).

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Dano,"I really like these.  Understand that the speaker in it is no-good.  but.. that's not the point of it.  SUPER cheap device to add alexa to all the spaces the really don't need a dot etc.  ie, laundry rooms or utility rooms.",great for low use areas.
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,jcreative,"If your space is extremely limited then the Echo Flex might serve a purpose.  Alexa functionality plugged directly into an outlet means no need for counter or shelf space.  But if you're planning to use this speaker for streaming music you'll want to pair it with a REAL speaker.  Sound quality of the Echo Flex alone is barely tolerable, especially when compared to an Echo or Echo Dot.  The Echo Flex can be easily paired with an external speaker through Bluetooth or AUX cable.  If you're only wanting to add Alexa capability this will do the job.  But if you're wanting a good sounding speaker better opt for an Echo or Echo Dot.",Niche device

You can add a night light or a motion sensor to this. Would be great by the front door with the sensor. You can program it so when it's set off it'll turn on a light for you automatically.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,4,23 May 2020,blshof,"I like this device over the dots because you don't need to have a power cord or table shelf space. It works great just like all other echo devices, easy set up, just plug it in and go to the Amazon app and add device. 
I have not tried the motion detector or light add ons yet but will be testing them soon.
Cons: volume is terrible and sounds very cheap compared to any other echo device.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,ladybug,I have Alexa devices in almost every room but running cords for an echo in my tiny bathroom with only one outlet was tricky.  This unit works well for asking questions or adding items to a list.  Understandably the audio quality is lacking in terms of playing music.   One of my main goals was being able to call someone if I fell while in the bathroom and it did work well for that.,Functions well for asking questions

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,4,23 May 2020,Matt,This little gadget is great addition to my Alexa system. I have one of these echo flex in my bathroom and one in my garage.

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,3,23 Nov 2017,Dave,"I bought three of these with the intent of putting them in the bathrooms and linking them to a small bluetooth speaker for news and music while showering etc.
I like the compact size and no wires, perfect for a bathroom outlet. 

As expected, the internal device speaker is garbage, comparable to a cellphone speaker, no surprise there. Fortunately, decent sounding Bluetooth speakers are inexpensive and plentiful. 

The reason for the 3 star rating is that the thing can't hear me. I have Echo Dots and an Echo Show 5 placed in various rooms of the house. None of them have difficulty hearing the ""wake word"" from across the room in a normal speaking voice. For some reason the Echo Flex just doesn't hear me unless I either yell at it or speak to it from inches away. At that point, where is the advantage of voice control?

So it's a cool little gadget that serves a purpose, but it needs definite improvement in the audio department.","Alexa, why can't you hear me?"
Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,jessesharp,this one surprised me. I just thought it was a little alexa speaker.

""sitting on the throne"", I can play Jeopardy (lol), and I have it linked to a blutooth speaker, so when I take a shower, I just ""Alexa link to speaker"" and ""Alexa open Pandora""!

Amazon - Echo Flex Smart Speaker with Alexa - White,1,5,23 Mar 2020,CaptStabbin,"I have an entire home built for Alexa. However there are some dead spots where Alexa cannot hear my requests. While Dots are cheap enough, they are larger for the areas I would need them for so for the last year or so I went without. In comes the Flex... it’s perfect. This great little device goes perfectly in hallways, walk in closets and small areas where one doesn’t need a rather loud speaker for music but for simple requests such as home automation requests, etc. 

I have paired these with the clip on night light and it works wonderfully in the main hallway of my home. As mentioned above, the speaker is rather unimpressive but that is to be expected as this device isn’t meant for that. It’s an extra “leg up” for voice requests where you need it most.",A handy little Alexa
