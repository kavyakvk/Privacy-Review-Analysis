Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,McGannskiRules,"This is the ""apple"" of digital thermostats and it's made by google (Nest's parent company).

It looks great on the wall. Has a solid feel to it and comes across as very well crafted. It would've been nice to have been able to compare out old thermostat to this one to see exactly how much we're saving on our oil bill but we're definitely going through less oil than we used to.

Installation was a breeze. I actually opened a chat with one of their reps to ask them a quick question about the unit and they pretty much insisted that they would stay connected with me until I completed the setup and tested everything out.

The configuration is a breeze too - at least it was for our heat-only system. 

The major shortcoming is the software. There are some things that are just not intuitive like the eco settings and some things that just leave you scratching your head wondering what they were thinking when they wrote the code, like displaying what the target temp is more prominently than the current temp - there's a feature called farsight that will show you the current temp for a moment but then it goes back to the normal display.

The usage history is capped to ten days. Seriously. Like how much memory would it take to give us a month or even a year, it's just some raw data that shouldn't take up much space at all on the device.

The home/away feature works when it wants to. There have been times I've been like, ""why is it freezing in here?"" and opened the app to find the nest thinks I'm away from home and times when I've been out for hours and opened the app just for the heck of it to see if the furnace is running and it thinks I'm home and the heat's cranking. 

We've had two of these installed for a little over a month and it still hasn't learned our schedule. It might have something to do with not knowing whether we're home or away, lollll, but either of these features should be pretty easy to make work any number of ways and have them work well but they just don't.

The app and web interface are nicely laid out and easy to use for the most part and from my experience with them, they seem to give you access to most of the controls and features that you'd have using the wheel on the thermostat itself, without having to stand there and scroll through everything with the notable exception of the farsight setting.

From what I can tell, you can't link two nests in different zones and get them to act smarter together, for instance to say hey the furnace is running for zone two, why not heat up zone one for a little bit too while you're at it. Maybe I'm missing something and by all means tell me if I am, but that seems like it'd be a nice feature to have.

It just feels really limited with what you can do with it and they've been out now for long enough where you think they'd have this thing feature packed with the ability to customize it a little more than what you get out of the box with this 3rd gen model.

I feel like the ecobee is probably a more robust option but just barely. That being said we did get two of these and I'm pretty happy with them ..... I'm just not satisfied if that makes sense. There's just a lot more I'd like to see these things be able to do that hopefully will be added via firmware or software updates as more people install them and clamor for more features.",Nice hardware. Software is lacking.
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Qsrv,"Easy install. Nest works perfectly with Echo Dot. Alexa- raise Dining room to 69 degrees... Awesome. It learned after just a couple days to automatically turn the temperature down to 63 at 11:45 pm every day and back to 68 in the morning. I can set the Nest to also control lights when I'm away (Nest can detect the fact that you're away by noticing your phone is not present, I believe). Also I got a $75 rebate from the utility company. Win...win...win.",Super easy install
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Jun 2020,HeatNaz,"So I knew very little about this product when I decided to purchase my 1st one but what I did know was my home as many homes come with these absolutely inefficient thermostats so I bought this nest smart thermostat & absolutely love it
Benefits: affordable & really smart as it learns how hot or cold a person likes their home
Knows when you are coming home as registered by cell phone location unless you tell it not to
Custom daily down to 1/2 hour custom temp daily weekly schedule
Rebate of $75 from srp off your electric bill after 2 months so think about what you paid -$75. How cool is that!
I bought my parents this gold one & installed it at their home. Almost immediately I could tell home cooling way more efficiently
This product is amazing. I would recommend to everyone",The absolute best smart thermostat
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 May 2020,MacFamily,Had a 2nd gen but wanted to love that upstairs so we bought the 3rd gen for downstairs. We wanted to be able to use the temp sensor but it was only compatible with the 3rd gen. The base was different from the 2nd gen so it was a total removal and install. All the wires went in the same locations so it was a breeze of an install. WiFi connected with no issues and the new nest picked up right where the old one stopped. The old nest installed upstairs with no issues so now our entire house has smart thermostats. Went with this over the also well reviewed eco bee because I enjoy not having to think about the thermostat. Me and my wife work different schedules with days off so it’s hard to actually have a set in stone thermo calendar.,Same great idea with updates
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Sep 2020,TimL,"We had no problem installing it ourself. I love the fact that I can set a schedule, and that it’s smart enough to know when we are away (so it will auto adjust as needed). The best part is that I can control it through the google home app. Makes it nice if you are traveling back from vacation, and as you get closer to home you can set it to your desired temperature before walking in the door.",This product works great!
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Akk1,"this was my first time installing a thermostat at home on my own. i followed the instructions and when I noticed my very old Thermostat has so much more wires than what nest takes I contacted Nest customer support online using my cell phone and they helped my for about an hour untill Nest was installed and working.
They asked me for a picture of the old thermostat wiring and a picture for the wiring that was coming out of my HVAC room, and then sent me a diagram to my email address explaining which wires I should connect where. the whole process was a breeze and customer support person was great, professional, and patient. 
the experience of installing this while someone who has the knowledge is with you along the way and holding your hand exceeded all my expectations. 
The nest performance is very satisfying and accurate. you have modes for home, and away which can be easily set to save energy.
I couldn't be happier.",AMAZING customer support

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,GenaInSD,"It was easy to install and figure out how to use. I got a TON of coupons, rebates and cash back for it, bringing the price WAY down from retail. I love that I can set the circulator fan for a specific period of time (I used to turn mine on at night to cool down the house in the spring and then forget about it and leave it on all night). I like the report showing me how much it was used that week. I can ask my Google Home Hub the temperature and she will tell me the temperature outside, inside and what the thermostat is set at (love that!). We are moving a  year and a half so I used the option plate that came with it to cover up the old holes where I'll put back the previous thermostat.

We got the spare sensor - it's installed but the weather has been too mild for it to show any effect (yet).","So far, so good!"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,Cfig,"Everything on the Nest from the install to the scheduling is easy to do and most of the features are pretty nice. There are two issues I have with the Nest. The first is you can't change the frequency in which the fan cycles on. It only gives you the option to come on every hour. You can select run time for 15,30,45 minutes up to 1 hour but that's it. It would be nice to be able to select every 1,2,3, or 4 hours just so the fan isn't coming on all the time. I'm sure this can be fixed with a software update. The second issue and this is a big problem is that the current room temperature is inaccurate. The Nest reads 2-3°F above actual room temp. I am currently on my 3rd Nest (Generation 3) in a 20 day period. The 1st read 75°F for over 24 hours even though there was no way it was 75° so I exchanged it. I installed the 2nd Nest and after having it for a day I noticed that it felt a little chilly in my house. I looked at the screen and it read 71° but it seemed cooler. So I put two of my previous thermostats (a Honeywell VisionPRO 8000, and a Comcast digital) and a digital food thermometer next to the Nest to compare the readings and all 3 read 68°F. (I'm no pro but I think if 3 thermometers read the same then I would say they are accurate) I called Nest and the technician said it can take up to 14 days to ""learn"" the temp so I waited to see if it would correctly calibrate. It didn't, and I exchanged it for my 3rd Nest hoping the other two were defective. It's been 2 days and no luck. This one is reading 2-3°F high as well. The tech also told me that the Nest's are programmed to have a 2° range. I understand this when heating and cooling so you're furnace or A/C isn't tuning on and off every 5 minutes however there should be no range on the accuracy of the actual room temp. It's either accurate or it's not. I'll give this a few more days and call Nest and see if they have a software update to accurately calibrate it. They say this has 12 sensors. How is it that 12 sensors are less accurate then a cheap $50 thermostat with 1? I don't understand.. I've included some pictures showing the temp differences. My Nest reads ""current temp"" 71°F and the other 3 thermometers read current room temp as 68°F. That is unacceptable.",Temperature not accurate.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,cherry3700,"Bought the Nest Thermostat hoping to save some money on our energy bill. Installation was the easiest thing possible, anyone can figure it out (just make sure you have the proper power switch turned off and check the wires for activity) When we first installed it, I actually thought I installed it incorrectly because the data being collected was telling me my AC unit was running for a good 14-15hrs straight daily!!...called my heating and cooling guy to make sure A) I installed it right and B) that my AC unit was functioning properly. when he checked my AC unit it was low on refrigerant. He topped that off and BAM my data (on Eco mode) shows my unit MAYBE runs 45m to an hour a day and even at times no usage at all for days!!!. I LOVE LOVE having a visual aid to my furnace/AC usage!!! Now we will just have to wait and see what the winter will bring...

This product was pretty pricey and I even considered getting my money back before installing it because of it's cost. BUT, reading reviews and seeing how this thermostat could save me so much more money in the long run I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did!

Not because it is complicated to setup or program, but because it is too simple! I was used to the old programmable thermostats that turned on and off precisely at a specific time whether someone was home or not. The Nest doesn't do that. It builds it's own schedule based on your real-world use and then deviates from that schedule when no one is home.

I love how the Nest thermostat communicates with the Nest Protect Smoke Detectors, utilizing them as motion sensors to determine if someone is home or not.

Things I like is that I can monitor usage, see usage history, set it to learn the most common temperatures. That I can see the temperature from my phone if needed and I can change it from anywhere. I can monitor temperature if I go on vacation.

This is a great Thermostat with some great features and one annoying flaw.  There have been 3 generations and countless software updates, but for some reason they refuse to add a real temperature Hold feature.  The only way to ""Hold"" the temperature if you set up you own schedule is delete your manual schedule. The auto feature is good if you have a routine but if your schedule varies from week to week,  or month to month the manual setup is better.  If I have people over and they are going in and out of the house I want to set the A/C at a higher setting so my A/C is not constantly running.  If you set a new temp it will change at the next scheduled temperature time. 

The room sensors are also great however you can not adjust the time windows for morning , midday, and Night.

The Nest was easy to swap in and connect to with the nest app. It also connects to Alexa. It offers so much more than I had realized when I purchased it. I like that it uses cell phones to determine if you are gone and adjusts heating temp for an unoccupied home. It can be controlled from the app and shows you the status of heating or cooling wherever you are.

Have 7 thermostats to install, ZERO can be added to the Nest app.  Calls to Google support have not resolved a thing.  These are already on my wall and Google is basically useless at troubleshooting.

Furthermore the Google Home software that is imposed by Google on Nest customers is additionally miserable to use.   The software on the back end is given no design, no attention, just left to engineerings to craft and it sucks.

We already had a 1st generation Nest thermostat and bought the 3rd generation after reading that it a dual system works with it. I went through the process of taking pictures of the wiring and providing them to a Nest technician through online chat. I provided them with the make and model number of our two systems as well. He quickly confirmed that Nest was compatible and provided me two wiring diagrams which made it extremely easy to install. Took 15-20 minutes for each one. Now I can command or ask Alexa about the upstairs and downstairs temperatures. The only thing I had to figure out was how to get Alexa to connect with each one as it didn't do it automatically. Went into the Alexa app and disabled the Nest thermostat and reenabled it and added the two thermostats then labeled them upstairs and downstairs.,So easy to install!

The fully take advantage of the thermostat, I do recommend adding nest temp sensors to be able to identify zones in the house that are at different temps from where the main thermostat is located. With these two options combined, you can control the times and zones of the house where the AC or heating needs more flow and would help control them accurate.

The four stars is due to the fact that it has preset times (morning, afternoon, evening and night) and it does not allow the user to change the start or end times of each preset. Not a big deal once you learn how to change other settings, but would be nice to be able to change them to avoid having to look for workarounds.",Game changer for cost savings and temp monitoring

So far so good!",So far so good!
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,OverlordSpock,"Look, let's just cut to the chase: the Nest thermostat is not the BEST smart thermostat on the market, but it is a really good one and it is the best looking one on the market. Honestly, as long a smart thermostat is pretty good at what it does, I want it to look attractive, what with being a wall-wart and all. If it's going to be there hanging on my wall, it needs to look good as well as function well. The Nest does that.

It has most of the standard smart-thermostat stuff: You can set up a programmed schedule of when you want the temperature to change; it is easy to manually change the temperature through the innovative spinning case; it pays attention to your manual adjustments and will learn and adjust your scheduled program based on what you actually do; it tries to tell when you're not at home and reduce energy usage at those times; the Nest app allows you to access and adjust your Nest thermostat remotely on your phone.

If that were it, I'd give it five stars and call it excellent. But, there are a few minor quibbles that prevent me from doing that.

Quibble 1: The Nest thermostat doesn't integrate with Apple's HomeKit (I have no idea about other smart-stuff systems). I've heard rumors that Nest is working on adding HomeKit support, but seeing as how Nest is owned by Google, I'm not going to hold my breath for this.

Quibble 2: The function that can tell if you're home or not isn't perfect. The thermostat is in a fixed location. It can only monitor the immediate area around the thermostat. If you aren't in the room in your house or business with the Nest thermostat, it may not think you are home, even though you are, and switch into away mode. I wish that Nest had some sort of remote sensor product that could be connected to the Thermostat that could be placed in other strategic locations in the home to handle this (and potentially read temperatures in other locations as well).

3. Nest is owned by Google and all the data-collection concerns that may come with that. Take that for what it's worth and make your own decision if that is important to you or not (for me, it's not—I don't care if Google knows when my thermostat changes temperature—but for others this may be a concern).

Don't take this review the wrong way. I really like the Nest. It's good. It hits most of the expectations I have of a smart thermostat. I just wish it could be great.",A Good Smart Thermostat with a few Minor Quibbles

I must say, they claim for it not to be much different, but the size is slimmer/sleeker, display is nicer, and from what I noticed the extra sensors helps a lot. It’s much more responsive to passing by or waking up to it than the gen 2. With the extra sensors, I assume it can even more accurately read indoor temp, also, as I noticed the ac running less from the logs.

I really had no problems with the install and linking to the app. Everything worked on the first try. It was surprising how heavy the thermostat felt before I mounted it.

As far as the thermostat's operation goes, it seems to get confused whether I am home or not. My schedule varies A LOT, and I have NO consistency for a daily schedule. That said, I would say this is why my Nest is confused! If I had a M-F 8-5 schedule I would guess everything would be great.

My favorite part of the thermostat is when I pass close to it, the analog clock shows up. I don't have A/C and don't turn on the heat, so I really just have an expensive, but nice looking clock. I did get this on sale, used a gift card, and received a utility rebate, so I got a good deal anyway.","Easy install, ""feels"" high quality."

I've had 2 other models from Nest, and aside from the complexity of setup and use, everything else is flawless. App support is great, compatibility is fantastic. Worked first time I hooked it up and didn't need help wiring the thermostat to the AC unit. This was a wonderful experience in my opinion as my first hookup was filled with lots of problems.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2015,AlanD963,"The 3rd generation Nest Thermostat was easy to install and works perfectly with my heating system. It's too cold right now to check it with the air conditioning compressor.
It lights up big and bright as you walk by, and you have several choices of which display lights up. The default is just the set temperature in big bright numbers but you also have other choices such as an analog clock with a slowly sweeping second hand. Just click the face and you can see other information such as the inside humidity and the temperature outside.
A feature that I did NOT use is letting the device program itself. I turned off that feature in the setup and it was easy to select the times I wish the heat to turn up and down, as you would with a standard programmable thermostat although you can do it on the Internet as well as the device itself, and yes, everyone's favorite feature is you can turn the temp up or down from your bed, or from your car if you're on the way home.",I'm Happy With My Bright New Nest

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 May 2020,cj23,"This install appeared to be running smoothly until the thermostat wouldn't power on at all. That was an indication that I wasn't getting power to the RC wire. However, I had to connect the Nest to a power source for about 5 minutes to get a charge on it to see what the actual problem was. Called out an AC technician, and he told me that I should have turned off power to the furnace as well as to the outside unit. Without turning off the power to the furnace, I blew a fuse on it, causing no power to make it from there to the Nest. After he replaced the fuse, it's been smooth sailing.","Great product, just some tips"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,KBMarino,"First off, the style beats the old round thermostats and the more recent square bricks mounted to the wall.  Form and function are incorporated beautifully.  Installation on my system was straightforward and simple. The only issue was the size of the wire labels. I had a hard time applying them snd getting them to stick.  Photographing the wires with tags was a great help. Once the base was attached to the wall, the first step, and the wires were attached to the screw-free clips on the base, the main “dial” of the thermostat just snaps onto the base.  Throwing the breaker back to the on position for the furnace powers up the unit on most systems. Then the setup program begins.  Simple, straightforward and done in about 3 minutes.  Connecting to the home network gives nearly immediate access to the wireless functions with Google Hone products and Alexa.  You can speak to these products or use the apps. Easy as pie.",Great Product
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Jun 2020,Kiki,"Overall I like the thermostat.  It's good for my partner who is legally blind.  He can see the numbers on the thermostat as they are large enough, and it's easy for him to use, just left or right, cooler or warmer.  Dislikes:  1)The app keeps dropping me and I have to keep signing in.  The app stays on my phone, but every time it thinks I'm out of wi-fi range, it acts like it doesn't know me and I have to sign in again.  This is really annoying if it's 3 AM and I want to turn down the air and not get out of bed.  2) The other dislike is I can't tell by looking at the thermometer OR the app what the actual temperature in the house is.  It will only tell me outside temp and the temp it is set for, but not what temp it is inside the room where the thermostat is.  It's weird.  Other than that, I like it",Works well

The installation went well, the directions were sufficient for a novice person to understand. The only difficulty that I experienced was getting the app to work correctly.

I have two of these thermostats at my primary home, so I picked up another one for my vacation home.  Not only can you remotely control the temperature, but you can save money in a few different ways.  Create a schedule and if you don't know how or forget to, this smart thermostat will auto-create one for you; based on your habits or if it detects if you are home or away.  Plus, most utility companies run rebate programs (Rush Hour).  For example: to conserve energy the thermostat may auto raise or lower your temp by a few degrees once or twice months and in return, you will receive a check in the mail ($50 for each thermostat) I have received over $300 in the past few years!",Piece of mind and can earn you yearly refunds

If you can carefully follow the instructions provided in their tutorial video, you don't even have to hire a pro to install it! That part is completely up to you, but they make it simple enough for the average person! 

Integration, functionality, and communication with the Nest app will probably make you question why you didn't purchase it sooner! Not only is it easy to setup and control, but it begins to program itself after a few days to make those same adjustments that you would likely make at certain times of the day!

We turn ours off completely quite often as we like fresh air when it's cooler in the evenings and, you wouldn't think it's a big deal but, it's also nice to be able to just use the phone app to do so. Yes, it's easy enough to walk over and do but, more than often I use the phone. 

If you are looking for complaints/flaws, the only gripe I can think of is it's a little to smart. You want to make adjustments, sometimes it readjusts itself shortly after because it's on a schedule.

I can turn on my air conditioner from anywhere.. if you’ve been on a summer vacation and had it turned down or off, you can turn it back on before you head back so it’s nice when you walk in. It truly is a game changer. Also.. I’m pretty sure it’s saving me money on my bill. I’ve run my air conditioner more often than before, but it doesn’t run as long now, which keeps the rooms cool and the bill lower.

There are lots of things I like about this thermostat, although it comes up short; and I bought four for my home and am now committed! The biggest gap is that there is no HOLD TEMP feature. I had to turn off learning and delete schedules to use two of them like manual thermostats; a waste of money other than the ability to adjust from my phone. Next, I had a lot of set-up issues; multiple attempts per thermostat were required.  Finally, the AWAY feature or Geofencing has yet to work. This was very important to me. I really like the Remote Sensor functionality, although already had a problem. After running fine for several days, one sensor disconnected from its thermostat. After much troubleshooting, I found that the sensor was fine and I had to reset the connected thermostat. The learning feature is nice, but without the other features I mentioned, it’s just another thermostat.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,PapaS,"This is my 2nd Nest 3rd Gen Smart Thermostat. 1st was installed 6 mos ago for our upstairs HVAC zone. I like it well enough to get another for our downstairs HVAC zone. Best lesson learned from 1st Nest: Don't let anyone install a Nest thermo without having a hot (power) wire connected to the Nest otherwise when the Nest's backup battery runs out the Nest will die disabling the HVAC. I had to have an licensed electrician diagnose the problem & run a hot wire to the Nest because the Nest installer did NOT know about the necessity of the hot wire because the Nest worked great once installed...for 30 days, then  while we were away from home during winter weather everything shutdown. ! I knew the system was out as monitoring it online indicated so. At anytime, I can check on the Nest using the Nest App. I can also ask Alexa for very limited information like, ""what's the temperature in the upstairs mid bedroom?"" The App provides much more extensive details and options, i.e. adjusting the temperature. Upstairs is empty-nested, so there's usually no one there to use it, so I haven't had any experience yet with using it's ""smart"" capabilities. The new one will be smart enabled so it can learn our habits via experience and make adjustment without having to make on-the-spot personal adjustments. I am anxious to see how that works out! Most significant downside: Alexa is not yet sophisticated enough to do all she's asked to do regarding the Nest thermostat...might have to wait for the development of a ""Smart Alexa"" to be capable of working with a ""Smart Nest"" thermostat!

Regarding the Nest Sensors. I love having the option of determining which of the upstairs rooms need to be comfortable for occupants. The sensors can allow that.

I wish Bestbuy would have stated this device requires a ""C"" wire to power it. My home has air handler built into heat pump system, 26 years old. My current Honeywell thermostat is powered by batteries NOT by a live wire. You take batteries out and old  thermostat goes blank. The 2nd clue was there was no breaker to kill power to thermostat.

It takes a week to learn your habits and automatically builds a weekly schedule that is customizable. Before we had the NEST, it was common to forget to turn down the heat at night or during the day when we are at work but now, I hardly touch it. The remote monitoring through the app allows us to call for heat without having to come home. There is also a report generated that tracks the amount of heat/cooling called (in hours) so it's easy to see changes week-to-week. I would never go back to a regular thermostat.

I personally have none, and had it up and working within 15 minutes. - I won't go on about all of the features, as you can read that anywhere, what I will say is that I have seen a SIGNIFICANT reduction in my heating and cooling bill since I purchased this. First it makes changing time of day temperature scheduling a breeze, so unlike most units where you would set it and thats it forever, this is so easy you feel comfortable modifying it through out the year. Second, it learns when you are away and your schedule over time, to help turn off and on heating or cooling automatically. At first there were a few times when I would say wow it is cold in here and see that the heat had been turned off, so I would turn it back on - but after a bit it had become very accurate. Third you get a report from NEST monthly informing you of your usage and some simple breakdowns of why you saved or used more. It is a great way to get simple insight into your patterns to help adjust a bit. I literally paid for this unit within the first year. Also to boot, many power companies offer rebates to get these, as even they recognize how cost effective they are in the end!",Must Buy

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,Iseulde,"Before I purchased Nest, I was very apprehensive about installing it by myself. There is no way I am paying $200+ to have this item installed. However, Nest has a very good 6-minute video that walks you through how to install Nest from beginning to end. After watching that, I felt more confident, but I was still worried about drilling a hole in my wall (sheet rock). I was able to communicate with Nest representative right away - they have 24/7 service - and have my questions answered. The day I installed Nest I was able to walk through each step carefully as provided by the instruction, and when I got stuck I was able to call the Nest rep immediately. Within 45 minutes my Nest was up and running, and I have 0 handyman skills. There was very little to set up, and I really enjoyed how Nest learned my preferences after a week, and I was able to adjust it once the weather changed. I also felt my AC wasn't blasting air as violently as it was using the old thermostat, and my house is feeling more comfortable when I arrive home. I haven't had Nest long enough to see any bill changes yet, but with how much setting you can use the Nest for I think I can adjust it enough to start saving me some money.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,EGMReviews,"I had been looking for a programmable thermostat for a while. Most of them have online compatibility checkers where you can plug in your current thermostat's wiring configuration and find out if it will work for you. We just bought this house this past summer and thought the thermostat was programmable, but upon closer inspection, it wasn't. It was just made to look fancier than it really was. So I took the cover off and checked out the wiring. Every place I went said it wasn't compatible with my system. On a whim, I chatted online with the Nest customer service. The rep was amazing. She had me take some photos of my wiring and of the furnace itself. We have a funky heat pump hybrid system that doesn't seem to be supported by most programmable thermostats. Bu she said I was indeed compatible and then emailed me my custom wiring diagram for the Nest thermostat. I went to my local Best Buy and picked it up. Then, using the recommended YouTube video, I installed the whole thing myself in about 30 minutes. It worked the first time without an issue. Now I'm not the world's best handyman so I know that if I can do it, just about anyone can do it. A couple of tips for when you start using the Nest thermostat: When you first get it running, adjust it a lot. It learns from you making adjustments. If you don't, it tries to save you as much money as it can but your house might be colder or hotter than you would like. Also, get familiar with the press and turn user interface. This took a little getting used to but once I figured it out, it was fine. I am already seeing reductions in energy usage. And it is rapidly learning our family schedule. Just an all around great device that does exactly what it promises.","Great Product, Great Service, Great Company"

I was fully expecting to patch some holes and then measure + drill new holes to mount the Nest. Nope. It comes w/ a bracket that perfectly aligned w/ the existing holes for my old thermostat (Honeywell Chromotherm III). Screwed in the bracket, matched the colored wires to the corresponding Nest tabs, inserted the wires, and then mounted the Nest. Set-up was a breeze from there - just select language, enter your wi-fi password and you're done! It took me longer to replace a wall outlet as part of this same project than it did to get the Nest up and running. Literally less than 10 minutes! As for look and feel, the Nest is a beauty. It's heavy and feels solid, not cheap. As soon as I was done installing it, I was calling all my friends and family to get one of these! Nest thought of everything, it comes with a nice plate to fit over the bracket so it looks clean when mounted AND not only did they include a screwdriver (which fit the screws perfectly), it's a magnetized driver so you don't drop the screws when installing!

I purchased the Geek Squad when purchasing the thermostat. When it didnt work I called them asking for help.... they were absolutely no help, no one I talked to were familiar with thermostat.

Overall, I've loved this product since I've had it! The integration with the app is great and checking to see if the Eco temperatures are working is great to do on the fly! One downfall of this product that I was not happy about was the location services from your app. I was under the impression it was to start understanding if you were coming home and would heat the house up before you got there by using your location. This is not the case. It'll start heating your house when you're about a block away in my experience. Otherwise all the features they've described work just as good as they sound!

I was concerned about getting the Nest wired up. Because I have a radiant heat system and central air conditioning. Which mean a couple extra wires. But the instructions, and little tools they get you in the box made it almost idiot proof. So followed the instructions and used the extra face plate they provided in the box. And within 30 minutes my Nest was up and running. My temperature in my condo has not been more stable. I will note that I did reach out to an electrician just to see how much they wanted to do the install. It was ridiculously high and so I truly believe if I could install this.

My home was built in 07’, current thermostat did not require a common wire but luckily one was installed just not connected so all I had to do was connect one end up in the attic to the furnace to make it “live” and then plug it into the nest.

It SAYS you can use the Nest without one but what ended up happening was my AC system would run for 30 seconds and then shut off for 10 and then kick back on. Certainly not healthy for the unit!

Very very easy installation. The directions were so user friendly. I love this thermostat. It senses when someone is near and lights up and shows the temperature in the room.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,bqaggie,"If you're a Texas resident or somewhere where you heavily rely on your HVAC unit, then I highly recommend a NEST.  It's programmable online, on a smartphone app & everything is so user-friendly. It was a breeze to DIY install. Took no time & you don't have to be a professional electrictian whatsoever. Rather than continue to waste money on a non-programmable thermostat, this is a MUST HAVE.  If you want your home set at a particular temp while you're gone, or if you change your mind (or the weather does) then you can simply adjust via the app.  So simple.",A homeowner's MUST HAVE
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Bethko,We bought this for my parent's house. After the app told us we needed a pro to install it we were able to call the support line and the tech was able to walk us through everything! It's so easy to adjust and the cats can't accidentally change it like the previous thermostat! I am planning on installing one in my house too! I highly recommend this thermostat if you are looking to upgrade your thermostat.,Great thermostat!
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,bigfish4545,"Purchased to replace an older (but still working) programmable thermostat. Installation was very easy, about ten minutes. Another few minutes to connect to my wireless network and I was ""in business"". I set a program and things have worked perfectly since.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,AtomicClock,"Replaced what seemed like an ancient thermostat with insanely complicated controls and no way to set auto cool and heat together. This Nest unit has it all: tons of settings/customization and flexibility, wi-fi to change your temps from your bed or couch because you're as lazy as I am, and it even looks cool! Installation was SUPER easy and fast, and customer service was excellent! I contacted them with a couple of pre-installation questions, and actual human beings helped me out right away! I had to make sure I was still on Earth after that call, or at least not dreaming! Anyway, just buy it, it's awesome and way better than your old one without a doubt. Just check for compatibility first, their online tool can help you with that, so that you don't buy one and then complain that it doesn't work with your system, like other people who don't do their homework. ;)",AWESOME upgrade

It just works and if you have the other products (Cam, and Smoke Detectors) they communicate with each other, I could turn on the thermostat from my phone, from home or at work. It also knows if im home or not, so if I go away and left it on, it turns it;s self off. Great! This is an A+.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,TeslaNinja,"We love our Nest. The ability to adjust the AC away from home is great, especially when the summer sets in those 120 degree temps destroy our electrical bill. The smart features are ok, but our schedule is too variable right now for this to be very helpful (when on, the nest tries to predict your schedule and adjust the temp based on what you seem to like - this only works if say every Monday in your life is uniform - ours is not with 2 young kids, variable nap times, activities, etc). You can make your own schedules if you like as well. Set up was pretty easy. I like know tech fairly well, but I am no electrician. Nevertheless, an online video or 2 and we were up and running w/o having to spent 200 bucks on an electrician. If you like, you can have the nest sense when you are coming and going (using GPS on your phone). Nest has a nice program that has our cameras, nest protect (smoke detectors) and nest thermostat all in one place. This is nice, esp when on vacation and checking in on everything. Sometimes I wonder if an Ecobee 3 would be better with its individual room temp sensing technology but overall I like the nest ecosystem so I am happy with the purchase.",The nest is great

If you over tighten screws on the mounting plate the main part will not snap on because the mounting plate needs to be perfectly flat.  Even a slight warp not visible to the eye will make the main part impossible to mount.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Fortyfour,"Installed to work with hydronic baseboard heat only. Ugh! Had me worried as so many different settings to choose from and nothing specifically noting hydronic heat just “radiant” heat. It did take some time to learn (not sure if because of type of heating system) so I thought it wasn’t working initially and I kept changing the settings which didn’t help. Almost returned it. Best to set it up and forget it. I found the app a little buggy (iPhone 6s). Sometimes when away it had me logged as being “Home” so I took the “auto scheduling” off. It learns the times you prefer your heat turned up and down anyway so once I got that figured out, all was well. Didn’t have to touch it after a few days. Some learning curve but totally worth it. Customer service was also responsive and took time over phone to ensure all was set up properly. The price can be shocking but if you’re into cool gadgets and wanna change your heat setting from anywhere using an app, it’s for you.","I hate, like, love it"

My house is fairly large, and it was built 30 years ago, heating and cooling the house is just as easy as before and SO much cheaper. In the first four months, the savings paid for the devices. They were basically free. It is also a nice touch to be able to adjust the temperature from your phone if you wake up in the middle of the night from being too hot or too cold.

I like how it knows that we are not home and lowers the temperature automatically. We are also replacing our heaters, and the installer said that these thermostats are far and away superior.

I know from looking at the history (the first day I let it run the same schedule as my old programmable thermostat did on a weekend when I was home). The difference in how much it ran that day compared to since then, when I can turn it up and down, with my Echo, is unbelievable. And it is so convenient in the middle of the night to be able to use my voice to turn the thermostat up or down instead of getting out of bed and going down the stairs to reach the thermostat. I love all smart devices, but this one is hands down the best. And though this is the only brand I have tried, as it is my first smart thermostat, I can't imagine any other could be any better. From the eco settings, to the history and it even tells you the humidity, and of course the ease of use through voice control.",Excellent

Install was easy enough. Very intuitive menu system was easy to navigate, and the thermostat was hooked up to my wifi in minutes.

After installing, just begin using. After about a week, the Nest thermostat learned all of our heating/cooling patterns and I haven't had to make an adjustment since. No setting up daily or weekday/weekend schedules!

Your nest also keeps track of how long your heat/AC runs each day and can display it to you. When you hook it to an online account, it can also provide you with monthly email reports of your energy usage.

Finally, it was super simple to get this hooked up to my Amazon Echo, so I now no longer need to walk over to the thermostat to make adjustments. The Echo can make adjustments via simple voice commands.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2016,tmw1564,"I purchased a 3rd generation Nest thermostat and installed it. I had one issue with this. To charge its batteries, the Nest needs a C (common) wire hooked up; otherwise it tries to charge itself whenever the heating or cooling system is running -- the only time current is passing through it. When I hooked one of my Nests up, it said it needed to charge its batteries, and even though my house had no need for cooling or heating, it turned my HVAC on for hours to charge its batteries. I researched, found out what the problem was, and hooked up a C wire (luckily my HVAC controller had a place to hook up a C wire and my thermostat wires each had three extra wires in them). Good luck to anyone without an extra wire to use.",Well Worth It

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,3,23 May 2020,Nick,"I bought this because I needed a new thermostat and wanted the cool new thing.  It works as advertised, which isn't as good as it sounded.

First of all, I would recommend getting the version that comes with the remote sensor.  I had to run out and buy it separately because my new HVAC system isn't balanced well.  Once I got the remote sensor, I was able to get everything working great!

The disappointing feature was the ""learning"" part.  No fault of the product, it does what was advertised, but I ended up disabling it because I wanted to manually set the schedule to do what I wanted.

What really disappoints me, are 3rd party integrations.  Nest used to work with everything, then Google demolished the API and replaced it.  Now almost nothing works with the thermostat.  I wish I hadn't bought it.  

If I could make the choice over again knowing what I know now, I would buy an Ecobee.","Works Well, But Lacks Integration"

Within a week, it warned me that my heater was ""short cycling,"" an issue often caused by lack of proper airflow. I am good about replacing filters, but I was buying the denser, more expensive filters. However, this was leading to diminished airflow and a doubling of my electric bill that I had just attributed to increased prices and other devices in my home. When the Nest warned me of this issue, I went out and bought the right filters, which were substantially less, and my electric bill for the month dropped by $150, cutting it in half.

Super easy to setup and get up and running. Pull off your old thermostat, look at those labels where the wires are connected to, label them if necessary. Connect your new Nest and connect the wires. Setup screen is super easy and walks you through the settings.

The app is easy to use. I started with a week of learning to build out a basic schedule and then we control it with the app or have it detect when we are not home. Easy and my heat runs much less now. 

I was worried about setup, replacing a rectangle thermostat with a circle one usually leaves unfinished walls. But there is a great rectangle plate that you can install that covers that up.",Up and running with ease

I began to purchase LED light bulbs as a start, new energy efficient appliances, and then September 2015 the Nest 3rd Generation was released which caught my attention. I asked my father-in-law who had the Nest 2nd Generation for information and he had nothing negative to say about it so I was sold. After comparing it to other competitors I was hooked on this one due to the ease of installation, good reviews, and $100 electric company rebate (ask your local energy company).",A+

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,NestLover,"This thermostat is easy to install. The Nest website has a video you can watch that will lead you through each step. Watch the full video first. Then watch a step at a time, pause the video after the video of the step, perform the step, and repeat until installed and set up. I think someone that has never installed a thermostat can install this thermostat by watching the video (and it comes with a screw driver to facilitate installation). The video also walks you through the steps to set up the connection to your wifi network and settings. The auto away feature is very helpful in not running your unit if you are away. The internet and app set up was a breeze. I can control two units from my phone app. If you have been away for a while, you can check the temp before you head home and turn the unit on if you'd like to cool things down before you get home. There is a monitoring feature so you can see how long your unit ran each day. It is so easy to install and easy to use. There are no buttons and switches and settings that other thermostats have that can be intimidating. The auto learn feature is really cool too.",Totally awesome web enabled thermostat

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,steve,"This thermostat works great and has a lot of functions ordinary ones don’t. It is also compatible with the rest of my smarthome, so I can control the AC on the go or with voice control. I have, however, encountered a few issues that prevent a 5 star review. 

First, it has not saved me any money on electricity, and I have had the product for a year now. This may be due to the fact that I already had good habits of turning my AC up when I left.

Second, Amazon Alexa can not always connect to the Nest to control. Sometimes, the “Alexa” just can’t understand me, which is not Nest’s fault, but other times it cannot find it due to connectivity problems. I am very tech savy, so this was not an installation flaw on my part.

Third, Nest automatically turns off for away mode based off lack of movement in the house. This means if I don’t go into my laundry room, it just kicks off. I have woken up in a pool of sweat a few times as a result. I really wish Nest was smart enough to sense my smartphone’s presense like some other products.

Overall, I still enjoy this product more than many I have purchased, but in 2 or 3 years, I believe there will be a significantly better product on the market that may make me wish I waited to upgrade. For now, though, this is the best thermostat I know about (though I admittedly have not looked at the ones that came out in the last year).",Good product but could be improved

I removed it from its mounting bracket and was able to see the wiring that connected it. Went to the Nest website, found the wiring configuration and said to myself, ""I can do this."" So headed to Best Buy and bought the Nest. Half hour later it was installed and set up. Over the next week it learned how we like to keep our home temperature. And now it just takes care of things.

Really like the intuitive controls and ability to make changes to the system from home or when away. The self-learning algorithm has exceeded our household expectations and the Nest system itself has proven to be a key component in our overall smart home system.

The only drawback was installation required an HVAC specialist to install. Had checked with Nest Support (amazing service) in advance it would work, but due to a proprietary cable from Carrier, needed to have it rewired at the furnace side of things as well as at the thermostat.

It was easy to install. I just popped off my old unit, detached the wires and installed/wired the nest using the online instructions. It was surprisingly simple and worked well immediately. I took off a star because of some of the issues with the home vs. away mode, eco mode and recently while traveling I had it on away mode so that it wouldn't cool the house so often, but for some reason on one of the days I was away it reverted back to the normal cooling schedule.

At first, I thought I screwed up because my Nest shut off for a few minutes. I couldn't figure out how to turn it back on or why it turned off but eventually it came back on and it's been fine since. As far as design and features, it's exactly what it's supposed to be. It has a bunch of things you can adjust in the settings. It does the best it can at saving energy. The best thing I can say is that it's worth buying if you want something more than a standard thermostat.",Nice Thermostat
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,CautiousBuyer1,"Review for Nest Thermostat 3rd Gen Stainless Steel. 

Love this thing! Not sure if it's more about the thermostat or the fact that I don't have to get up in the middle of the night to adjust the temp as I did before. 

Now, as you may have heard in reviews as I did before purchasing, it does have some flaws. Today the Eco mode came on when my wife left for work but I was still home asleep. I knew the house felt cold for some reason. Seems if it doesn't sense movement over a certain amount of time it switches to Eco. Never really did that before today. For those that don't know, there is a mode of degree range you set for when you're not home called Eco Mode. It keeps the home from using energy when it senses that no one is there but automatically keeps the temps from becoming dangerously hot or cold.

On another note, when setting, the temp seems to sway 1 or 2 degrees from what it's set for. So if it's set to 75 it will shut off around 76, and turn on around 74. From what I've read in other reviews and forums, this is possibly to keep it from switching on and off so frequently. For these reasons I give it 4 stars.Think they may have tried to make it do too much whereas it falls short of accuracy on a few features. But for my need (which was the convenience) it is great. I can live without some of the other stuff, just switch it off. I'd say this device (as with any) is something that's according to you or your family's needs. Some features in your phone you don't use, as some other people do. Find out what you can or can't live without in your best interest. I got tired of getting up and down when I finally get comfortable. 

Either way it's better than your old thermostat that's downstairs or across the room that you have to change in the middle of the night. That alone makes it worth it to me!!",Love this thing!
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JV82,"I watched the online installation video and the Nest was really easy to install. (The only thing I would alert people too, that was not in the instructions or on the online video, is that even with the breaker switched off, if any of the wires touch at all while installing (or switching out the old thermostat) you can blow a fuse in your furnace. Luckily it is a cheap and easy fix if it happens, but just a heads up to be really careful with the wires when installing to avoid the inconvenience.) Since installing the Nest, it works just as promised and “learned” my patterns within the first few days of use. The Nest and the app are easy to use. I would highly recommend it.",Great thermostat

Its perfect for me, considering one of my bedrooms gets the afternoon and evening sun so it was literally 9 degrees hotter in that room.... I could see it right there on the app!!

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,kboyk1,"Do not be intimidated to install this on your own it's not hard. The instructions it comes with and YouTube online shows you how to install.
Take a picture of the way the wires were installed on your old thermostat prior to uninstalling. In doing so this will ensure that your connections are connected correctly.
It takes the Nest a couple of days to remember what temperatures you like when you are home and at what times you are home. After a couple of days Nest will ask you if you want it to automatically go into ""Away Mode"" when it senses you are not home.
Keep in mind the Nest system has a 1 degree band and learns your particular home.

App is also easy to use. I wish the setting of a weeksly schedule was more easy to customize.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2015,ajschenk,"The 3rd generation of Nest is an outstanding product. My primary reason for wanting the Nest was to meet my needs of a thermostat that I could control remotely. I travel almost every weekend, and wanted to be able to set the thermostat to a very energy efficient setting when gone for a few days, but also wanted to return the setting to my comfort zone ahead of me arriving home. This product certainly meets those needs.

The initial learning period required a bit of work, until Nest learned my patterns of when I'm home, at work, etc. After two weeks, everything was perfect.

I also have Xfinity Home Security/Automation, which this now seamlessly syncs with. When I arm the system, Nest automatically goes into the ""Away"" state, and restores itself to ""Home"" when the system is disarmed.

The install took less than 5 minutes, and comes with everything needed, down to the screwdriver. Setup to wifi and the the app took another 5 minutes, tops.

I love managing the system with the Nest app which enables you to adjust the temperature, set the heating or cooling mode, set your daily temperature schedules, remotely run the fan, view home humidity and review your past energy history. It also reminds me to check the furnace filter.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2016,ThisIsNot,"I followed the instructions that came with the Nest and had it installed in just a couple of minutes. Setup was a breeze as the Nest pretty much holds your hand through the process. I had it paired with my home's wi-fi and setup through the Nest app on my iPhone. I like that the Nest tries to decrease our cooling and heating bills by sensing when we are and aren't home.

My main complaint is that it wants to use temperatures that are too extreme for our dogs. The Nest wanted to let our house get up to 86 degrees in the summer and go down to 65 degrees in the winter, when we aren't home, before kicking the AC or heater on. That's too extreme for our dogs so I had to disable the energy efficiency setting for the AC. I didn't realize it was going to do this until I left to go to the store and came back after an hour to a house that was 80 degrees.

I do like being able to adjust the thermostat from my phone, the Nest is futuristic looking and stylish, and it now work with my Apple Watch. It's automatic energy savings features need to be tuned. I think it would be easier if Google/Nest just added a setting so you could tell the thermostat that you have pets. That way it doesn't get mad at me for not letting the house get above 75 degrees when we aren't there in the summer.

There are other thermostats that will work just as well as the Nest if all you want to do is control them from your phone when you're home or away. Get the Nest if you want the thermostat to learn when you're home and away so that you can shave back on your heating and cooling bills.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Upstop,I have been wanting a nest thermostat for awhile but couldn’t justify the price. Found it on sale so made the plunge and got it. Installation is pretty straightforward but if you do run into questions on wiring nest will help you out and have you up and running in no time. Now I don’t know about saving energy but being able to see your usage is a great feature that I use a lot and it will learn your habits. When I’m not home I usually have my system off but when I’m getting ready to head home from work I open app turn on and start cooling. When I get home it’s nice and comfortable. Yes I’m one who isn’t going to cool the house and waste energy when I’m not there. Of course winter months will be a different story. When you leave the house you can set it up to switch to eco mode which is a great feature as well. It’s a great thermostat but it is an investment but I highly recommend it. I also recommend purchasing room sensors as well if your thermostat placement isn’t in the best location.,Great thermostat

The NEST comes well packaged, includes all you might need to install it and it has a beautiful screw driver. Gives you a lot of information and the application for apple or android users, allows you to control and monitor your house thermostat. It is also convenient for those moments when you're really lazy and don't want to walk to your thermostat to change the temperature, you simply do it in your app. But the best part is that it learns from your habits and you can program it.. I live in miami and there is nothing better than have my NEST turn the AC on so when I arrive the temperature is nice without wasting money leaving the AC working all day. Great investment.",Incredibly surprising
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,tree100,"I love the learning that the nest is known for. Installation was so easy. It even came with a screwdriver!

And did I mention I can now turn down the AC when I land at the airport so that my house is cool when I walk in the door? BONUS!

The only con is the price. These aren't cheap. However, check with your local electrical provider that might have rebates associated with this. Mine gave a $75 rebate for connecting it to my utility account. And supposedly they will give an annual $25 credit for as long as it is connected - essentially paying for itself even if you don't account for electrical savings that this will supposedly provide ""learning"" our habits.",Excellent Thermostat

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,yashart,"I had originally purchased an ecobee4 for the Alexa integration. However, the experience was less than stellar. No ESP, meaning the ecobee and my dot would both respond to commands. This got old incredible fast. Not to mention, the initial setup was easy - but I felt like I was constantly tweaking things to optimize cooling. I got tired of reading forums online and trying to figure out what the best AC cycle schedule for my home. After a few weeks, I decided to give the Nest a try to see if the ""grass was greener"". Sure enough, I've been enjoying the new thermostat for a few days now. No tweaking. No reading up online. No fuss. The thing just works.

I have a Nest device that is less than 2 years old.  When I turn the dial, it continues to say, “Please connect to base.”  Also, when turning the dial, it then falls off at times.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Ajhh,"Pros:
- gives monthly reports of usage.
- It knows when you are away (motion detection) and reduces the temp automatically to save power
- easily connect to WIFI
- Control your thermostat from anywhere
- Fairly easy to install a C wire for charging.

Cons:
- cost
- works best with a C wire for charging the battery. Some setups don't have an extra wire to be used for charging.

This is the 2nd Nest Thermostat I purchased. I had to install a C wire for each Nest I installed because my setup did not have an extra wire and I live in an area that can get extremely cold in the winter. It was as simple as running a new 5 wire thermostat cable through the holes that already had my existing thermostat wiring. Then I found the C terminal on my furnace and attached the wiring to it.",Great thermostat for a connected world

When you compare it to the ecobee and honeywell smart thermostats, the nest's minimalist design, clickwheel function and easy to grasp menu items takes the cake. You can set it up fairly easily with the instructions in the box but you have to be careful to properly label your old thermostat wires and connect the corresponding colors in the nest.

Installation was a breeze, though the smaller profile of the Nest left an exposed unpainted area that was behind the previous, larger thermostat and which needed to be repainted. 

The Nest learns your standard schedule very quickly, and it is easy to make changes on the go from either the thermostat itself or from the Nest app. I am also a big fan of the ""auto away"" feature that turns down the heat when you are away from the home (it detects ""away"" based on a combination of motion in front of the thermostat and (optional) location services on the Nest app).

Here is my story. After purchasing the thermostat from a nearby Best Buy store, I contacted Nest tech support to verify the proper connections were made. After they asked me a few questions, they direct emailed me a diagram, and it was followed to the letter, The system appeared to be working, but had a problem getting consistent cold air - the heat was also engaging when it wasn't supposed to (the outside temps were in the 90s). I called tech support, and they said the base plate that is mounted to the wall must be faulty. I was one day outside of Best Buy's return policy, so they sent me a new base plate at no charge. I still had the same problem. I had a qualified AC tech come out to the house the tell me the diagram from Nest had the wires hooked up incorrectly. 

I was a little disappointed this was not found on initial contact through the chat support nor on the one hour follow up phone call I had to make. I also wish it had Home Kit support through my Apple products.

It starts to lean the habits of my family, and then create a schedule for cooling the house according to what we usually like. It even can recognize if we are in the house, and if we aren't it will turn on ""eco mode"". Yes it is pricey, but I highly recommend it.",Fantastic Choice
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,gam1,I've been contemplating purchasing a smart thermostat for several years. I rent an apartment in an older three family home with an oil burner and radiator system. This combination doesn't really give me the best heating efficiency for my money. I installed the compatible Nest thermostat and now I can turn on the heat precisely from my smart phone saving me money while not wasting fuel. The Nest thermostat is a good reliable unit and has been working flawlessly for me this winter. Wish I went with my instincts several years ago I would have more money in my pocket.,Full control and peace of mind

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Dallas,"I was a bit skeptical about this thermostat, but after a very easy self installation, this little gadget hasn't stopped surprising me. It starts learning a routine pretty qickly and tells you how much time your heat/ac equipment has been on per day, and also identifies the days that you have economized usage. Out of 10 days, 7 has been minimal... I fan wait seeing my next electric bill!!! moreover, I really enjoy not having to get out of bed to set the tempetature... I either open the app, or ask Alexa to do it. It has been a short time since installation, but I'm already in love with my Nest.",Yeah!
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,BradleyJ,"Although I am happy with the two nest thermostats that I purchased I was not happy with the nest website, specifically where you enter what wires your current thermostat has and it tells you if the nest will work. Basically it says the nest will work for me (what it doesn't say is that you kinda have to hack it to work) After reading about horror stories online doing it the way nest says to (for my situation) I went ahead and pulled new thermostat wire to both zones and upgraded my zone relay switch box. I only splurged for the nests because after the sale I got both for 400 then I got 200 back from my gas company as a rebate. In the end I paid 200 total for both which was awesome..... then I had to tack on about 40 for new wire and 110 for the new relay box (not to mention hiring a professional to install the box if you aren't the type of person who feels confident doing the work. I did it myself and it's pretty easy, intimidating but easy). I still saved but now it doesn't feel like such a great savings haha. There are cheaper options that do the same thing but nothing will be as cool as a nest. It's definitely a splurge item. If you plan on just buying this and installing it make sure you have at least 3 wires behind your current thermostat and one of them is a constant 24v (this is assuming you are using the thermostat for heat only, heat and ac will require more than 3 wires)",Cool if you're into tech but research carefully

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,Creedence,"I have had a couple Nest thermostats in my house for about 3 years. They are fairly easy to use and quite intuitive, especially when paired with the mobile app. I had one of my 2nd generations thermostats develop some sort of problem (began to heat up, couldn't detect temperature, turned on the heat instead of the A/C--a general meltdown) so I bought the 3rd Generation as a replacement. I agree with most online reviews that say that gen 3 is an incremental improvement--mostly cosmetic--and generally not at all worth an upgrade from gen 2. Still, this version is more visible from a distance if that's something you care about.
The ""works with Nest"" compatibility family is a neat thing, and I do use that as a pretty big part of the connected ""smart"" home I've put together. However it's not a substitute for a dedicated home controller like SmartThings or (my choice) Homeseer. Nest does worth with those just fine. I've never tried Ecobee or the other competitors, but the Nest product line is a solid choice and certainly has an aesthetic appeal compared to a more traditional thermostat.","Good product, don't bother upgrading from v2"

Full installation took about 20 minutes; the greatest issue was removing the existing thermostat - I don't know who put that on the wall but one screw was stuck in the wall by Hercules himself, once I removed it, it was smooth sailing. Everything is color coded, so it was super easy. Turn the dial to set-up and that's that.

Extremely easy to install and it looks awesome on the wall. I can’t wait to see what the actual functions can do. My only opinion is if you know you are going to get one is to prepare the wall before hand. You might need to paint or patch holes from the previous thermostat. This isn’t a necessity because it does come with a white trim plate that you can put on to cover all that but I think it would look nicer with just the Nest on the wall.,"Just get it, it’s worth it"

One for upstairs and one for downstairs. I was a little hesitant but this thing is the real deal. With the app on my phone I can lay in bed and change the temperature or when I am away.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2016,CraigN,"I want to preface this review with I absolutely love my Nest, but it absolutely does have some flaws that prevent me from giving it a perfect score.

First, for the positives - it does a great job of controlling my home AC - it reliably figures out when I am away, it learned my weekend and temperature habits fairly quickly, and the quick-look when you walk by in front of it works fantastically. It has a great ""Heat & Cool"" setting for days that start out warm but get cold in the evening, or vice versa, or you can leave it on heat or cool individually.

Unfortunately it has some quirks - While it reliably figures out when I am away, it has a tougher time figuring out when I am home. I have spent hours out for a day and come home, and it stayed on it's ""Away"" function even after an hour of being in the house. 

Granted, both the app and the device get regular updates, and lately this quirk has happened less often, it was worth mentioning.

I absolutely love the product despite this and would recommend it to anyone looking to add a well connected and easy-to-setup smart thermostat to their home.",Excellent Smart Thermostat

It is also nice to be able to adjust the thermostat while away from home or just on a different floor of the home.

They recently updated the Nest app so that you can have multiple accounts controlling the same Nest(s), meaning my wife can use her own account and it tracks both our phones to know when to go into 'Away' Mode. I also like that I can see our usage history to see what days we use the most energy, though I wish it would let me look at a longer history than just one week.

I asked my father in-law who had the Nest 2nd Generation for information and he had nothing negative to say about it so I was sold.

When Nest came out, i was very enthusiastic, but then discovered that it couldn't control my humidifier. So I have been waiting. With the recent round of rebates I decided to try - and yes indeed it does control my Humidifier. But now it is wait and see. I can't specify an actual percentage for the humidity on the granularity that I previously could. I don't see an option for Frost control - where it will adjust humidification based on outside temperature. The previous system also had three sensors in the house, whereas the Nest relies on itself and its Cloud data. I like the integration with my other devices and trust that it is using the data from all 9 Nest Smoke Detectors to really confirm when we are home and when we are out - but time will tell.

You spend a week manually adjusting the temp to your liking, then it handles the rest. Gone on vacation?

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,2,23 Aug 2020,JayBee,"Long story short, the features and functionality of this device can be good to great.  However, make sure your system and thermostat connection point has and supports a common wire.  Despite Google/Nest's insistence that you do not need one in my experience and in that of many others you really do.  Without a common power your thermostat under heavy load will not pull enough power off your system.  As a result it will possibly (likely) cause your HVAC system to short cycle.  There are various remedies available to alleviate this issue, but for people who do not have a common wire and or have a system where heat and A/C are spliced together, this can be more trouble than its worth and or require an HVAC specialist to rewire your system.",Make Sure You Have a Common Wire

Not a problem - the Nest did not require WIFI to provide all the features I noted above. Once you get WIFI and load the app - even more impressive! The only reason I did not give this a full 5 stars is that the user manual was a little light on how to change the settings as the Nest was learning and applying changes.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,DCMD,The thermostat is easy to install and set up. It depend the first week learning your schedule so don't install right before a vacation (like it did). it has a motion sensor to see when you are at home which is a great function if you use the room where the thermostat is a lot. The phone app is nice if you get hot in the night (like from hot flashes) or if you want it super cool at night but don't want to get out of bed to a frigid house. Just pop open the app and turn the temperature up or down without leaving your bed let along walking downstairs.,Great thermostat for people with changing schedule

It was easy to install and pretty easy to get set up as well. They even have a very good process for verifying if this will work with your existing system. I took a picture of my wires and everything from my existing thermostat and sent it to Nest.

There was one wire additional in my previous thermostat and i connected it wrong at first (it was not there in NEST video). Initially the NEST was cooling although it says heating. I called NEST CSR and they asked me to reconnect this additional wire different location. That person was extremely helpful and it got fixed.

The only concern was the wires from the old thermostat not knowing 100% were they will be connected. However, you can call the representative and send them a picture of your current setting (before removing the wires from the old one) and the person at the other end will tell you exactly where they go.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,Recman,"This thermostat is unlike any I have had in that it can take the weather into account so it will try to reach setpoint by my personal schedule or learned schedule. Because I have a Radiant heat source it naturally takes a log time to get to setpoint which isn't the thermostat's fault. But it will take the heat momentum into its learning calculations in order to turn the heat off even if it's below the setpoint because of expecting it to naturally get warmer after my gas turns off. Really cool thermostat. 

I only had an issue of not charging it before I set it on the wall (which I recommend to do for 45 minutes) and it never quite got enough charge and therefore turned its wifi radio off.

The great thing about the Nest versus a regular programmable thermostat is that you are not stuck with a weekly schedule. As I work part time it has learned my schedule and will turn down when I leave for work, different days of the week. The programmable wouldn't do that, I had to turn it down and then back up.

A month later the system started giving me an error message on the thermostat screen. I called nest and they walked me through the troubleshoot. So, they determined I needed a common wire install because my old thermostat ran on batteries and the nest doesn't so it's started having a power sharing issue. The good news is nest will reimburse me for the HVAC tech to come out and install. I haven't received my check yet so that's why I'm rated this product 3 stars.

I watched a few YouTube videos prior to installation and they were very helpful. 

Find where the main breaker box is and check if labels are clear (and correct). I spent over 20 minutes to find the correct breaker switch since the labels on my breaker were wrong. I had to turn off each one and come back to the thermostat to see if the breaker I just turned off was correct one.

Check the fuel type of your furnace: natural gas, oil, or electric.
Have your home’s WiFi ID and password.

Two other things that I love about it is that it lights up when you walk past it, and that it knows the weather because you put in a zip code in the setup.",Great product

When installing it is relatively simple, but make sure that all of the wires are cut and stripped to the same length. If they aren't you will have a difficult time getting the thermostat seated properly.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,arjay67,"When the Nest first hit the market I was put off by the price. I was also skeptical if another ""internet sensation"" would have any longevity. I didn't want to be on the bleeding edge only to be burned if/when the company faltered. 

But Nest has stood the test of time and remained. So when I had some RZ certs to use I combined that savings with the $100.00 rebate from ComEd to feel a lot better about the price.

The Nest has shown to be easy to setup and operate. The instructions were clear, with additional information on their website that is very thorough. They also have installation videos for the more visual learners. They have a network of professional installers available if you really don't want to DIY. But for my situation, I found that the most difficult part of the installation was removing my old thermostat. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, everything is well labeled and the whole job took me about 30 minutes.

It's very nice that Nest includes the additional mounting bracket for those rare installations that would require it. But even better was the trim plate since my old thermostat was a bigger, rectangular model that had been painted around. The trim plate covered it up and made it a professional looking job. While I like and appreciate the inclusion of the trim plate, I would like it more if there were other finish options available. But this is a very minor issue. It just plain looks good on the wall.

I did have one momentary hiccup on the setup. On the first attempt it could not connect to my WIFI. I know the user/pass was corrected, it just took forever and then gave an error. I tried it a second time and it connected right away and has remained active for months. So if at first it doesn't connect, just wait a minute and try it again. 

I have the savings features enabled. So it's set to start cooling down about the time I leave work. But if I have to work late and it doesn't detect anyone home, it will stay in the upper setting until I arrive home. Better still, I can always launch the app on my phone and tell Nest to start the cooling before I leave work. I loved this feature so much about my car, now I have it IN MY HOME!!!",Rebates make it a MUST HAVE!

Before opening the box but after buying the Nest I read on the box to verify the unit will work on your system. The box says it will work on over 95% of homes in the US. I guess I must be one of the 5 % it doesnt work on. What was frustrating is that I checked the website and it told me to email technical support to verify it will work in my home. I did that and the customer support department told me that it would work. And for a short period of time it did. Until I realized that my upstairs and downstairs zones no longer worked.

It would be nice if you don't have to blast the heat that high for it to turn on. I'm still learning how to use it. So maybe we are missing something. It hasn't been. Cold enough to use the heat. Our home is well insulated. The true test will be when we try the AC in the summer,Good thermostat but!!!!

Even though I was on the chat line for what seemed like hours we never did get it connected to the internet.  (my two Nest cameras are both connected to the ap).  The chat line help was patient but at one point asked me to find someone else to help me enter the PW.  I explained I have two homes with the same PW in both homes and on several Nest devices but this one was not connecting.  Finally I surrendered and gave up.  I would have returned it but it is installed and working manually but will not buy another.,Disappointment

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,3,23 Nov 2017,SimGuy,"I purchased the thermistat after reading reviews. Installed and thermostat worked for a week. Woke up at 2 in the morning to a chilly house. Furnace was off. Called Nest and spent two hours on the phone with them trouble shooting. I was impressed with how much they helped. The internal battery was dead and the tech determined that it was because my router was conttantly pinging it keeping the radio on. I hadn't seen my router on the list of incomparable devices but he thought it was. We decided to try charging the battery using the USB port for a day and seeing if it started working. I installed an old thermostat in the intermediate. When I tried it a couple days later the battery was still dead. I didn't have time to mess with it so just returned it to Best buy. A couple days later a senior Nest tech called to ask about it. He said my router was comparable and that given the battery wouldn't charge the charging circuit was bad.

I was actually very impressed with the service team. I will probably try another Nest thermostat when I get the time. While working it performed well. I had it connected to our Logitech Harmony system and it worked well together.",I got a lemon.

Overnight and random times during the day it does not allow the temperature to go up but goes down 10 to 15 degrees. I am waiting for my next electric bill. I called and they had me clear all the memory setting. That doesn't work. It started doing it again within 12 hours.

After 6hours of customer support, my home was deemed incompatible, due to a C wire. Home is less than 2 years old. Fan would not turn off and nest face would not charge. Nest customer service was fantastic. However, i do believe; Nest needs make some minor changes to make the unit more compatible. They offer to reimburse for the cost of a C WIRE install, with a limit of $300. Since i needed two units installed (C wire) the cost was way higher. With the price of the nest, i didnt feel the investment was worth additional costs. Was sadly disappointed and let down. If nest is offering to assist with Cwire install (up to $300), Why not upgrade the product (allow for batteries) and or add an adapter which incorporates the C wire (like ecobee).

I turned off the auto schedule setting because I was cold all the time. I called nest and they told me to turn off eco setting. Expensive thermostat and so far I'm only using the programable setting and some mornings it is not at the desired temperature when I get up. Customer service said maybe it's because of the cold weather (high 20s) well I live in northern Michigan. What happens when it's below zero? 
I plan to call customer service again - at one point they said I may need the c- wire installed. If that's the case I will return it - not worth any additional cost - I only have a two wire system. I will update review if things get better",Still trying to like it

Installed and it worked like a charm for about 6 months. Then it kept disconnecting from WIFI and only able to work manually. Then it quit altogether.

Worked ok for three months and when we needed the air to work, it started blowing heat. Followed all the instructions found online and nothing worked.

It is costing me OVER $500 to get this installed. even though my a/c unit is only 2 years old they say that the NEST, because it steals power to charge its internal battery, needs another power source. Like the 5 wires in the thermostat aren't enough already. You have to pay for an a/c guy to prove its not your system having issues. Then get him or an electrician to run another wire to power the NEST. Guess again. Save your money! Because the Nest will not ever pay for itself.

I love how the display can be programmed to show the current outdoor temperature when approaching it, and then display the expected outdoor temps in the coming hours. This has proven to be a great way to find out about the temperature for the day in the morning and help me decide what clothes to wear!

Connecting to home wifi network was easy. Phone app is great.

I specifically was looking for a thermostat that offered multiple remote temp sensors. The existing thermostat location in our 1980's home leaves something to be desired. It is in a hallway and never does a great job regulating temperatures in the bedrooms it controls. With this thermostat and the complementary remote temp sensors, it should do the trick this winter to keep heat levels comfortable (full disclosure, this was installed this summer and I have yet to see how it performs during the winter. I will update my review if the experience is anything less than stellar).

I still wish the technology were not so expensive. I question the money it will save - but that is secondary to me since the issue with sensing the temperatures in the bedrooms was the problem I needed to solve with this thermostat.","Elegant interface, solves therm location issue"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,vibhutijaya,"Upgraded a super-old thermostat and humidistat combo in the new crib with this Nest. First of all, it is beautiful! We paired it with a third party moulding piece that surrounds it fully (a nest for the Nest). It really looks GOOD! We chose copper and the satin finish of the metal is exquisite. Enough about form!
The installation was pretty rocky and it is a story I have to tell for a little caveat emptor affect. We elected to visit the Nest website in order to select a skilled / trained Nest installer. Oh, boy...
The installer chosen was really responsive and sent some employees within the hour (which is amazing!) The guys who arrived proceeded to begin to attempt to install the Nest and it became clear to us that they had absolutely no idea what they were doing. At one point, I think the guys were even flipping through the little Nest manual. The short version of the installation debacle is this: for whatever reason, the guys could not get the Nest to power up and then suddenly (after about a 90 minute trial-and-error session) we were told that all was well. YIKES! A little bit of advice, not all Nest Pros are skilled and experienced in installing this device (despite what the Nest website and supposed Nest credentials might say). 
As far as function is concerned, it's been functioning really well. We're hopeful that we can squeeze a little extra life and efficiency out of our aging HVAC system and keep those bills down. It is really nice to schedule temperature fluctuations and to alter them from the mobile device. I've notice that if I want my place to be comfy and cool for my arrival, I definitely have to give the old system some time to get it cool for me, but that is not so much a condition of Nest as much as it is the limitation of a system that is 12+ years old. We know that when we replace the HVAC in this place, the Nest will be even more useful to us and so far we're happy with the purchase. Fingers crossed that the awkward installation wasn't a botched install. Looking forward to adding cameras and smoke detectors later on. Yay, Nest!",Test of the Nest

I started noticing significant savings on my utility bills and thought nothing more of it.  Then once the weather started to change the issues started to arise.  The learning feature started moving the temperature all over the place, I would frequently have to go in and program the thermostat back to the schedule that I wanted it on.  In heat/cool mode it would consistently let the temperature idle outside of the range specified.

Then in October the thermostat lost connectivity to my wifi connection and couldn't find any network.  I spent several hours on the phone with Google support until they determined that the nest had suffered a hardware failure.  Now I am waiting on a replacement device.  Considering that the first until only lasted 4.5 months, I am not exactly optimistic about the longevity of this device.

My home is only 5 years old but no one could get it to work with my system without it blowing fuses and completely disabling the heat pump.  $250+ wasted on installation.  Too many complications with it so I had to return the units.  So much for wanting to be energy efficient.  There is nothing special about my HVAC system and the professionals couldn’t even get it to work.  Sorry I even tried.,Terrible Experience
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Nov 2018,Skyrider,"My AC system doesn't have a C wire, but the nest doesn't require one. However, in this case, it recharges it's battery by tapping into your AC's circuitry. 
As a result, the day after I installed the nest, I had a burning smell coming from my AC system. It turns out my heating system was somehow getting switched on even though the AC would be off. In other words, with the system off and no air circulating, the heating circuitry was on. The repair bill was $250. At first, I thought maybe the Nest was not the culprit. However, a day after the heating relays, wiring and elements were replaced, the burning smell came back. 
I removed the nest thermostat and reinstalled my old thermostat and have not had any issues since.
It's too bad, because I really liked the thermostat with it's wireless smart technology and functions.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Nov 2017,AdamS,"I spent 6 hours with support trying to get this to work. The first person I spoke to asked what my heating and cooling systems were and I told him, giving him exact model numbers. Then we spent several hours trying to troubleshoot before I got disconnected. After reconnecting I had to start all over again and once again got disconnected a couple hours in. 
The problem is my heating and cooling system are separate. I have an older gas fired forced hot water system. A few years ago I had central AC installed with a blower. Every time I hooked up the Nest my AC kicked on and wouldn't stop. I even tried the C terminal (common) and it still wouldn't work correctly.
Finally the third person I spoke to told me my blower wasn't compatible and it was a known issue. I could've saved 6 hours of my day if the first tech would've told me that. Instead I wasted all that time on a fruitless effort trying to make it work.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Nov 2017,Momm,"I give this product one star for the first item, which was ultimately resolved by a second unit. If I could give negative stars for Nest as a company, I would give them a -10. If you keep reading, you may not want to purchase this item in the first place. **Warning: It is long, but trust me... you want to read it!**

I bought two of these for both zones in my home. One worked flawlessly and calibrated itself within minutes. The other one, however took more than an hour to calibrate, which after calling Nest Support, they claimed was normal since they verified it was wired properly. Something, however told me that it wasn't normal, but I accepted the word of the expert on the phone. Eventually it calibrated and started blowing warm air like it was supposed to since it was winter. It seemed to take a little longer than normal to reach a warm temperature and we noticed it would turn on for what seemed like no reason, but thought it just must be a super sensitive product that would keep the air temp. precisely where it should be, so we ignored that as well. As the seasons changed and we got hit with a particularly warm spell early in the Mid-Atlantic, the A/C never turned on. In fact it was still blowing warm air even though it said it was ""cooling"". 

I tried trouble shooting and eventually went through the entire set-up procedure again to no avail. I called Nest Support and the woman on the phone was very pleasant, but told me to disconnect a wire that the previous agent had told me was installed properly. She also told me to leave this wire disconnected since it caused the unit to begin to blow cold air as it should. Okay, I will once again accept the advice of the ""expert"" and do as I'm instructed even though it goes against that gut feeling that it was wrong. I was just thankful to have cold air again.

The next day I go to work and get a call from my neighbor telling me that my A/C unit is making strange loud noises. When I get home, I hear the crazy sounds coming from my unit and the upstairs is hot. Really hot! Immediately shut it off and don't bother calling Nest at this point. I get a real A/C tech over to check my system. He tells me that my Nest was sending too much voltage to the unit and fried my ""contactor"" which switches between hot and cold. He replaced that part, put the Nest back on line and wouldn't you know....same issue occurs. He removes the Nest, puts a different thermostat on (also a learning system) and it worked perfectly. Then to show he wasn't trying to sell me anything, he took that down and put my ORIGINAL thermostat back up and again it worked perfectly. He told me I was lucky because a few more hours of use could have completely destroyed my A/C unit, then I would be looking at several thousand dollars to replace it.

I explained all of this to Nest Support and finally they agreed to send me a replacement Nest since I still wanted to use their product. A few days later I received it, installed it and it calibrated itself in less than 10 minutes. Surprise, surprise. AND it worked right the first time. So what would you do if you had this happen to you and your gut, your technician and the experiences all pointed to Nest damaging your A/C unit? Right! You would call them and request that they pay for the replacement part. You might even demand that they pay for the labor and appointment fee as well. I didn't though. I only asked them to pay for the part! A $165 part. That's it. 

Here is where the trouble really gets stupid and frustrating. This whole thing started in April. I was put on hold, promised call backs, transferred to multiple ""specialists"", ignored, insulted by argumentative language and then ultimately dropped from their radar all the while thinking I was getting somewhere. Two days ago on June 22, I could take no more and called and demanded to have the issue resolved immediately. I was not going to be promised a call back or to leave a message. After being transferred and hung up on, eventually I reach another ""specialist"". ONE HOUR LATER.... I was told my request was denied. Then she argued with me for requesting them to take another look and gave her the WHOLE story again. She said and I quote, ""Ma'am, if you want me to submit this to our senior management again, it will be denied"".

Enough. I give up. The Nest was defective and damaged my unit. That is 100% clear, honest and factual and even Nest knows this because they gave me a new unit. Nest support is garbage and will NOT support you when they are at fault. Buyer beware for sure! Do yourself a favor and ask technicians first if they have any issues with them before you trust your very expensive A/C unit to this thermostat. You will be surprised. What they don't tell you is it is NOT always compatible with your unit. You will NOT know this unless you ask them. Then they will reluctantly tell you. Good luck and you have been warned!",Buyer Beware/Some Defective & Cust. Service Aweful

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,FCJRK,"So this thermostat is the first one I’ve ever installed/replaced. It was very easy to do and I labeled my wires with the provided stickers. Literally walks you through everything step by step once it’s on. There’s not much else to say about the install itself. 

This device looks very nice! Has a big/bright display, has tons of options and settings depending on your needs and temperature habits. I’m actually very impressed with the unit itself. I’m used to either older digital models or the ones filled with mercury. So this is like looking into the future. 
I have not downloaded the app because currently I still prefer manually turning the dial. Which is fun to do nonetheless. 
There are settings galore and I do think the nest would be useful to many households. It is also supposed to help save money over time, not overnight. Calculate the costs and find how many months or years it takes to pay for itself. Anything saved after that is dollars in your pocket. 

My complaint would be to add a single temperature sensor in the box, without spending the extra money on the upgraded package. It does have one built into it, but honestly how many homes have the thermostat in an odd spot? In an area that isn’t used often or doesn’t get enough airflow for accurate temps?

Other than that I’m very happy with my nest purchase, it looks sleek and offers many settings for every temperature need I’ll ever have.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JUMA,"I was a little skeptic to pay $250 for a programmable thermostat and even when the price dropped when the 2nd Gen came out, I was still skeptical. But I have a family that includes 3 small children so our schedules are hectic and we don't always remember to turn our thermostat down when we should. Plus we go to the lake a lot in the summer and being able to control the thermostat from our smart phones was very intriguing to me. So I went ahead and made the purchase and after about a week, its been great. Its learning our schedule and the ""Auto Away"" has kicked in when we have left for an extended period of time. In fact with that feature, we only need to turn it up/down from our phones now when we are coming home from an extended leave. I will be anxious to check our electricity bills from last year to see if am getting the savings that I believe I am. Its a truly ""set it and forget it"" type of deal.

Now, I did have some problems with the installation. I am not expert in the HVAC business but I feel I do a pretty good job of following instructions. I did as I was instructed (configuring the wires) and the heat wouldn't kick on. I called the Nest customer service and we ran through a bunch of tests and after about an hour and half we came to the conclusion that I had system with a water pump and thermostat needed to be configured with the update. The problem was, my nest wouldn't update when connected to my computer so we had to wait for the ""OTA"" update. Finally it connected to my WiFi and updated and the customer service rep helped me reconfigure my wires so that the Nest worked with my system. Its worked like a champ ever since. The customer service rep was nice and patient and that ordeal was the only negative about buying the Nest but not sure it was anyone's fault, really.

Overall, I would recommend the Nest especially if you are a busy family running throughout the week. It seems to be able to save you energy (and money!) even when you aren't paying attention to it. Is it worth the money...maybe. It all depends if you are disciplined enough to set your ""dumb"" programmable thermostat every time. If you do that, than its not worth the money. If you are like me though, I think its going to be a good investment.

I will try to update my energy and money savings as I go along. That might help someone to decide to purchase or not if they know the actual savings this thing might give them.",Excellent thermostast

I recommend buying several of the thermostat puck things to place around the house. Just so you can use the Nest app to check those room's temp and turn on the air/heat for where you are, not the hallway your thermostat is likely to be.",Easy to install
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,Technomom,"I'm not a person who usually takes the time to review products even though I depend on the reviews to buy my items. I'm sort of ashamed to admit that. That being said, I felt that I must review this product. I have installed at least five thermostats previously in varying places and this was by far the easiest. Not only was there a place to go online to ensure the compatibility of my system but there were numerous videos and instructions to follow should I need them. I didn't need anything but the instructions packaged in the box. A smooth setup followed by immediate connection to my wireless and app on iPhone. I've been using it over a month now and I know it has saved me energy already. I am waiting for the next electric bill to truly show usage as I just bought my house. I no longer forget to turn my thermostat up or down when I leave because I now have Nest...and it has learned my habits already. It has a ton of settings but it walks you through it all step by step and it is compatible with security cameras and other things if needed.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Aug 2020,mlbk,"This thing is awesome. We've had it for 2 yrs now and it's been super helpful. No problems with it at all. We have actually seen a reduction in our electric bills and I think it's largely due to this being installed. It's so convenient to be able to program different temps at different times of the day. Sure, we want our pets to be comfy, but they don't need it nice and chilly on hot days the way we like it when we're home! And we can adjust from our phones from anywhere, so lying in bed at night, want to bump it up or down a few degrees, just grab your phone instead of going downstairs to adjust the thermostat. It tracks your patterns and preferences and makes its own adjustments to try to fit into your lifestyle as well. Works seamlessly with the Google Home, so even if we're too lazy to pick up our phones to adjust it, we can just ask Google to do it for us! It also reminds us when the filters need to be replaced, and has a bunch of other features as well. We probably aren't even using it to its full potential but we do a lot with it and it's definitely one of those things that you wonder how you used to live without it.",every home needs this

I set a schedule of times to come on and off. Compared to other programmable remotes this is easy. I like the energy history you can see how long your furnace was on. You can also see what time it came on and when it went off by the hour. You can set the thermostat to ECO mode which if heats or cools your house to the minimum and maximum levels. During the winter and your away, it could be turned down to 50 degrees. I like the fact you can be anywhere and see if your house is heating or cooling.

Most thermostats I've used are very old with bare minimum features or just weird controls overall. The Nest is straightforward, sleek, and it feels like a solid device in the way it's constructed with a solid weight to it. The app makes it very easy to use and the ability to change the temperature without having to get up is game-changing.
The Nest also learns what temp you like it and when. It starts to schedule itself based on your temp changes. Within about 2-3 weeks a schedule started setting and we only had to make 2 tweeks to the 'learned' schedule, otherwise it was spot on. Now we don't really think about the temp in the house.

The price dropped to $219 which helped, but I finally pulled the trigger on the purchase and couldn't be happier.  Installation and setup was a breeze.  It only took about 25 minutes for my son and I to get it up and running and programmed.

The only downside is that it doesn't work with Apple's Home application, so Siri voice control doesn't work to control the device.

No more forgetting to turn off the heat or A/C when you rush out the house. No more getting up for frequent adjustments when the home is slightly cold or hot. No more stairs to groan about when your tucked warmly into bed. No more multiple unsightly thermostats. We are living the dream!

Favorite features:
- Away mode tracks when nobody is home and defaults to away settings
- Ability to adjust temps remotely on extreme temperature days for pets
- Monthly usage data report
- Set schedules and change schedules whenever I want

Issues:
- Occasionally has very odd ""learned"" temp adjustments. Nest has created schedules with really high or low set temperatures. Not sure what caused this but it went away after we deleted it via the app. This has happened more than once
- Historical lookback only goes 1 wk on the app

I must also mention Nest has been fantastic. Almost a year in I noticed a chip on the glass face and they immediately sent a replacement. Love companies that stand behind their product. Builds a ton of loyalty!",No more running downstairs to adjust the heat!

If I am in bed and cold I can open the app and increase the temperature, instead of getting up and going downstairs. If my husband and I are both away from the house it automatically switches to ""Away"" mode and lowers the temperature to eco mode. The only downside is that once we come home it can take several hours for the temperature to increase back to the ""Home"" setting... thinking going from 62 degrees to 72 degrees... but can't really blame the nest for this, its more because of the size of the house.

I'm not a very handy person but was able to follow the instructions easy enough to set it up. The Nest does a good job of remembering what temperatures you use at different times of day. But if temperatures fluctuate, then you have to adjust anyway. The biggest disadvantage for me is not being able to run the furnace fan by itself. The app is great for keeping an eye on temperatures when your away, and adjusting it while away.

 But our son, who’s installed NEST units in his previous and current home said,  “not true”.  So I took a leap and bought this latest version at BB. My son first walked me through the compatibility test. Our existing HVAC wiring passed the NEST Test!!  Then he guided me through the install via phone which took only minutes!  Wow!

Either way you can't go wrong.

Because of my family's irregular routine I went ahead and did the weekly programming but, it's definitely great to use the app to regulate the temperature whenever no one is home and the system is still running. I simply just hit the ""away"" option and the system turns off until it is required to start cooling again.

This thermostat is best used if have a smart home or making a smart home. I use Google Assistant to control the Nest as well as the Nest App. A wifi connection is strongly recommended to get the most out of this product because that is where it starts saving you energy costs.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,Marinepilot,"This thermostat is everything it is cracked up to be and more! It has lowered my energy bill another $50 at least since I've gotten it. The ability to program it when you are there or away, and then it enhances that program by learning your habits is amazing. It thinks of things that I don't even think of! The one thing that would be better if built right in would be the ability to geofence the Nest, but there are third party apps out there that let you do that, so you can set it and forget it basically. When you leave the house it goes into away mode, and you have it turn itself back on and start cooling/heating when you are on your way home! The ability to heat and cool is extremely well liked also, so during those odd times of the year when one day you have heat on in the morning and air on in the afternoon, you can use that setting so you don't have to keep running back and forth to the thermostat. I also love that I can control it from my phone or tablet. Too cold in the morning? Grab the device and turn the heat up without getting uncovered!

It's ability to automatically set a schedule based upon your being home or away is one of the most useful features. Only issue occurred during installation, as the thermostat states that it does not require a ""common"" (C) wire for power. That is incorrect, as the thermostat does not function properly without one. If a C wire is not used for power, then the thermostat will obtain a charge by sending a pulse to your HVAC unit every minute or so...in my case, this caused my A/C to turn off every minute. I'd say if you can run a C wire or if you have one available, that is the recommended way to install.","Works well, elegant interface, and saves money."

Not only looks nice, it also serves a purpuse, like showing you the temperature inside or the time. Amd it is intelligent too. Just go out and it goes into Away mode to save energy. As soon as it detects you are home, it goes back to the preset temperature, unless you tell them to start cooling your home for your arrival.
One not obvious advantage is that you have the control at your phones reach, so you can set the temperature to your best comfort without having to go to the specifiwd set poit on the wall of your house. It also learns and auto adjust the settings.

Admittedly, in the first few days, I didn't know if I would find the value in this unit from Nest. However, after 6-7 days the thermostat started showing it was ""learning."" I can see clearly now after just two months of use that this device will be paying itself off in short order due to the savings in energy. It adjusts itself based on your location, so that it doesn't run the A/C when you aren't home.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,ciscoheat,"I absolutely love the Nest products. They are both functional and eye appealing. The ability to control via the phone and set it to away is great. My favorite feature by far though is the ability to run the fun for say 15 or 30 minutes. This is great during the summer when you don't need to run the full ac but can just circulate a little air to take the heat off and fall asleep. 

Lets also not forget about Nest's monthly reports. Integration with Amazon's Echo allows you to use voice commands for your heating and cooling comfort. The only downside to Nest in my opinion is the lack of integration with Smartthings. Hopefully that will come one day...",Makes HVAC Exciting

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2016,BigD,"Bought this since my children each have one. Replaced an older programmable (not connected) thermostat. If you want to protect your privacy by restricting location, you must manually set the ""home"" and ""away"". This thermostat ""learns"" by looking for patterns in your home-away designation. It also has recommendations for energy efficiency. If you have regular patterns, this will effectively adjust your temps. There have been minor reports regarding loss of memory and function, however these seem to have been addressed through firmware updates. The controls are problematic if your Internet connection is dicey. Thus a strong wired primary with a wireless repeat connectivity is a must. Thermostat can be controlled manually at the wall in the event of loss of Internet, but remote operation is absolutely reliant of connectivity. This is a problem with all IoT. This can be wired to furnace/AC via a four or a five wire connection. Some thermostats require a five wire connection and many existing furnace hook-ups do not have them. Check the wires before purchase. Spent more time spackling/painting wall than installing since even with optional faceplate there was still uncovered surface. Installation w/o faceplate a more modern, pleasing look.

I also like the auto-away feature where it senses my phone's location and will automatically jump the temperature up to save power when I am not in the vicinity of my house.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,hunterbob,We love this thermostat because it knows when our cell phone is nearby and when we leave in the winter it drops the temp to 64 and when we get close to home it increases the temp to 71. After a week of adjusting the temp manually it started doing it on it's own so now it's 2 steps ahead of me. When I walk up to it lights up and tells me the current temp if it's not running but if it's running it's orange and you know the heat is blowing. From anywhere in the world I can check or change the temp.

It turns the heat on automatically in the morning when we wake up to get ready and turns it back off when I go to work. It knows the temperature outside so unless you tell it to, it won't waste energy heating or cooling when it shouldn't just because that's the normal setting.

Remember this a learning thermostat and it does learns you cooling/heating habits. It took a few months before it actually got my temperature setting right. My family the loves having the app on their devices. So we rarely touch the thermostat.  We love the fact that we do not have to adjust it when leaving or returning.

To start go onto the website to determine if it is compatible with your current Hvac system all you need for this is to pull if you're current thermostat and see what color you're wires are. You either are good or not. Than go and buy one. Packaging of the product was great. It comes with everything you need to install it. It literally took me 10 minutes to install and about 10 minutes to go through the setup of the thermostat. It will take sometime for the thermostat to learn hence a learning thermostat. All in all I am confident in my purchase and that over time it will pay for itself and help save me some money. The nest app for your phone is very basic and simple to use. In the app you can select you're temps, eco mode, turn up/down temps and more. I gave it 4 stars only because I have had it for a short time.",Enjoy

While it requires a bit of user input the first week -- most of it done from a simple and quite usable app available for both iPhone and Android smartphones -- after that, only minor adjustments will be done from time to time to alter what might be considered the household's usual schedule. It allows an unprecedented degree of control, from close or afar, of one's temp settings. Crank the heat up 30 minutes before hopping out of bed on a brisk morning, or have it activate the fan for a preset time period in the middle of the night with the same ease without getting up and fumbling around with the blasted thing in the dark. It provides an accurate record for each day, indicating when the heat or a/c was activated, whether by the thermostat or a household member, to what degree, and for how long it was on. There is simply no way this can't ultimately pay for itself after the rebates and ultimate savings on the heat and cooling bills.

The ability to program from a phone or PC, or adjust any setting from a phone or PC is really a plus. The thermostat has a sleek design. The app and web interface is easy to use and provides useful information regarding usage and settings. The thermostat itself is a little cumbersome to navigate through the menus, but can be done. Initial setup was really easy and it walks you through the whole process.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Phil123,"During my routine furnace maintenance this fall, I asked the serviceman about installing a smart thermostat. He said that it would cost me about $125 if they did it, but he removed the cover of my previous thermostat and labeled all the wires for me so that I could install the Nest myself. This was very helpful, because not every system used exactly the same colors and codes. Installation was very easy except for one wire I wasn't 100% sure about, so I called Nest support and spoke with a technician. He checked the information about my existing thermostat and was able to clarify the confusion for me. I mention this because I was very impressed with the speed and efficiency of the customer service. 

As for the Nest itself, I love it. Setup was easy: you connect it to your WiFi network and answer some questions (language, location, etc.) and you're good to go. The app is good and shows you what you need to know. The Nest will ""learn"" your usual routines and if you are usually gone during a certain time of day, it will reduce the temperature. You are always free to override this if you happen to be home, or just want it warmer or cooler .

What I noticed right away was that my furnace only kicks into the highest fan speed in the morning when the house has to warm up from having been set at a lower temperature all night. During the day, I rarely hear the fan at high speed, unlike with my previous thermostat. 

I also like that you select the temperature just by rotation the outer dial, which is a lot easier and more convenient than hitting little up and down arrows. The temperature shows when you are within range of the thermostat and it's easy to read from a distance. As you approach the Nest, it shows you what the thermostat is set to. 

The display also shows the outdoor temperature and indoor humidity.

 I had to get a new thermostat because on January 1st I shocked my touch screen thermostat and fried the screen. It was stuck at 60 degrees and I could only adjust the temp down. Good thing I had gift cards from Christmas. So with that reason I will say that it was the best accident for the new year. I love that you can customize the settings so that at certain times the temp will change or that if your cell phone leaves the house the temp will adjust to a lower level. Once you come back and reconnect to your wifi the temp will go back to what you previously set it to. Installation was a snap. I am not a handyman but installation took me less then 10 mins. Very cut and dry as to what to do. I think the thermostat on this unit is more accurate then my last one. Our house seems to stay warmer. It is kind of cool to go into the reports and you can see all the adjustments that were done. If you have kids that like to mess with it you will definitely see at what time they decided to kick up the heat. I thought about the eco version but I didn't like how it looked.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,SmartDad88,"We purchased this when it was on super sale through the holidays last year(2017) which was almost, if not half, the retail price. 

Google/Nest does a great job with this kind of price reduction on all their products. 

The bonus was we received a credit from our energy company for the thermostat as well, making it almost free.

The previous bills without this thermostat were 25-50$ a month higher the previous years during winter and summer peak energy usage. Which in total was about 4-6 months of the year. Even if we had paid full price for this unit it would have paid for itself within the first two years.

The learning it does during the different times of day makes it a breeze to almost never have to touch the thermostat. 

The home/away sensing is awesome too. 

The only issue we have had isn't really the thermostats fault. It's location is in a hallway which is in the middle of the house. Our 60's Ranch house is very compartmentalized which means if you have all hallway doors closed it can throw off the temps in the other rooms(colder/hotter dependant on time of year exterior temps) as the hallway is generally the longest regulated temp in the house as it doesn't have a HVAC register. 

 This is leading us to believing we may need to purchase the Nest Temp Sensor(s) to rectify this issue. Not everyone will have this problem it really depends on house layout and insulation properties of your exterior walls and ceiling/roof. Which is why I don't knock the thermostat down a star.

Ultimately it does everything it's built for while saving you money.",Savings starts year one.

1. Easy to install (don't follow the schematics in the paper instruction. Use the NEST website for the correct wiring.
2. Cool design and operation (love the turn knob)
3. App on iphone works with no issue. Like the Usage history and why energy consumption is high on that day.
4. Auto away mode works. It has a motion sensor that turns on the display when you walk by.

Areas of improvement:
1. Heater/air-con only turns on 2-3 degrees above/below set points. Have to manually compensate when setting my range.
2. Paper instruction wiring is misleading especially on RC or C wires. Use the website to get your correct wiring.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,CajunDad7,"I purchased two Nest Thermostats and a sensor. I liked what I purchased so much, I bought 3 more sensors. The sensors are essentially electronic thermometers that you can put at places distinct from the thermostat. In our house the thermostats are in the hallway and they always over heat and over cool the bedrooms. Thus I can use a sensor in the room as the thermometer and thus the set point for heating and cooling. The installation was easy. I did it myself. I have a good working knowledge of this sort of work, but it is easy and the instructions are straight forward. There are numerous videos available to help with installation. It appears through the first month that we have saved some money, but I will have to look over the year and base it on the average costs of heating and cooling. But based on the usage that the Nest evaluates, we have used less than last year and the temperature seems most even to that observed the previous year. Nevertheless, a more thorough evaluation is needed. The nest has great features including energy saving features, easy of use, voice control of heating and cooling temperatures (if you use the right app), etc. I am very happy with my purchase.",Nest Thermostats have been great so far

The display is nice, and it is super easy to setup. Using the Nest website's tutorial videos, I was able to swap this out from my old thermostat, and get it programmed in under 10 minutes. The thermostat learns my family's routines, and over time makes adjustments based on what it learns. The display is customize-able with different information. It is very easy to adjust the temperature or switch from heating to cooling. Using the Nest App, you can customize schedules on your own, and there are even ""eco"" settings, where you can let the thermostat run to a temperature to save you money on your utility bills. I also bought 2 of the optional Nest temperature sensors (because I have a 3-story house). The only downfall to those that I didn't know about is the system can only run, based on which sensor you choose (in my case, I can make it heat my house based on the thermostat on the main floor, or one of the sensors in the basement or on the 2nd floor. But not all 3). I can also control my thermostat/temperatures from my Google Home speakers or displays; along with the app. And, with the Google Home Assistant, you can set up ""routines"" in there. So when you leave the house, you can make a routine and say something like ""I'm leaving"", and it would turn down the temperature to an Eco setting.","Great product, and easy to set up."

My husband and I are not great with tech but together we got it up and running, any complaints thus far are due to user error as I'm still learning about the programming.  One thing I wish was better is setting up the fan only.  I currently have it running for 3 hours in the morning and there is only 1 fan setting, I wish it could be set on/off as desired as I would run it late at night before bed and perhaps during night when it's really hot.

Set up was also easy, and the Nests look fantastic and work ok overall (more on where they fall short below). Small issue is the app (for remote control) could be more intuitive. Larger issue is that when I set all thermostats to ""Away"" (with a single tap in the app, which is great) they do not stay set to away for some reason... in four days of being away on vacation, I've gone into the app six time to confirm that the thermostats were still set to Away, and four times they were back on their regular schedule heating the house. So I had to again manually set to Away 4 times. Not only is this gitch annoying (because part of the proposition of having these is peace of mind, not having to think about them or do things manually) but they are not saving me money if they're running the heat to the same temps as if we were home. My old programmable were a pain to manually set when we were going on vacation (and then to reset to regular programs when we got home) but at least they worked properly. Nests are cool, but so far they have not been as set-it-and-forget-it as I was led to believe.",Wish They Worked as Great as They Look

What more can be said!,Saved me money
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,DanW,"I bought this, to replace our old programmable thermostat, and I'm glad I made the change. The programmable thermostat was cumbersome to change the programming, and not very responsive to touches. With the Nest thermostat, the navigation is much easier, and intuitive. I can also pull out my phone, and easily make adjustments, even if I'm not at home.

Some of the additional features I like: 
- It also has the ability to learn your habits, and eventually, it will create it's own schedule (if you allow it, in the settings)
- It has a proximity sensor, so the screen goes dark, when you aren't near, but as you approach, it changes the amount of details, displayed
- You can set it to display other items, instead of the current temp. For instance, we have it set to show the current temp outside, which also shows the weather predictions, for the rest of the day, as you get closer

Installation was just as easy as any other thermostat. If anything, it was a little easier, since it uses spring loaded terminals, rather than wrapping the wires around a screw.

My only complaint is that I would like the screen to be touch controlled, rather than dial the outer ring to an option, then 'click' the front face, by pushing it in. Not a big deal though, since I have all the same options, through the app on my phone.",Love having intelligence behind my thermostat

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,NLVsd,"We previously had a Honeywell at our old home.  It was good and did the job, but the app was glitchy and would sometimes be down due to system updates from Honeywell.  When we moved to our new home, we bought the Nest because it’s trendy and different.  Honest assessment is it does the same job as Honeywell.  Depending on which model and color you get, it sometimes reminds me of a door nob on the wall.  Since you will control the device from the app, you normally would never walk up to the wall unit and do any adjustment.  I like that it is Alexa friendly but the voice control can be tricky.  I would recommend this or Honeywell.  I think it depends on user preference.","Great, fun and trendy"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Alexcon42,"I had a Honeywell connected thermostat that just kept losing wireless connection and after a year it decided it did not want to cool my system anymore, so i decided i wanted to upgrade to the nest.
On opening the box just the way it was packed you know you have a quality item and has nice weight to the device also
The instruction on how to install was quite good and easy to follow, the only issue was the sticky labels were not tooo good and kept slipping of so be careful, i took a picture after i labeled just in case.
the nest has a plastic surface that is 3/4 covering the glass that you might think needs to be peeled off but is actually part of the device surface , i checked online and is teh only way i found out not to touch it. once installed going through the menu, off course you need wireless connection and to download the app, but you can do this without as i connected after the unit was setup and installed. after connection and running it was easy to use from the app, don't forget this is a learning device. there was some lag time between switching the cooling system on and off but after a few days it git better or i just did not notice anymore, overall this is a great device and good value for money for the future.",nice addition to my connected home

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,TVDB,"If you aren't familiar with this thermostat, there are two things you should know: 1) it is a Google product 2) efficiency maximization is part of its design. So, for whatever that's worth to you, now you know! I've been using it for only two weeks, and my main frustration is that I want the house cooler (Texas summer) but it has many times let the dang place warm up at the worst time, late afternoon, when letting up the gas for just twenty minutes can send the temperature climbing fast and can't recover til long after dark. Even though its dialed down. In the mean time I have learned how to turn off those features, but still have to crank it to 50 sometimes when it shows the temp 5+ degrees warmer than where it's set and it has stopped running.

The other thing that it does which is rather impressive, is that it operates the condensor, the exchange, and the blower independently, thus coaxing the system to cool FAR BETTER than a basic on/off thermostat. It can really get this place chilly. And probably at a fraction the energy use. 

So, a mixed review - would be nice if simply did what it was asked, but it is impressive how it can really drive the system, probably saving money in the process.  

I would conditionally recommend it.",This is not what I thought it was.

I finally found a good excuse to buy it. Just because. The install was pretty strait forward. They gave you some face plates to cover older rectangular style plates you may have had. in my case I will use the rectangular plate until I get the time to paint the wall to hide it. I have a separate theater room that does not have a fan. I use the AC fan to keep the room cool. It is nice to just open up the app and change the temp or turn on the fan whenever I want. The fan has a timer function which is great because sometimes I would forget to turn the fan off and it would run all night long. The software is very focused on efficiency and a good amount of thought was put into the functions. Exceeded my expectations.,Excellent and reliable product with good functions

Once we figured out the problem and set the ""Away"" setting, problem solved.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Eastcoaster,"I was originally going to go with the Ecobee. However, the one I got was defective and there were none left at Best Buy to get another one. So I needed a wifi thermostat so I got the nest. I love the design and it looks very nice. I had actually have it installed in a different area of my home due to the fact that it required 3 wires instead of the two my old one had and due to the age of the home and retaining walls we could not run a third wire. It went well for a few days and then I noticed it always offline via the app. I had stopped renting the modem from Comcast years ago and used my own in addition to wifi. I blamed the nest for never being connected as my other devices were always online. So I ended up just giving the Comcast box a try since I just upgraded. It had wifi in the modem. My nest has never been offline since. If you have connectivity issues check your wifi (clearly the newer systems are much better than the 8yr old one I was dealing with). Talk about simplicity! I turn my thermostat up on my drive home! It's much more efficient than the programming days. If I'm late, I'm not wasting energy. When I'm in bed upstairs, I turn it down before bed/when I wake up. It may sound lazy but you just have far more control. My plumber installed it when I converted to gas from oil. Very user friendly.",Not bad

Actually they don't, because it's in my bedroom. But I imagine them doing it every time I see it because it looks that nice.

The shiny form factor is worth it alone. 

It works well, and it knows when I'm not home so it can save me money when I'm away! What's not to love?

Also, spinning it to set the temp feels premium. I've never felt a premium knob before I spun the nest. Now other knobs feel cheap and I can't stand spinning them.","So slick, so pretty"

After I finally got the Nest installed, I have not in any shape or form, regretted it.

I will say that the instruction manual is very informational, except for a very small fact. If you do not have AC, do not hook up the White wire, because it will send an error code to the thermostat, and it will not work properly.

If you have any issues at all, contact and ask for tech support from Nest, because the gentleman I spoke to new my HVAC system like the back of his hand.

One other small note. Try not to cut back all of your wiring because you may need some extra wire that can break off and you won't have it. Even though I did this, the technician told me what to do to resolve that issue and it was absolutely simple.

It's nice to be able to turn on your fan, air conditioning, or the heat from the convenience of your phone.",Beginner Nestor

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,DrBob,"The 3rd Generation Nest Learning Thermostat is an excellent investment in smart home technology as an energy and money saver. It is extremely easy to install using the detailed instructions included in the package or any of the dozens of Youtube videos to be found online. Once installed, it virtually programs itself to adjust the heating and cooling parameters to the activity patterns within your home space. At the same time, it provides ample opportunities to override these self-determined settings to suit the immediate or long-term situation. Many energy providers are sponsoring rebate programs that can somewhat offset the (admittedly high) initial cost of the Nest device.
I have used it so far for a little more than three weeks in a fluctuating temperature spell and have found it highly correlated (through its detailed history function available in the smartphone app) with the number of degree days. More importantly, the house is always comfortable within the temperature ranges I have specified. A test of the cooling functions will have to wait several months I fear but I have no doubt it will prove equally helpful.",An excellent smart thermostat

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,HarryO,"We purchased the Nest - Learning Thermostat, on sale. I opened the box, and followed the installation instructions. Make sure you take a picture of your existing thermostat's wire connections and label each wire (using the labels included by Nest) before you disconnect anything. Once you have done this, the rest is pretty easy. Don't forget to download the Nest app to your smartphone, and set-up a Nest account. Also, apply for any rebates you may be qualified for (ex. So Cal Edison and/or So Cal Gas - up to $125!). I recommend that you also sign up for So Cal Edison's Rush Hour program (additional credits to your bill). We've had the Nest Thermostat for a week now, and our central heat and air runs in the morning (5am) for a few minutes to heat the house to 72F. The house stays above 70F the rest of the day. The Nest already learned our routine, and it ""knows"" when we leave the house with our smartphones and automatically sets the thermostat to Eco mode. I think this was a smart purchase for our home. We had new insulation added to the attic, walls, and under the floors in 2015 so we don't leak much warm air and the furnace doesn't run very often.",Nest - Learning Thermostat is pretty cool!

The only thing the instruction manual did not mention is there is a USB port on the back of the thermostat that you can use to charge a little it before you install it. My thermostat shut down during the installation process because the battery was low. I would recommend charging the device a little using a micro USB cable before installation.

Bought a new one and will try to replace the battery om the other one, one day.  I guess they do have a life expectancy.","Love the product, has a life expectancy"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,MattR28,I replaced this for my mother. Her old thermostat wasn't ever keeping the right temperature and it was extremely annoying. Since I was sick of walking into a sauna every time I went I decided to pick this up. It was a BREEZE to set up and connected right away to the Wi-Fi. The feel of it is VERY high quality and it seems to be made well. Almost vintage with the dial and bold clicks. She had a difficult time learning how to use it at first but now she knows right away! The great thing about that was when she turned up the temp by accident and I wasn't there I just used the app to make it go back to normal even from 200 miles away. If you walk by it shows the temp and home screen shows outside and inside temps with weather as well. We havent had it long enough to recognize savings on the electric bill.

Worked perfectly with both of heating and cooling systems. Love the ability to control with the app. Savings has been consistent from the beginning, even with changing seasons our monthly bill continues to go down. Functionality is perfect and they look great too. My only complaint was the temp was measured only at the thermostat while noticeably different from room to room.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,dbfirefighter,"I have not seen a heating bill yet but I think we will see a savings. What we like is after the first week it learned our routine and automatically adjusts the temperature before we get home, at night and away for the day. What is even better is both my wife and I have it on our phones (Apple & Android) and we adjust it if our routine changes like turning it on before we get home early or tell it when we are away.

We have to travel over the weekends for kids sports and it is no longer a worry when we are driving down the road to see if someone remembered to turn down the heat. My wife is not a techie (I am) but she loves the Nest for the simple usage on her phone.

Another trick I learned is when I feel a little cold in the house and the heater is not running, I figure it is just a cold spot so from my computer or phone, I run the fan for 15 minutes and it circulates the air allowing the temperature to equalize (especially in the hallway where our thermostat is) and the heater to go on if needed.

The last thing I want to mention is customer service. The wiring was not correct and they stay on the phone with you until it is correct. Follow the instructions to take a picture before you disconnect the old one. When our heater broke (circuit board) they never once blamed the heater, they kept working with us to diagnose the issue even putting on an advanced technician until he could absolutely say it was not the thermostat. The only issue was it took about 3 hours between hold times and getting the advanced tech to diagnose.",We love it.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Jonnyc1503,This thing is amazing! One of the main things I love about tech is that it can (not always) make your life easier. THIS DOES. I forget about it as it disappears into the comfort of a warm house when I want it and saves energy when I'm not home! I also love that if I am coming home at a time that is not normal for me I can hit the app on my phone and bump the temp up. It looks gorgeous and was fairly easy to set up. Be sure to take a pic of the wires coming from the old thermostat before you unplug them all. It will make it easier to hook up the new wires on the NEST. We looked at a couple thermostats like the Ecobee but NEST really has this one locked down. I also bought some Google home minis that are amazing...Hey Google what's the thermostat set to and it will tell you and even turn it up or down with a simple command!

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,MVSM,"Purchased two of these for my home - though they are pricey it helped my utility provider had a rebate going for each device (installed and registered). I placed the order after ensuring my existing thermostat connection is compatible with NEST (NEST website has clear instructions on its site to check compatibility). The installation itself was a breeze, and being a novice, it took me 30 minutes to install each device. The setup instructions can be done on the device or through the app, and once connected to your home wifi, the device gets registered automatically with NEST. I found the setup very intuitive, and had both the devices functioning within the hour. It has been a couple of months since I bought them - I love the self-learning feature - it sends you alerts on filter change due, and learns and adjusts based on usage etc. It recently sent an alert on my phone that my furnace needs to be checked as it switches on and off frequently - Love that!

We had a programmable thermostat but it was too hard to configure. After one week of using Nest, it learned our main habits and adjusts the temperature accordingly. When we want to fine tune the temperature, we don't have to walk across the house to do it -- we just pick up our phone from our nightstand! Moreover, it was super easy to install. It was up and running in 10 minutes, including the time it took to take it out of the box. 

I definitely recommend going online to Nest website first to test compatibility and to obtain a wiring diagram. Makes the install way easier.",Smarter than me thermostat

It looks fantastic on the wall, the main display is high resolution so it is easy to read onscreen text. 
And operation is just as easy; i was amazed at how quickly it picked up our weekly and daily patterns. After a couple weeks, we hardly touch the thermostat at all. 
I like that it can be controlled remotely, and that it also links to other home control applications. Although I don't use the feature very often, it is nice to know it's there if needed.
It's too early to tell for sure if our utility bills will go down or up, but it appears to be slightly lower so far. Even if there's not a significant cost savings, the control features make this well worth the price.","Amazingly Easy, Amazing Performance"

So, it was left to me to perform the install, I found out that the two wires on my old thermostat was the outdoor temperature sensor which was no longer needed with the Nest.
The install process was straight forward, I took pictures of the old wiring, matched the wires, and connected to the Nest terminals. I tested the thermostat after the install and everything looked good!

I was able to replace my upstairs and downstair thermostats in literally 5-10 minutes each, no need to call for technical support at any time. As for the product, it took about a week for each unit to ""learn"" our regular patterns and adjust to times we are not home and it has a sensor which detects motion to verify if we are at home. Additionally, it was very easy to connect to the internet, set-up, and set my schedules. Another great feature is the App on my Apple Smart phone, I can manually control the units from anywhere, anytime... As an example, we were away all day and I awoke the Nest thermostats from their away mode about 30 minutes before I arrived back home, our house was at a great temperature when we arrived without having to wait for it to warm up after we got back.

I wanted to really cut down on my electricity bill and I figured this would also be a good measure. The existing thermostat I had was not a programmable model and didn't seem like it was very accurate either. I wasn't sure how hot it actually got in my place and so I left my thermostat on 85 thinking it wouldn't hit that high during the day, but it would. Given that, I would be cooling my place for no reason at all and wasting money. This allows me to set the exact time it shuts off and comes on so I can save energy while away at work or wherever else and also always make sure I come home to a properly cooled house without wasting money.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,shawn,"I do love the thermostat however I'm still getting used to it, It has this smart feature (that can be turned off) which basically it sees your habits and tries to predict them for you, for example, if everyday at 1pm you lower the temperature to 69 after a few days the thermostat will do this for you, im still getting the hang of that because we change the temperature often depending on what area of the house we are in and other variables like that. This thermostat replaced the original one installed in my house in the 70s a much needed upgrade when I purchased my home. Don't skimp out and buy a cheap one, this one has function and style and its a conversation piece.

The learning thing has no easy turn off so I googled it and followed someone's youtube video that showed how to turn off the learning feature.  (basically clear everything out and start over w/o any history and it stays off).

It is pricey if you don't use the learning feature but I think it is way cooler looking than my Honeywell rectangle.  I bought another one for my other floor.  Would recommend.",Very cool looking

Even comes with a cute little screwdriver and built in level. Connecting was just as easy...everything went without a hitch on the first try. Just beautiful and I love that it detects when you are present. I found myself just walking by it to watch it light up. HOWEVER, I did have a moment of pause this week when I realized that there was a software glitch that left a lot of people out in the cold...literally. And the reason that I wanted the Nest in the first place is because I split my time between two places that are 5K miles apart...and I found out about the glitch from Alaska...but by the time I found out about it and tried to log on, it was resolved...so no harm this time. I do love being able to check in on my house from afar and see that all is well. So, yes it is awesome and it works incredible...just bear in mind that it does require a wifi connection to work, and if something happens to that connection you are powerless. I would still buy it knowing all of this...it adds a lot of modern flair to your house.",An aesthetic dream

I watched a couple of installation videos online and felt like I was ready to go in no time! The hardest part was just getting the stickers on the wires to label them and then poking them all the way into the holes during installation. I only had to go back and push one additional cord in more but I wouldn't have known that if the Nest Thermostat hadn't done such a stellar job of identifying the fact that it wasn't all the way plugged in and letting me know exactly what to adjust.

I have a lot of Nest products in my home (including the cameras) and have been very satisfied. The ability to remotely connect and monitor usage and change the temperature is great. The integrations with Google Home and IFTTT are icing on the cake.

I give it 4 instead of 5 stars for two reasons:
1) The learning part of this ""learning"" thermostat is next to useless. Several of my friends also have this thermostat and everyone has complained about how poorly it learns schedules for your comfort. You'll need to go into the app and set your own temperature schedules.
2) The thermostat requires more power to run than some setups will provide -- even setups where the thermostat is otherwise perfectly functional. Some HVAC units only power while the unit is running, which means the Nest will first shut off WiFi and then eventually go to sleep. I understand the need for constant power, but my annoyance is that the solution is not found anywhere in the Nest support documentation. I ended up finding a thread on a 3rd-party site where someone explained connecting the Common wire to supply proper power. Why couldn't Nest explain that?","Great, if you set your own schedule"

This tech verified all the settings in the thermostat and when he found nothing wrong there suggested we reset the thermostat and start over from scratch. Once we performed the reset and reprogrammed it the thermostat started reading within 1/2 degree of the thermometer I had hanging on wall next to the Nest. Both Technicians were very professional and helpful. The thermostat has been working flawlessly since. I love the way it learns the temperatures we want during the day and adjusts temp when we are gone for long periods of time,"Support Outstanding, Thermostat Works Great"

It took a while to convince my wife to let me purchase this but with a rebate incentive from our local energy company I was able to seal the deal.

The set up for this thermostat is incredibly easy. The app is easy to setup and very user friendly. I wanted to see the difference in energy consumption between how we were previously using the A/C and now with the NEST. So, we kept the A/C set to run and maintain a temperature all day without modifying our schedule. Then, the following day, we modified the run time by changing the Home/Away features on our app. Needless to say we saved almost three hours of energy consumption just by making that one modification! So far, I'm very pleased with this product. Also, great interface and look of the product as well.",Excellent

The aesthetics are much more appealing than our old thermostat. All controls are simple and the screen is easy to see in light or dark.

I recommend checking the wiring on Nest's site before buying to ensure your unit is compatible. The installation took about 5 minutes and another 5 minutes to configure. No issues reported and I do not have any negatives about the units. There's an energy usage monitor so I'm estimating that I'll probably make up for the cost of the unit in a year or a little beyond. The biggest savings I'll find is with the ability to turn the unit off and remote activate when your an hour away returning from a vacation.,Excellent Thermostat

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,etchlings,"This is a fantastic thermostat. The setup and installation are absurdly simple, and comprehensively documented. Even with one small difference in my setup from standard, the online documentation had a solution and I was directed there by the device itself during install. What thoughtful design that is.

As for its ""intelligent functionality"", the Away feature took about a week to learn my habits and the device does a better job than my old unit (programmable) did at keeping things at the temperature it says it is holding. Haven't had a chance to fully rely on the A/C yet, as it's winter, but the heater and fan have been without issue. The A/C was tested and worked during install, however.

We really adore the way it ""greets"" you as you walk by, too. It's non-intrusive, silent, and helpful to see the current status of the system at a glance.",Does everything it promises

I've had one issue a few days ago where the display no longer lit up when walking past it. Upon investigating, I noticed the wifi was disconnected and it said low battery. I called tech support and they couldn't understand why since the power readings were on par. They advised to reset the network settings and leave it to see if it would recharge.

When it is very cold out, the voltage doesn't seem to pick up on the wiring setup.

After two months I do have to say it is worth the investment. Living in Oklahoma I set it in Heat/Cool mode and haven't touched it since. I set the upper and lower temps and it handles it. Does a better than fair job keeping my house comfortable without my intervention. It knows when I'm home and when I'm away. And to be honest, I'm really impressed when how well the 'learning' part of this thermostat works.

Why only four stars? Let's be honest, price. For most of us $250 is a lot to spend for a thermostat. Even if it does do some very smart things. Would I purchase another one in the future? Probably. Would I replace my current one with the next new version? Probably not. It would have to be pretty compelling new features to do that.

The thermostat does a great job of learning your preferences in the first week and then creating a schedule based on that. I think its a no brainer that a thermostat should be a device you can check up on while you're away from home, so I find this to be the perfect solution.

It then becomes one of the best designed thermostats (admittedly a low bar).

Chief benefits: easier scheduling of heat/cold; ""learning"" of schedules; plug-in into energy companies' power saving plans (surge schedules) which can provide monetary benefits.

Be sure to hook up the common wire when you install it or run a common wire from your furnace if you don't have one already. The Nest powers itself via the Y-R wires to charge it's internal battery. If you don't run your furnace very often, the internal battery will run down, and the furnace won't run until you put a charge in the Nest via microusb. Using the common wire (blue) will provide steady 20v to the unit and thus keep the charge. Other than that, it's a solid thermostat. I like the daily usage summary. It HAS helped to keep costs down. I've probably saved 30% by scheduling and letting Nest learn our routine. Installation is straightforward and well documented.

That is sort of ridiculous to have to wait a month for it to populate online. The Nest has around a 24 hour wait period so it can capture data but allows you to see how long the system was on for. I am happy with the decision and like the learning features of the thermostat. Easy to hook up within 10 minutes and we were ready to use. Lots of great features and easy menu system. Still working on finding the sweet spot with the green leaf but will keep working on it.

I am not sure how much savings I'll see since I don't have AC, but I've been pretty pleased with it thus far. Getting it up and running on my iPhone app was simple and the installation was super easy, too. The hardest part was just repairing my wall because I didn't want to use the square faceplate that came with the unit.

My only complaint is that I thought it would work with Apple's Home app, and thus far, I've not been able to make that happen. That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. If I would have known this, I probably would have purchased a different unit, but that has more to do with how I want to run my house than it does the thermostat itself.

Imagine that sleek, black, perfectly circular device you see in the picture... sitting on top of a white rectangle.

For the most part it works pretty well. The app sometimes doesn't report the location correctly and it gets a little goofy. Sometimes it can't figure out whether or not you're home or away. They put out and update a while ago so you could add users and I thought that might help but it didn't. An example would be that my wife leaves for work before I do but even though we are both signed into the nest app under different users it see that she is gone and sets it to away but I am still home and it doesn't see I'm there. I have noticed a lower usage of heat and ac on average and that is good because my bill has gone down enough to make it worth the purchase.,Like the fact I can check it from anywhere!

We bought this and installed it about 3 weeks ago, and so far I am impressed. And our energy bill was lower.

It looks great on the wall, has multiple settings to show different info (weather, clock, etc.) when you walk by, and it learns daily patterns via a motion sensor and connecting with the gps on your phone. I was a little creeped out at first that it knew when I was home or not, but it uses that info to help save power. I am completely satisfied with it.",Awesome thermostat
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,T3llm3mor3,"Great device and I would have given it five stars except I have issues with the notification module for the filter exchange. I wish that it would allow you to put the exact date vs the month of when you change your air filter and how long before you want to be notified to change it (1, 2 , 3 months etc). I turned on the notification, however it never notified that I needed to change my filter out like my prevous thermostat would when it was dirty. I love that I can change the temperature remotely, how it regulates the temp in my home and that I can put it on eco mode if i so desire but they REALLY need to modify the filter notification module since changing your filter is extremely important in maintaining the life of your air conditioner especially if you have pets like I do.",Great device except.....

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,2,23 Nov 2017,BMWAndroid,"I first purchased an Ecobee 3 and after setting a weekly schedule it did a superb job and also worked really well using Siri via Apple HomeKit but since I prefer Android and it didn't integrate with Google Now, I though I would give the Nest a try instead. The build quality of the Nest feels superior since it is heavy and has some heft to it but the user experience is awful. I thought that using the dial for adjusting temperates was more convenient, but that is about all it has going for it, and besides isn't the point to not have to constantly adjust it? More on that later. Using the dial as the only way to navigate the interface is annoying and slow compared to the Ecobee3's touchscreen. To get into the menu section on the Nest you have to press down on the dial and hold it. Once there, you have to navigate everything via the dial and pressing down, very similar to something like BMW's iDrive control knob. Unfortunately it takes way too long to navigate when all you want to do is change a few things. This would perhaps not be so much of a problem if you didn't have to constantly adjust it. Learning? What learning? It's heating all the time when I don't want it to or when I am not home, and then not heating when I am freezing. And yes, it is installed correctly, just in case you were wondering. I even reset it to start the learning process from scratch and still it doesn't seem to every figure out my habits. I did not set up a schedule and one could blame me for that, but honestly the whole device is marketed as being so smart that you shouldn't ever have to manual program a weekly schedule. I have a very regular work schedule as well, so it should have figured out most of my habits after weeks of giving it a shot. As for Google Now integration, it is useless. You give your phone Google Now commands and it rarely ever reaches the Nest. Perhaps that's a problem on Google's side and not the Nest's fault, but it is the same issue with different Android devices. Ultimately though it means that I like very little about this product. I was interested in installing the custom firmware to the Nest which allows you to connect directly to the thermostat via your wifi network without having to have a cloud service as a middle-man, but seeing as though I so strongly prefer having a larger informative touchscreen to the physical knob and a tiny screen that only shows you the temperature when you walk by, I don't really want to keep it. It looks elegant and feels nice to the touch, but the technology is inferior and feels outdated.",Build quality nice but inferior product
Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,KayW716,"This is one of the best things ever! It was simple to install and link with my Google Home and phone.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,FredZ43,"I have a programmable thermostat, but wanted to upgrade to a smart thermostat. Our HVAC system is a heat pump with forced air electric backup. After purchasing the Nest Learning thermostat, I first went to their website and entered the wire info from our programmable thermostat into their thermostat compatibility chart. There was no match, so I opened a chat session with a Nest tech support person. I sent pictures of our present thermostat wiring, but the tech support person said that she could not help and I should contact one of their listed Nest Support vendors in my area. There are 3 in this area and I sent requests to the 2 closest ones. After a week, I did not get a reply from either. I then saw that Best Buy offered a $99 fee to hook up the thermostat, although I did not know if they would travel the 40 miles to my home. In the end, I decided that it would take a very long time, if ever for me to recover the $99 fee in addition to the $161 cost of the thermostat (with electric company rebate) in savings over my programmable thermostat, so I returned it to Best Buy. Best Buy did refund my purchase price, so thank you for that. If you have a simple HVAC system, this should be easy to install, but if you have anything beyond a simple system you may find that this is not compatible.",No help from NEST

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Nov 2016,Eric305,"This product was supposed to help make my home a ""smart"" home but purchasing this product was the dumbest thing I could have done.

This product was NOT easy to use, it did NOT work at all. For a "" third generation"" product , i expected to at least be able to easily navigate through the options, easily make selections or even add a simple zipcode for my location.
Even the customer service rep from NEST , advised to enter all my info ir to navigate the product menus snd options on my phone instead of the actual touch screen on the unit.

I spent an entire day on the phone with multiple customer service reps from NEST.

One of them even blamed the faulty operation due to my brand new air conditioner.

At the end I did save money, i saved about $300 by returning the product!
I would never recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money or have a smart home.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Jan 2020,KingofDisruptiveIT,"Was told by Best Buy and Google this would work great with my new heater/AC and heat pump, the unit did work, it is just after installing it my power consumption went from around 1300kVA to over 5000kVA and bill went from an average of 140 a month to 550 per month.  I called Google support when I received my first power bill and it was so high, they checked all the settings, had me change some things and said it should be good, next month it was even higher, called again, had me change some things and said it should be fine now.  Got my next electrical bill, was the highest ever and most usage ever, called again, pretty disgruntled at this point as this device that was supposed to save energy and money had now costed me over 1200 dollars in electrical bills and insane usage, I spent 6 hours on chat with support after which they concluded it was running auxiliary heat and my heat pump at the same time and that it was not compatible....this after 3 months, obviously I wasn't happy.  I thought ok well how do i return the device, this was the best part, sorry sir you can't return the device, completely ridiculous, I had a documented case going back to the first month, I was told it was compatible over and over and their decision is too bad.

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,2,23 Nov 2016,cxifra,"I read all reviews first before purchasing it, and also took advice from a friend who installed it. I also checked compatibility issues and everything seemed OK. Installation was quick and easy.
I first had issues to connect to my wifi network. I rebooted my router and tried a few other things until I got it connected. However, it soon lost connection due to a low battery level. I tried to change the batteries but you can't: this device has unchangeable built-in batteries that charge from the wiring to your furnace. I rechecked connection, checked with Nest Support, and they gave me no good solution to this. It was a weak technical staff. The only way I found to make it charge was to lower the display luminosity level. As it goes on every time it detects movement in front of it, this weird solution managed to keep it working. I had it installed for a week with no problems. Then I travelled for 2 weeks and checked its functioning thru the phone app and it kept working fine. Until a week ago, my furnace got stuck working with the fan only but no heat, and as I live in Minneapolis, that's no good. I could not make it work again, and I could not even reset it. There was a green light blinking on the front of Nest but no other life signals. I had to uninstall it and bring back the original and reliable thermostat. I found out that many users had similar problems due to a bug in the software update released in Dec/2016. I'll try to resurrect it and try to get update its software, but I will return it if not successful.
It does learn your habits and starts regulating the temp. I like the concept and the possibility to check it on line. But it didn't live up to the promise. I recognize I may have gotten a lemon. I would recommend it, but with caution.","It looks promising, but failed to deliver"

Google - Nest Learning Smart Thermostat - 3rd Generation - White,1,1,23 Nov 2018,Konstantin,"I bought the 3rd Generation Nest on Black Friday and I installed it couple of days later. The first two days all was great, it was really impressive. All of a sudden the device started displaying a W2 wiring error and shutting down randomly. We rechecked all the wiring and it just did not work. I took down the device and installed by old $30 thermostat back which worked like a charm! So obviously there was a defect in the wiring panel of the Nest. After spending 40 minutes with Nest support I was asked to install the defective Nest back so that they can troubleshoot it. No way I am doing this and putting my family in the cold again with a device that can possibly damage my 2nd stage heater. I wanted to give a Nest a second chance as defects do happen but my experience with their Customer support just persuaded me not to do so. I am returning the device and will never again consider a Nest product.",It just didn't work!
