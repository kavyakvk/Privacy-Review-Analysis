Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Oct 2018,Elem Sea,"Can't disable the stupid home. It is non-stop displaying stupid snippets. Looking at it now it's telling me these: Try ""Alexa, play the Rhino video."" Try ""Alexa, tell me a horse joke"" Try ""Alexa, what's the top rated Bluethooth speaker? Try ""Alexa, what can I make with spinach?"" Try ""Alexa, tell me something weird."" OMG, they don't stop!  All the damn day. No way to turn them off other than turning off the display. Is it too much to ask to just have a clock? Make it an option. Duh! I want to buy 30 of these for my office and use them as video intercoms. I have 3 I'm trying out and for this purpose (and music and all the other Alexa stuff), they work perfectly. They are AMAZING, actually, in that regard! But their lame ""try""  messages won't freaking stop. I can just see my employees who should be working ""trying"" all these new things and watching cat videos all day because Echo keeps suggesting new things! Ugh. Why, Amazon, why?!?! It could be a perfect product.... if the user just had the option to turn this off.",Home Screen ANNOYING x 1000
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2018,JD,"I work from home and bought the Echo Show specifically for two reasons: background movies and music to keep me company all day.  For music, yes, this is an excellent device.  The sound is loud, clear and surprisingly well-rounded.  Alexa recognizes voice commands very well in this respect.  Movies, on the other hand, are a struggle.  First, Alexa does not recognize most movie names by voice command, even ones I know are on Prime Video.  Next, if you have Alexa take you directly to Prime Video, it offers only a ""lite"" version of the service.  You cannot search movies well and the few categories they have stop at 60 results.  Being that I can easily stream 4-6 movies a day while working, I've already exhausted most of the good choices.  Then, for whatever reason, the audio volume on videos is 50-70% lower than music.  So in order to watch a video at arm's length away, I have to turn the volume to 1/2 at minimum, but usually 3/4.  I don't understand the massive disparity between music and movie volume.  Worse yet, if Alexa responds to a command while I'm watching a movie at that volume, her voice is two or three times louder than the movie, which is to say, obnoxiously loud.  Now, maybe I bought this for the wrong purpose.  I am never going to video call or have it control my lights, nor am I going to ask it to set an alarm or give me a recipe.  However, with the marketing claiming there are tens of thousands of commands, I was under the impression that doing something as simple as using Amazon's own video streaming service would be incredibly smooth.  Unfortunately it is not.  And like others have said, this is a touch screen after all, but there are very few things you can actually use it for.  I think I am used to the app screen on my phone I guess.  I keep expecting to be able to go to a home screen and pick what I want to do.  With no clear index of abilities, I really have no idea what I can do until I try things.  Then, after Alexa tells me she doesn't understand five or ten times, I just give up.  Last, I've gotten some errors while streaming video that claim the device's storage is full and it can no longer stream.  Well, there is no apparent way to clear the storage; streaming data should be temporarily stored and automatically replaced with new data anyway.  Because of this, I've had to restart the unit to clear the memory, which can only be done by unplugging it.  Yes, really, even with a touch screen and pull-down menu at the top, there's no restart button, you actually have to unplug it.  Decisions like these make me question who they had working on R&D.  Some of these things just don't make sense.  I do think this has the potential to be a 5-star device with the hardware as-is -- the screen is very nice and the speakers sound excellent except for the volume issue.  I know not to expect the functionality of a pad or phone with a mobile OS, but I also feel very limited by the intuitiveness and functionality of the system as it is today.  Unfortunately I doubt the fixes will come before my refund eligibility expires...",Odd Device
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2018,Baby Yell,"I have several of the Alexa devices (kindle, dots, spots, echo, original show) this device is different for 2 reasons, speakers and size of screen. This is a great kitchen companion. The screen is large enough to view from across the room. Before adding an ingredient to a dish, you can confirm the measurement without walking away from the stove, bowl, mixer e.t.c. It has great speakers so you can fill the room with sound as you prepare your gourmet dish. I am hesitant about putting it in the bedroom, video calling :). When I purchased my show, Amazon offered a free smart light bulb. I wish they would bring back that offer. Not that I would buy another show, but it might help others purchase one, if they were considering having a smart home. The new Echo Show is a must have!!!!!! I purchased my Akexa Show from an Amazon kiosk in a mall. That is why this post doesn't detail ""verified purchaser"".","Yes, you need this upgrade"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2018,Trad24,"Edited 10/19/18: After 2 updates, the volume problem mentioned in my review is fixed. When using normal volume speech, but with the Echo volume set fairly low, Alexa now answers at a suitably low volume. And today, I was able to activate the new Whispermode, which works great! You whisper to Alexa, she whispers back to you. I'm raising my rating to 4.5 stars. If Amazon would ever remove the annoying “Try this” messages ruining my home screen photo (and music screens as well), I would probably rate this as 5 stars. (This is unfortunately unlikely to happen, as Echo Show users have been complaining about this for a year and a half, but it hasn't changed.) I upgraded from the first generation Echo Show. I’ll get my one real complaint out of the way first. On the second generation Show, you can lower the volume for music and videos, but not for the Alexa voice. Even with the volume set very low, so I can listen to music without disturbing anyone, if I need to interact with Alexa, her response will be very loud. This didn't happen with the first generation Echo. On that one, if I turned down the volume, everything was turned down, including Alexa. I did send feedback to Amazon about this, and I see someone else here commented on the problem. I'm eagerly awaiting the new whispermode, which isn't on my device yet, but really, I just want the voice volume to work the same way it did on the first generation. I do really like the bigger screen size, which is a pleasure to watch. I'm also enjoying using the Silk browser to access YouTube. (You get to it by saying “Alexa, open Silk.” ) You can't use voice to search for YouTube videos, but if you're willing to sign into a YouTube account, you can access your saved video lists and get to the videos quickly that way. I also used the browser to access my local PBS TV station and watched some on demand video on that.","Love the bigger screen, but not the change to Alexa voice volume control (Edited 10/19/18 - voice issue fixed!)"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2018,Marc S.,"Someone at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to make the clock tiny and non-changeable.  That is the most important task this thing does is tell the time and you can't even see it.  You can't change the clock, the size of the type or any font on the home screen. I called Amazon Echo Support, they said a lot of people where complaining about the same things, they didn't have any solution and politely thanked me for my feedback....

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2018,RSB,"Edit - 11/26/2018 Updated review after approximately six weeks of ownership with daily usage. I had the first generation of this product and received this the day it was released.  I've used four of these Echo Shows daily.  I don't want to repeat the other great reviews on here so will try to add extra seven extra pieces information that may be helpful to you. 1) I wish Amazon and Google would band together and get over their silent feud.  I'm a huge fan of both companies (sorry Apple), but their products don't work well together.  After Amazon removed YouTube from the first generation product, I was more than upset.  Well, now you can get YouTube here via a workaround method.  You can use either Amazon's Silk Browser of the Firefox Browser on this device.  Neither works exceptionally well and I've found that Firefox works a little better, faster and with fewer hiccups.  So, you can get YouTube - just not on the YouTube native application.  It's not as good and linking your Google user account to the device and is much more difficult  to do. 2) It's difficult to get a Google-branded doorbell, the Nest thermostat or the Google camera to work with this device.  There are workarounds (many listed with a simple web search) that take a lot of time and technical knowledge to set-up, but everything seems like a workaround and isn't easy.  Amazon wants you to purchase their Ring doorbell, another thermostat brand (EcoBee), and Amazon-branded cameras.  This is very frustrating, to say the least.  I beta test Google Products and it's the same thing there.  Their new Google Home Hub doesn't support Amazon products well, but that's a different review for a different platform  Again, these two behemoth awesome companies need to come to terms and support each other's ecosystems.  I know it's a competitive ""thing"" that is supposed to benefit the shareholder via an increased profit margin.  However, as the consumer, this is a sore huge spot for me and I assume others? 3) I've used the drop-in feature from the Amazon Application on my phone to this device.  It's slow; painfully slow to connect and subsequently come into focus.  Moreover, the camera on this device shoots up the ceiling so you can't really see the entire room you've ""dropped-into"" well.  In order to see someone, they have to be directly in front of the device. Perhaps these are meant to be security/privacy features or are these just half-baked implementations? 4) I like that you can now issue a follow-up command to Alexa.  That is, you can program the device to listen to your request without saying the wake word ""Alexa"" again. 5) The user interface seems rudimentary. - almost like a pre-schooler designed it.  Sure the screen is larger, but simply displaying the weather, a clock or sports scores on a cartoonish-like background isn't enough.  I'd really like to see my Google doorbell and cameras as a default dashboard here without purchasing the Google Home Hub.  My hopes are this changes with future software updates.  Amazon: you employ some of the smartest talent in the world so please upgrade this simplistic screen interface.  It looks silly and very much like a Palm Pilot interface on the early 2000s. 6) Why oh why does Amazon Prime only display the last 60 shows in your library here?  You need to use the phone/tablet/computer application to see your entire library.  Amazon Prime shows are another fantastic thing about an Amazon membership, so why limit the ability to see a users' inventory?  Also, the volume on Prime video is much softer than when playing Amazon Prime music. 7) If you care about someone seeing your personal pictures, you can restrict access to your Amazon picture library,  That is, you can disable the picture feature on the settings menu via a toggle switch, the picture library comes ""ON"" by default.  So....if you have any compromising/private pictures uploaded from your phone automatically to the Amazon Cloud, you may not want them to display on your Echo device. All-in-all, this is an incremental improvement over the original product with the best feature being the larger screen size.  The speaker sound is OK, but not fantastic as a few other reviews note and the sound is lower when using Amazon Prime video.  I'd like to see a better and more modern user interface and better ability to integrate with Google products.",An Inccemental Improvement Over The First Generation - 7 Things You Should Know - Updated Review
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2018,Chao Chao,"When I first saw the Echo Show Gen 1, I was on the fence of getting it. Looked promising but the screen was a bit small for the price tag. Glad I waited for Gen 2! The screen on this thing is beautiful. Full HD and vibrant colors. I'm amazed that I can watch my Prime shows and it looks great. I also love the lyrics on the screen for Amazon Music. Sometimes I just want a solo karaoke session in my kitchen. The sound of the Echo Show was what impressed me the most. I'm upgrading from a 1st Gen Echo Dot and the moment I heard the sound of the Show, I was blown away! There is so much bass and the volume can get insanely loud for such a little device. The kitchen might be my second most favorite spot in the house. Touchscreen is also very responsive and works great. The only thing I wish it had was an app hub so I can choose exactly what I want. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand what I want to watch.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2018,The Review Dude,"The actual hardware has improved.  The sound quality on this Echo Show is definitely better than the first generation.  The screen is bolder as well.  I own a first generation Echo Show as well... I do not love the new software update that hit all Echo Shows.  For example, if I set my background to show my family photos from Amazon Photos, I do not want to see stock photos of news stories as well!  I know I can turn off updates in my settings... BUT I like the words from the updates, I just want them over my photos like the old Echo software!  As it stands now, a family picture will come up, then a news story photo.  This is quite annoying! I do not know how long Amazon will rule this market.  The new Google Hub looks like a great device.  However, the inferior sound and lack of a camera still puts it behind the Echo Show.  But in a couple years if a Google Hub Max comes out... I may switch to that!  The Google brain just is outpacing what Amazon’s articfical intelligence can do. (I have both Echos, Echo Shows, and Google Home’s in my house!)  Facebook also just released an interesting device similar to the Echo Show that lets you video message FaceTime Messenger contacts.  But as of 2018-2019, in my opinion, this is the best device of its kind on the market!  I’m very happy with this Echo Show compared to the first generation Echo Show!!!","An improvement, but not without some quirks."

Well I’m supposed to fly to another state later this week to give to an elderly relative! And this would be a disaster if it was a Christmas present!! Well I’ve been on hold for almost 15 mins waiting for a rep I can understand.. my advise is DO NOT BUY!! They rushed the manufacturing and the support is horrendous!! Update - This is still an ongoing NIGHTMARE!!! I finally got through to support after multiple calls and was promised a new device was being sent straight to FL where I was flying to do the install for elderly grandma with Alzheimers. I traveled yesterday to FL from NJ to install and the device they sent was an Echo Show 1 that was REFURBISHED and missing the charger!!! I sent an email last night and got a reply that they will be happy to replace my defective eco show 1 with a refurbished unit as per the warranty... I am now waiting on hold again for a supervisor to attempt to make this right... (will continue to update),WARNING - (STILL) DO NOT BUY!!! (update 2)

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2018,Jay F.,"I have had the first gen Echo since it came out.  The sound was decent and I had it hooked up to my Smartthings hub for full home automation.  However, I found myself migrating more and more over to the Google ecosystem and the Home hub devices.  When the 2nd Gen show came out, I decided to give it a try.  I was convinced that I was going to return it the next day.  Brought it home, set it up, did some research and found more about Hulu Live and it's integration with Alexa.  Connected my Ring doorbell and cameras ... the next day, I did go back to Best Buy - but I bought one more of the 2nd Gen Show's and two more of the Spot devices for my boys rooms.  I have disconnected all my Google devices and will be adding the 4k Fire Stick when it's released next week.  Absolutely love the 2nd Show and Spot devices.  The camera doesn't bother me at all because I have a $0.30 piece of plastic that is a lens cover like on my laptop - and when I am not using the camera, I slide that over the lens and no one can secretly watch us.  Love the drop in feature because I now placed one of these in my mom's house is up in age.  I will be disconnecting my cable subscription and using Hulu Live because I get all the local stations in addition to the cable channels that I use.  That will save me over $70 per month .. and I can watch on all my Fire Stick devices, Show's, etc.  Lastly, I did buy the Google Home Hub as well with the 7"" monitor ... that was the one I was convinced I would be using.  However, the sound is awful compared to the Show, it's tiny and if you want to watch any sort of videos on the screen - it sucks because it's so small ... I returned the Google Home Hub the same day it came in ... Hope this helps.",Surprisingly good!
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2019,B. Flanagan,"I have had multiple Echo devices, including the first generation Show. This is definitely an improvement on that, bigger screen, better music and sound, and video. However, more than any other single function, we use it as a digital picture frame. The background picture, when the device isn't being used for something else, can be set to an album that you have created on Amazon Photos. We loaded 400 or so photos, and they change at about one minute, which I think is a perfect time. There are a couple of problems, though. First, the units have a tendency to stop and stay at one picture, until the unit is unplugged and plugged in again. This has been mentioned time and time again in reviews, but the Amazon team on this project has apparently either not prioritize it, or can't fix it. Expect this to continue until they make it a priority. The second issue with this as a digital picture frame is that there's no customization, other than selecting the album. Pictures rotate chronologically, either by date taken or date uploaded. You cannot shuffle or randomize. So if you took a bunch of photos at a birthday party or wedding, you are going to see all of those pictures in succession, before it moves on to another. It's gotten to the point where I can predict what the next pictures going to be. Also in the category of lack of customization – there is no effects that you can use with these pictures. There is no transition choice – fade,, wipe, side – nor were there any effects that can be used (Ken Burns, etc.) Amazon doesn't give you any kind of slideshow maker, and it doesn't support any third-party apps. In the general category of Alexa – the skills have now become like Apple's app store. You can't find anything useful unless you read something about it somewhere. It suggests skills, based on one's you have already enabled. We tried that once. ""Big sky"" is a weather app that's pretty good. Around Christmas time, it was suggested that if we like that, we would like something called ""Sky Weather"". So I enabled it by voice. And then opened it. It went on for about two minutes. And Alexa did not appear to hear me calling for it to stop, so I had to scream. No more suggestions. My home isn't smart enabled, so I'm not going to comment on its usefulness on that front. The recipes are definitely helpful, but I don't think I'll be watching much video on it. Simply finding your Amazon purchases can take time, and there's only a limited number of them that show. Finally, the ""drop in"". Nice idea, but these are usually going to be sitting on kitchen counters or side tables. You're going to have to squat down. In an age where everybody has an iPhone or iPad and Facetime is available, it's an inferior redundancy. (Oh, and it can be really annoying. I gave these to 2 sisters and a niece at Christmas. One of the sisters sent me a message. Suddenly, the Echo Dot next to my head started glowing and fading, glowing and fading. I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. So I could sleep, I just unplugged it. Next day, I saw other Dots glowing and fading, and went into the Show to find out what the heck was going on. Apparently it was the message, and it doesn't stop until you read it. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to texting. They still haven't found the homerun app for this device. For us right now, it's pretty much a $229 picture frame that doesn't do everything we would like it to do.",Waiting for updates

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2019,Barry,"I've had the Show for a little over a week. This thing has great potential, but it sorely needs a software update. If you think about it, it really does not do anything useful. Most of the time it just sits there. You need to be able to customize the home screen background and size of the time / weather. It could be a fantastic, basic, smart home controller, but it fails on that part. You need to be able to map addresses. You need an option to not show this ""Try"" nonsense at the bottom of the screen - that is just veiled advertising. It needs more thought put into accessibility features. I just tried: ""Alexa, show me the nearest pizza places"" as prompted by one of their ""Try …"" suggestions. It showed me 8 sample pizza offerings from different places, but did not state the distance. I tapped on one of the pizza offerings, it showed the distance, but would not let me map the location. If I want to order a pizza I would have to go to my computer – why bother with the Show? *** After 4 weeks *** This product has so much potential, but the implementation is garbage. It should never have been released for sale. The reality is it's just a tabletop dust collector – it does nothing. Most of the time it just sits there. It would be useful if it showed the time, day, and date on the home screen. It does show the time, but the font is too small to be useful and it's not configurable. It doesn't show the day or date. It shows an icon with the current weather and temperature, but again it's too small to see across a normal-size room and it's not configurable. 90% of the screen real estate is wasted. At the bottom they have an advertisement for ""Try: Alexa…"" And this can't be removed. After the first 15 minutes of ""Wow"", this gets old really fast. The bottom line, in its present state I definitely could not recommend it to someone. If they fixed the software with some of the many complaints you see on the Echo Devices forum, it could be really good and useful. *** After 6 months *** Still no software update. This thing just sits there. It would be useful if the clock were larger, showed the month/day/year, and got rid of that ""Try…"" nonsense that's always on the screen. Just about everyone who buys one has the same complaints, but Amazon has done nothing. They now have an Echo Show 5 which, from the pictures, looks like it addresses a few of these problems. The 2nd Gen Show will probably end up in the garbage in a few weeks. There is absolutely no way I'll be getting a Show 5.",Great Concept Needs Software Update

So far, when I have tried to use it, it has been a letdown. The Alexa commands are not exhaustive/intuitive enough to navigate purely by voice, but there is also no effective way to navigate by touch. Asking Alexa to play a program that is available on Hulu sent me to Prime Video instead, where it showed a pay option. When I tried to display a recipe, it continued to time out between when I glanced at the screen, completed a step, and returned to see what was next. With egg- or floured-covered hands, it was an extremely frustrating process that led me to print the recipe anyway. Beyond those experiences, my Echo Show has sat dormant, which is very unusual for a new toy. It does not seem to be worth the money, and I might be returning mine and returning to the radio and my cookbooks, which accomplish as much or more as this new piece of technology.",Quirks make it an insufficient sous chef and kitchen TV
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2018,Bron,"First, this is an order of magnitude improvement in terms of hardware. Much larger screen, which looks great. Very bright, good color, all as expected. It looks nicer as well. This device is larger and heavier. The sound is much improved in terms of the speakers, drivers, etc. and it has bass response the 1st gen Echo could not dream of. All in all, much as presented here on Amazon. As expected, there are some software issues and omissions. It's a new release, after all. So I'm sure Amazon will be fixing these soon.  Many have noticed the LOUD Alexa voice response. It is truly annoying. Hopefully, they will fix this soon. Ideally they would let you set Alexa's voice response level independently from media. As it is, media volume is much lower. Also, they appear to have used spatial processing to give you a stereo effect and it works great. But it's not always desirable. There should be an option to disable it. For example, it works great for some music, but not well at all for other music.  Also, the bass response is overdone - for some things - even when I lower the bass in the equalizer to minimum levels. The equalizer adjustments need more range or tweaking, in my opinion.  At first I thought, wow, I won't need my external speakers now, This thing sounds great. But as I went on, I soon learned that wasn't the case and reverted back to using my Bluetooth speaker. The spatial effect interference with mid-range (vocals) is the primary reason as it alters the balance of sounds, but the over-done boomy bass is also an issue. It's less of an issue at lower volumes. Some music sounds great. And movies I watched from Prime Video all sounded very good. With movies the bass and spatial sound works very well and everything sounded fantastic. It made for a very enjoyable movie experience. I was a beta user for the original Echo and we went through some of this with that device as well and Amazon did a great job of addressing the issues, so I am sure they will do the same this time around. The hardware is a huge step up in performance, so the results should be excellent. So vastly improved screen and sound drivers, they just need to get the software tweaked for music. Also, as some have noted, not all of the functionality is working properly at this point. Most all of the basic stuff does. Some  things still have glitches. But give them time. I will try to come back and update as things unfold. Giving 4 stars for now as I like it even with the glitches. Update:After lowering the bass (a lot) and moving the Echo to another location, sound has improved.  Still would like finer controls, but it definitely has great sound potential. Some songs sound incredibly good. The spatial effect can be very enjoyable with the right source material.  Also, as mentioned, it works extremely well with most movies.","Definite improvement, some software issues on release"

So, though the Show still remains limited in many ways, being able to set up and control my new smart light bulbs is a new big plus to me.  I now have smart light bulbs and Amazon Smart Plugs all using only the Alexa app. Updated 2/3/19:  I find this device to be disappointing for the price.  I’ve had the Show for two months now.  It has a few positives (nice display, decent sound, Zigbee controller) and others have commented on them.  I don’t use Zigbee devices, so that’s not a benefit to me.  However, what I noticed most are the negatives: 1. It can’t do 2 things at one time.  For instance, it’s not possible to watch the livestream of your baby sleeping and also play music or an audiobook.  It can do one or the other.  A Fire tablet can do both, though without the audio power of the Show. 2. It’s not possible to watch the map tracking of your delivery.  Perhaps it would require computer components to do that, but I find it annoying that it’s not possible on the Show.  It’s available on my Fire tablets or Shop Amazon app, and it would be nice to watch on the Show. 3. It has no light ring for notifications.  I’m surprised at how irritating I find this.  I can walk through a room that has an Echo or Dot in it and immediately see that there is something I should attend to.  Not so with the Show.  Only if I happen to be in the room at the time a message arrives will I be aware there is a message. 4. It doesn’t show the list of your skills.  Alexa will read them off instead.  This is way too slow. 5. It nicely plays Prime videos.  However, it’s like watching a 10 inch TV when I’ve got a huge big screen and Fire TV on the opposite wall. 6. It emits a lot of light, just like a TV, even at the lowest light level.  If I have the ambient clock on, there is way too much light emitted for a bedroom (unless you want a ten-inch bright nightlight).  I can turn off the clock which will allow the display to eventually go dark, but then I have no clock, although I can always ask Alexa the time. 7. It’s heavy and tethered to the electrical cord.  I like to move around my kitchen and sometimes move my recipes with me.  I can’t do that with the Show.  Plus, I can’t enlarge the font. 8.  I noticed that some of my Skills sometimes flash a message on the screen and by the time I get up close to read what it says, the message is gone.  Gone, as in no way to replay it (that I can find). I love my Fire tablets, Echos, Dots, and Fire TVs.  I’m also liking my new Amazon Smart Plugs.  I also felt those devices were good values when on sale.  The Echo Show has me less enthused.","What it does it does well, but it’s limited in what it can do"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2018,Jeff Carter,"The Echo Show 2nd gen is amazing. The screen is not only bigger but your wallpapers look more vivid especially pics with Autumn Leaves Echo Show 2 is louder then Echo Show 1 You can access your smarthome controls in settings eg lights,switches,plugs etc. You can ask Alexa to pull up firefox and silk browsers and you can view YouTube. I was able to view all my YouTube favorites,history,subscriptions etc once I logged in. Music sounds more crisp on the Echo Show 2 especially Dolby Show 2 has a lot of base but you can cut that down in the alexa app or in the settings as well I think. I recommend the Echo Show Gen 2 and the Stand Accessory sold seperatly thru amazon.  The stand makes it look even better as you'll see in my picture. An FYI Echo Show Gen 1 also now has the browsers,light controls,youtube etc since an Update. The advantage of the Echo Show 2 over the 1 is mainly the bigger screen size and it's HD Screen. The Echo Show 1 is just a little brighter then the Echo Show 2 but the Show 2 looks better with your wallpaper pictures cause of the HD Screen.

I had been wanting a display device for use in the kitchen where I could refer to recipes while I am preparing a new dish and was also interested in purchasing an Alexa-enabled video doorbell so I could check to see who was at the door whenever I hear the dogs start barking while I am working on my computer in my home office.  I don't yet have the video doorbell but I did ask the new Show to display recipes for corn beef and cabbage, one of my husband's favorite dishes, and the images were sharp and the colors brilliant.

For the last 3 years, the Echo Show has changed our lives. She lives 2,000 miles away, and we were able to be together most days. She was fine cognitively but could never get the hang of FaceTime and could not be bothered to keep an iPad at her side. The Echo Show was wonderful, because, with her one-time permission, I could ""drop in"" to her living room at any time. She was near deaf, but the quality of the microphone and speakers meant she was able to hear and understand me. Perhaps the screen allowed a little lip-reading too. It also allowed her to talk with her 88-year-old sister. The phone did not work for them because of hearing problems, but the Echo Show did. Her sister's daughter saw it and bought one for herself to communicate with her mother. It followed her to the hospital for her end days.

If you're trying to make it work for someone else in your Household, it's a nightmare. I bought the new Echo Show for my daughter (who lives with her mom) so that we could video call.  We had previously made M an Amazon Teen account (CID-Teen), which gave her access to watch Prime video content, and shop as an Amazon prime member.  I am also a Prime Music Unlimited subscriber.  Amazon Music won't let her use her Teen account play music, so we had to create a new account just for that purpose (CID-Music). The Alexa app would not let her Sign-In with her Teen Account. Then we tried removing her from the household (CID-Teen->CID-Normal).  She could then Sign-In to the Alexa app, but lost the ability to play videos, music, or shop as a prime member. Then we tried to Sign-In with my account (CID-Parent), and add her as a comms profile (CID-Comms).  This initially failed because the mobile login claim (phone number) was associated with another CID.  We called support to get the number free'd up.  Once we were able to create the comms profile and Sign-In, we realized that this isn't a real solution either, as she now has all of the devices for my home (lights, tv's, etc) in her Alexa companion app, as opposed to just the Echo Show device that I bought for her. 4 calls to support, ~90 minutes wasted talking to CSAs.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2019,LJ,"I’ll start by saying the sound quality of this device is top notch, and a real treat as an addition to my multi-room sound setup with other echo devices throughout the house. My intent on purchasing the echo show was to have video feeds in the main kitchen area for the baby’s room, my son’s room while his friends are upstairs playing, and the doorbell when people come over. In general, this is where my satisfaction for this device really falls short. The video feed of any camera you are viewing times out after 10 minutes, and you have to retrigger the video feed by saying “Alexa, show...”. It’s a wildly poor design choice, and one that brings the entire experience of this device crashing down. There are some other basic things I would have liked to have seen with a massive touch screen like a different UI that allows you to touch different groups and interact with them, similar  to how the Alexa App works on phones, rather than entirely relying on voice commands. I mean, what is the point of having a massive touch screen if the opportunity to touch it and interact with it is extremely limited? Aside from that, the video playback functionality is limited to prime video and Hulu, again with major omissions from Netflix and YouTube. In general, the hardware is let down with half baked software and terrible design choices from the team. I’ve also seen people complaining about the 10 minute video timeout for the past couple years, and Amazon is completely silent on it (wish I had known that before buying, since device is pitched like a baby monitor, often being bundled with Wyze cams and showing product images displaying camera feeds into children’s rooms). in conclusion, I’d skip the echo show product line. Not really sure what it’s for or who’s needs it meets, but it certainly isn’t for me.","Great hardware, half baked software"

First issue, without a smartphone, he couldn't set it up. In fact you have to have a cell number to link the account to. Okay, did that but I have had so many issues getting it to connect. For some reason, I always have to repeat his name; adding contacts is convoluted: adding a neighbor -- we set up the Alexa app on the neighbor's telephone and I confirmed it is working from there. Can't add the neighbor as a drop-in allowed contact. This product is too difficult to set up and use. I have been with support multiple times. Perhaps I have too many Amazon devices and it gets confused but use case is simply an Amazon Fire Tablet with Echo Show base and this Echo Show and I can't connect with any consistency. Good idea but needs to be simplified to work and set up. One should be able to set it up on EITHER phone or PC web page. There needs to be consistency between alexa.amazon.com and the app as far as contacts are concerned or it needs to propagate immediately. Users shouldn't have to have to install alexa app to use the device. Or if they do, then at least make it easy without needing double identification setting up the app. This device is just too confusing for the average person to set up (and I would consider myself especially tech savvy).",Issues issues issues

I can truly say the Show 2nd generation is a worthy upgrade if you listen to music on it. The audio is fantastic with lush deep low end and richer mid-range and highs. We listen to a lot of music in our kitchen with ours and this one thing makes it so worthwhile to me. The screen is noticeably larger and looks like it is higher resolution. Watching movie trailers or shows is even better. I can only imagine that one day there will be small TV sized Alexa Shows. I would love to replace the 27"" TV that is on the wall right behind the Alexa Show with a larger screen Show 3 or whatever is in the pipeline. I can have a Fire TV stick on it but that is different than the Show. It doesn't pop up tidbits of information nor wake to ""Alexa"". Perhaps a Fire TV Cube would work, but again it has a bit of a different feel than a Show. I think the Show is the perfect counter top or table device, so I guess what I'm asking is simply to have a Fire TV have a setting where it acts more like a Show. But then again my TV doesn't have motion sensors to know when you've walked into the room. Nor does it stay on all the time. - Maybe there is something to my wish after all. Anyways, I am really impressed. If you already have a gen 1 Show then you may be fine to keep with it. I'm giving mine to my Mother-in-law so we can video chat with her. It will be more than enough for her needs. But if you listen to music a lot or really want a larger screen then the Show 2 delivers on those. 5 Amazing Stars!",Fantastic Successor to the First Generation Show

Solberg,"This is nicely designed hardware. Pulling it out of the box, you get a sense that you're buying something of good quality. It has good, loud speakers, and a reasonably nice screen. I was pretty excited. Unfortunately, the user interface let me down. I can feel the huge potential for this product, but every time I tried to do something, I was stymied in some way. It's not like it's a bad interface, it's more like it's not finished. For example, the home screen seems like it would be a great way to check on my day. I'd like to see a forecast for the today and maybe the next couple of days on the main screen. The other half of the screen could show maybe sports scores or news headlines, or maybe the status of all the connected lights in the house, or maybe a touch screen of quick actions to jump to recently used stuff. None of that is available. You can get a rotating view of news headlines, but you can't pick your source. You can see sports information, but for some reason it only shows my local football team, and there's no way to choose. This would be a perfect heads up display, but the rotation of elements means that you'll have to stare at the screen for a long time before what you need pops up. Again, lots of potential, but not there yet. Another thing to do with this is watch videos in the kitchen when you're cooking. This works okay, but everything about choosing and finding episodes in clunky and unfinished. For example, I wanted to watch the next show in the series I was watching, but for some reason, it went to the first episode. I could not see any way to go to the episodes list so I could choose the next episode, and I didn't know the correct number, so I couldn't try asking Alexa. I thought about keeping it because if Amazon keeps iterating on the UI, someday it could be quite useful. However, at this point, it's well-designed hardware with software that frustratingly just wouldn't do what I wanted. I also considered keeping it because it works with the Fire TV Recast, but in the end, the hard to use interface was just a little too much to overcome, at least for now.","Nice product, but the interface isn't there quite yet."

The Echo Show 2nd generation is Amazon’s latest entry in the major “land grab” to fully automate your home.  Being much more useful and refined than the Echo Show 1st edition, this device demonstrates that Amazon are good listeners; they discovered what users disliked about the first Echo Show and removed/reworked those functions and they discovered what users liked and improved those. First, if you are new to the Echo Show line, let me describe some aspects of the device this way you know what you are getting. Display:  This new Echo Show features a larger touch screen (10.1” vs 7” on the Echo Show 1st Generation); the additional screen real estate comes in really handy for watching movies or following recipe videos.  In addition, the resolution on the 2nd generation Echo Show has been bumped up to a more pleasing high definition (1280x720 resolution) from a non-hd (1024x600 resolution).  The result is a very nice looking screen featuring crisp, colorful pictures and videos. Sound:  One of the reasons you would buy this device is to acquire a really smart speaker.  The sound on this Echo Show is very nice; the engineers kept the original two speaker design, but upgraded and, for better sound disbursement, moved the speakers from the front to the sides.  To help fill out the sound, they added a welcome addition, a “passive bass radiator.”  Which, according to Wikipedia, is an unpowered speaker where the “Internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone.” Or, put another way, the air moved by the two inch speakers drives the bass speaker.  The result is a very enjoyable, full sound.  How does the sound coming from this Echo Show compare to the sound coming from similar Bose or Sonos Bluetooth speakers?  I do not have any experience with Sonos since I do not own one, but I have a Bose Sounddock and the Bose is clearly better.  However, this Bose speaker is not a smart display; I can give up a little sound quality to get all this device’s other cool functionality.  Anyway, the sound that is produced by this Echo Show is respectable and powerful enough to fill a medium sized room. If you purchase this Echo Show and are disappointed in the sound, you always have the option to purchase a dedicated, high end Bluetooth speaker and pair (connect) it to your Echo Show.  The result would be the best of both worlds; audiophile sound with the functionality of a smart display. Physical design:  The new Echo Show takes on a somewhat different form than the original Echo.  Instead of being all plastic, it is covered in a pleasant and decorative tweed looking fabric.  You get a choice of two colors, charcoal (dark gray) or sandstone (off white).  On top of the newly redesigned show are the physical volume buttons, a mute button to mute the volume and turn off the camera and four microphones.  On the front, near top of the screen bezel are four additional microphones.  These eight mics do a nice job of picking up your inquiries to Alexa to perform all of her different functions.  Additionally, one nice touch that will fly under the radar is the mini-usb port on the back.  This will enable you, via a usb to Ethernet adapter, to connect your Echo Show to your wired Ethernet connection.  Why is that important?  For various reasons, people do not have solid, reliable wireless coverage in their home or they might not even have a wireless connection at all.  This will help in those situations. Software:  The area most in need of improvement is Echo Show’s software.  Owing to the contentious relationship between Google and Amazon, there is no way to easily access YouTube on the Echo Show Second Generation.  You can do it, but it takes effort.  The Echo Show has two browsers built in; Silk and Firefox.  So, you will need to ask Alexa to open Firefox (or Silk).  After your browser opens, you have to navigate to YouTube.  After you get into YouTube, you will need to perform a search via the onscreen keyboard.  Only after that, you will see your search results and can open your video.  Wouldn’t it be much easier to say “Alexa, show me YouTube videos with funny cats” and have those search results displayed on the screen?  However, if you want to watch YouTube videos, there is the capability to do so. That brings me to another point.  You have a nice new device with a screen, but do not confuse it for a fully functioning computer.  Because there are no installed programs (or apps) like on your laptop or mobile phone, functionality is more limited.  For example, if you start going to different web pages via one of the browsers, it does not take long before you find pages displaying oddly—videos not playing and login boxes not working; it is all because the browsers are not the full-fledged browsers that you are used to accessing on your computer.  So, just keep in mind that even though this device looks like one, it is not a computer.  It excels at doing certain things like keeping your shopping list, keeping a daily planner, displaying cooking videos, accessing Amazon Prime movies, answering some basic questions and most importantly, controlling your smart home devices; it is worth owning this Echo Show just to perform these functions. Zigbee Home Hub:  Huh?  You will see some information about the Echo Show being a Zigbee Home Hub and everyone touts it as something really important, but never really explain what is going on.  Let’s take a minute here to do that.  It turns out that the networking that you are using now, WiFi (802.11x), Bluetooth, and wired Ethernet are not good for all of the home networking devices that you own or will own in the near future.  That is where Zigbee comes in.  Zigbee uses a different networking standard (802.15.4) in order to connect all of the home automation devices that you own, think thermostats, light bulbs, plugs, security cameras and the like.  Now, with all of these different devices sending signals zooming around your house, you need something to pull them all together and control all the different aspects of them—are you on, are you off, turn the temperature up, turn it down, show me the backyard camera; in order to get all these to work, you need a hub.  That is where the second generation Echo Show comes in.  It is a Zigbee hub which will use this new 802.15.4 network to easily setup and control all of your Zigbee compatible devices.  Even though it does not sound like much, being a Zigbee hub is kind of a big deal. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the Echo Show Second Generation: Pros: -Sharp HD touch screen -Nice sound, much better than any other Amazon Echo device -Nice integration with Amazon Prime (videos, photos, music) -Setup is very easy -Stylish look; more modern and elegant than the first generation Echo Show -Ability to connect to wired Ethernet -Zigbee home hub Cons: -It is not a computer which you will discover if you regularly use either of the show’s built in browsers -Poor integration with video other than Amazon Prime video (think YouTube, Sling TV, etc.) -Lack of options to setup the home screen -A ton of skills, but many are useless -Supporting Z-Wave (alternate protocol to Zigbee) would have been nice",Impressive device; an important link to your automated household
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Nov 2018,Ethan Winter,"The good: The sound quality is excellent compared to the Echo. The screen quality and video clarity are also good. The bad: It takes far too long to update. For example, when you put your calendar events on your home screen, it is usually 12-24 hours behind, showing you yesterday's events. Same goes for notifications. Received an Amazon shipment and my Echo notified at 10:16am, it wasn't till 10:56am that my Echo Show gave me that info. The ugly: Home screen just isn't actually prepared to display properly. If connected to your calendar, it will only show one even for the day, rather than scrolling through multiple events, requiring you to touch the screen to go into your calendar (at that point I could just be using my regular Echo device). Headlines/stories are completely random, and cut off mid sentence. So you'll see something like ""Snakes loose in the wester"" and again would have to touch the screen to dig in further. It also seems to have a much harder time hearing me that my regular Echo devices, especially if it's playing music! Additionally, it simply isn't designed to be seen from across the room; I have a small city apartment so at most I'm 10 feet away, the time and weather are tiny little dots in the corner of a an otherwise empty screen, and there's no way you'll be able to read the ""try"" scroll on the bottom of the screen unless you're right on top of it. Unless you are using this for the specific purpose of video chatting with someone else who has an Echo Show, I'd say save your money till they make the adjustments. With Google Home Hub (which unlike the Echo Show has the ability to search and play YouTube videos) only costing $150, and regular Echo devices at $100, this just feels like a missed opportunity that is over priced, not prepared for a good user experience, and overall not worth the cost!","Fine, not great"

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Oct 2018,K. K,"Edit Nov 2, 2018. I've been working with Amazon support on my issues around how the device handles light level detection and how it behaves overnight when used as a bedside device.  My main issues were 1) the device did not sleep as expected (so it was distracting while sleeping) and 2) the ambient light sensing mode did not work properly (it made the device VERY dark).  I have some updates and feedback on Amazon's support process and where we stand. First, Amazon support has been excellent.  They reached out to me directly to discuss the issues and have solicited my feedback and ""evidence"" (videos for example) to demonstrate the behavior.  They've had their engineering team involved... so it's obvious they are taking this seriously and want to fix the issues assuming they are valid and can be validated.  This is what I'd expect.  I'm very happy so far. Related to sleep mode.  At night, by default, I've determined that if the ""Adaptive Brightness"" is turned on then the device will not sleep properly and will continue to cycle through the various screens prompting you for interactions.  The normal stuff.  If you turn ""Adaptive Brightness"" OFF then it does work.  This is counter intuitive but the good news is that this mode works and resolves the issue of the device working as a bedside device, I'm happy to say. In relation to when the Adaptive Brightness mode is ON and the device becoming too dark I am still working on validating that with support.  They're serious about fixing the issue so I'm hopeful. I've raised my review rating based on the above and my genuine positive experience with the Gen2 Show outside of those issues.  The audio is superb, the screen is great, and it's a great platform.  I am completely willing to recommend the device now assuming folks understand the dimming issues mentioned above and how to address them.  To summarize, currently: 1. For Bedside use disable ""Adaptive Brightness"" in the display settings.  This allows the device to go into sleep mode at night when next to you on a bedside table. 2.  When not used as a bedside device it's ok to use Adaptive Brightness but be aware that you may need to turn the brightness level up so that it doesn't go too dark.  IF you turn AB on and the screen goes to dark just raise the brightness level as I noted. Original review: So, I have 3 V1s and now 2 V2 Shows.  I like the devices, obviously, or I wouldn't have invested in them for use around the house.  The 10"" V2 is a great upgrade in most ways.  Bigger screen, much better sound, some new interface features (but Echo still needs a LOT of work in this area) but it also has a nearly game breaking flaw. On all of my V1s the screen dimming worked awesome.  If it was night time and there was no activity in a room the screen would dim, intelligently, and the display would just show the clock.  The idea here obviously was to reduce distractions during sleep.  This made the Show a great device for the bedside.  Not any more (at least for now). V2 of the show has a serious problem with dimming and ""sleep"" detection, as I would call it.  There are two problems compared to the previous model: 1.  The device does not properly detect light levels, or react to them, so that if the Ambient Light sensor is ""enabled"" it will dim to an almost unreadable state if the ambient light source is behind the unit.  Sometimes even if it's not.  I had to turn this feature off completely as I could not see the display on my devices about half the time! 2.  The biggest flaw is that the device NO LONGER detects that a room has no activity if used at bedside (and possibly elsewhere).  I spent a very restless night because the screen on my Show V2 would NOT go to ""sleep"" mode (where it completely dims and only the clock is shown) and it was SUPER annoying.  I have no idea how to fix this.  I cannot use the Ambient Light sensor because then I would not be able to see the device during the day much of the time.  I'm puzzled. Note that I've confirmed that the V2 is using the same settings as the V1 so this should not be happening.  In general... it's a big problem and if it's not resolved I may be returning the device here before too long.  The bigger display and improved sound are not worth losing sleep at night.",UPDATED:  Great upgrade to v1 but with caveats about how to set brightness settings for bedside use.

I bought 2 and saved $100, 1 for the kitchen and 1 for my bedroom. I was driven to buy this when I heard it at an Amazon Store. Sound quality alone was enough to buy. Video chatting is easy and simple to apple or android devices. Philips hue smart bulb connected easily with “Alexa, discover devices”. The consistent carousel of content, reminders, upcoming events and news keeps me checking the screen throughout the day. It’s also simple to see my security cameras without interrupting the TV like I use to when I used the Fire TV. I’m waiting for a update for Netflix and screen mirroring. It’s a Great buy.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2018,Kindle Customer,"Once you get past which ecosystem to commit to, make no mistake, this Smart Display is really slick.....setting aside the fact that IMHO Alexa is better in a number of ways over the Google Assistant for these purposes, and considering I own both the Google Home Hub and the Show Gen 2, I have to say that the display size of the Show Gen 2 is a huge win/+.  Saying 'Alexa' is also easier and more reliable than 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google'. As for screen quality on this unit, very nice.  And the audio quality is very good.  I love the fact that you can get some thumping bass from this product too.  It's audio quality is sufficient to fill an entire room.  All the features that Amazon advertises for this product work pretty well, to really well.  It's not often that this happens..... The home automation aspects of this Smart Display are very good, to great.  It relies heavily on having the Alexa App on your smartphone, but I don't see this as a big drawback.  And the Mic array is particularly adept at hearing you correctly the first time.... I'm not going to do a deep dive on all the features....as Amazon's content on the site does a good job of this.  For the asking price, I think it's one of the best Smart Displays released so far this year.  And because I'm Prime, I get tons of content right off the bat, i.e. music, movies, apps, shopping, order updates 'Alexa', where's my stuff, etc. Google Home Hub sits in the bedroom.....Echo Show Gen 2 sits in the kitchen, where we spend 70% of our time.  Provided Amazon continues to push updates to this unit for some time to come, I think this experience will only get better and better!  Can't wait.",Awesome Smart Display

My major complaint is that the screen constantly tells you to try this, look at that, do this, do that.  It's so annoying and I've only had it for a day. I think you can turn the screen completely off but why should I have too.  Amazon needs to give it the flexibility to be customize-able and not just their way, stupid.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2018,Alex,"The Amazon Echo has not improved at all in voice recognition since the first generation. It's this bipolar extreme between good voice recognition and absolute horrific make you want to smash your head into a brick wall frustration. The Echo Show for what it is supposed to be able to do is incredibly inadequate and this is something that I feel should be obvious. This is 2019. Not 1995. We live in a world where even crappy cell phones can go back to apps that were opened ANYTHING that you're doing, is completely interrupted when you ask it something else, and then afterwards, there's absolutely NO WAY to get back to what you were doing without it starting over as if it totally quit the program AFTER you asked it to switch back to it. For instance, there's a built in web browser (Just so you don't think this is skill-related and maybe Amazon pass the buck). Let's say I'm browsing a page.. Could be anything like. Any page. I then say ""What's the weather like?"" It takes me away from the page to show me the weather and say it also of course. At the end if I say ""resume firefox"" or whatever it literally will go to the OPENING of the browser as if I had NOTHING open. Same with the Twitch skill. So I will say ""open <streamer>"" and it will open the stream. Cool. then I wanted to know the weather. Cool got the weather. But now Twitch isn't being shown, so I say ""resume Twitch"" ... it goes to the purple Twitch home screen ""X channels you follow are online. Would you like to see them?"" no. when I say resume Twitch I want you to !@&*(^&*^ resume what was playing before I asked what the weather was. This is so basic functionality it's not even funny. To continue the story, I then proceed to say ""Ask twitch for <streamer>"" TWENTY TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To which EVERY TIME Alexa says ""I dont' recognize that streamer name"" then other times it opens up Wikipedia to something completely unrelated that I DID NOT SAY. So I end up resorting to asking it to open Twitch and then tapping the options on screen as if I'm using a Tablet, completely defeating the purpose of a FREAKING VOICE ASSISTANT. Now a more simpler thing. With Google Home you can say ""Turn on the energize"" and it knows it's in whatever room it's in so it will turn on the lights with that scene in that room. Or you can say ""Turn on the energize  everywhere"" and it will turn that scene on in every room in the house. OR you can say ""Turn on the energize in the dining room"" while in the bedroom. Alexa? Not a chance. I mean yes. You set up rooms. Yes. You put Alexa in a certain room. No. She doesn't seem to know what room she's in nor can she turn on ANYTHING in that room without you being AS FULLY EXPLICIT.. ""Turn on the energize in the bedroom"" .. even though you're in the bedroom, because saying ""Turn on the energize"" is met with ""There are multiple devices with that name, can you tell me which one you want?"" then it's like defusing a bomb, because saying the natural response to that question ""<name of device>"" is met with ""I'm sorry. I didn't understand that."" Basically you have to GIVE IT THE FULL COMMAND as if it has absolutely ZERO understanding of language or anything else. In other words it's primitive as a straw hut in the middle of the jungle. Amazing idea, implemented boneheadedly awful. And sad to say this is why other devices are running circles around it. For all the features that Echo Show is supposed to have, it is ruined by it's complete incompetence at voice control. And once you realize that you cannot even REMOTELY talk to it like you'd talk to something that even TRIES to mimick human conversation, it still won't understand you half the time, as evidence by me telling it to go to the streamer that I just said once and it understood and then it fails to understand twelve times and I have to actually just press buttons to get there because the voice command is garbage. I pre-ordered the first Amazon Echo and still have it. The voice command has not improved AT ALL since then. Having a continue mode where it listens again for a follow up command is NOT better speech recognition. It's just code. You need better AI, by like a billion lightyears of a long shot. If it didn't perform the basic functions of controlling the lights etc. with learnable , though less convenient commands, I would return it. I don't even want to install additional skills on it because my experience using it to watch Twitch has probably taken ten years off my life. I'll just use the computer the old fashioned way because IT WORKS.",Completely Incompetent for Anything But The Most Basic Inquiries

Called customer service the next day and they stated that many of the devices that were sent out for Prime day are not working properly and there is no volume. The resolution I got was, hold on to it for four or five days and hopefully they will do an update to fix it. No suggestion to send it back or send a new one. Basically keep your fingers crossed and hopefully Amazon will fix the problem on the hundreds of units that have already complained about this issue. When you're playing a video and tell Alexa to stop, it does not stop. You literally have to scream at it to go back to home. The suggestions and captions all day long scrolling are really really annoying, you should be able to change this! Putting your photos on in the slideshow doesn't work properly either. You constantly get Amazon backgrounds coming up. What a disaster this was in ordering! You would think a brand new item they would at least let you send back.

I use my Echos daily for alarms, changing the heat/AC, lights, timers, weather, news and podcasts and as an intercom. I was expecting to be pretty happy with the Show, but out of the box it has potential that has yet to be realized, at least from what I can tell. First, I thought video news would be great. Reuters was what I tried. It plays, but then I ask Alexa to exit. Instead of stopping, it simply shuts off the video, but the audio continues to play. Seriously, this is annoying. I tried a few recipe skills and they were quite clumsy, difficult to exit and one even wanted me to sign up online. Hello, I want to do everything on the Show, not go to some website. Why is this so complicated? The constant stream of various headlines and ""trending topics"" is annoying. Can I shut them off? I have yet to figure that out. So, with all the hype on developing a ""delightful user experience"" why do we have to start from zero with a new medium/platform? Why can't Amazon or Skill developers apply good UI design and make this not just easy to use, but fun? I'll add more later, but first impressions do matter. My new iPad, Kindle and other devices were a lot of fun right away. This should be too. Sadly the experience is more like buying a fussy new printer than an innovative new device.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2019,Jim Lewis,"I previously gave the 2nd. Gen. Show 3-stars for having no manual.  However, on actually firing it up, WOW!  I got it for two basic reasons: 1) to be able to display multiple named timers and not having to keep asking Alexa, ""How much time is left on my pizza timer?,"" and, 2) to be able to quickly ask, ""Show me the Front Door"" without having to fiddle with my smartphone or computer to see what's going on with my Ring Video Doorbell.  It works great for both purposes and is pretty handy for other things.  I like seeing any math calculation results displayed on the screen, too, as opposed to just trusting that I heard all numbers dictated to my DOT the right way. The display and sound quality are just fine as far as I'm concerned.  The device is on an open kitchen table several feet from any walls but the aluminum blinds on a kitchen picture window form a nice reflective backdrop to send sound forward. I bought the official Amazon plastic stand.  It holds the Show firmly enough but is kinda stiff to adjust.  A metal stand with more tilt and rotation may be in my future. One of the most annoying things, though, is the Discovery and Rotate Continuously modes.  I turned both off and it worked initially but when I had some quirks getting notified by my Ring Doorbell, I tried turning those display modes back on and now I haven't been able to turn Discovery and Rotate Continuously off since!  Hope to avoid the Factory Reset nuclear option.  What does work to give me a non-distracting blank screen is just to say, ""Echo, turn off screen."" The Ring Doorbell was a bit tricky to get working right.  Have a nice Linksys Router that does both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands with the doorbell about the only thing on the 5 GHz channel and given highest possible router priority.  Figured since Show is not battery-powered and is close by router, I'd put it on the 5 GHz channel, too, the better to get notifications from the Ring Doorbell.  Bad idea!  Only when I put the Show on the 2.4 GHz router channel did doorbell rings trigger Show notifications (I could view front door video from either channel, though).  Figured when I pressed the doorbell, it began to hog 5 G channel to transmit video and the 2.4 GHz channel would be freer to communicate with router for video feed.  The notification and switch to video upon request are now pretty fast and reliable. In spite of no manual in the box, there is plenty of on-screen Show help available.  What does seem a little schizophrenic is the Settings interface on the Show, in the Alexa Android app, and on the alexa.amazon.com interface are all a bit different.  Would be nice to have more commonality of interface and more advice that one needs to go to the alexa.amazon.com site or whatever for some operations.  I liked the Show and the Black Friday Sales price so much that I bought Show 5's for our daughters but I forgot to uncheck the ""Automatically Link Device to my Amazon Account"" ordering option that is automatically checked as the default even when ordering as a gift!  I had to go to the alexa.amazon.com site to be able to ""factory reset"" the device ordered for the daughter to remove it from my Amazon account!  Crazy!  (told her if I saw anyone ordering baby clothes on my account, I'd know who it was!) Amazon has clearly put a lot of cleverness and intelligence into these devices, e.g., when I say, ""Cancel all timers,"" Alexa complies and cancels all timers set on the device, then reminds me that there is also one still running set on a Dot and would I like to cancel that one, too.  Or, not having adjusted to calling the Show ""Echo"" to distinguish it from the ""Alexa"" Dot, if I tell Alexa on the Dot to cancel a timer actually set on the Show, the Dot is smart enough to know about the Show timer and do what I asked, advising what it has done.  Would be nice, though, if it would stay on the timer screen upon request.  The count time is displayed in pretty large font - the name of the timer is ridiculously small, though.  The user ought to have a way to configure timer display and relative timer order and command running timer display by voice, etc. (""Make my Pizza timer full-screen and show me the last countdown minute."") So all in all, it seems like a great device for a bargain $150 Black Friday Sale price.  Still lots of bugs to be worked out.  Trying to find the interface and behavior that makes everyone happy must be a Sisyphean chore.  But the Show has no trouble understanding my voice at a distance over the roar of the kitchen exhaust fan.  It's performance has been great, so far. I do ask Alexa/Echo weather questions, directions and store hours, general knowledge questions, etc.  I did gripe to Amazon that when one asks the Show for directions and traffic, the Show only gives you verbally expected travel time with a traffic report and a hint of routing but you have to go to the Alexa app to see a map of a proposed route - ridiculous for a little computational device with a great screen connected to powerful servers.  I also asked Alexa several times in different ways for travel times and hours to a specific local Post Office and Alexa insisted on giving me directions to another Post Office about as nearby in the opposite direction that I wanted to travel!  I expect better on such things.  Will have to see how calendaring and tasking work and interface with Toodledo and Microsoft calendaring tools that I use. The other weird Amazonian thing was that I sprung for the $5 Amazon Smart Plug bundled as part of my shopping spree.  When I saw the order invoice, the price on the Show had been reduced to something like $132 and the price on the plug jacked up to $22-since the total price was the same and I did order a bundle with the Amazon stand, I had nothing much to complain about.  And the Show is a truly fine device at its Black Friday price!","In Spite of No Manual, One Helluva Cool and Useful Device"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Nov 2018,Brian M.,"I’ve really liked the 1st generation Echo Show and so when I say the features of the 2nd generation I quickly preordered it. I replaced all 4 of my 1st generation Echo Shows with 2nd generation Echo Shows and repurposed the older ones. The screen is a big improvement on the 2nd Gen, you can really notice the size difference and the new screen looks a lot clearer. We use this for streaming cameras too and as a baby monitor and night and you can see all the detail you need to see. The sound is improved as well. I listen to Pandora pretty much all day long on the Show in my office and for the size and footprint of it the sound quality is great. I will say the one thing I noticed, as far as audio goes, when you ask Alexa to turn up/down the volume vs. using the button the voice command jumps what seems to be a couple steps and I find myself having to go over and turn it down manually if it has gotten too loud. I get around this gernally by saying a specific level i.e. “Alexa, set the volume to 4”. Overall I’m very happy I upgraded to the 2nd generation Echo Shows!",A Great Upgrade From the 1st Gen Echo Show

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2018,Drew Anderson,"Updates:  I have updated this and I gave it another star. There is an Amazon-produced youtube video that is worth watching.  However it isn't in the Amazon help, and it isn't referenced by any of the Amazon help. It gives some of the basics of the device.  I found it on google. You can find it by searching for ""Echo Show Basics"" and it is about 3.5 minutes long. If you watch the video, the device will be less infuriating and can easily be made less presumptive. In the book ""1984"" there was a telescreen.  It was always listening.  Always watching. I always wondered how these devices might come into existence and into peoples homes. I think that I just bought one.  Maybe I'm just afraid that I just bought one. BTW, I do have an Echo, and I like it. The Show, however, is another story. The default mode is for it to be constantly doing something on the screen, switching between ""cards"" which present separate types of information. I spent most of today searching for or figuring out how to turn things off. The home card/screen starts out with lots of stuff turned on. (That is the presumptive part.) Trending topics, sports scores, upcoming events, Discovery with Alexa are all on, but you can turn them off. The one thing you cannot turn off is the Try ""Alexa, ..."" hint at the bottom of the screen I searched for hours on how to turn this off.  It even displays when you are listening to music. (This is what ""infuriating"" is referring to in the title!) The default mode when playing songs is to show the lyrics.  There doesn't seem to be a setting in the any of the various settings options to change this.  However, if you tap the progress bar for a song while it is playing, it will bring up controls.  There is a ""Lyrics"" button.  I'm sure I just dense, but it took me a while to find this. I also feel much more paranoid about the camera than I thought I would, even with it disabled. I am not very happy with the device and wish that I never bought it.  Hopefully, it will improve over time. I understand that some competitive devices have a shutter. Some things I do like: The multiple timer screen is pretty nice.  But, if you set a timer on one device, the other device doesn't know about it. Sound is pretty good.  Another reviewer mentioned that the movie volume is noticeably less than the music or Alexa volume.  I also found this to be true. The display is good. Some things it doesn't suggest, but should: ""Alexa, go home"" ""Alexa, go to settings"" ""Alexa, turn off screen"" ""Alexa, stop streaming""  This will cause it to release the stream so that another device can stream something.",Presumptive and somewhat Infuriating device
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2018,Naomi,"For those who are debating an Alexa device with screen capabilities, this will depend on what you want to use it for. In taking the smart home plunge, I ended up purchasing 4 Echo Shows (2nd generation) and 2 Facebook Portal+’s for my home because I wanted both, PA & Drop in function, but also a primo video chat. Here’s why I have both: The Echo Show (2nd generation) exceeds the Portal + in overall functionality. It provides all of the features of the previous model and more. I wanted some (or all) of my primary devices to sometimes act as a PA & also be able to use the ‘Drop in’ feature when I am not home. I live in a condo and have an 8wk old puppy coming. Though I work from home, at some point if I need to go on a run or leave for an hour or two, I am still able to access the camera and speak to her if she’s barking at the front door. For now, Facebook Portal does not have this feature. With the Echo Show there is also no need for an external hub for most of my smart devices because it’s built right in. I’m unsure if Portal has this. With the Show, there is also direct access to the internet. Just ask Alexa to play movie trailers, Prime videos, etc. The display is nice, but I would chalk up the video calling and ‘Drop in’ quality to better than that of my security cameras (also high quality). The Facebook Portal+ display and AI camera technology far exceeds that of any other device I’ve used. I purchased this for the calling feature - which is its’ primary function. During a call, you no longer need to employ being your own camera man during the call - it’s completely hands-free and smoothly follows you around the room like a movie director. I was impressed by the range at which it accurately followed me and will even follow in the direction of your voice if you happen to step out of the frame. Very limited on other functions though and I expect more are soon to follow within the year once the ‘data breach’ blah blah stuff calms down a bit. Though the Portal does not support the PA & ‘Drop in’ functions that the Echo Show has, I can still control all of my smart home devices & groups with ease and employ all of my routines with no problem. If you’re looking for all-around functionality and more features the Echo Show (2nd) is the way to go. If quality video calling is the priority, then you can’t beat the Portal+ for now - it far exceeds everything else in that arena.",Echo Show (2nd) or Facebook Portal+? - Great functionality with the Echo Show (2nd)

They had a Dot before, so they weren't totally new to the devices. I had showed them how to call me on the Dot, and they used it to call other family members too. Once we got the Shows in both homes, it wasn't long before they were dropping in on me on a regular basis. I thought, at first, that it might be intrusive but there is a CLEAR tone that someone is dropping in and you have about 15-30 seconds before the view comes in to focus. I love it. They just dropped in to find out when we would be traveling to see them. My mom told me about the cookies she made and I could see my dad eating them LOL. I like to be able to drop in on them to see how they are. When I'm away from home, I like to drop in on my own house to see what's going on and make sure it's all OKAY there. It might take a bit to get your elderly parents set up on the Show but it's totally worth it. You can restrict access to certain times or completely. It's done by contact, not device. You can also set it up to go to your cell phone, I believe, with the Alexa app. So, my update is not just about the device itself (but the newest Show is AWESOME ... I didn't know if it was worth upgrading but it IS) but also about it's functionality with faraway loved ones :) The sound is AMAZING! A huge step up from the previous Show. I love the bigger screen!",*UPDATED* Great sound and great for those with elderly parents or distant relatives

Thank you! Thank you! Thank You! This device should be marketed more to assist caregivers it is truly a life saver. The screen comes up with her prompts to take her medication everyday at 8pm and she seeks us out to get her medication. I am not sure anyone who has not done caregiving for a memory challenged individual understand what this means but it is life changing. Echo tells her to turn her favorite TV shows on, it gives both a visual and verbal cue so she is reading! My Aunt is reading her messages and she processes them and acts upon them. And we can drop in, ok that is a little more challenging but she is learning, still looks around for who is talking to her :). I leave activities for her to do and with nanny camera she is actually doing them. Turns out she is very busy during the day and not just sitting in her favorite chair sleeping. She is given down time during day to take naps and does take a few naps. She prefers not to go to senior center saying she prefer young people. She also does puzzles, sweeps floors, folds the laundry I leave for her, cannot put it away but she is folding it. She usually more active in the warmer months so as winter approaches I need to find more activities that Echo can provide. I am also learning how to program echo, I would like to be able to maybe put her favorite show on the Echo and at least let her watch Golden Girls once or twice a week.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2018,Jesse K.,"I was super excited about receiving the 2nd Gen Echo Show today. But, after spending a few hours with it, I’m not that impressed. I’ll start off by saying the sound quality and output is amazing, other than that, I’m struggling to find a good use for it. I’ll give a full rundown below: Backstory: This is my first “screened” echo product. Originally, I was thinking this would have similar features to an android tablet. I wanted to use it in the kitchen and run some of my cooking/recipe “apps” on it. I somehow missed the memo that the Show is essentially an echo dot with a screen, and you can only choose from the limited “Amazon Skills” selection from the Alexa app using voice control. *In full disclosure and “TMI”, I’m on a strict low-carb/ sugar-free diet - the native recipe skill is almost useless for me...* I know, I know, you can watch prime and other videos on it, but I have no idea why you would want to watch something on a 10” tabletop screen when your TV is 10x bigger, or on a tablet that's 50x thinner... There is almost zero personalization available and everything seems to be locked down. Heck, I can’t even select items or information (like 5-day weather, news, calendar) to display on the home screen. Unless I’m missing something here, looks like the whole operating system literally just runs off the voice-controlled “skills”. Out of curiosity, I went ahead and ordered the Fire HD 10” tablet with “Show Dock”, and I'm glad I did... With the Fire Tablet, I'm able to run the apps I like and it's completely mobile. I don't have the sound quality that the Show had, but this can easily be fixed with a nice Bluetooth speaker.",About as much functionality as an Echo Dot with a Screen...
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2018,Kenny,"Update (12/19/18): Today I tried watching some Youtube videos. I noticed within 5 minutes, the Echo would close the browser entirely and go back to the home screen. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I never owned an electronic device that pissed me off so much. I'm ready to make my own Youtube video (that you would have to watch on any other device except the Echo Show) of me shooting this piece of garbage and FINALLY getting some enjoyment out of it. Update (12/17/18): So I've had my Show for 2 months and I have to say that nothing really changed. It still remains an expensive disappointment. There has been an issue since the beginning where after watching so many videos on Prime Video, the show will no longer play videos until the device is restarted. My volume down and mute buttons are going to wear out from having restarted it so much. I have to do this about every 2 days. I know it needs to be restarted because when trying to play a video of any kind from any source, the Show will perform really slow and seem to load for a minute or two when selecting a video, then just back out and not play anything. This is kind of ridiculous. At the time of writing this, there is still no Netflix either. I see the Shows are sold out until after Christmas. I hope people aren't buying these as gifts or they're going to have some pretty disappointed spouse's/relatives. I previously wrote a review with more stars, but the more I use the Echo Show, The more i'm starting to dislike it. Watching the movies that you own on Prime Video is a nightmare. Once you get a movie or show playing, it works fine. But the voice commands to get certain movies to play is a nightmare. Name a certain movie and she will say it back wrong, or say she couldn't find it. Try saying play whatever from my library, and she thinks it's a skill. It's super frustrating. Have Alexa turn lights off during a movie and the movie pauses for about a minute so it can show you a toggle button for you lights. Pause a movie? it'll stay paused for about a minute, then go to the home screen, to which there is no ""resume"" or ""continue movie"" command. You have to tell her to play whatever show or movie again. I bought this to replace an old Samsung tablet that I had on my desk to watch Youtube or Netflix while doing other things. I miss those days to be completely honest. I should have stuck with the regular screenless Echo that I had.","Sound is impressive, that's about it"

Our household uses the devices on a daily basis. I was pretty excited about the possibility of the Echo show. We could use it in the kitchen for the family calendar! Or for recipes! Or maybe to watch a show! Oh the possibilities! We bought their 2 for $120 off deal black Friday 2018. I was intending on giving one of the units to the in-laws for Christmas and putting the other in our kitchen. The in-laws were wanting something that showed a nice big clock with the date and day of the week (among other things). I figured that the show would definitely be able to do that! Turns out I was sorely mistaken. The clock is a small little thing in the top corner that is not customizable at all. No date, no day of the week. But hey, at least it has a calendar right?.. that is essentially useless. It only shows one or two days, or not even a day if you have multiple things on the calendar. It doesn't even highlight what the current day it is! There is no monthly or weekly view, just a extremely zoomed in view of 1 or two appointments. There is no option to customize anything. You get what you get. Why would you have a calendar without a week/month view? We also were thinking it would be great for recipes. Turns out that because I'm in Canada, close to none of the 'standard' skills even work. Amazon has geolocked the recipes skill!?!? Ok, so no problem we can't use the recipes skill that is advertised clearly on the side of the box. I'll get over that and use the browser to show a recipe. So, I opened up the browser to a recipe site and started cooking dinner. After a couple minutes, the device times out and returns to the home screen! ""Alexa, reopen my browser"" should get me back to the page I was on right? No! It takes me back to the home page and I have to navigate to the recipe again. Rinse and repeat every two minutes until I give up and open up a physical cookbook. EVERYTHING that I wanted to do with this device doesn't work. No clock, no calendar, no recipies, no netflix, no <insert whatever you think it will do here>. I'm sure that all these things will all get addressed in time,but right now it really falls short. I gave this 3 stars because the actual physical product is excellent. Quality is great, speakers sound really good, screen is bright. I have no complaints about anything physical on the device. It really is a very nice physical product, but the firmware is close to completely useless for anything that I want to do with it. I will most likely return the units I bought. Maybe I'll buy them again once they have addressed some of the things that would actually make this useful.",So much potential... but completely uncustomizable.

Also, i decided to move all of my photos and music to amazon so that it was all in one place. After a 40 minute phone call with customer service, i learned that you are now unable to upload any music bought on any other platform to amazon music. So I have amazon music unlimited but they are still asking me to pay for music that i have previously purchased. This is very upsetting. Also, supposedly you get unlimited photos being a prime member but as i was uploading my photos......all of a sudden i was told that i was out of space and had to pay more to store and backup my photos.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2018,William Stevens,"20181108: I bought two new Echo Shows several days ago, one at home, one for the office. The good stuff: 1. Easy to set up. I had the Show up and functional in under 15 minutes. It was already registered to me, all I had to do was rename it (based on the room I placed it in). Downloading the Alexa iPhone app made setup even easier. Within about 30 minutes I had most of the home smart devices connected, included Nest devices and the SmartThings hub. 2. Good sound. I don't think it will compete with a Sonos or the new Apple Homepod, but the sound is good, and for most applications, more than good enough. 3. Very nice to have the calendar and other life-organizing items pulled in from Google and other sources to show on the screen. 4. Does a nice job showing recipes. 5. It will read your kindle books to you. The bad stuff: 1. Alexa doesn't handle names very well. And, if you have names in SmartThings that weren't fully thought out, you may run into a few problems. To clean up the labels for a voice-activated environment, I had to carefully rename a number of items and groups, ensuring that no words overlapped. That can be a challenge with multiple Hue lamps and other smart devices in the same room. Naming the lamps kitchen 1, kitchen 2, and kitchen 3 works great, until you also want a group called Kitchen Lights.... Same for the porch lights, and so on. In the end, I've renamed almost every device with some name that is not directly overlapping with the group I want it in (usually a group will be a room). 2. The device sits with the screen, and the camera, at an angle. This is OK if you are reading a list, but not so great if you want to use DropIn either as an intercom, or to check on your home while you are away. As I mentioned in my Echo Spot review, mostly you get a great view of the ceiling. For the hefty price take (about $220) the device should allow adjustment of the camera angle. 3. The unit is made to sit on a surface, a shelf or a counter. It would be great to be able to wall mount it, but that won't happen without some special hardware. One other item to discuss: all Alexa devices require a login. You can login with the same account on all of them, which solves some problems, but causes others. I have a wife and two kids. Alexa assumes everyone is me, because I logged in with my Amazon account on all the devices. So? It means the reminders are mine, the alarms are mine, the calendars are mine... all my stuff on every device. Amazon, if you really want to make Alexa useful, you need to make Alexa family-aware. If my son updates the calendar on the Spot in his room, it should stay with him, and he doesn't need to know about my appointments. The Echo Show in the kitchen is a community device for the entire house, but the Spot or Dot on the nightstand should be much more personal, especially for alarms and calendars. And Drop In should work for all the devices, no matter who the device is personalized for.","I nice-to-have item, but it needs more work"

The (big) show was installed in my 87 yr old mothers home. She has advanced arthritis in her hand, is totally deaf in one ear & can’t hear out of the other. She also suffers from cataracts so her vision is less than ideal. To try and communicate via telephone is extremely difficult. Her landline is almost useless. She cant see god enough to use a smartphone so we’re left with a poor quality flip phone with a really weak speaker. Since installing the Show gen 2 in her home it’s changed her life for the better, it really truly has. The sound is so bold & clear that she has no problems at all hearing calls. The touch screen is very sensitive, just a light touch make the selection. My mom is very picky and normally resistant to change and was suspicious of this new technology. She really likes her new (video phone) it’s won her over. It’s big & loud & intuitive. I  now have no problem communicating  with her several times a day using the two Show 5s I purchased.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Nov 2018,My Public Name,"It set itself up. Honestly, it knew which WiFi network to use and the password (assume Amazon has it stashed in the cloud somewhere under my name). So that was nice. Watching Prime video works fairly well, but it can be hard to get exactly what  you want without interacting with the touch screen (or possibly the remote, haven't tried that for anything but volume). On some shows and movies, it insists on bringing up a list of episodes, which can be scrolled through by intoning ""next"" and ""previous"" over and over. Other content plays immediately, picking up wherever I left off. Hooked up Hulu as well, and telling the thing to ""watch Seinfeld"" worked automatically, bypassing Amazon Video where I don't have the rights. It picked up where I last left off and was able to advance episodes with ""next episode"", but ""previous episode"" unceremoniously dumped me on a Hulu list. Saying ""next episode"" on last episode put on to another series that is apparently part of ""My Stuff"" on Hulu. Added the Echo Recast for off-the-air, which also works fairly well, but oddly enough it tries to launch Hulu to watch CBS. That doesn't work as I don't have Hulu Live. Oddly, NBC loads right up and ABC presents a poser: use Recast or Hulu. Telling it ""1"" for Recast works, but it would be nice if it would remember such decisions (with an interface to reset defaults). Using the ""channel guide"" command shows all of the expected channels (including CBS), so it's a bit of a mystery as to why it thinks CBS is only available on Hulu. As for YouTube, the first command I tried was ""watch cat videos"" to see how bad the YT experience would be (thanks to a feud between Google and Amazon). Should have realized that the command didn't invoke YT at all. Later on asking for YT content, I was asked to choose between Silk or Firefox browsers. Choosing the former allowed for using YT through the touch screen. Suspect content integration is non-existent, though it should be able to at least search. Haven't bothered as YT is mostly a waste of time anyway. Interfaces with the usual Alexa suspects of shopping (of course), checking the calendar, managing lists, setting alarms and timers, listening to music (now with lyrics), reading Kindle books, etc. are enhanced considerably by the screen. Phone calls worked as expected with an added visual interface; same for home automation. However, it seems that most 3rd party skills do not take advantage of the screen. Speaking of home automation, I don't see a visual interface for setting scenes, but suspect they will work through voice. No sign of notifications. Every other Alexa device I have lights up and beeps to indicate a new message. Would seem like a no-brainer to put these on the screen. Or perhaps the rotating display on the home screen covers these sorts of missives (mostly shopping related). Sound is great, video looks great as well (though 720p I think). Certainly this is the best alarm clock ever.",Nice smart display with some bugs to shake out

Love the big bright and quality screen. While the sound is not quite has good as our HK's, it's still very nice and this thing gets pretty loud. Also love the drop in feature to have video from/to other show units, can see using this more in the future. Plus once we get camera's, it will just be better. Set up was simple, just follow the steps on the screen. It does take some time to update and ""optimize"", but once it's done, it's done. I agree the constant tips, while nice sometimes, do get old after as while. The only issue I have is the stupid lack of interaction for youtube and netflix. Funny this comes bundled with Hulu, but NOT netflix or youtube.  Gee, wonder why. These days it should! The Hulu integration works so well, it should be the same for netflix. I read a questions one one asked about netflix and I can't believe all the negative, snarky and crappy comments. Seriously? This is a big screen, many people will put it in the kitchen (as we did) and many people spend some time in their kitchen (as we do), so some will want to watch Netflix or youtube. I am just so tired of all these tiff's between these big companies. Get over yourself, the ONLY ones that are losing out or being inconvenienced is the CONSUMER. Shame on you. Maybe some day, Google, Walmart, Netflix or Amazon will be the bigger person and think about what matters most, the consumer. Okay rant over. Over all, very happy with the unit.","Love it for the most part, one rant"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2018,R Young,"I already had an Echo Dot in my kitchen, but I thought the Echo Show would be nice to have in there so I could see timers, watch some videos, see recipes and I liked that it could act as a digital photo frame as well. The original show was pretty dated looking so I skipped it, but the (2nd gen) Echo Show looks so much better. Software: This is the biggest problem with the Echo Show so I'm leading with it. The software is really designed poorly. If it has a huge 10"" touch screen, why not design the software to let you use touch AND voice. Want to go to a website? You can't just click on a browser, you have to ask it to ""Open Firefox"" or ""Open Silk"". Want to quickly pull up a list of your timers currently running? You can't, you have to ask it. Want to search from a Prime Movie to watch while cooking? You have to do it with your voice and it's very cumbersome. If you're watching a video and want to set a timer, it closes out the video. When a timer is running, it's not always displayed, so you are left wondering how much time is left and have to ask her. When you use it as a photo frame (using the Prime Photos app on your phone or computer)  the photo you use is muted (no where near as nice looking as it is on the Google Home Hub) and it's constantly you to ""Try asking Alexa to...."". The whole thing is really poorly designed from a visual perspective. Thankfully that can be solved with software updates if Amazon tries. Display: The screen is beautiful and viewable from anywhere in the room. I find it to be a good size, in fact, it was one of the reasons I didn't go with the Google Home Hub. With a 7"" screen, that was just too small to be useful. Sound: It's a huge upgrade from my Echo Dot. It has a nice full sound and I rarely have the volume over 40%. Voice Control: It does a great job at hearing the call phrase ""Alexa"" from anywhere in the room and even in adjacent rooms Overall, it's a good device with a lot of potential. Hardware-wise, it's top notch. Beautiful display, great sound, fits in well in a kitchen. The software is just lacking. You have to wonder if the people who designed it ever tried to use it on a regular basis. Hopefully they'll address those in future software updates.","Great display, great sound quality, pretty mediocre software / features"

Sound quality on the 2nd Gen, superior - you might not even miss a Sonos Play One (which I also have for my TVs) and this has an excellent screen.  Sound quality on Show 5, far better than the Spot. Screens on both devices far more useful than their predecessors.  If you are trading in Spots, be aware that the Amazon base for the Spot will work perfectly on the Show 5.  Saved us $20 x 2!  Base is highly recommended if using for a nightstand clock unless your nightstand is lower than your viewing angle.  Ability to have large clock on Show 5 is excellent for trying to view without the glasses at night.  FAILURE to allow for a large clock on the 2nd Gen - for instance if using for a kitchen clock with photo background like the Show 5 has - inexcusable at almost 3x the price.  Fix this Amazon.  Clock on the 2nd Gen is unreadable across a large room which is a complete waste of that beautiful new large screen.  I would like to have a slide show background behind a large analog clock, for instance.  Perfect for the kitchen or family room. Show 5 has a clock shutter - great for a bedroom clock.  2nd Gen is missing a clock shutter.  Why?  If you are setting the 2nd Gen on a shelf - in a family room for instance - be aware that if you intend to do video dropins you will need a base to lower the angle unless you like looking at the ceiling.  The angle on these was designed for standing at the kitchen counter (just as long as you don't care that you can't see the clock) or sitting bolt upright at a desk with the device in front of you at arm's length.  Any other height/angle combinations and you are going to need the base to get a proper view of the room.  These devices are vast improvements over their predecessors - but - several missed opportunities for simple softrware value adds. Glad to own these, but waiting anxiously for software fixes for some obvious misses on the 2nd Gen.  The top of the line should have ALL of the features of the lesser devices available, not a subset of the Show 5.  Amazon wrongly assumed that people would want a giant clock on a small screen but would have no use at all for a giant clock on a large screen .  The great sound from the new speakers will soothe me while I wait for the software fix.",2nd Gen - If only the software lived up to the screen and speakers...

All that is great, you can turn things on and off, but with the exception of the Ring video, not much needs the beautiful screen.

I assumed it would be nice to choose photos to show her while also having a somewhat automated video chat option she didn't have to learn to use. Simple solvable software choices made by Amazon make this desire impossible Before this purchase I'd been an avid regular Echo user, I have one if every room of my home with all my lights, music and other electronics fully controlled by voice and found it convenient to reorder items. However, the words showing up on the echo show telling users what to try have completely ruined the opportunity to use this device as I describe above. My grandmother regularly becomes confused and aggravated after having been prompted to do stupid things (""Try, 'Echo' play Seinfeld on Hulu"" prompting her to sign up for the service) or emotionally irresponsible things (""Try, 'Echo' call Mom?"" which prompted me to have to explain to her that infact her mother had died years ago, again.) It is stupid that I have to leave an emotional review about this, there should be a menu option to remove text prompts, the online forums are full of this complaint but Amazon is too busy abusive warehouse workers and monopolizing cloud storage for all mainstream internet use.","Try ""Echo, stop telling me what to try!"""
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 May 2019,Adam,"I've had the Echo Show for a month now and there are things I like which are pretty much the things I like about any Echo device (I have 4 now). I like being able to access Apple Music from almost any room in the house and listen to almost any song I can think of. I had hoped the Echo Show would be the same for video. Sadly no. I replaced the Echo in my kitchen with the Show. I wanted to be able to watch the news or a TV show while cooking which is something I love to do. A glass of red wine, watching a dumb action movie and making a nice dinner is my idea of heaven. Unfortunately, beyond the limitations of only having easy access to Prime video and Hulu (you can access YouTube and Netflix more manually), the real problem is the impreciseness of the voice controls. I've spent the last 15 minutes trying to figure out how to watch Season 4 of the Vikings on my Echo Show. Hulu has it, but everytime I ask to watch, ""Vikings Season 4, episode 1"" the Show brings up the correct search and offers to stream it through Prime or Hulu. Perfect, right? No, because although the search says Vikings Season 4, Episode 1 - if I select Hulu then I get Season 1, Episode 1. If I select Prime, I get the 1960's movie with Kurt Douglas (admittedly great but I've seen it a bunch). Herein lies the problem, I can't get to the content I want through the clumsy interface and simply opening Hulu ONLY shows a very limited selection of things to watch. 1st world problems, I know, but still. Basically, the Echo Show has me getting mad at Alexa all the time. The radio version of her is pretty smart.

I got it all customized to my liking.  Then when I went to listen to music, there was no sound.  I factory reset it and tried again.  No sound, even in the introductory video.  Contacted Amazon support and they decided it was defective and sent a replacement. Second unit arrived.  No sound.  Called support to try and return it.  I was connected to tech support who this time had me unplug the power cord from the back of the Echo Show and leave it unplugged for two minutes.  Afterwards, she had me plug it back in.  It now worked. I'm very happy with this device now, but have some serious concerns about its durability and longevity since it could not work right out of the box.  In addition, it lacks the privacy camera cover that the Echo Show 5 has.  For these reasons, minus two stars. All things considered, this sounds as about good as a very decent JBL speaker that was my previous favorite for music, and the screen is more vibrant than a Lenovo Smart Display.  I'm happy with my purchase assuming it doesn't need to be unplugged for 2 minutes every time I want to use it. Update:  After having this about a week, sound completely stopped.  I give up.  I'm not going to unplug this for two minutes every time I need to use it.  This thing is getting returned.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2019,Phil,"I have been using the 1st generation for almost a year.  This was on sale for a solid price.  I’ve been using echo devices since the first one came out in early 2016.  And it’s still in use over 3 years later. I really like this 2nd generation so far. The initial process to get it going took maybe 20 or so minutes because it had updates. What do I like about this over the 1st generation? Here is a few things: 1.  The sound.  The sound is a lot more fuller for the room that it’s in.  The bass is substantially better.  It fills the room with plentiful sound. I live in a attached home and probably wouldn’t put it past 40 percent or so.  The thing Gets LOUD. 2.  The screen. It’s about 3 inches bigger than the first gen. And it’s way more vibrant.  Although my ring camera footage is a bit grainy to be honest. I feel like it might be a bit better on the 1st gen.  But most things the extra real estate really helps.  If you have weak vision like I do, it really helps you see the screen from the other side of the room. 3. Most of the Same features in a bigger form factor. Still has the same home screen as the 1st gen.  I have always enjoyed the home screen.  I look at the days headlines as well as the time and current temperature.  I have a smart home I guess you can say.  I like that I can check my Ring cameras and get a visual view of the current brightness on my Hue light bulbs.  Initially I was hesitant about getting one with the screen, but I really do love it.  Also things like song lyrics and answers to questions give you something visual to look at rather than just hearing it I noticed that this uses about 30 or so percent more power.  Echo show 1st gen has a 21W AC adapter and this 2nd gen uses 30W.  But if you factor in the extra 3 or so inches for the screen,  the 9 watt increase seems about right. So that’s just a few things that I have observed.  I will try to update my review over time. Personally I probably wouldn’t of bought it at MSRP price.  Echo devices drop in price pretty quick. The lower price point influenced my decision.  Lastly,  I will continue to use my Older Echo devices because they seem to last a while.  They just don’t go bad after a year or so. Overall good buy for me. 2nd generation has improved on several things for sure.",Good at sale prices

Ordered it by voice yesterday (20 Nov 18) and got it on my door next day in less than 20 hours, thanks prime. Took about 10 min to do updates and everything and since I already have a Alexa account for my other devices it was preregistered and automatically connected to internet. The sound is amazing the attached video doesn’t do it justice. It has a pretty good sound wilder and IF you open a new card it’s 70 dollars off with a gift card so affectively after taxes I only paid 119 for it. You have to order by voice to get the early Black Friday price plus 10 dollars off first Alexa voice purchase then that’s how u get that 119 price line. Either way love it so far. Works perfectly with my nest camera. Takes no longer than the nest app to open up and show me on the screen. Sound wise I’d say it could used some extra power in the mid range but still a very powerful speaker. That’s all based on the past hour playing with it.","Great speaker, great smart display."

My wife of 36 years, and I love music, and we banter back and forth on things as we prepare dinner. I thought, Hey, an echo show would be fun........ Wrong! The first one I received didn't have any sound. I got tech support on the phone ( now that's funny) and they said ""the speaker isn't working"" I said ....Really? So they ship out another and it has the very same problem. Yes the very same issue. However, I was able to fix the problem by unplugging the unit, and plugging it back in. Yup that was it. unplug, replug. Now this happened while the SECOND tech support person was on the line with me. She says, : oh yeah, that's what I was going to have you do"".  NO she never mentioned that, and didn't even know I did it until there was sound coming from the unit. My point is this. I spent 250 dollars on the unit 128 dollars for Prime, 8 dollars for music. and wasted 3 hours of my time on two different nights sorting this out. GO WITH the Google home. I should have. and no I'm not associated with Google at all. I do not recommend you purchase this unit. It really, in the end, isn't worth it. I was excited to get one and all that excitement is now GONE! I really haven't used it since the first night. Don't really want to. If you want to buy it off me I'd be glad to get rid of it.

The Show lacks no built-in wallpaper or background choices like the Spot does, no color adjustment for the standby clock. The ""Try Alexa"" messages at the bottom of the screen are shown no matter what you are looking at on the screen.

Bass is fluttery, grumbling at medium volume. Far from ""Premium Sound"". Video is excellent. Notations starting with ""Try''.... are in such small print that you need to be sitting within arms reach to read easily.

There is a way to disable/enable the camera without disabling Alexa's monitoring ability.... just ask.

The main issue, as others have mentioned, is that the home screen constantly has “Try X” recommendations that cannot be turned off.  I bought the Show with the understanding these could be turned off.  It sounds like there were some workarounds in the past and/or for other Show devices, but none of those work anymore (as of December 2019).  I wanted to use the Show mainly as a digital picture frame, but having constant recommendations was too much to put up with.  It seems Amazon is either getting a kickback by promoting certain things (no, I do not want to try watching The Voice on Hulu), or they are incomprehensibly out of touch with what their customers want in a user experience or simply do not care. Aside from that (huge for me) deal breaker, there was an overall lack of customizability.  No ability to change the clock size etc.  All this is super frustrating because the screen and speakers are both really rather impressive.  Music sounded great and photos looked nice.  Alas, I’ll stick with using Alexa without a screen foreseeable future.","Good hardware, Bad software"

The reason is to be able to fall asleep to shows I already know (basically, bore myself to sleep) and that would not have a lot of flickering light levels.  I have and echo show 1 which would --after all kinds of machinations---allow me to get to prime television,  and would automatically take you to something, but not anything you asked for.  Then you can try to back out and get to what you want. I wanted Murder, She Wrote, for example.  It just kept saying it could not find it.  If you could get to something you wanted, it would boot you out after a short while. So I decided to get the Echo Show 2.  Same thing! I finally called support since this is the same behavior my echo show 1 was exhibiting so I figured software, not hardware.  I spent a long time on the phone, and the fellow finally agreed that these just don't work for what I want  it for. He could not get the machine at his premises to do anything I was asking. He thought it might be the comma in the tv show title. He said he would do a write up on it and someone should be in touch with me when solved.  After a couple of weeks I just returned it since I heard nothing. The good news is, this was a refurb and it DID include the power cord that many said were missing from their refurbished purchase.

I want to like it but the primary reason I purchased was to watch shows from Hulu while I work in the kitchen and you cannot chose a specific season/episode.  It just plays whatever it wants.  There's no way to select it on the screen and after opening Hulu you can't tell it to ""Play season 2 episode 10 of ......"".  It just plays the first episode of a season.  If you tell it to play the next episode it just restarts the episode your on.  Seems a tablet may be better suited for my needs but then Amazon shouldn't advertise that it works with Hulu.  I also don't like that you cannot turn off the suggestions on the screen so when you have photos as your background there's always text across them.  Makes me feel like I paid to advertise for Amazon in my home.  A lot of the skills need much more fine tuning to be user friendly.  For example Ring has a skill so I can see who's at my front door on the device but it takes several seconds to connect as it connects through the website.  By that time I've already gone to answer it or pulled it up on my phone much quicker.  It does have great sound though and picture quality but I don't think that makes up for the lack of being user friendly.",Horrible with Hulu

This version does not have the slide button to shut off the camera.  It's a command in the settings.  I prefer the button on the top of the 5"" Show that allows me to block the camera whenever I want to do that.

There are several discussion areas on the internet that address this issue, and it may start cropping up in 2nd generation Shows as well. This defect appeared in my 1st generation Show about six months after purchase. What happens is that a loud click or pop can be heard when the audio activates. Ask Alexa a question and you hear a pop before and immediately after the response. Play music or a podcast or any audio/video source, and within 5 minutes of starting, sometimes earlier, the pop/click appears randomly, though as the video clip shows it occurs on average about every 10 seconds while there is an audio source. You can avoid this distraction by using a bluetooth speaker, but my point of contention is that this is a defect that has not been addressed by the manufacturer. I purchased a 2nd generation Show before this issue cropped up with my 1st generation one so I can only hope that the defect has been addressed in the 2nd generation.

Snyder,"This is my second Echo Show, and the second one that does not work right. Bottom line up front: No sound comes out of this one, and yes, the volume is up and I've tried completely resetting it. I had the 1st-generation Echo Show, and its screen wavered and flickered incessantly (but unfortunately, that problem did not show up until after 30 days). I sent it back to be fixed, but all the ""genius"" Amazon techs did was reset it...which worked for about 30 minutes. Good job, Amazon techs! Now this second one, a 2nd generation, doesn't work out of the box. Alexa acts like it's working. In other words, if you ask for the forecast, it'll show up as text on screen but there is no acknowledgement or sound. If you ask it to play music, the scroll bar will appear and be moving (and if she knows the lyrics, they'll display on the screen), but again, no sound. Yes the volume is up, and I've tried unplugging and replugging, and a factory reset. (As a technical-type person, I can already tell you that the odds that a factory reset would fix this issue—or the earlier one with the flickering screen—asymptotically approach zero. That is, Amazon is just wasting your time when they recommend that for issues like this.) I would not recommend an Echo Show to my worst enemy, although they might indeed make a great torture device. Summary: Do not buy! And avoid at all costs. Amazon simply does not know how to make reliable devices with screens. (I have a non-screen Echo, and it's worked fine for years.)

The Echo Plus has some great sound quality don't get me wrong, but the Show definitely is the better sounding system.  Adding this bad boy to our inventory of Echo devices was a great choice. You should do the same. Enjoy.",Amazing sound from the new Echo Show!
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2019,B.A.,"Lots to like about this product: 1 Good HD Resolution, good color. 2. Automatically gets dimmer for sleeping, well implemented. 3. Great sound for such a small bedside table device, however, not as good as a high quality soundbar which you can connect too via bluetooth, so echo dot + soundbar actually better. 4. Good video playback, but appears to require a subscription to prime video. 5. Integrates well with Ring devices.  This is the reason for my purchase.  I tell my device to ""show me the back yard"" (or any other named camera) and it does, with a larger and better, and generally faster view than the Ring app on my cell phone.  This is probably reason enough to purchase the item if you use the Ring system and cameras.  It appears you can do two way audio from and to the cameras. 6. Nothing from Google (say Youtube) is available directly, however, you can ask alexa to ""open google', at that point you can access your email, youtube, and all other google services via the built in Firefox browser. No other streaming appears available without additional cost. 1. The biggest irritation for me, and one that could be easily fixed (and would probably result in a 5* review if it was fixed): On the bottom of the home screen, below the nice nature shot you have posted from your camera, the device insists on showing you every minute or so, something new you can try with your echo show.  Try x, y, or z.  This is incredibly irritating after awhile, especially, if you are not particularly interested... AND THIS CANNOT BE TURNED OFF according to Amazon support.  For a supposedly ""customer centric company"", very bad behavior.  Force your customers to watch a commercial on the device they have purchased every minute or so. The only way I have found to turn this off is to tell the device to ""turn off the display"".  This works until something alerts it and it comes back on again, and the ""try x, y or z"" begins again. However, you can train your self to ignore these messages, and eventually the home screen will time out, showing only a grey background with the time. The device does so many things well, or reasonably well, I could not give it less than 4* even with this irritating behavior. Review update:  This thing has grown on me with use.  Rating change 4* - > 5*. Seems to be a very well made quality item.  Functions well, particularly with Ring camera system.  Can look through any camera by voice command. Pandora music displays album cover, and progress bar.  A CD without having to take care of the CD. Fidelity is good, but better if tied to quality sound bar via blutooth. Can view email by saying ""open google"", then selecting gmail or news or whatever from the google menu.  Can respond to email, but difficult to forward to third parties, this needs improvement. Very pleased with the device... have even trained myself to ignore the small print suggestions on the home screen that cannot be turned off.  Occasionally, prompts me to try something interesting. Thank you, Jeff.  Nice product.",Quality Product with some VERY irritating behavior which cannot be turned off...

Upgrade Pros: - Sound Quality - Bigger Screen Outside of those two factors regards the Echo Show 2 I don’t see any further justification that would fall into upgrading your original Show to the Echo Show 2. I did not see much a a listening skill improvement as sometimes I have to speak up to get Alexa to listen.  I did get a lot more of “sorry, which device?” From Alexa when both Shows connected and yes they were of different rooms.  I also have the Echo as well 2nd gen.  I had issues with some skill sets built in with New Echo making connection or recognizing the demand..  Such as Apple Music , in which works perfect with my original Show but after connecting both, it seemed that I was consistently receiving the quote “ I cannot play Apple Music at this time” a lot. So I asked myself is it worth just to upgrade to a tablet size screen? (The Show 2 is literally twice the size screen of the original Show) Only thought of consideration for that would be to access view of security cameras, but even on that note, I have two IPads at 10 & 12” for that, so that was crossed off. Lastly the sound, only real advantage here is if you don’t have a sound system or a sound bar then yes this would be ideal for you.  Being that is not the case for me as I do have a soundbar, that was the last advantage that was removed in my book from keeping device and of course the device issues contributed the most to me overall to me.  It also take up quite some space as the back end of it extends quite a bit due to most likely its hefty speaker.",Review Based On If You Are A Echo Show 1st Edition Owner..
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jan 2019,Jorge,"Just terrible. The Echo Show is so limited. Could be great in a few years but I’m not willing to wait because it’s TERRIBLE RIGHT NOW. Let’s start with what it CANNOT do. Can’t play: YouTube or Netflix. Doesn’t search: you can ask it questions but it won’t know 90% of them AND it won’t search it on bing. So the ad that Amazon shows saying “Alexa show me a recipe” is FALSE. You can’t manually type in searches either. Partial capabilities: Searching, some apps let you search. Let’s start with Hulu. You can bring up Hulu but won’t have the option from the home screen to search on Hulu. You’ll have to find the right verbal request that’ll allow you to drag the endless screen for what you want. Example: I wanted to watch the current season of South Park. Me: “Alexa play South Park season 22 episode 1.” Alexa: “here is South Park season 1 episode 1.” This happened every time! I had to have it bring up the South Park page then scroll to the episode I wanted. 22 seasons of scrolling took so long! Let’s talk about the touch screen! THE NON RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN! I practically had to punch the thing to get it to react to my haptics. Am I supposed to double PUSH to get a video to play? Or pause? Don’t even try to drag the progress bar to rewind advance an episode or song, just accept your fate and play from where you’re at or start over. I can complain about so many more first world problems here, but it’s not worth my time or yours. Pass on this and get a tablet.",NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. Limitations abound.

I stick with my 2-star rating but this is relative to the 10"" Fire tablet and price. The Show 2 is not bad and I get it that there are niche uses.  Unfortunately, those niches are not for me. IMHO the Show should run Android and not this experimental and buggy funny interface. Even if I liked this funny interface, it is also available on the tablet. I like an Echo Dot with a screen (=Echo Spot). Amongst others I can travel with it and easily change the WiFi. Can I travel with the Show? Possibly but ... It does, what it does and it is not bad except that the current software has issues. I cannot play Prime movies. Sound is worse than my $50 bluetooth soundbar. Screen is just 720p. Why, please why does this thing even exist? I mean, for that price Amazon could have taken the 10"" Amazon Fire tablet hardware and pug into the speakers of the Show. And please: what is Amazon thinking? Another proprietary power plug? How about USB C? No, the Show is not bad. It just misses the point (for me).",Something is missing for the price

I have a Fire Tablet which I use for movies and music and when I pair with my soundbar it is perfect.  Whenever I pair the Echo Show with the soundbar it continues to cut out frequently.  I had the same problem with my first gen Echo Show but not this bad.  I had to go back to using my regular Echo with the soundbar to get a good sound again. Whatever technology they installed in the Fire tablet and the Echo I wish they would pass on the Echo Shows because it just does not work.  My whole house runs on Alexa including thermostat, sprinklers, lights, etc. so I love the overall product - just not the Bluetooth so I can not fully recommend you buy it unless Bluetooth is not important, then it is superior in every other way.",Nice upgrade but Bluetooth connection sucks

This thing should be able to do everything the fire tv can... you cant even shop on amazon with it normally. you get some weirdly watered down version of everything.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 May 2019,Rosieminnie,"I am an Amazon Echo fanatic. From that very first Echo speaker tryout invitation to the 1st generation Echo show, I fell in love with Alexa products. So, when they announced a larger screen Echo Show, I pre-ordered like most people. I have had the product for a while now, and I must say that I am a bit disappointed. Cons The problems with the video feature. First --- Alexa voice recognition on that is lacking. It takes more than one try to get the right video to play. I never had that issue with the first generation Echo Show. Second --- Alexa does not pause or stop the video on command. I have tried several commands such as “Alexa, Pause!”, “Alexa, Pause the video!”, “Alexa, Stop!”, “Alexa, stop the video!.” The only thing that works is to command Alexa to play a song, then command it to stop the song. I wrote Amazon about this and never got an answer. I am not sure why, Amazon used to be so good at answering those questions, but this time around, I got no help. Third --- Alexa does not pick up where you left off. When I get up and use the screen to pause a video when I come back the entire video is gone, and the screen is back to normal. I then have to ask Alexa to play the video again. This would not have been a problem, but if it is a show that you are re-watching, you have to remember the specific season and episode you were watching to ask Alexa to play for you. It is a frustrating issue and still need improvement. Pro I love the sound system. I know that at the beginning people were complaining, I guess I lucked out because I never had an issue with the sound of the Echo show. I never go higher than volume 5 because I tried volume 10 once and it gets really loud. If a song with bass is playing, you can hear the bass super clear. Alexa can respond well to many commands as its past contender. It can show you what you need to see or read it to you. I do not use the Audiobook feature because I do not like audiobooks. However, I did ask it to read me a book to see if it works. Alexa can only read you specific books. You must give it the title of the book in order for it to work. There are skills available for children that can select more random books. I have tried the Amazon Storytime feature, and it can read you random bedtime stories, which is cool. I wish there were one for adults, that can just read random books as asked but that just me being picky. I love the fabric cover of the New Echo Show. My very first Echo show, I had to buy a cover to prevent it from being scratched and looking worn. The new fabric feature is perfect and easier to clean. Overall, despite the drawbacks of the video feature, I will highly recommend the Echo Show 2. I use it often and still watch some shows and newsreel on it. I am sure, as past experiences have shown, that Amazon will soon correct those issue with the Echo. So, don't be afraid to invest in one.",Expected Better

Alexy,"I, like many other reviewers, bought this because I work at home and wanted a hands-free entertainment device so I'm not delayed from things.  The video streaming commands are beyond frustrating.  I constantly have it not play things I'm requesting.  It won't pause by verbal command.  When you do pause it, if you have to do something longer than 2 minutes it closes the entire program and you have to find the episode you were watching again.  Alexa's voice is insanely loud and I can't adjust it... so after my son goes to bed I can't use it because it's so loud I don't want to wake him up since my office is right off his bedroom.  I constantly have issues with the touch screen not doing what I'm telling it to do (such as pressing play).

I've placed it on Facebook Marketplace to get some semblance of money back for it as it's utter garbage and after a couple hours on the phone with offshore representatives who pretend to be sympathetic to my issue and keep transferring me I'm simply done.

It is distracting and useless. I would not have bought the Show if I had known about it in advance. It is like having a TV constantly display messages for you to try some product or another.

First - Although it shows the time on the wallpaper screen, it does not show the day and date like almost every smart watch in the world. How hard would it be to include the day and date? Consequently I have to ask it many times every day to tell me the day and date. Old age is a bitch. Second - This is an Amazon problem, there is no way to contact Amazon about wish list features -- not just for the Echo but for anything.

The majority of all functions will only give you an audio response only, even if there easy to find corresponding video available from the same sources the Echo Show is pulling from -- news briefing from different media outlets, as an example.  For video streaming, the big players either aren't available or require jumping through several hoops in order to get them to function. If you'd like to utilize the device as a digital picture frame, you're able to use Amazon Photo -- a thing no actually uses as far as I can tell -- but unable to link the device to any image services or accounts which people actually use. Most of my gripes there aren't necessarily Amazon's fault as other companies are certainly under no obligation to create skills linking to their services for the Echo Show, particularly when many of them are direct competitors of Amazon and their services. It's unfortunate and frustrating, but it is what it is. My main complaint is one which Amazon has no one to point a finger at but itself: The screen is 10"" worth of unused space 90% of the time, with only 1/12 of the area being used to display the sort of information you'd want at a glance on an always-on display. It shows you the current time and temperature, but there is currently no way to customize or add additional information. Not the current day or date, upcoming scheduled appointments, particular stocks, moon cycle or whatever other info you might want at a glance. To repeat, this $230 always-on display does not allow you to have the current day or date displayed. You need to ask Alexa to tell you this information. There is less information display on a 10"" display than what is offered on the ~1"" screen of you smartwatch of choice. There is no way to customize this information. This is less functionality than your average digital clock. To add insult to injury, apparently the ability to display the current day and date IS available on the Echo Spot for $100 less. This may seem to a minor issue, and largely I think it is. But it speaks to the sort of decisions -- or lack thereof -- being made with this device as a whole. Amazon hit gold with the original Echo and decided to slap a screen on it, but don't seem to know what to do with the screen, even when it comes down to the most basic functionality. If these sort of things are added in a future update, I will happily change this review.",Wasted Potential

One for me the other for my elderly parents.  Echo Show has provided me with peace of mind and made caring for my elderly parents so much easier.

Another time saving feature is the ability for my Mother to create a shopping list.  I can access her list and pick up groceries or whatever else they need without having to make a phone call and write everything down.  Many other features such as reminders, timers, memory skills, music, hand free phone calls and much more have given me reason to appreciate how much Echo Show has improved my position and duty to care for my parents.

It is hefty and build quality is solid. The 1st gen sitting next to it is dwarfed in comparison. It was easy to set up, just like the 1st gen. I'm hoping it doesn't develop the same annoying popping sounds that my 1st gen suffered from because it looks great on my desk and works seamlessly with my apps. I was a little disappointed in the sound quality, however. Due to the fact that they moved the speakers to the sides instead of having them fire forward, it becomes necessary to pay more attention to where the unit is placed (i.e., you have to pay attention to objects around it and how that impacts the sound deflection.) I realize this was a design choice in order to maximize the screen, so that's the trade off.  This is my fifth Echo device. Each style (Dot, Tap, Show, etc.) has its place. Keep in mind, the 10 inch diagonal screen is contained in an 11 and one half inch frame. Take out a tape measure and be sure you have a place for something this big.

I bought the generation2 with hopes of it being better at hearing my voice from across the room. I have not found that to be the case. I have had the new show for about 3 months now and I love the new features with the new one. The screen is much better, as is the sound system. I bought the swivel stand and the screen protector and I am glad I did. Not that anything has happened to it, I have it sitting in my kitchen area and that is always a good idea to have as a safe guard for your Alexa device. Some of the key differences between the devices are the ability with version 2 to have a freetime, where you can restrict activity. Hunches is where you have a connected device that you think or have a ""hunch"" may have been left on too long, you can have Alexa check on it. One real feature I love is the Guard feature. Guard feature detects if your smoke or CO detectors goes off, if there is glass breakage, and can set away lighting. The Guard feature only notifies you if any of these occur it doesn't call authorities, that is left up to your security system. However, I like having the notifications coming to my phone so I can remember to us the drop in feature on Alexa to see what is going on. There are other version2 features but these are the 2 biggest new features that really make buying the new one worth the argument.

On major issue- major voice control quirks. I have to over enunciate to get it to work for nearly anything. I’ve given up on using it for my Phillips hue lights, it rarely works, and usually ends up asking me what I said multiple times. I have no accent, and my diction is clear, my career involved being heard by many over the radio, so I know that isn’t the issue. There is a 3 to 5 second delay anytime I tell it do view my nest  cameras, this is a dealbreaker, we had an intruder try to break in, and in that instance 4 seconds to identify the person smashing your front door feels much too long. I’m beginning to wonder if I’ve got a defective model, it seems to have gotten more quirky after a couple initial weeks of trouble free use. Drop in was a large percentage of why I bought this and the kid friendly module. That feature is a bust. We’ve got a spread out house, I’ve got to go through 3 security doors to tell the older kid to come to dinner. A voice activated PA sounded lovely. It. Doesn’t. Work. It is frustratingly slow, it squeals with feedback the entire time, and if he is listening to music, he seems unable to hear me at all. Sometimes I won’t disconnect, leaving me with dinner prep hands trying to get the squealing feedback to end. This feature is worthless. Note- returning device. Issues have gotten more prevalent. We watched videos on the amazing screen the first day, but that’s it. We should have gotten the google home hub for the best support and intuitive smart device controls. Lesson learned.","returned & purchased google home hub, all my frustrations/issues are gone now."

For the past few weeks it either gives me the wrong information, videos abruptly stop and it reverts back to the home screen saver, things that worked before on it don't now, or it will abruptly talk at least once almost every hour. I'm gonna start with the creepiest one, the fact that it talks. Once an hour, usually at night it will wake up and either say sorry I don't understand or something else without anyone near. We've had to unplug it at night so we won't get woken up. Secondly, videos just stop playing and it reverts back to the home screen. This is super annoying when I'm trying out a new recipe or trying to entertain my little one for a minute while I take care of dishes or something else. Next, I had synced my ring doorbell and nest cams up with it in the beginning and now it refuses to bring up video from either of them. And lastly, it is a pain trying to bring up anything because either the wrong thing is opened or it'll constantly say ""Sorry I don't understand"" or ""I didn't hear that."" To be sure that it's the device and not software, I had checked for updates, restored to factory defaults, and even unplugged the thing for hours hoping that any of those would fix it. Nothing works!!! It is so frustrating. If you get this device, please spring for the warranty because now I am out of the window for returning/replacing it, so I essentially have a large cumbersome paperweight.","I wanted to be happy about this product, but..."

My biggest complaint is that you cannot change the news that shows up. You can only turn it off. The news is nothing but propaganda. I tried talking with support about it, they kept offering ideas that did not resolve the issue at all. They don't even know how their own product works. On top of that, we have to constantly tell her ""Cancel"" because she thinks we're talking to her or get the response ""I can't do that right now"" on simple things like telling her to go to the home screen. I would say the processing power on it is terrible too. My kids like to watch music videos on it, but it's so slow to respond. And forget about wanting to watch any kind of shows. It's just too slow of a product to do that. Wish I never bought it. Best use I've found for it: Prop the ipad up on it. It's actually a very nice angle.

I feel the disappointment is so profound because I had great expectations. I received this for Christmas and got it all set up. I was very excited to see all the utility this thing could offer. Less than 48 hrs later it’s back in the box. It seems that they failed to account for the fact that users might want to restrict access from their children. In this digital age, that oversight is unacceptable. I simply could not believe there is no way to lock kids out of this thing, but after an hour utilizing amazon support, I had to accept this fact. No screen lock with pin or login required. Yes, you can require a pin for video from your amazon settings...BUT this will still allow videos that are rated for general audience. There is no “always require pin” option. This means Sesame Street and such playing any time. So unless you want to let your kids be on this thing all the time, or spend all of your time physically getting them away from it, I can’t recommend for any home with children.

The 1st gen software was upgraded to the same as the 2nd gen, so if you have the 1st, you won't need to upgrade to the 2nd to use the new software features unless.. you want the full screen and a much better sound experience. The 1st gen device configuration was very poor with its boxy appearance and annoyingly prominent speaker location.  The full screen presentation of the 2nd gen combined with the speaker moved to the rear is a winner and in my opinion, that alone is worth the upgrade but then I just like new electronics.  The 2nd gen device looks better on the counter, it's sharp and easier to see text from across the kitchen because the screen is larger. The software update also centered the announcements on the screen which adds to the new look and makes it easier to read on the larger screen.",Worth the Upgrade from 1st Gen

If I could I'd give it a 4.5 stars (4 stars for today, .5 stars because it has load of potential. Display: Excellent. It's big and I felt it was going to be too awkward at first because of the size but once I started using it the size of the display (and the unit) were more spot on. Interface: Good, customizable.  Scrolls information if you want and adjusts based on lighting and activity around it (i.e. turns off/dims when dark and not active). Can control quite a few things including lights from the interface and also does a great job with video and other media both with displays and control.  Alexa works well in displaying information in usable forms (lists, links, data, video clips, etc). While I can control lighting, I found Google Home hub has a better interface for controlling things; just easier to get to and very easy/quick to turn on and off things in the same room.  I have not used any of the video calling etc. but from what I've seen that's pretty solid. Sound: This thing sound great.  Full sound.  Not going to replace any high end systems for music or movies but it's good.  I tend to use it for audiobooks when I'm doing work around the house moreso than anything else and it's great for that. Amazon still hasn't integrated things like Ring into this as well as is should.  As a comparison, the Google Home Hub integrates excellent with Nest. Someone ring the nest doorbell and it immediately shows the camera, it very quick with accessing other cameras or the thermostat.  I think it will get there and when it does it potentially will be better as I think the hardware is better (faster, better display, etc).",Good with even better potential...

Sits in a dusty corner as an overpriced zwave hub. Touch screen still has almost zero uses. I would have liked if this thing could integrate into a security hub for Ring products with an always on video.... But no. Getting too a ring product takes ""yelling"" and spins for 30 seconds while your doorbell rings (on 1gb internet service). Just but an echo plus and skip the screen. They never figured out why they have a screen. Older review The touch screen is worthless. It physically works great, but software is built around voice interaction only. AMAZON MOST PEOPLE WILL WANT TO USE THIS AS A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE TO GET TO MUSIC, SMART HOME ACTIONS AND CAMERA APPS. Nope. Everything is done by voice. This big beautiful screen has no great way to touch your way to your music or videos, RING cameras, etc. Why is this a problem? Say someone is at your front door. Ring doorbell goes off. What does this device do? Nothing. Want to see it on that big screen? Then it is time to tell at Alexa to show the camera...so now the guy at the front door knows you are home. Yes you can set up a few quick touch shortcuts. But they are two screens into the program. Want to show multiple ring cameras at once....nope. Want it to show a camera when motion is detected....nope. Want to play a specific song on Spotify or Amazon music using the touch screen....nope. have to tell at it. If you already have music turned up, guess what, it can't hear you anyway. You will have your phone out to solve these issues using your Sonos or Bose or music player app. Seriously what is the point of this big beautiful screen on this device if the software is built to avoid you using it at all costs. Most people just want the home screen to be a few apps or triggers. Or maybe show an Amazon owned ring camera. If we could get this, it would change my opinion of this device. This fix is not hard.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2019,Ben,"For some background we have had a ring doorbell for a little bit now and an echo dot. This is important because while it's not hard to pull out your phone to check on your ring feed, having the show is faster to pull up your ring feed and why not view it on the big pretty show screen? The show can also control your whole smart home if you have more smart devices that you want to use it with. Now on to why I mentioned having the echo dot. While I love our echo Dot and it is not a subpar device in anyway (has awesome voice recognition and Spotify sounds very good on it) the sound on the show is so so much better. It puts out every tone and beat in the songs and it can get very loud. Crystal clear quality. However if your wanting to get this for the sole reason of watching your Netflix or HBO I would recommend just getting an HD10 or even an HD8. While it's not impossible to watch these services on the show, there's a few extra steps you have to go through. If your watching solely prime video stuff it's flawless. Just get both if you can afford it! I have an HD8 and we haven't gotten an Amazon device that disappointed us :) All in all, the show can do so much, big pretty 10 inch screen, and the sound quality is amazinggg.",Worth every penny

We selected the Echo Show 2 because the reviews said the sound was superior to the comparable Google device and because the built-in camera allowed video conferencing - something we do regularly.  While the speakers and picture lived up to our expectations, the quality of Skype calls was poor.  And, my wife was never able to get it to connect properly to her calendar. Most importantly, Alexa did not give correct responses to many simple questions, including follow up questions to the trending topics that were suggested that we ask Alexa. Just 2 examples of many, Alexa suggested we ask about: A rare chimera cardinal, but it was unable to respond correctly when we asked to see pictures. And, Usain Bolt beating the NFL 40-yard dash record, but it could not respond correctly when we asked what was the record time. Also, it was unable to respond correctly on multiple occasions when we wanted to see recipes for specific foods. Every day we experienced numerous instances where Alexa could not provide an answer, but we were able to get the correct answer from the Google Assistant. (The requests for pictures was done with our smart phones but others were done with the Google Mini.) The inability to respond and/or the incorrect responses from the onset caused us to start testing and comparing Alexa versus the Google Assistant right away. After a week, we had enough and concluded that Alexa was unable to meet our needs. Because of our extreme frustration with getting accurate information, we never bothered to connect Alexa to the other smart devices in our home, so we cannot say how Alexa might have handled tasks like turning lights on and off. And, I was not satisfied with the limited selection offered to shopping inquiries versus the selection offered when looking at Amazon on my computer. While the reviews indicated that Alexa is compatible with more 3rd party devices, they also said that Google had the edge to answering informational inquiries. We just never imagined that the discrepancy would be so great. If getting answers to questions regarding news, sports or 'how to' are important, we suggest you go with the Google Assistant. The final irony came as I prepared to return the product. Alexa was unable to respond to the question of how to reset the device to the factory defaults, but Google was able to give me the answer.",Alexa needs lots of improvement.

I didn’t have this problem on the original Echo Show. The 2nd gen Echo Show screen is definitely larger and more vibrant. Overall it’s not that useful unless you are going to watch something directly on it. It has Prime Video, Hulu and for some reason, NBC. Without Netflix, this makes it a light offering. The content (like news stories) it pushes out is rarely relevant to me. If you like following cooking recipes on tv, then this is probably good for the kitchen. Alexa has all the same problems she has on every other Echo device, most frustratingly she can barely answer questions about what the device can do. Instead she either refers you to a help section that mysteriously isn’t available on the device itself even though it has a screen or she just says something like, “Hm, I don’t know that.” One improvement on Alexa’s shopping skills, particular to this device, is that you can look at the products, though it’s a narrow set.",What are you really going to use this for?

Big issues: Ring integration: The Ring integration sucks. When motion is detected or a doorbell press happens, you should have the option to have the Show automatically display the Ring camera that's reporting in. Web video: I had aims to use the device to watch Youtube videos and read about the workarounds that exist for the device inexplicably not having a Youtube app (due to some Amazon tiff with Google). I thought I could get around this by using the integrated browsers, but this really doesn't work well. The browsers seem to expunge cookies every time you switch to the home screen, so you get logged out. Youtube, Youtube TV and DirecTV online viewing are basically non-starters. Who the heck uses Hulu? Audio mic: Our old first gen Alexa (not the show version) had no issues understanding us when being asked to do something. This gen 2 Alexa Show has a much harder time picking up requests and many times we have to repeat the requests multiple times before it figures it out. Lack of recipe content: There are tons of simple recipes that I ask for that just aren't found. This highly touted functionally of this device pretty much stinks.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Feb 2019,Mindcrime,"While I liked the original Echo Show, it often felt like a version 1 of a product. I didn't care very much for the design of the product, the looks, and the screen size/quality. When Amazon offered deep discounts on the new Echo Show if you traded-in your 1st gen Show, I decided to take the plunge. We mostly use our Echo's for listening to Amazon Music, and for the price the Echo's, including the Show, performed well. Gen 1 of the Show had good but not great sound.  The screen was good but not great. Gen 2 addresses both of these issues and as a result, the product feels and looks like what the Show should have been all along. This biggest and best part of the gen 2 Show is the screen. The screen is basically the whole front of the device and it looks really good. Out of the box I had to adjust the brightness as the default setting was too low. Everything on the gen 2 screen looks good. From song lyrics to 5 day weather forecast, the screen is bright, clear, and with good resolution. I recently purchased the Amazon Fire Recast device which allows you to stream ""over air"" TV to your Fire devices and to your Echo Show. On the gen 1 Show, watching tv was difficult because of the screen size and quality. With gen 2 Show, watching TV is much better. The screen size and clarity fo the screen make watching local news/tv a pleasure. The screen is nice enough that streaming Prime Videos is nice as well. The sound on gen 2 is also improved. The sound is louder and fuller. Out of the box the bass is too much and drowned out the rest of the music. The Show has an equalizer setting that allows you to adjust the bass and treble. The gen 1 Show did not come close to the sound regular Echo's can provide so I generally listened to music over the Echo's rather than the Echo Show, unless specifically in the kitchen where my Show is located. Now with gen 2, the sound is good enough that it is not a compromise. The big question is, is the gen 2 worth the upgrade from gen 1?  Absolutely, especially if you can get it at the discounted prices. At full price it is still a good upgrade but may not be worth it depending on your particular use. For me, listening to music and watching TV improvements would make the full price a generally good value.",Nice upgrade to original version

It sticks straight out so you can't have it up against the wall on the kitchen counter without bending the wire, and I am afraid it will eventually damage it. So it sits out a few inches taking up more counter space. The second, bigger issue, is the one with the sound cutting off and having to be unplugged to reboot to get the sound back. This is a KNOWN issue and I really wish they would come up with an update to fix it. I don't know what sets it off so it's not like I can just ""not"" do whatever it is. It would be really nice if this had an easier to access web browser so I could get to recipes easily. I still end up using my tablet propped against the wall for that. The sound is great but it would be nice if it were a little more customizable as the bass is a little too heavy.

They did a software update and it changed it by causing the screen to sleep right away with no control/options to change it. While we are use to having our other devices with screens awake all the time, you can forget it on their biggest brightest best screened device (oh and most expensive too). The 10 .1 2nd generation no longer stays awake. It goes to sleep and stays there until you wake it up. Very frustrating. Either don't buy it or plan to return it unless you like this. Frankly, I can't stand it. It will do this while you have music playing,  and I've read even while recipes and other things are going.  I haven't tried videos. I don't think I can bring myself to do it. And, what is the point of having things rotating on a screen ( which by the way was something else we had to get used to that we didn't like and couldn't turn off) but once you could get used to that with at least the items you liked, now you don't even have that going because they disappear to a sleeping Screen? I just don't get it. My only thinking is they want to protect their warranty on this beautiful display by having it go to sleep. I asked the tech department if they plan to put through a software update to keep it awake or at least give you a choice. Guess what, no idea. I wish Amazon would get it together and please the customer. I wonder if they asked anybody first. I'm thinking I'll return it and just get another 8. Hopefully they won't do it to that in another update. I... Just... Don't... Get... Amazon.",Warning! Don't buy it.. sleeping screen almost 100% of the time on the 2nd Gen
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2019,eoz,"My main purpose for buying this was to use Skype to chat with my mom. Since chat is currently one of the few apps that allows group video chat, I thought I could chat with her and others at same time via the Echo Show. However please note that group chat via Skype on the Echo Show does not work. Only worked when did person to person video call. I feel there should have been some mention that if Echo supports Skype it does so without full features. I submitted a question before buying but nobody knew the answer to I'm writing this review to save others the need to buy then return. Also not while the device itself is nice (big screen and great speakers) the software takes no advantage of having a screen for input purposes. You control this completely by saying ""okay alexa"" which for me personally isn't ideal. Also there were suggested videos that you had limit control over and really didn't want to see. Overall, they could have made a much better device if the software was applied differently on many fronts.","Good hardware, horrible software"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2020,Mark,"I have 2 of these, accompanied by other, various echos, and the place where these ones shine is that nice, big screen. It may be sort of frivolous, but I like seeing random pictures and information on screens in my house throughout the day; It makes everything feel so high-tech, like I'm living in the future! The rotating imagery also kind of refreshes the feel of my house--Like, it's not always the same view when I look into a room where they are. I like that there are a couple of browser options, because aside from Alexa skills, if you have an internet browser, you can put anything you want to on the screen. Time and temperature resting screens are great too--They're like extra clocks. One drawback is the sound. It's plenty powerful, with 2x 2.2"" speakers, but the sound layout is kind of a let down. Unlike the Echo Show 5, there are no front(under) slots for forward sound, and the feel of the audio is a more distant sensation as it bounces off the walls behind them before reaching me. This gives a very bassy(I like bass!) sound, but crisp treble is lost, and the audio in general feels very detached from the screen that I'm looking at. The only other drawback is that it doesn't have a physical cover slide for the camera, which can be forgiven, as this idea didn't come out until the Echo Show 5. Later versions will probably have this. With all considered, They are very sturdy units, and I got screen protectors for them to make them more durable. Having a nice-size screen with all Alexa features in a room that you spend a lot of time in is amazing. I'd recommend these if you have the cash, and are looking for a new toy. If you catch them on sale, don't waste the opportunity. For music only, go with the new Echo (3rd gen), which is essentially an Echo Plus (2nd gen), minus the smart home hub, and on-board thermometer(I actually love the on-board thermometer on mine!).",Amazing device!

I have 3 echos, 6 Dots and a tap so I have experience with these products, but still find this one awkward to use. When you play a song, lyrics scroll. So if you like karaoke at hope, you'll like this. The connectivity with blink cameras (the reason I purchased) is underwhelming. I expected to see all 10 of my cameras on the screen, get alerts etc. Instead, no alerts and I have to ask for which camera I want to see, remembering all 10 names. So once I get an alert on my phone, I can then use the device to ask to see a live feed. I might just be an Alexa eShow dummy, but I liken this to my short lived Google Glass experience.",Mixed review. Kind of Underwhelming

If you have an Amazon Eco or Eco Dot, the Eco Show is a must have! The Eco Show is compatible with both the Eco and Eco Dot and the Show is very easy to set up, it’s almost completely ready out of the box! And the sound from the Eco Show is awesome! You can adjust bass, treble, etc. The screen is huge and very clear. I don’t watch movies on my Eco Show, but one could and it would be a great devise to do that on. I have my Eco Show, Eco and Eco Dot synced up so I can hear my Amazon music all through my apartment!! It sounds awesome! The cost of the Eco Show is reasonable! There’s not enough room on this review to tell you what all the Eco Show does. I would recommend if you’re thinking of purchasing one to go on UTube, they’re several reviews on there that gives you a great idea as to what the Eco Show can do.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jan 2020,herodotus,"Update: do not buy this product. It has major software problems with zigbee support. I had  power outage yesterday and after rebooting all of my Philips hue zigbee lights went offline  and can not be added back. Nothing works. Tech support was useless. Everything was on surge protectors and many on ups. All lights work manually but they will not connect to the show and the deleting and readding  does  it work.  Alexa software updates are not well tested. The GOOD: The Echo Show 2nd Gen (10”) device is awesome. We’ve had it for a couple weeks and really enjoy it. The audio quality is superb. The screen is crystal clear and bright. MICs seem to be good at picking up requests without issue. The BAD: We really want to mount it on the wall but there are only two companies that sell mounts. One is USA based Humancentric and the other ATOPHK (chinese). The Humancentric mount is two flimsy. The ATOPHK design looks ok and appears to be better designed than the Humancentric mount - the company seems a bit questionable. No web site. All the writing has very poor grammar. Makes me nervous to trust a $250 device to  a company like that. I wish Amazon would provide a wall mount that has  pivot and rotation capabilities. We want to mount it so that it could be seen by the person cooking then rotated to the kitchen table so we can play games like trivia from the table. UPDATE: I bought the ATOPHK mount. It works. But some issues. See my review about it. The mount is a bit over priced. But quality is good. The UGLY (and this is really bad and thus the 2 stars): There are MAJOR flaws  with the Alexa App and Echo devices regarding Zigbee support. I have a bunch of bugs open with amazon on this issue and this is the sole reason i gave the Show 10 two stars. If you have a Echo Studio, Show 10, or Echo Plus they have a Zigbee hub in them. Zigbee is a low power low bandwidth home automation protocol for devices like Philips Hue bulbs, water sensors, and door/window sensors. The issues: 1) amazon never took into account what would happen if the echo with Zigbee (ZB) support died or was replaced (upgraded to a show 10 in my case). If you have a bunch of ZB devices (we have 9 hue bulbs) that the echo w/ ZB support goes offline then all the ZB devices go offline as expected BUT if you have other echo devices with ZB support (we had a Echo plus and bought a Show 10 and Studio) they will NOT automatically pick-up control of the ZB device. Amazon failed to implement multi-master or master/slave failover. So if you have critical devices using Echo’s as the ZB hub and that Echo dies even if you have other Echo w/ ZB support online they will NOT be able to take control the ZB devices. Not good. Especially if you are not at home if the Echo w/ ZB dies. 2) If you go into the Alexa App you can NOT migrate the ZB devices to another Echo device. There is NO way to do in the app. 3) if you deregister Echo w/ ZB support in an attempt to force them to “failover” to another echo. All the ZB devices attached to the device disappear from the devices list AND from all your routines. With NO warning. This is really bad. 4) if you are using Philip Hue bulbs you have to manually go to EVERY device to migrate them to the new Echo device.  you have to go into Alexa App, then go “Add Device”, press help  (?) button, scroll do to zigbee unpairing question, select it, then go down to section about philips hue bulbs, go to the bulb to get the serial number, enter into screen. The app will then reset the bulbs association with the old echo  and rediscover it. At which point you need to manually add it back to all the groups and routines.  It took me over an hour to deassociate and rediscover the bulbs, and then add them into the right groups and routines and retest everything. Ugh! BTW, The amazon plugs controlled by the Echo “failed over” to the new Echo Show and Studio fine. This problem only appears to be related to Zigbee support. Amazon really need to redo the entire Zigbee support for the Echo product line and Alexa app. These types of problems are not software bugs but a major flaw in the design of how they engineered ZB support and severely hampers the use of the Echo devices to be used in home automation - especially for critical components like sensors.","Great device, MAJOR FLAWS with zigbee support.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Sep 2020,Leonard J. Mullen,"Let me start by saying I own two of the 10"" Shows, an 8, a 5, and five (5) Gen 1 Echo Shows plus a Recast, an Echo Auto, an Echo Connect, and four Dots.  The Echo Show 10 is the very best Echo device.  Rather than repeat what others have posted, let's stipulate to the fact that the Echo Show 10 has great speakers, a terrific HD display, and really good mics.  I'll use this space to explain how I use these devices.  In my opinion, what you can do with the Echo Show 10 is at least as important as how well it does those things.  I bought this particular Show 10 from Best Buy along with a Show 5 and a smart LED bulb for $179.99.  Same price I paid for my first Gen 1 Show. ********** How I use my Echo Show 10 ********** I have a Show 10 on my kitchen counter. While I'm planning and cooking meals, I direct Alexa to add ingredients to my shopping list. I ask her for recipes for whatever I am in the mood for. I ask her how much does a bell pepper weigh (because I dice and freeze mine when they are on sale and recipes often call for one medium bell pepper, etc.). And I set timers -- ""Alexa set a fourteen minute timer for ribeye"", ""Alexa set an eight minute timer for lobster."" When I make jerky, I set eight jerky timers to remind me to change the temperature or rotate the trays. Names come in handy if you are cooking Thanksgiving dinner at the same time. I can check the timers from any Show. This time of year, I like to cook outside. The Echo Show's AC networking allows me to take radio, television, and the world wide web with me. I have one on my desk at work. I have a lot of smart devices in my home -- especially lights and especially in the kitchen. I don't leave lights on at night. I can simply direct Alexa to ""Turn on sink"" or ""Turn on Kitchen"" (Kitchen is all the lights I use in the kitchen). This comes in handy when you are up to your elbows in dishes and the sun decides to set. It comes in handy when you need a midnight snack too. The Echo Show 10 has a built in Zigbee hub so you can control Zigbee devices without the need for a separate hub. Most of the time, Alexa is entertaining me. I have a collection of photos playing as my background. The Echo Show 10 is an excellent digital frame. I listen to radio stations -- music, talk radio. Alexa keeps track of my favorites. When I select a radio station or album on one Show, the rest add it to their 'recent' lists. Very handy. I have a Recast, so I can stream Free TV to my Shows. I can also watch Pluto in a browser. I have an electric fireplace insert that looks really great, but it doesn't make any sound. I have a first gen Show tucked behind the insert. When I run the fireplace, I direct Alexa to play fireplace sounds and to turn off the display. I have a Show 10 in my bedroom. I bought the Show 8 to replace this so I can slide a cover over the camera when I want privacy. (Just kidding. My kid already told me he is taking it back to school. Turns our his privacy is more important than mine.) The Show 5 and Show 8 have mechanical shutters for the camera. Sometimes I work from home. The Show is great for voice calls. It's great background noise (TV/Radio) when I am 'mostly' working. I set an alarm to get me up 'weekdays'. I left a first gen Show at my mother's house. I have it configured so I can 'drop in' if she does not answer the call. I have an Echo Connect installed, so every device offers to pick up when my landline rings. I put a first gen Show in my dog's pen. Initially I put it in there so I could drop in on him when the automatic feeder rotates to make sure it was working as expected and to see how he was reacting to it. (After a short time, he stood over the feeder and barked when he was hungry.) He was alone all day and I could drop in on him. Not sure what he thought of it, but he would get out of bed and bark back at me, so... You can interact with the ecosystem using a phone app. So, my shopping list, calendar, and contacts are in my pocket. I can drop in on any Show from anywhere as long as I have my phone. Use one as a baby monitor for secure monitoring. With Prime Days just around the corner (I guess), I bought one of each model of the Show into work. It was like a carnival. One guy googled things to ask Alexa. (If you have one, say, ""Alexa, I am your father."") We discovered trivia games, math quizzes, and a thousand different ways to interact with Alexa. Amazon offers exclusive deals via the Echo devices. I secure purchases with a PIN since the Show makes it SO easy to buy stuff from Amazon. Communication is an improvement opportunity. Sure, you can call people or drop in on other Echos, but we are talking about 1x1 communication. Everyone else is doing 1xM or MxM. Amazon ought to work on a 'party line' feature that would let the family get together. Other than that I have no complaints. The browser experience could use some attention as well. My main beef with the web browsers is that after a period of inactivity, the Show returns to the home screen. If you are watching a video or following a recipe, you have to continuously touch the screen to prevent this. Best accessories for the Echo Show are 1) smart phone, 2) Recast, and 3) Connect. Your smart phone is just a portable, cellular, battery powered, very tiny Echo Show. The Recast lets you watch free TV on your Shows. The Connect turns every Echo device into a landline.",Terrific kitchen assistant -- and a whole lot more!

However, it's quite big to be placed on a side table or any table. At the same time the processing power of this thing is terrible. Doing a web search or YouTube search takes me back a few years of all the smart device development I've seen. Very slow. Screen should've been FullHD for the dimension 10"". Due to its size sitting on the side table it's in close proximity to the eyes almost as close as a tablet computer usually is. But where a tablet at this price range can be found with FullHD screen (in fact fire HD tablets) this comes with HD (720p) only. Lastly the price on this is doesn't seem worth it, given its lacking in processing and screen quality. I think for base price show 5 at $75, show 8 at $100 and this show 10 (2nd gen) at $150 is ideal for what it offers. This show would be worth $200 to me if it had 1080p screen and had faster processing capabilities.","Sounds great but the screen, the internals and the price..."

I have to shut it off and restart it constantly (per their tech support advise) as well as disconnect it from our internet and then reconnect it every time I use it. It doesn’t switch between windows while it is idle. It just shows what you should say for the things you like and want to see like the news. I have had it for two months and it has red lined me three times. It is really frustrating. It may be going back. My lap top sitting on the counter works better.  How ever if you want it just for music it works nicely and the sound is great. But I would have gotten a blue tooth speaker if I needed just music.,Not worth the money.

I was excited to get it and to call him, but there was no audio. Amazon support did their job but it wasted a day, and I feel like they should have offered a replacement after the first tech chat session. I reset the device to factory, checked for software update and still nothing. They said they would check with their resources.....I left for work,.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2019,LegoDad,"I've been using the Echo devices since their inception.  I was fortunate enough to get into an early adoption queue. It's amazing how embedded into my daily life these things have become.  I use them for so many things - from morning repeating reminders to get my son his ADD medicine to timers for cooking and my favorite, adding things to my shopping list.  I love being able to just ask for a song and have it play. Weather forecasts, current temp outside, news synopsis...  It has become such an integral part of our household. The Echo Show was a nice addition, I liked the screen, especially when it came to monitoring multiple timers, or being able to look at lists without having to use the app.  But it was a bit small for use across the room, so some things I didn't ask unless I was closer to it. This new one removes that restriction.  Screen is huge, seeing the two side by side is just amazing.  It's bigger than I had expected just from reading the specs and measurements.  Screen is vibrant and crisp, text is clear and photos are well displayed. My son loves that there are so many genres of jokes he can ask. I love that the Echo is one of the central parts of my automated home.  Switches all over the house, lights, thermostat and video cameras - I love being able to just ask to see a camera and seeing it, or turning lights on and off, or changing the temperature of the house.  I was happy before the Echo devices to be able to do all that from the cell phone, but it's even more useful now that the Echo can control so many things.  Works well with IFTTT but I still prefer the skills where it can directly access something. There just isn't a downside.  I'm passing my V1  Echo Show to my mother, who also received my V1 Echo when I upgraded to the newer little cylinder tower for the V2 Echo.  And I've given her my old V1 dot when I got the newer dot.  It's nice having them in a few places around the house.  The dot in my bedroom is my only alarm clock I use anymore, despite having a nice Philips glow light wakeup system...  It is just so much easier to say, ""Alexa, set alarm for 6 AM,"" than to hit the buttons on the alarm clock.  Especially when you're setting different times for different days. And even for napping sometimes - just tell it what time to sound the alarm, and take a little nap without worrying about napping too long and screwing up your sleep schedule. Worth every penny for my household, wouldn't be without one anymore...",Worthy upgrade from Version 1

I thought this would be great as a cooking assistant in the kitchen but it has a life of its own. It plays random videos without any instruction.  It then goes into modes where it responds to no commands at all. It literally sits unplugged in my kitchen 70% of the time.  I honestly should throw it out but having paid over $200 for it, I keep hoping a new software update will at some point fix some of its flaws and make this paperweight into something useful. Amazon, you should honestly be ashamed of this product, but hey, Microsoft thought Windows Vista was a good idea once upon a time.  You can make up for this by pulling it off the shelves and making something that doesn’t suck to take its place. For real...like now.",So bad....this is Amazon’s “Windows Vista” idea

We uploaded photos to our Prime account and created an album that rotates for our background. While some may find the different pop ups annoying, we enjoy them. I can see where some would like a way to turn them off, but our house enjoys seeing and frequently clicks on the snippets. The pip ups also help us to learn new skills a available with Alexa.  We frequently use this with our Premium Prime music and the family enjoys seeing the lyrics. It’s nice to also view particular items on Prime we are interested in buying. Prime videos are not what you might expect, but we didn’t buy this solely to watch movies, though we do at times, while cooking. Overall we’re very happy with this purchase.",Happy

And boy, I could not send that Google Hub back to where it came from fast enough! It may be great for smart home only users, but it is no fun or really that useful, other than that, at all! You cannot even get answers or videos that come even close to what Google gives you on your cell phone!! And, it is not for the sight impaired- meaning me. If I needed to know the time after 6pm, I asked Alexa. I don't get it... And, oh yeah baby! I love lyric mode on this thing! This bad boy can rock your booty off, for sure! The bass vibrates everything on my kitchen counter! I love it!! I call mine Alexxx sometimes... it answers, most of the time, no matter which name- Alexa or Alexxx. I do wish it had a man's voice, sometimes.... really could use hearing one once in a while! It's kinda funny, sometimes, I just get ignored- similar to a man lol. Like, when I asked her to repeat the same song for the tenth time. Or, she will just decide that I need to listen to a certain playlist, instead of said song. It's annoying, but sometimes the first song is so good, it gets me to listen. Still... If I say play this song, and she says, I'll play ""this"" instead, it's rude! Another thing I absolutely love, is watching YouTube. I've saved my Channel to the homepage in the Silk Browser, so all I have to do is just tell it to open YouTube. It goes straight to my homepage. I can go to or watch my subscription feed and playlists, go to my watched history, watch recommended videos, and easily search for anything I would like to watch. It is so quick and easy to navigate! My most favorite thing to watch, is Criminal trials, and they last for weeks. So, while I'm working in the kitchen doing other things, or just sitting around the table, I can pick up where I left off on my Fire Stick, and watch them right there on my echo. I can search the internet for anything! I can type it in, or make it even faster by using my voice and just hitting the enter key on the onscreen keyboard. I've heard a lot of people complain that there are too many steps to do things on the Echo. But, I can get to anywhere on mine almost as quickly as I can on my regular computer. I hate to say that I haven't ventured out into the many, many things this thing can do, other than these few things, but they're the ones that I enjoy. One day, I'll try venturing out into unchartered territory for myself on this lovely device. I know I can tell you one thing is for certain. I will definitely be buying more of these wonderful, booty shaking, singing to the top of my lungs, mind blowing gadgets very soon! I just have to have them in several rooms! I highly, highly, highly recommend the Echo 2nd Generation to everyone! REALLY, EVERYONE!!","🎶🎵🎶 It's all about that bass, bout that bass, bout that bass ~ and bringin' booty back 🎶🎵🎶"

The camera is fuzzy when your drop in... it takes several moments to clear up... sometimes longer. Hulu works great... Spotify works great... asking questions, great,  custom service is great and they are so fast to respond, they switched out the device, they just don't know how to fix it. nothing else works... No Netflix, prime, Plex, sometimes the browser its self is less then helpful.... and the device freezes up. today it started beeping for no reason. I couldn't figure out why. I finally factory reset it and it stopped... I don't know why this has happened but unfortunately I would not recommend this to anyone just because it has been a headache. just use a computer, tablet or something else... If something changes I'll update this review.",I was so excited
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2019,MEW,"The larger the better in my book. Sound seems better than 1st iteration. Much easier to use bue to size and videos are more easily distinguishable. It will auto reconnect to wifi in case of internet or power outage which happens here frequently as with Echo Spot but the screen size and sound quality is so much more impressive, I just wish Alexa knew more historically significant info, geographic areas of the world and you could select multiple languages for responses. It would be handy to have someone else who understood French, German, Spanish, Russian and Italian on whom to practice. No one else remembers any of their language training and it makes it tough to keep current. Just a thought for improvement for future updates. Please. Size of screen also makes it easier to see my son and his large family in another state and Alexa often helps me locate my iPhones by dialing until I can locate them by vibration if necessary. Alexa has and reinforces good manners which seems to be a dying art in communication.",screen larger and more easily seen from a distance and sound bolder
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2019,Jonathan Feist,"Good looking screen, well performing device that gets loud. Make no mistake, this is not a high resolution TV for streaming your favorite Prime video channels, nor is it the perfect sounding speaker to stream Amazon music, but it does both of those things quite well. There are not many skills that take advantage of the display on this echo device, but I like the simple clock that it is for most of my day. The touch screen performs well and the microphone seems to work better than on my echo dots. In terms of sound, it gets loud and it sounds pretty good, but it does a weird thing with bass. It's almost like there is a dedicated driver for bass, and that it's coupled with a vibration motor, because if you can feel it, it's deeper, right? I don't know what it is, but it's overemphasized to my ears, giving the impression that it's trying too hard to be a great speaker, instead of settling for just being a really good speaker. The mute button is convenient, but I'd have liked to see a shutter for the camera as well. Ultimately, I'd have liked to use this echo device in the bedroom, but not with that camera on it. It shall remain in the 'public' parts of my home. In the end, I can recommend the echo show to anyone looking for a smart speaker with a display, but is invested in the Amazon ecosystem. Amazon really needs to solve this feud with Google, it is a mistake to not have YouTube on this device.",A fun way to experience what Alexa can offer.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2020,soloz2,"The echo show is a new addition for me.  I picked up a 2nd gen and an echo show 8 on prime day and they are fantastic additions.  I put the 2nd gen in a room I previously had an echo in and put the show 8 in the kitchen to replace the dot I had there.  Both sound a bit better compared to the echo devices they replaced, and having the screen is an excellent addition.  I like being able to watch news while cooking or cleaning.  I am somewhat disappointed in the smart home integration of the 2nd gen.  I picked up some Phillips Hue white and color ambiance bulbs and I had anticipated I could change the color through the touch screen, but you can't.  You can only turn the bulb on or off.  Even changing the brightness has to be done via app.  I haven't played around with voice change of brightness or color, but that is likely possible.",Good sounding echo with a great sized screen

So glad I did, the sound is so impressive and clear don't even worry about a speaker and the photos are bright and clear. I do not find the adds a burden and actually kind of like them as they give me new things to try that I had not even thought of, and I've found some functions through them that I use a lot.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2019,Albert,"Despite an annoying idiosyncrasy, overall I like the Echo Show. It's nice to have a screen to watch movies and shows in the kitchen while working there, as well as listen to music from a device that has a great sound for its size and designed function. Its annoyance is that the touch feature doesn't respond as your phone or watch does; it has a lag when you tap the screen, and sometimes I have to tap it a couple of times to get it to wake up and respond, particularly when I want to watch movies or shows. Volume control can be the same way sometimes, as well; a slight lag on occasion. Voice response from Alexa is just what you would expect: prompt and on-point, even when there is a lot of background noise going on. Other than that, I really like my Echo Show. And it integrates nicely with our other Echo devices in the house.",An integral part of your kitchen

The larger screen, for my old eyes, is good especially for viewing WYZE camera Alexa Skill views while in bed. I'm also very pleased with the enhanced speakers and resultant sound. I could not find a review of the power consumption by the 10.1"" Echo Show so I just used my Kill-A-Watt device to determine it pulls .09 amps, 5 watts at idle and 7 watts streaming WWOZ,  a local community radio station.

The screen display is also much better.  The sound quality is also great.  I'm glad I decided to purchase the newest version. After reading some online reviews, I decided to update mine.  First, this isn't my first device. We have one in every room (echo, dot, show - 1st gen, & spot).  Second,  the more you use it,  the better the experience and the better it is for Alexa to understand what you want.  Third, once I figured out how to set up groups and connect all devices, the experience increased significantly.  I can play music in any combination of rooms in my home from my cell phone app.  It's been entertaining randomly starting funny songs on the bathroom dot when my unsuspecting husband is hanging out in there too long!  Fourth, I work from my home office and have my spot on the office desk.  Once I synced my calendar,  it was a game changer! I can see upcoming meetings from anywhere I have a screen or just ask the non-screen devices what's on my schedule.  I LOVE this feature! Finally, having 3 adult children, I bought all of them a 1st gen show, now we can do video calls to each other from different sides of the country at any time since this works both on the screen device and on your cell phone.  This is wonderful and my favorite feature.",Much larger and better than the original

I love that I can ""drop in"" automatically, without them having to get to the phone.  It works wonderfully.  All I say is ""Alexa, drop in on parents"" and walla!  It auto-answers on their end, and the video of their room goes opaque for about 10 seconds (for privacy purposes), and the Echo Show ""announces"" that I am calling them.  I can even mute the call (which also turns off my video), and still see/hear them (they can't see me when I'm muted, but they can see a small video image of their room in the top corner of the Show's screen, so they know they're still on video).  It sits on my desk, so when I'm in between calls/projects, I ""drop in"" on my parents several times a day.  Great for monitoring my parents (and their caregivers, who are pretty darn good). You can also make 2-way video calls from the Alexa app on your phone.  Not as nice of an experience, but it's nice when you're away from your Echo. The only thing I don't like/understand, is why it's mandatory to associate their contact with a phone number (video calls go over the internet, so they don't need a phone number).  I hope they fix this in the future. To be honest, I haven't used the Echo Show for much else, except to play my favorite radio station, K-LOVE (positive, encouraging).",Wonderful option for video calls with aging parents

We also have other Alexa devices that haven’t given us many problems. THE ECHO SHOW WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! The voice recognition is awful. It’s constantly going off during our normal every day conversations in the kitchen, which our regular Echo never did.  It rarely gives me an answer to anything I ask it... all I get is “Hmm, I don’t know that one”.  (Then I asked Siri and get an immediate answer). I have also tried linking our Amazon Music account to it multiple times and it still doesn’t recognize it - although it says it’s connected. I could listen to any song I wanted before, and now it gives me a long spiel to upgrade my account (to what I already pay for) if I want it to play.  I was most excited for the screen but that’s no better. I’m always having to swipe or hit buttons more than once.  I’ll definitely be switching back to my original Echo!",Hate it!!
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2018,Steve Segal,"Got 2 on Black Friday. Heres my review and criticisms of this device. Im confused and conflicted about this device. I feel like Amazon knows they need to improve on the software. Pros : Sounds amazing - 11/10. Like seriously, the bass on this thing is wow. It's really clear. Now onto the cons.. On my phone, I can touch anywhere, and get a response. There needs to be a back button, there needs to be swipe functionality, like from the bottom up on an iPhone.  Im touching parts of the UI on the Show expecting it to do something, and Im frustrated that I can/cant click on certain things that are or arent obvious. There needs to be a Device list similiar to how I control my devices via my Android on my phone. I can say Alexa (show) turn on Philips Hue. I get the Device, it pops up. I even get a brightness bar. But I cant view any of these devices whatsoever in the 30 Internet-of-thing type devices I have connected to the Alexa ecosystem. What. Why? I dont have friends. I dont use this for making calls or video calls. Thats what phones are for. This product should really be relagated or somehow updated via software to include alot of the features lacking. The homescreen is extremely limited. There needs to be way more access to font sizes, font types, what shows up on the home screen. I mean come on, Google killed it. There needs to be options for screen ""timeout"". Just take a page from Android 9.0 or whatever. If Amazon takes into account these comments seriously - and I think they do, especially with the always learning doomsday robot named Alexa, she'll probably write code just based on reading this comment. Edit (1 hour later) - Seems Amazon does take these comments seriously. I got a phone call - asking for feedback. Not even an hour after posting this review. I further explained my situation. Interesting. Gave them more feedback on the ecosystem. I think it really comes down to Software. The hardware is great. Few other things mentioned. Im still unsure whether I will be keeping the device. It is cool to note that they do (for obvious reasons, they read the comments) just wasn't expecting a call or anyone to care or read. As busy as they are, and to receive a followup call. Hope my voice recorded feedback helps, Mr. Bezos.",Amazing sound - BUT - Lacks basic touchscreen support and software functionality.
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2019,Lorac,"For the most part this 2nd gen Echo Show does what it says.  It still needs to do more things that make use of the screen (for weather and traffic) rather than just print the basic info.  How about a google map with traffic?  full details with pictures and radar for weather?  The most annoying thing is the continually-scrolling ""Things to Try"" that cannot be turned off.  While displaying nice pictures from a recent family wedding I see things across the bottom of the screen like ""Try Alexa tell me a horse joke"" or ""Try Alexa tell me something weird"" etc etc NON-STOP.  My first intention was to ""try"" this Echo Show and see how much I liked it and then get another one for the main floor of the house (this one is in my office) and another one for the vacation house but because I can't tun of the ""Things to try"" on the screen I won't be buying another one.","""Things to Try"" on home screen is beyond annoying, I won't be buying another one!"

It's a tad cheaper to ask Alexa to sign you up for Amazon Unlimited music! If you have an elderly parent who isn't very tech savvy, this is idea, as you can personally set it to auto answer when you video call to check in.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 May 2019,AftrBrnr,"So, where to begin?  How about with the Good: Screen - nice size, bright and vivid Sound - nice, room-filling sound Unit design - nice aesthetics, but functionally lacking without a stand - As far as the Bad or weak points, there are quite a few, but fortunately these *could* be resolved with policy or software changes: Performance - overall, it's a fairly sluggish compared to my other devices.  This could be issues with code, hardware or servers - there's no way I can say for sure either way.  Hopefully, it's something that can be remedied on the AMZ side. Screen - there's not much to watch on it.  Or rather, it's really hard to find anything worth watching.  Your choices are Amazon Video or Hulu. > No Netflix > No casting from other devices > No Plex video (music works fine) > No SlingTV (we're a Sling house, not a Hulu house) > No YouTube (note - there's a workaround to get to YT by using an included browser, but it's slow and awkward. Additionally, finding what you want on Amazon Video is painful on this device.  Videos I can easily locate on a phone, tablet or set top box are nearly impossible to locate. All in all, it feels a lot more like the Fire Phone than it does a Fire tablet, in that it seems geared more to sell stuff than it is to meet consumers needs or demands . Unit design - as a counter-top device, it REALLY needs to be up off the counter a bit more. Otherwise, there's a good chance that at some point a spill will ruin it.  I bought the ATOPHK stand  for an additional $44 (ouch!).  It's a great stand, but something like this really should be included with a ""premium"" product like this that is meant for the table/counter. I bought this Echo Show because I love gadgets, but only because it was on sale.  I wouldn't have purchased it at full price and, having bought it and experienced it's limitations first-hand, I'm not sure I would buy it again until the functionality/compatibility is expanded significantly.  As it stands, a $29 Echo Dot connected to my home system via bluetooth has 90+% of the value I get from the Show. Your mileage and desired usage may vary! Note to Amazon:  I *really* want to like this a lot more than I do.  Tweak up the speed and give me more access to other sources and you'll have a 6-star product. -- .:: 3-month update ::. The above observations and opinions are unchanged, both good and bad.  But I've found something else that I think is worth mentioning.  I found that video surveillance of any kind is slow / delayed significantly. I've tried BlinkXT2's, as well as several budget-friendly Dericam cameras (via Monocle) and both had a serious 12-18 second delay on the Echo Show.  For instance, the pizza delivery guy was ringing my doorbell before I saw his car pull in my drive. There is nearly no delay when viewing the same video streams from either camera on the phone apps, both on wifi and off.  Also, network monitoring shows my bandwidth is far from saturated.  That being the case, I can say with a fair bit of certainty the issue is with the Show and not the cameras or network.  My guess is there's a shoddy x264 codec in there somewhere, or the overall hardware's just not up to the task. Either way, I'm keeping it at 3 stars for the looks and sound quality, but I'm still largely unimpressed.",Slightly underwhelmed but hopeful. Overall rating at this time: meh.

The bigger issue occurred right after the replacement and support window ended (1 year).  I no longer can get sound out of this device at all.  No audio confirmations, no music streaming, no weather or news...basically, the reason I use my device outside of Amazon Photos integration is ruined.

For $400 I could get an iPad Mini and do 1000X more than this will do.  Not very customizable visually at all.  I can change the background and turn a few home screen options on or off.  Trending Topics is totally irrelevant to me.  I searched for ways to replace it with trending news stories from news sources that I like. So far there is no way to do this, even though this would be a very simple feature to add and would be much more useful than the trending topics.  Finding good skills (i.e. apps) is difficult.  For every 5 star skill available, there are fifty 1 star skills you have to look through.  I do like the suggestions that cycle at the bottom of the screen. Try “Alexa ...”.  This is actually useful along with the email they send you once a week with the same kind of tips.  Overall, the UI is extremely basic and boring though.  At this rate, you should wait for maybe the 5th generation if they are even still making these that long.  The 2nd generation is unimpressive and I honestly feel like I wasted my money.

Since countless reviews have focused on the big and beautiful screen, my comments are added here: 1. No doubt this is a gorgeous screen. The small clock typeface has been fixed, although much to my surprise, there is little to no clock customization. Worse, the only background ""themes"" are the simplistic (and very tiring) ""illustrations"" and no background at all. What happened to the wonderful photos I have on my Show 1st Generation? This is Amazon's star product; I would have expected all kinds of new customization features and details. I settled for my folder ""Album"" of various photos that I have in my Amazon Photos app. Just say ""Alexa, add this album to my background"" and they will cycle every 1 minute or so (and no, there does appear to be any way to cycle these any faster...). Any yes, as another reviewer stated, an entirely different background pops up with an ad or notification. 2. The loud Alexa voice has been fixed I have read. I don't really like the side and rear speaker placement however - poor Alexa sounds as if she is within a box. The sound is indeed louder with an accentuated bass (and a three-level equalizer, woohoo!) but the music is missing a clear location. It sounds diffuse and non-distinct. 3. The worst surprise was this irritating screen-goes-blank after 2 minutes feature, which is carried over from the 1st Generation. Why does this happen? I can no longer see lyrics or title or the art after the screen dies. Arrgghh. 4. No Youtube. We all know why but that doesn't make it any better. And no, the Silk/Firefox work-around is just stupid. Just make up (Google and Amazon) and bring the native YouTube back! In retrospect, I'm glad I have them both. The 2nd Generation will take over the kitchen and the 1st Generation goes with me to work. Why all the critical comments despite the 4-stars? Because the new Echo Show is placed right next to my Lenovo Smart Display, which has a seamless Youtube and great sound/screen as well. The 2nd Generation Echo Show is just so much nicer than the Smart Display which was one of the biggest disappointments for me in 2018. Amazon can quickly fix most of all these nit-picking comments in future updates.

That said, the interface is essentially non-existant. its just awful. When watching on my ipad, i can access a full schedule, but on Show, there is no such option, only a list of the channels....doesnt even show what is currently playing. this product will never succeed if they dont address this video streaming fail. sad.",Meh...

Ease of use, integration with other devices and sound quality are all excellent.

Load this app, do this, do that, can tech support, but got it done. The then 3 more, easier each time. Now, I unbox it (well designed package), set up the cables, turn it on, and it installs itself with some prompting. Never opened my app on  my smartphone. Took about 20 minutes, because it had to update itself.  Easy. And it worked, call a relative who also had one (a Echo5) and surprised them.  Yea, I could Face Time, but a smartphone or a tablet are a little more expensive, plus I am an android man.  Plus if you are a gadget nerd, that don't matter. ""...the most toys wins"" kind of guy. I am still learning how to use it. Upon discussion with other owners, I will get rid of the annoying sales crap, (it can be done, but Amazon should fix that with a software update...PLEASE?), I am pairing two speakers too it. Have used it for Movies via Prime, but believe it or not, I use it primarily like the phones of the old days, in the kitchen, talking, watching stuff, and the like. I do like it.

I have my Alexa Show in the kitchen, sometimes when I say commands it understands, about 1/3 to 1/2 the time it does not.  All my other Alexa first party devices have better voice recognition function.  (One echo 2nd gen, three echo dots, one echo input, and one echo flex.)  Sometimes the Echo Dot in the living room picks up and responds to what I'm saying while the Echo Show in the kitchen does nothing.  It needs to be rebooted at least once every couple weeks or it doesn't work at all.  It's getting worse as time goes on.  I was initially more satisfied with this product, and it does work great for voice/video communication through a skype like function with family and friends.  That's its greatest asset and the only reason I'm giving it two stars.  It's good to let my kids speak with both sets of grandparents at a whim - we also bought one each for the grandparents.  They have the same problems.  2 stars to this if it didn't have the great video calling system -- almost 4 stars with because it's so handy - (the picture and voice calls are fantastic!!!)  but 3 stars overall because of the frustration when trying to use it as intended with the lack of voice recognition compared to the other Echo's.  It's truly really bad.  I unplug it often in pure frustration after repeating myself multiple times.

Update: after only 3 days with this  It randomly opens skills with no command. When given a command it will open to some random video and will not stop unless I unplug it. For the price I'm surprised at the lack of features. The fire tablet has a show feature and it actually works better then the show and the show is way more expensive wth amazon! Trying to deal with CS is a joke. Um have you reset it? Yes the last 3 people I have spoken with asked me to reset it.. um ok can you just reset it for me. Really after 3 resets how is the 4th going to make a difference can anyone tell me this? So far it's ok. I'm disappointed it does not integrate with Netflix or youtube. It is definitely 100% amazon integration only. The video quality is nice no complaints there.,A little disappointed but over all ok.

The obvious - I doubt this is too many people's first Alexa device so I won't go into too many details.  Alexa is good for a limited number of tasks out of the box: Timers, alarms, occasionally answering a question usefully, weather updates, etc.  As a standalone totally not worth much money.  I have mine paired with a couple of smart LED bulbs and a Logitech hub so it has a bit of actual functional use, turning on the TV/entertainment center and setting the lights to the right setting. Specifically the the Echo Show: Pros - sound is very good Screen is nice Alexa works like it does on any other device Solid value at $160 plus a Hue bulb and Dot Recipe idea looks cool and seems to work with a few minutes of testing. Cons - Basically the same as everyone else has written, but here goes: Camera aims at the ceiling - should come with the stand Amazon is selling for $30 Always has text asking me to try some task HULU plays a random episode of any TV show you ask it to play (edit - may not be random, just playing from first profile). No YouTube Can't make the time bigger on the homescreen I can't seem to get it to interface with my FireTv.  When I say ""pause Hulu"" or ""pause FireTv"" it doesn't do anything.  It appears to be all setup correctly within the app.  (Works with Netflix though by saying ""pause Netflix"") Solid 4 stars - some presumably easy software updates would move this to a 5 for me.  Only the camera is a physical defect.",Pretty cool but has some major flaws.

About the only good things this has going for it are the sound and video qualities; after that it falls apart spectacularly. I bought this as a little TV for my kitchen, but the delayed touch response was so maddening I couldn't deal with it for more than 2 days.  The streaming capabilities are very limited. While it does have all the services (Hulu, Netflix, et al) you can only start where you left off so it's impossible to rewatch a previous episode unless you start it on a different device. I also tried asking Alexa for a specific show, season and episode. I think she may have had a mini stroke trying to sort it out.

I really want to take it apart to figure out how its producing the bass.  I mean this thing is packing some serious bass hitting speaker or something.  First I thought it was my TVs audio system's subwoofer that was bumping but to my amaze it was actually this device.  Unfortunately there is a downfall.  It doesn't have a camera cover built in like the echo show 5. Pros - Perfect sized screen.  The sound is amazing good. Great piece for the living room. Cons - No camera cover.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jul 2019,Weblee,I am going to write a long review here because Amazon does not seem to have an easily accessible  technical support channel for customers who purchase and use Alexa devices.  One way or another my laptop got a virus that was sending out massive amounts of spam so my ISP IP address was blacklisted.  I re-imaged my laptop deleting everything and everything on my home network was reset to factory defaults along with reinstalling firmware where possible.  Once everything was online I noticed my Alexa dot was connecting in a manner I found suspicious.  It was a challenge getting a technical person but Amazon customer service lined one up and then tracked me down after I abandoned a call to customer service. My household depends on the Alexa devices for lighting and device control so having them offline for a while had a big impact.  I'm relieved  now that I know the level of security that is baked in.,Great tech support when you finally get a technical person

I can see what’s going on downstairs or even connect to my parents Show 5 I got for them for a video call.. I have the Philips Hue system to control all the lights and it links to all my TV’s, alarm system, doorbell, my music and video apps and stereo amps, so I can voice control my entire house now, thanks to the awesome Prime Days deals! Even if you just have it as a stand-alone device and have no Alexa compatible devices, it’s a must have!! I had 2 power strips that it discovered and I had no idea they were Alexa compatible! Very impressive system.. another reason it’s a must have is if you have a ring doorbell or any cameras with your alarm system, you just add an app, login and you can see/control everything. I have motion zones on my security cameras and I have it set to automatically pop up whichever cam was triggered. You can do that with Ring, too but I have it set to just say “Alexa, Show (video with audio from the camera but your audio is muted) or if you say answer front Door it pops up with your audio un-muted (so you can talk back and forth).

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2019,Scott W,"After using Google's suite of products for several years, I decided for a change given Google's security practices and fumbling around with integration/Nest changes/whatever else they'll change next week. I've owned a Dot for several years and added to the collection with a couple more Dots, couple Shows and other devices. The Echo family feels more integrated and natural than Google devices. However, I've found Echo searches (like web searches) to be a little more limited in some cases than with Google - no real surprise there unless they switch over to Google's search in the background. No biggy though since I still have my browser and phone when I need to fall back. As far as the look goes, The Echo Show 2nd Gen is rather large. My wife immediately took it over and placed it in the kitchen. It does look nice and she enjoys the fast recipe searches as well as some toons while cooking. The base is definitely sturdy and isn't going anywhere without someone intentionally moving it. I've got the black model and it looks rather nice overall. Videos play well and look ok. The brightness could stand a little work and under different lighting conditions, it isn't necessarily what I'd want to spend any large amount of time. Sound, as with all these devices is ok and nothing stellar. About as good as built in speakers on a TV I suppose. You can fiddle with the bass, treble and mid range to get slightly better sound. It's decent enough for a small set of speakers and serves the purpose. One thing that I really like about the Show is the ability to connect to other devices like an intercom. This feature works very good and if you've got a camera on both ends, it even functions as a video call (similar to Duo in Google land). The ability to send a text message (which is read aloud) and notification (requires user action to read) and even call from your phone are all big pluses as well. I was much more impressed with how well this worked with the Echo family than what Google comparatively has. An odd downer on the Show 2nd Gen is a rather stupid glitch that has apparently existed for over 6 months and Amazon has completely failed to correct. If you unplug the device from the wall and then plug back in, most all the time, the sound will not work. The only remedy is to unplug the power cord from the device itself (not the brick at the outlet), wait a couple seconds and then plug it back in. Do that and all is well. So if you ever move it, plug into the wall first, then into the device. So this isn't the end of the world, although one does have to wonder what kind of fubar they have going on where the order of plugging something in breaks it. Lost a star on this one. Overall, I am really enjoying the Echo family and this device in particular more than the Google family. There's some features that Amazon has done better and with the skills system, you do get to try out some extras whereas Google sees fit to be an Apple tool now and lock everybody out. With Amazon putting these puppies on sale so much, I'm glad I took the plunge and switched over.",Very happy minus the power/sound issue
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Dec 2019,MikeB,"I'm not a fan of this device so far. In fact, I was in the kitchen trying to use the device and I'm having such a hard time I decided to come and write this review. I use my Echo Show in the kitchen - as a photo frame when idle, for kitchen timers, to watch shows, and to look things up on occasion. As a photo frame, it does ok. I think I'm with about 99% of the reviewers by being disappointed that you can't use this as just a frame. It always has to display something to promote their products/services....try this skill, buy that product. The timer feature works well. I like that I can name the timers and have multiple. Of course, they always have to screw something up. In the case of timers, the timers (with names) will display for a short while. Then the screen will go into frame mode and only display one timer with no label. So now you can't just glance at the device and know. Now you have to do something with it to display what it should be displaying to begin with. When you have active timers, just display all the timers with their names. Geez! Watching a show was not an easy task. I started with ""Play The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."" That didn't pull up anything right away. It took a few attempts to pull up the show. When it did, I expected it to start with my next episode. This was not the case. In fact, it didn't reflect which episodes I had watched already vs. not. I had to figure it out on my own. The device does not listen well. As I stated, I have this in the kitchen. I also have an echo dot in the other room....on the other side of the room. It's about 30 feet away. I would estimate about 50% of the time when I say ""Alexa"", the echo dot in the other room picks up. I will put my face 6 inches away from the device and sometimes it still won't work. This is what just happened again that was so frustrating. Honestly, I don't want to use my voice for everything. I want the option. I think most of us are familiar with a tablet. My preference would be for the Echo Show to have an interface more like a tablet. The fact that you have to use voice for 95% of what you want to do, and this doesn't work well, causes me to get very frustrated. It doesn't seem like a premium device. It feels more like an entry-level experiment. On the plus side, the updates seem frequent. Who knows, maybe it will eventually get to state where it's not so frustrating to use. It's not there now.",Not exactly what I was expecting
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2019,iDRMRSR,"I bought this to replace an old school Echo speaker only.  I use that via bluetooth to play audio from a Microsoft Windows Surface device, audio that comes from a special server accessible by a browser like Chrome.  The old Echo speaker worked perfectly.  I wanted 2 more things, first, a slideshow of my Amazon photos, and second, a self-dimming clock.  Both those functions worked splendidly except... When streaming Bluetooth, the Echo Show would frequently just flat out stop working.  No audio.  Or after about an hour, the audio over the Bluetooth would become fuzzy and distorted and broken.  If I turned off the Windows device, the Echo Show still thought it was connected!  I had to restart the Show and repair the thing to my Windows device. While playing the audio, it would constantly show me ""Now Playing"", which interrupted the slideshow and clock entirely!  No way of turning that off that I could find.  And worse the Show would randomly connect and disconnect with the Windows over Bluetooth.  USELESS TO ME IN THIS STATE!  I wanted the better audio from this to play while it just kept displaying my photos and appointments on the home screen, but no, it kept switching over to NOW PLAYING.  What an awful thing. I've been using my Echo Speaker Only for two or more years without problem!  I wish this Show would achieve the level of connectivity and reliability.  I now have my old Echo Speaker, with the microphone muted, sitting next to the show so I can play my audio AND display my photos and appointments and clock continuously. It's unacceptable to have two of these things next to each other!  Worse yet, if you have multiple Echo devices within earshot of each other, and I mean one or two rooms away, when you say Alexa, they all wake up and dogpile each other and it's a crapshoot which device will actually process your command, like ""Alexa, what time is it"". They should allow you to set ANY WORD as a WAKE WORD so that  you can address each one separately and uniquely.  Furthermore, when one device (wake word Alexa) announces that you have an AMAZON shipment, another device nearby with the wake word of AMAZON will wake up and almost attempt to reorder the item. This smart speaker world is fraught with frustrating pitfalls especially when one of them THINKS it hears it's name, or an Amazon Alexa advertisement is playing on the TV and they all wake up stupidly. PLEASE FIX THIS.  Getting rid of these rough edges, and it would be a pleasure to have them around.",Considering returning this thing due to Bluetooth problems

Yeah of course Alexa works and the screen is cool at first, but like others have mentioned its subpar content make it kind of janky. THIS IS NOT A TABLET. You will pull your hair out trying to treat it as such, i learned this the hard way. I wanted to add some things but simply cannot due to how poor Amazon made the UI. You can tell her to search ""google"" and bring up a web browser. I was able to watch NBC football games like this, but ESPN, CBS and NFL Network all require location access, and since this is not a tablet, there is no way to enable those services. I feel like a lot of people learn these things the hard way after they get their Echo Show, so I feel obligated to let everyone know. If you're looking to buy an Alexa and don't have one, this is good. If you already have one and are looking for a little more control over your devices, this is great! If you are looking to put this on your desk for media content?

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jan 2020,Zax.,"Having a screen feels more natrual. I got into computer voice dictation back in 2006. And got the first echo device in my family when the 2nd gen eco first came out. And have used it quite a bit. I debated for a long while if having a screen was worth the investment. And finially told myself ""if I've had to think about it this much. I might as well try it"" and I'm thankful I did. The screen feels more natrual to the device. Having a voice dictation speaker has always been cool and useful. The vivid touch screen adds a nice amount of feedback that always seemed to have been missing. Its pleasing to ask for something and see it take place. The upgraded audio is also a huge plus. I was always reasonably impressed with the 2nd gen echo audio. For its size and mono set up it handled audio better then I expected. The audio on the echo show is more surprising still. You wouldn't expect to receive such deep tones and well balanced highs from a computer screen, of course it wont out do any of my multi thousand dollar audio systems. Nor would I expect it to. For a bed side device its ample and effective. Exceeding expectations. The touchscreen is responsive enough to enjoy using, color and contrast are generous with high quality visuals nothing seems faded out, another concern was viewing angles. There is nothing to be concerned of with it however. Build quality and materials gives it a premium feel the glass screen is highly finished while the fabric speaker grill is tight and well made. Features are plentiful, from weather and pictures to noise machine and alarm clock. YouTube viewed from a browser is extremely responsive. To summarize it. They did a good job making this device. And if you're familiar with smart speakers you should find yourself enjoying the added feedback of a screen. I wont tell anyone they must upgrade to this device because you really dont need to. However if you're getting your first smart device or you're interested in the newer tech it offers. You should buy one. The most important thing to understand is what it can do. What it cant. And what it's good and not good at. If you go into the purchase educated, you will not be let down. If you think you'll replace a computer or tablet with it however, I can't help you when you feel slighted.... that is simply put, not the devices fault.","Visuals are a welcomed feedback experience, it will not however replace your tablet."

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,Jeff Probst,"As others have said ( yes I read the reviews, but thought I could get around it) you must have smart phone. I'm attempting to set this up for my 85 year old mother in law that has no idea how to use a smart phone, let alone an app. She did not have a cell phone so we purchased one of the only remaining big button flip phones available, thinking all we have to do is switch over from my wife's cell phone number to the new flip phone. No you have to call Amazon in order to change the phone number, you also have to receive the text message. While on support line call I attempted to have the text sent twice, no text. Amazon support says, its the phone carrier blocking texts, and that they cant reach the carrier. Funny thing is I called the carrier right after  hanging up with Amazon support and talked to someone there. Their not blocking texts. This is by far the most aggravating POS, I've ever tried to use. Why would you make a device that cant be accessed from any home computer for setup? Why do I need to call support to change the phone number linked to an account that I set up and have full access to? This truly is the dumbest piece of ""Smart"" technology I've ever seen. We also purchased a Ring doorbell/camera for use with the show, it does not do what you expect it to do either. The video doesn't go straight to the show when the bell is rung, you have to tell Alexa to show the front door. Someone obviously rang the bell, show me who is at the door, duh!! No the video has to go somewhere into the either then you have to tell this smart device to give you the video. Stupid!!! We also wanted to have family pictures as a screen saver, also a PITA. You need a FB account or some other account, you cant load them into the app, or to the device, or a memory card. There are simple picture frames that allow you to install a memory card with all the pictures you want, not this POS!! If your setting this up for your own home, it's probably pretty painless. If your trying to set it up for someone else, especially an elderly family member forget about it. It's far too complicated and aggravating. I'm stubborn, it's too close to Christmas, and so I will get it to work one way or another, but it should not be this ridiculous to get this to work!! After calling customer support to have my wife and name removed from the account and leave my mother in law on the account with her new phone number, they removed her and the number we had setup. Her name and wife's number were still on the account.  Another phone call to change the number, another text message, that mysteriously worked the first time. Next was getting the ring to work with it. Called customer service once again, after going thru every step including resetting everything back to factory settings the CSR and I were both about to give up. Then she asked me to ask Alexa who's account we were in. It was still somehow on my account??? Installed everything Christmas eve, would like to say it was painless, but no there were a few issues, mostly with the doorbell, anyway it's in. It's been two days, my oldest daughter lives with my mother in law, she says she awoke at 2am by rap music blasting from the show. My startled 85 year old mother in law is sitting in front of it not knowing what to do. Apparently my mother in law has been sitting in front of the show reading the stupid suggestions all night thinking that Alexa needs her to do them!!!

Nice screen size, excellent sound quality, good mic clarity. Everything works well, the only frustrating part is even though it recognises each user's voice, it will not automatically switch to use their account. You have to manually ask her to switch user accounts even though she know who's talking! And while she does well most of the time, there are times when she is maddeningly frustrating with her ""I can't help with that!""",Nice screen and speaker
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2019,J. Williamson,"This was purchased as a replacement for the Kindle Fire in the Show Mode Charging Dock that was used in the kitchen.  Although the Fire was terrific for accessing stored data and watching Dish TV in the app, it was somewhat unstable on the dock.  Therefore, it was replaced with the Echo Show.  I had expectations that it would work as well for those purposes but not be so unstable as in a dock. Echo Show Good:  The screen images and sound are fantastic for a device of this size.  It is responsive and fast. Echo Show Not so Good: No apps, but it must use skills.  That prevents watching the Dish Anywhere app in a simple way, as there is no skill for it.  I did find a work around by accessing it through the Silk browser, however, it fails to keep a connection and drops after less than 1 minute.  After multiple attempts to access it without interruptions, even after setting a bookmark, it's too frustrating to persist. Not so good: No ready access to Amazon Drive.  There is no skill?  It would be nice to access saved recipes that are stored as data.  The workaround, again, is to access the Silk browser (only say ""Silk"" - if you say ""Silk browser"" she does not understand), access Cloud Drive as you would on the computer, pull up the specific .pdf, which opens nicely in the window, click on the magnifying glass so that portions are large enough to read.  Nothing gets larger.  No response to the enlarge request.  Some photos will open sized to fit the horizontal screen but, for the purpose of accessing a document, it seems to be a fail. All in all, if you are interested in accessing recipe videos and saving them through the Echo Show platform, it works well.  If you like to listen to music or access predefined skills, it is fine.  If you want more specific interaction, the Kindle Fire works much better.",Mostly good
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2020,Joshua T. Wire,There is a lot to like about the echo show and a few major hang ups.  The biggest con is when you say “play baby Einstein videos” she responds “playing top result” then never actually loads the video.  Even a prime show “play the stinky and dirty show” results in a bing search instead of launching the free prime show on Amazon’s own service.  I tried adding “on prime” and it replied that nothing by that title exists.  Then once it does actually play the video will frequently stop playing.  My internet is great and works on other devices fine. By far the biggest complaint is video but this device has an issue actually launching a task.  It often gets hung up and you have to repeat yourself to get it to do something. I think it just needs a little more power to run itself. The things it does nicely are the digital picture frame mode while in standby.  You can go onto prime pictures and set what shows up.  You can say show pictures of “name” etc. With prime music the lyrics scroll along with song at the same time. It can be helpful to say show me a picture of a eastern bluebird etc and see what it looks like. All the things your standard echo will do this can too. Some things I wish were better.  It needs a dedicated set of free workout videos on screen.  Let’s do a cardio workout together etc. If you set your screen to pictures it would be nice if nba updates and random “things you can say” would stay off.  The video skills need serious work.  They need better YouTube support.  Needs a more snappy system. Overall we are satisfied with the purchase and use it a lot.  It’s a worthwhile purchase and they still have many kinks to fix,Playing video is a big problem.
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2019,VKSheridan,"I have 3 Echo Dot devices, 2 Echo Show (Gen 1) devices and one Echo Auto.  My home is loaded with smart devices that includes light switches, dimmers, stream devices, cameras, doorbells, garage controllers, plugs and door locks.  I want the ability to control anything and everything with just my voice.  If I counted up all the remote controls for just what’s in my living room, I’d have at least a dozen.  While the Echo Show doesn’t do a whole bunch more than the dot, it can show me what my cameras are staring out when triggered.  Instead of grabbing my phone to see what triggered them, I bark at Alexa and view the feed.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the Echo Show Gen 2 has a Zigbee hub built in.  It’s kind of a waste for me since I already have a SmartThings hub but it’s nice to know if the hub goes on the fritz as it might save me from replacing it.  I read how folks don’t like the size of the clock or the weather icons and had to laugh.  I just ask mine to tell me the time or weather as there’s really no sense trying to read it across the room.  I understand some folks hate the constant “Try this.....” on the home screen.  Set the “Do Not Disturb” to 24\7 and it all goes away until you command the device to do something.  Once you’re done, it goes back to sleep.  The only gripe I have (If I can call it that) is sometimes the command recognition isn’t the best.  Telling it to turn on the ceiling fan sounds nothing like turn off the porch light but sometimes, Alexa gets either confused or disoriented when there is some background noise.  Beyond that, I enjoy trying to see just hw many things I can automate with this device.",Function is only limited by creativity......
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2019,The Shopinator,"THIS is the product that SHOULD have been the Gen1 release and every feature (of the guts) was available and affordable to make, so I wanted to get that criticism out of the way straight up. Now the goods and bads, mixed by feature. Come for the sound? Stay for the display. The reality is that this is NOT HD, but ED, 720p for video playback. HD is 1080p for video playback. If UHD can be built into cellphones, not even phablets, then the raw displays and drivers are clearly MUCH cheaper as they increase in size. Still, this is a much better, approximately twice as large display than the Gen1 Show's display, though it doesn't seem to be any brighter, something I've seen lab-tested to be so. Since this is not OLED, it's not going to do better in your sun-drenched kitchen than the Gen1 did, even if it is clearer and larger so you can see it more easily on the other side of your island. But what really disappointed people most in the Gen1 Show was the sound. Not that it was bad... it just wasn't good. I have $30 portable radios that blow it away. The recently upgraded software for Spot/Show helps GREATLY by finally providing individual bass/mid/treble controls which most people will set wrong. And while the bass and ""whomp"" is MUCH better from the new Gen2 Show, it's typical big passive radiator v tiny active driver sound. Flabby and prone to splat, even at moderate volume (maybe halfway up with a good sounding recording like stuff from GRP). So, sure, it's able to play louder and it has more bass but it's not quality bass. If there was enough room for a huge passive radiator and the cavity(s) needed to make it function properly, there was room for an active bass driver with a smaller passive so it would be in much better control using a folded audio waveguide, if needed, perhaps even as a replacement for the passive. Most people can't hear that this isn't quite there but people who are accustomed to real audio, my career background serving audiophiles for decades, know better than to go for passives. But they're cheap, so I get it. Lots of bang for the buck... or whomp for the buck. At lower volumes, though, it works and sitting on my desk in front of my second monitor, it couples will with the desk surface for bass I feel in my hands. I will experiment to see if this is a good thing or if decoupling is smarter. Also, this new larger Gen2 Show is actually SHORTER than the Gen1, so it is easier to put on a desk with other media equipment and still see behind it, key for me, even if it is much wider and deeper. Please continue reading in my replies since AMZ doesn't like long reviews even when they are very detailed and warranted...","AMZ is getting much closer with the Gen2 Show, a good upgrade!"

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Mar 2020,Techno Nana,"First I must admit I am an Alexa junkie.  I started with the dot, the dot in colors, the Echo, the Echo in colors, and now the ones with screens.  The smallest one in my guest room, the mid size in the kitchen and the big guy in my home office.  My office is in the back of the house far from the front door.  I can ask it to show me the front door and, while taking a few seconds to do it, it does.  So I know whether to go answer the door, or if there are more Amazon packages left out in front.  Could be just a plant blowing in the wind.  But I am a single older woman trying to make my house smarter than I will be in a few years.  Some of the Alexa products came free with other things like my Ring Doorbell or my new subscription to Sirius.  I give them as presents but I LOVE having them all over the house so I can say “Alexa play Mellow Folk EVERYWHERE”!  My house is then filled with music, good quality sound, in every single room —even the bathroom.  Will I sneak watching an episode of Grey’s Anatomy on the 10 inch screen, yup already have.  I do have an iPad Pro that is for other things.  I also have several kindles.  This one is more for my piece of mind, living alone after my husband died in 2018.  My new house is set to be run my Alexa.  Only the iRomba doesn’t listen to her very well.  But sometimes I feel like I have a roommate who turns off the lights when I ask and keeps track of my shopping list.  Now I can see what is going on too!!!!

I bought the Alexa Show so that my kids could communicate with others and myself while at home, for access to Hulu and a fun tech item.  I have been able to communicate to my wife but others have not been as intuitive.  I know my son tried calling me yesterday and it nothing came through even though I was on the phone.  I'm going to have to play with it to figure it out.  I just wished it was more intuitive.  Hulu does work and it is not to have on in the kitchen where we have placed the Amazon Show.  But you have to ask for specific shows.  There is no way to surf your account or pick a specific episode.  I wish I had some navigation capability.  I also wished it had some YouTube functionality.  I realize that it is owned by a competitor but there could at least be some internet functionality that would allow you to access it online.  I also wished it had the ability to connect with my Pinterest account.  I use Pinterest with a lot of recipes and I would enjoy having it on my Amazon Show.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2018,avex,"I wanted a smart home assistant with a video display that showed me a feed of my smart cameras (specifically my Ring doorbell) and that functioned as a digital picture frame. So the Amazon Echo Show does show me the feed of my Ring doorbell, but my expectations were the Echo Show to display the feed if someone rang the doorbell. It's a bit cumbersome needing to ask ""Alexa"" to show the camera IF you know that someone is at the door.  Ideally, this functioned more like the Nest doorbell + Google home mini hub. It's kind of a head scratcher why this feature wasn't included as it's a pretty common use case people would expect to have. My 2nd complaint is that it does not continuously cycle through my Amazon photos.  After a while, it just stays on one photo.  I've read that unplugging/plugging in the device would cycle through the photos again (or asking ""Alexa"" to play slideshow). Knowing what I know now, I probably would have opted for a Nest doorbell to go with my Google home mini hub for my home video surveillance needs (although I would still be using the less expensive Echo devices since I prefer ""Alexa"" voice commands) and skipped purchasing this. What I like about the device is that it's loud, bright, the on screen display for light controls and the rotating photo display (when it works).",Mediocre echo device for what I wanted

Alexa is reasonably good at answering questions, and is infinitely better at getting you information than the Siri HomePod.  It is even comparable to Google's intelligent home puck in terms of getting you answers.  Overall, it is way better than Google because of the large number of very helpful and entertaining apps that are growing for the Amazon ecosystem. The sound quality, however, is terrible and not even close to the same league as the sound quality in the Siri HomePod.  Not sure if it is better to get a cheap echo puck and connect it to a good sound system, but this would be the better solution if you want good sound quality. It is neat, however, to be able to view videos on Youtube on this, in addition to Prime videos.  Not sure if it can do Netflix, but that would be a killer app for this appliance.  We don't have Hulu or an equivalent for it in Canada, but my Echo Show in the USA works beautifully with Hulu, and it is really nice to be able to use it on the counter when we are cooking, etc. This is a good thing to buy if you tend to be an ""early adopter"" of technology, as such people tend to be more forgiving of new technological solutions to problems they didn't know they had.","As good as an echo puck for voice recognition, but sound quality is poor."

The increased screen size is much better and easier to read from a distance.  If you are looking for a central Echo Show to have video conferences with other family members this is a nice one since you can have a few people participate in the call.  We keep ours in the kitchen which is the household hub so it works out great.  You can even video conference and drop in on multiple echo shows in the same house since we moved the old one upstairs.  It also integrates perfectly with our ring door bell system.  We have 3 echo shows distributed around the house so you never have to run downstairs to see who is at the front door.,Replaced my first gen Echo with this one.

I listen to it all, from Country to 90's rap.... The Beetles to Disturbed. I was blown away by the quality of the sound output. It makes cooking and cleaning more enjoyable and upbeat. If music really isn't your thing, you should be impressed with the recipe finder and follower feature (I'm sure there is a legit name for this feature but ""Recipe Finder and Follower"" just rolls off the tongue so I'm sticking with it). The Echo Show pulls recipes from various websites, and doesn't just force you to follow some site that has paid extra fees to be featured. If you select your recipe, Alexa will even read it to you step by step. My 11 year old loves the Echo Show because he can easily find videos he wants to share with me by simply saying ""Alexa, find me a video of Ariana Grande doing impressions of other singers"", etc.....and then selecting the right video. The device has also solved petty arguments such as ""does green colored mucus mean you have an infection?"". My 14 year old loves it because he can ask those hard to answer questions like ""How much am I worth on the Black Market?"" or ""Why is my mom so bossy?"". The multitude of ways this device can make your life easier is amazing. The only con I have noticed so far is that sometimes I have to say ""Alexa"" repeatedly when it is playing music. That's more of an annoyance than a real problem unless you are listening to some raunchy rap or Bill Burr when your child walks in.",The sound on this thing!!!!!!!

The idea of a screen to communicate is shrouded with incessant messages, haptic feedback, miserable intelligence and overall inconvenience. You will be much better off buying a cheap iPad and using the Echo Dot so you can at least move it. Ideas to improve for the next generation: -IMPROVE THE TOUCH SCREEN The screen is so unresponsive, I'd love to give up on it entirely. I have to press ""buttons"" on the screen five or more times for it to register. While I'd love to alleviate these woes with voice commands, the device is severely impaired and has selective hearing. Often times my commands won't even have a single understood word. As much as I'd like to tell my Echo Show to ""stop giving me command options,"" it won't ""know that."" -Display options If I have to see one more ""Try, Alexa, tell me something weird"" prompt, I might throw up. You're a passive device, not my reluctant friend with ADD. -Improved syncing: While your speakers are marginally better than previous Echo devices, the connection between devices to have multi room music is awful. They are not in sync and it sounds collectively distorted and unpleasant to say the least. Can I have my money back?","Obnoxious, Infuriating, Antiquated"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2020,Mr. Eddie S.,"I just got this Echo Show 2nd gen today and I know it’s way too early to be writing a review on it, but I found a few problems with this version that I hope Amazon will address in a system update very very soon. The first problem I found with the device is, when turning the camera off in settings it also auto turns the screen off when you don’t use the device for a very short time. I like for my screen to stay active at all times and hopefully this will be something that Amazon will work out very soon, because safety should always be number one goal and for this reason I want to keep the option to keep my camera off. Another issue that I found is the time and weather display in the upper left corner of the screen is smaller than that on my Echo Show 8 HD. This is something else that I hope that Amazon will look into and fix in a system update very soon. After all, it is important to be able to see these things from a distance away. So far these have been the only cons that I found in this version so far. Everything else I like a great deal, the picture and sound quality, screen size, and not to even mention something that I didn’t even see mention before buying unless I was too excited and over looked it, but this baby comes equipped with an Intel Processor as well which makes me feel even this much better about ownership. I have yet to pair my phone with this version like I did with my version 8 but plan to do so very soon for an even better musical experience. As for my Echo Dot, well I hope it enjoy it’s retirement. Overall, I am very please to say that I got the Echo Show that I always wanted and that is this 2nd Generation. If you too enjoy a powerful music experience, this is the way to go, the Echo Show 2nd Generation, happy shopping. Update, and I don’t believe this pertain to this device but all. I found while adding more basketball teams to my echo devices that the number is limited. This is something that Amazon need to look into and fix soon. I feel that there should never be a limit on anything you feed to these devices and not being able to add all the teams that I want, might they be my favorite or not is a turn off for me. Another thing that doesn’t pertain to these devices [kind of] that someone else mention that should be brought to Amazon attention and that is this thing with being limited to what music, etc you can and can’t hear. I feel that being prime members should entitle us to all that amazon have to offer. After all not only do we pay for being prime members, we are also loyal customers who should have all that Amazon has to offer. Besides, it does get annoying being told that the song you are trying to hear is only available through a prime music account. I also believe that this would boost the sales of Echo devices because people will a unlimited world sort of speak. Update: I don’t know if I mention this or not, but something else I noticed that hopefully Amazon will take note of and fix in a system update very soon, when you have information on the screen no matter what type of information or duration that information should stay there until you the user go to the home screen. With the screen going back to home by itself can lead to a bit of a problem in cases where you are not done with the information at hand.",An Awesome Device with a Few Hiccups and Suggestions
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Sep 2019,J-Babe,"When I bought this during Amazon's ""Prime Day"", I was excited to give it a shot. I love my Echo devices and use them all the time. I figured this one would be a fine addition to my collection. By and large, it is, but there are a few things that led to the 3-star rating, which I will explain below. First, sound quality and voice recognition on this thing are superb. Video quality is quite good too, though from my own eyes I would say most top end tablets have this thing beat handidly. This thing will hear you from wherever you are in your house, and you will hear it. Now, the reason I didn't give it 5-stars is this: I don't see how truly more useful this thing is over my other Echo devices. Its limited functionality as a screen device is what brings it down for me. There is very, very limited ""app"" support (and good lulck trying to side-load anything). You're at the whim of the Amazon catalog, which basically limits your video options to Amazon Prime and Twitch - both of which are fabulously entertaining platforms, but still very limiting. This device flourishes in a kitchen setting where you can view recipes and watch on-screen instructions, but the options there seem quite limited and not as versatile as just having a good cookbook by your side. Its a great device for music, but so are the other Echo devices. The option for on-screen lyrics is neat, but also useless in the grand scheme of things. By and large, what makes this device great is also what makes it hard to review: its really meant for the kitchen. I tried it as a bedside table device, and it didn't really ad anything. Tried it as a living room device, but for what purpose? In the kitchen? That's where its meant to be. And that, combined with what I mentioned above, is its limiting factor.",Limited use for a touch-screen Echo device

I came across a great cyber Monday sale and so we decided to give it a try. I wanted this one specifically for my kitchen, for recipes and videos. I read up a lot on it in advance, how to speak to it etc. There is a definitely some training on both sides. I approached it with patience as I figured out the right way to ask it do what I wanted. My husband (who normally hates technology) quickly took to it and loved it. It has a long way to go yet as far as being a bit more intuitive. There are moments I'm glad it has a screen, when it gets befuddled over ""return to the song"" (or something silly) I can just walk over and tap the screen to get what I want. Sometimes it trips over itself. But, I can have my hands in the oven and baking and ask ""Alexa, set timer for 6 minutes"" (you can set multiple timers with different names - whaaaat?) while I'm watching some random tv show or news, or listening to music. ""Alexa, how many tablespoons are in a half cup"" or ""...set a reminder pick up my prescription"", ""add garlic to my shopping list"" ""what's on my to do list for tomorrow?"" Catch my drift? I really have found it super handy.  I also listen to MORE music. I pay for Amazon music subscription but really only listened on my phone at the gym etc. Now on a whim, I find I come home from work and ask ""Alexa, play radiohead"" or something random while I'm taking off my coat, and voila! The quicker/easier access to music makes me utilize the service so much more. I'm still a bit wary of the security, so I've left some things out. I didn't connect my contact list, as I wouldn't want an accidental call to go out to someone while we're having too many glasses of wine at 11pm. No one needs that. The drop in thing is no-go for me. I locked down as much as I could on that stuff. I like that there is a mute button I can press when I don't want her to listen, but we haven't used that as much as we thought we would. I've used it when talking ""about her"" to someone else on the phone (she kept piping into the conversation with her confusion, LOL. MUTE it Alexa.) There's also a ton I still haven't tried. I haven't done any shopping on it. I haven't used it for smart home items. I haven't even used the Skype. And I STILL use it constantly and feel like its been impactful in our home. All in all, a few gaps to work around so not nearly seamless, but otherwise, it's truly changed our kitchen experience for the better. So many neat little features. I rated it 5 stars based on how awesome this technology is and how great it is at some of these features. I was tempted to go 4 because it has so much further to go, but that didn't seem fair. It's a new technology. I grew up in a world before cell phones - so when I compare that and consider how far this has all come? 5 stars.",We caved. First Alexa specific product. Love it!
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 May 2020,chaedog,"So we've had our Echo Show here now for a long time and we primarily upgraded from the first gen show because we wanted better sound and this device does have better sound.  However I'm not sure what happened, I think there must have been an update a month or two ago that has really made the device kind of sluggish.  We'll be standing next to the show, facing it and when we ask Alexa something a different echo device that's in a different room will respond because the Echo Show now takes a second to respond or so it seems.  It also will just randomly stop playing music or when you ask to have it shuffle songs by a group it'll play one song and then just stop playing.  We're constantly having to restart it because of this, usually after a restart it'll work fine for a bit.  Its not a home wi-fi or internet issue, we have plenty of wi-fi setup throughout the house and use a mesh network and our Echo Show is right near one of the devices even. I'm kind of bummed, I mean we enjoy our echo devices but when they don't consistently work its quite frustrating.  I think this might be our last Echo device and we'll slowly phase them out and replace with something else, when that happens I guess we'll cancel our Amazon Music unlimited subscription too, no use giving them more of our money.","Better sound than first gen show, but other things are worse!"

This is a surprise gift for his Christmas. The show was packaged great, it felt like I was opening a new iPhone. The setup couldn't have been simpler, as I don't really like the Alexa app. Everything was done on the screen and there was no need for the app. I did mess up the setup by mistyping my phone number and that led me to call Amazon but they were able to fix that quickly. I was quite impressed with the overall build quality, the speakers were loud and it has decent bass. Also, the screen brightness automatically adjusts to fit surroundings, so when I wake up I am not blinded. I purchased this with the Wyze Cam $5 addon, and I will leave a review there for that. But the ability to pull up cameras (this is my first show) and see them it fantastic. I couldn't be happier with this Show.",Setup not done on App
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jan 2020,Amazon shopper,"Alexa and my Echo Show is one of the most helpful life tools. I am so surprised at the amount of “skills” she has. I can just ask her to search something, set a reminder, add things to my ti-do list, add items to my shopping list, ask for interesting facts, news stories, recipes and more. I can also tel her to play music of a certain genre. You can set up routines and Alexa will be triggered by a code phrase, such as “Welcome me home” or “Good morning”. For example, after setting up a morning routine, I can tell Alexa “good morning” and she responds by telling me that I’m blessed, then goes into details about my traffic route to work. She then tells me the news. I was able to add whatever “skill” I wanted her to do during my morning routine. I can also tell Alexa to open movies, play clips and open videos on YouTube. I also have Echo dots in different rooms, so I can “drop in” and speak to whoever’s in that room even when I’m at work  I can Link all dots with my Echo Show to play music on every speaker throughout the house. I can also do video calls with whoever has an Echo Show. I can send voice messages to my family even when I’m away from home. There’s more, but I’d recommend purchasing to find out other skills that Alexa can do. The Show can do more than the Dot, only due to the video features on the Show.","Try it, and you’ll wish you bought it earlier"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Sep 2019,3rd Time is a Charmer,"Integration into the ecosystem. It is an all or nothing thing in my opinion. Our household is fully engulfed by Amazon. My 1 yr old's first word was ""Alexa""! I got the Show during Prime Day. As with all technology, in order to keep up with smooth functionality, devices need to be upgraded. The Show is definitely more responsive than my 1st gen Echo. Pros: Sound - for a multifunctional product, the sound the Show produces is quite impressive. Responsiveness - Voice recognition is so sensitive that it sometimes picks up my voice from across the house Cons: Interface - Some will argue it just is not meant for this type of UI. I feel it would definitely benefit from having more tablet like functionality. There is nothing worse than repeating yourself 5 times to no avail. As mentioned in some other reviews, trying to watch movies on the Show is complicated to say the least. Integration - Alexa just isn't able to do everything the Show wants it to be able to do. I would love for everything to be hands-free, but only if it serves its purpose. Alexa responds quickly, but not always accurately. Overall, it is great device. Especially if you can get it for under $150. I got the Show to provide easier access to my Ring Cams (another amazon product), and video chat with older relatives. For these purposes, it holds up its end of the bargain.","Room for Improvement, but surprisingly pleasant"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2020,James A. Hodder,"This was a good value item to me. I bought the bundled Show (10"") that came with a Phillips hue light bulb, and a reduced price echo dot. I am very pleased. It's not perfect, but I have no serious complaints. The sound quality is very good, and I only rated it 4 stars because I like a little more bass. It will probably please most people. The integration is easy. I turned it on, and since I already owned a tap, it hooked right up to my intranet WiFi. I put the echo do in another room and once I enabled both the Show and the Dot for communications, I had intercom capability on demand to our computer room. The voice recognition is actually pretty amazing, and it can almost hear you even if you whisper. One minor complaint, is that I have an old yahoo email account, and the device is currently not capable of letting add that account so I can see my mail. It allows gmail, icloud mail, Microsoft email and one more. I talked to customer service and they confirmed that currently the allowable list email providers that it can be integrated with does not include Yahoo. I plugged the Phillips light bulb in and got it to work after a couple of tries. The instructions were not quite clear. They indicated I had to turn on the light and then turn it off to activate it and get it to lock up to my WiFi. After I did that and it was unsuccessful, I quickly realized that there was no way the light would work with the switch off. Once I turned it to the on position, the app on my phone saw it. It works fine, and besides on and off control, you can control the brightness from the screen or by voice command. By the way, I was impressed with the Echo Dot sound quality. For such a little device, it puts out pretty good sound. It's not like high priced stereo, but it is decent. I am still playing with the Show, and learning some of the skills. There are hundreds of them. I appreciate that when it is idle, you can have the display show different information in sequence. One of them is a random skill that comes up and periodically changes at the bottom of the screen. Overall, I am very pleased with the Amazon Show.",Good value

If you're decidedly on team Alexa, this smart display is the one for you. The second generation Echo Show is miles ahead of the original, but many of the first generation device's characteristics remain.  Four microphones on the front of the device and four on the top only slightly change the look of the controls. As for better hearing, Alexa heard me the first time with the new Echo Show at distances where I had to repeat the wake word three or four times on the first generation unit, Also The redesign brought much-needed change which makes me a lot more likely to want an Echo Show on display in my own home. the second generation Echo Show sounds much fuller, deeper and just plain better than both its predecessor and the Lenovo Smart Display. That's true for video chatting, online content and music streaming. Yes, a Google Home or HomePod will still win out for room-filling, quality sound. But for a smart display the new Echo Show is no slouch. Speaking of Fire TV, the Echo Show will integrate with Fire TV Recast to put live TV on the Echo Show as a recording .Fire TV Recast is a DVR setup for your smart display. Not everyone will value watching real TV on a smart display, but if nothing else, Amazon is taking the logical step of marrying its video services to its video-capable hardware.",Amazon Finds the promised Land

Finally this black Friday had enough to get one and i don't regret it! We have it in our kitchen and I love listening to music on it. It plays the lyrics!! Now i can sing along even if i don't know the words!!!! I also love watching some prime videos on it while i cook and bake. I watched some Jack Ryan on it and the quality is soooo good!!! I finished watching it on my laptop and the quality was better on the show then my laptop! I cant wait for more of my friends to get this so we can do the video calling.

We originally bought the Echo Show 5"" and absolutely hated how the screen was small, sound was terrible, and and it just seemed overall slow and lagging. I love the idea of it, but the Echo Show 5 was a disappointment. However, I took a gamble and tried the Echo Show 10"" and I'm so glad we did!! I can't imagine my kitchen without it! Pros: - Sound quality is great - Nice to add ambient music while cooking to eating. - Screen is Large and Bright: Easy to watch videos of recipes and aid in meal preparation. - Video - I can call family/friends with the Echo Show easily and also check on my wyze cam for the nursery. - Many Functions - So many functions to play around with. From pictures to games to news or just a timer. Cons: - Some apps respond a little slow through Alexa but I'm unsure if its the developer or the echo. - Sometimes Alexa gets a little stupid and doesn't respond or listens and doesn't do anything. Overall, the pros way outweigh the cons and for us, it's a must-have product in our kitchen. I look forward to future Echo Show products and potential improvements!",A Must Have for the Kitchen!

We were never terribly impressed with those; it was nice having a touchscreen, but it was too small and while the sound was okay, it was nothing special either. Well, the 2nd generation Echo Show has a screen the size of a tablet and much, much better sound. I had been thinking about buying the Echo subwoofer, but I don't think it's really needed with this Echo Show; the only way to improve it much more would be to pipe the audio to the stereo receiver. We also got the adjustable stand for it, which is nice, but honestly it should be a standard included component rather than an add-on accessory. I deducted a star for the same complaints I had for the first generation Echo Show: Please, Amazon, give us the ability to TURN OFF the ""Try ""Alexa, (some random command"" suggestions. I hate them. Customers have been asking for this option since the day the Show was first released two years ago. And second, give us the means to display the clock (customizable would be best) and/or weather larger on the screen, like with the new Echo Show 5.",Huge improvement over the Echo Show first generation

It was easy to set up. I highly recommend getting the kindle book for this device as it certainly helped answer any questions that I had.  I did find a tech glitch that,  from an internet search, may be common to the Echo Show. I had no sound,  but when I unplugged the cord in back of the Show,  waited a bit, and replaced it,  the sound returned.  If I do not unplug the device from the base before unplugging from the wall first when moving the show elsewhere,  the sound disappears when I plug it back into the wall outlet.  So.....always unplug it from the base first,  if you have similar issues.  Fantastic sound,  by the way, and very stoutly built.","Great device,  a bit of a sound glitch."

Overall we like the concept, and the sound quality is good but there are a few things about it that are frustrating. I don't know how anyone can give this thing 5 stars though, primarily for the main reason below that it's slow. So about slow. I don't know how Amazon could ship this honestly in the state it's in. Drop in calls sometimes work fine and other times time out or take forever to connect. Same with skills. The Jeopardy skill regularly crashes back to the main screen and videos are slow to respond or become unresponsive for many 10s of seconds requiring me to manually cancel it or on rare occasion reboot the device.  Honestly in this area it needs polish.  I'd send it back if a replacement speaker wasn't the same price (I got it on a sale at a substantial discount). As others have noted as well it would be nice to have some more flexibility around what you want to see and how the screen acts.  As is its 'on rails' and Alexa seems to show whatever Amazon wants to show you and not based on any preference or interests you set. So that's a missed opportunity too. It does work okay with our Ring doorbell which is one of the reasons I bought it. But that can also be subject to the slowness I noted above as well.",It's nice but it's sloooowww

I couldn’t help investing in it to see if I really would like it. I give it a solid three. One of the top rated reviews express my frustrations to a T. I also purchased this in hopes of having a little entertainment hub in my home office. The music is great. The bass outstanding. The problem comes worth video content. As the earlier poster said all of the streaming apps are “lite” versions. Even if you link your accounts to them, the selection is paltry. Although it has a built in browser, there seems to be no way to sign into your account to retrieve videos you want to watch. The sound quality is poor on videos but outstanding in music. How did Amazon even pull that off??? The one plus that will make me keep this device (although the shortfall means I won’t be buying the next release) if the smart hub. The show comes with a built in hub that allows me to take to all my mixed up devices. No setting a scene and the having to dig up an app. I will keep it for the hub only",Give it a solid 3

With that positive impression, I purchased a second Show, the 10.1"" second generation unit for my kitchen.  What a disappointment, the Show 5 is an obviously more capable device.  The first disappointment came when I found out you can NOT control the display time out.  I want the Echo to display photos when on the home screen.  Instead, the display shuts itself off (except showing the time) after a couple of minutes, and there is no setting to control or disable it going to sleep.  It even goes to sleep when you are in the middle of watching the x-ray lyrics of a song being played.  Secondly, it has no Alexa app skills to display documents or saved HTML.  I want to display MY recipes that I have painstakingly accumulated over the years.  I can save them as almost any format (.XLS, .DOC, .TXT, .PDF, or HTML, etc.), but the Echo Show is NOT capable of displaying ANY format.  All it can do is display Alexa generated web images when you ask for a recipe.  So much potential, but so limited, and so poorly implemented.  My only hope is that they will improve the software over time.  With Amazon's vast resources, improvements like these should be a 'no brainer'.  Right now, its not even capable of being a decent electronic picture frame. Update 8/5/2019 I can hardly believe it, but Amazon contacted me regarding this review, and we were able to talk through the display timeout issue.  The rep agreed to submit my concerns to the development team regarding the display issue as well as my suggestions for future enhancements.  Way to go Amazon for actually listening!  I don't know if it was already in the works or not, but my Show 10.1"" is now displaying Amazon Photos correctly, without the display going to sleep.  The display still goes to sleep when showing background photos, but I have hope that will be corrected eventually.  As for future enhancements, like being able to display MY recipes (instead of just random website recipes) I guess we'll have to just wait and see.  I've decided to keep my Show, because it IS getting better, and Amazon actually listens.  I've upped it from 2 to 4 stars - only 4 stars because there is so much potential still to be realized.","Limited Functionality - Big Disappointment, BUT Getting Better"

There have been several times it plays music from my spotify on it's own and even after I stop it the music will again play on it's own a few times before it eventually stops. This, however, has not been a continuous problem. Likes...we have our in the kitchen. Its handy when I'm cooking to not be interrupted and just prompt Alexa to add items I've noticed I'm out of. I've used it to search recipes and have it handy while cooking (it can read aloud and follow along or you can read it yourself). It's easy to use to play music throughout the day, search for information, play games, or even shop. I often use it to set timers and alarms for various things and use it as our primary clock. It's easy for the kids to use too. When they ask us what the weather will be tomorrow or need information on a random fact they can ask Alexa on their own. You can prompt it from another room or stand near it and whisper (Alexa will whisper back and is handy when doing things like setting alarms after everyone else has gone to bed). The screen is a decent size and fits nicely on our counter top. Sound is decent but could be improved. We thought this was a cool item but were concerned it wouldnt be as useful but we were wrong!

Both of them are now outside the replacement window (November 2019) and now, oddly, both of them are having issues that are really making me angry.  The one will only play one song, then stop.  So when I say, Alexa, play the taylor swift Lover album, it plays the first song then stops.  It's been happening for a couple of weeks.  I've googled fixes, and no such luck.  The other show reboots daily.  Just, mid song it will stop and completely reboot!  I have no idea why.  It does play more than one song though.  So you can get in a few more songs before it just shuts off altogether. I NEVER write reviews.  But I'm writing because BOTH of my shows are going haywire, and I don't have options.

It's not just myself or on one device so I wonder what happened to make it worse rather than better. It's not horrible but definitely annoying! In general the Echo  devices are wonderful and the echo Show2 is definitely the best of all of them. I do have a suggestion...I do feel they should make a water resistant and easily cleanable version for those who would like to have an Echo Show in the bathroom or kitchen or even an out door version for people who would like one for thier yard. This is a wonderful item but it will not be good for a kitchen where it could have something splashing on it. Many people don't realize that YOU CAN TURN OFF THE CAMERA AND MIC by just taping the button on top. I also recommend that those who only want to turn off the camera occasionally but keep on the mic ....if you don't want to have to go into settings...to turn the camera off...buy these stick on camera covers with a slide button.  It doesn't damage the screen and works great! They are also cheap. I think I paid about $4 for 8 of them.,"Overall a great,useful device."

Once the trust is broken you stop using it. You stop asking questions to Alexa, effectively disabling the point of owning the device. I'm happy with the purchase because I was told the speaker system on this version was the best. It absolutely is. It is room filling, with tons of bass. It's quite amazing, really. There's a few things like timers, and lists that work better with a visual display, but it feels like they haven't worked on Alexa's vocabulary or fields of understanding at all. She says she doesn't know to a LOT of things. Hulu, does not work for me. I'm seeing a good mix of people who say it does and some saying it doesn't, but it will not connect to my login. It is also unstable at the login screen. There's a 'screen captcha' anti-bot segment to the login. I went through this thing 6 times.. At first it would barely load. It did seem to speed up, and I changed my login just to make sure I had a very simple one for the interface. If you get through the captcha with the correct login and password, it tells you that 'Hulu is not available at this time. Try again later.' I had a first attempt get stuck on this screen and not allow me to go back into the login section. I reset to factory defaults to get it back. This device.. It feels like an early 2000's piece of tech. It doesn't have that apple slick feel to it where everything just works, and obviously they released it slightly unpolished. I also can't get my nest thermostat to link. There's a huge lack of slickness to the pairing of external devices and services that I find very disappointing. Considering how simplified and scaled down a device this is, what exactly is it if it can't operate external devices particularly well and doesn't do as much as a tablet? We also own the 4K firetv cube, and the same problem happens. It wants you to be able to use it hands free, and encourages you to try, but because many of the things it wants you to do don't yet work well, (such as navigation and being stuck in netflix with no way to tell it to navigate towards the title called ""bah blah"", and having her tell you she doesn't know what the hell you mean), you realize immediately that it doesn't work well enough to let you do anything that the very first original echo could do, so, err.. Why does it exist? For the cube, you immediately go back to the remote, and for the show, you realize that you just got an original echo with a screen, and you won't be using it for anything else. For me, it's a decent bluetooth speaker that gives good weather reports. I like the speaker.. I like all the original things I liked about the original echo, but the visualization and video apps are currently being wasted. They would have been better off merging a full tablet with alexa, then at least you could navigate to and use hulu, and a web browser, etc etc while they catch up with her abilities. I'll update my review if they update and fix some problems. I really see a future in this series, but they need to slow it down and get it working better before crossing a platform into visual with a format that can't take advantage of it yet. It causes disappointment and brand wariness. *update* I attempted to login to hulu once again, and it simply worked right away. No idea what the issue was, but there was no delay. Just straight in. Also, I finally got my nest thermostat to pair. If I was of a suspicious mind, I would think it had something to do with my bad review that Amazon then contacted me over :D Deals a deal though. I'll raise the stars to 3 and hope they will work on her abilities that she has right now, not continuously add trinkets to a half working idea.",Not yet ready.
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jan 2019,Al M,"We ordered 2 of these., as Christmas Gifts. Expensive ones. One for my wife and one for our best friends in Fl. The one in Fl appears to be ok (Have not had a video call yet)  but the one for my wife has issues. When she attempted to contact me it would dial our daughter (even though it has MY number listed) This has been partially fixed by customer service. Our contact lists do not fully show on the device. C/S currently trying to resolve. When making a call from the Echo Show it is supposed to default to making a video call. It did when it accidentally called our daughter but once they fixed that it no longer calls in video. Yet if the Show is called from our cell phones it answers in video. It's been almost 3 weeks and we're still dealing with technical assistance. I think they should either give us another unit or get this one properly operational. By the way, on 2 of the tech calls, the tech was unable to correct any of the issues and just disconnected the call! The current tech adviser is polite and trying to resolve the issues but we are losing patience. We also purchased a Ring Doorbell from Amazon to use in conjunction with the Echo Show but we won't attach it until the issues have been resolved. As far as using the other functions (like a Dot) they work fine.  We've always had a great experience with the Amazon service and I'd rather not have to have our credit card company cancel payment but this has gone on too long! I would like someone to intervene and get this issue resolved. PLEASE.",Hasn't worked right since we opened it (Christmas Gift)
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2018,Rocky Mount Eddie,"I received the 2nd generation Show along with two 3rd generation Dots (which I paired for stereo) and immediately set up the Show. It was easy, and in a matter of minutes I was up and running. I began familiarizing myself with its nuances. It wasn't much of a learning curve, as I own the Spot, so...  I must say I was impressed with the screen resolution and size. Bright, easily readable from across the room. I love the color details when viewing Youtube videos, as it was faithfully reproduced. Music was loud, and some good bass was present. It was easily navigable via the touch screen, or voice commands. And the browsers, Firefox and Silk, launch on command. Cool. Say, 'launch Youtube', and you're there. Sign in to you YT account, and play all videos in your History; or simply tap the address bar, and when the keyboard appears, type in what you want to see.  It isn't a seamless way to go about it, but at least it works. All-in-all, the Show really delivers on Amazon's stated features and capabilities. I am happy with the Show, and if you aren't very picky, you may be too. Let's begin... Should you consider purchasing the 2nd gen. Echo Show?  If you like your music sounding great; if you like watching videos on an immersive 10"" screen; if you want to browse the internet as you would on a large tablet; watch Vevo or Youtube--yes, you should consider the Echo Show over its competitors. The 2nd generation Echo Show is vastly improved over the 1st generation Echo Show, which looked boxy, and had only seven inches of real screen real estate. Sound on that one was, at best, acceptable. Nothing to dance about, though. But on the newer incarnation the sound quality is quite good--no, damn good! You'll get powerful stereo sound. Bass punches solidly, so that you can actually feel it. Highs and mids takes care of rounding out the music quite well, and in stereo. Amazon improved the speaker system so, that you'll wonder how it could sound so good from a smallish footprint. But it does! And this thing can get quite loud. It filled our rather large bedroom without distortion, even nearly way up. Put it in a large living and your next party will be complete with D.J. Alexa on hand. Getting around on the internet with either the Silk browser or Firefox was as easy as saying, ""Alexa, open..."", and you're taken to the browser where you key-in what site you wish to visit. Sure, the on-screen keyboard is a bit clunky, but you get used to it. I've not tested the video-calling feature, or the drop-in feature, but from the rave reviews on Amazon about this, it's a winner. Skype will soon be coming to the Show. I was impressed by the screen quality and accurate color reproduction, even from across the room. Most aren't going to want to sit through an entire two-hour movie, though, but you could if you wanted to. A greater majority relegate the Show to kitchen duty, where it shines. Still, any room (not the bathroom!) is a good place for the Show. So, in my opinion, yes you should consider bringing home the Show instead of the competition's products, as Amazon got it right the second time around. And at $230, I'd say it is priced just right to go. Well, I'll play with this gadget a few days more. In the meantime, The Echo Show must go on!",The Future Is Upon Us
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Feb 2019,hannaman,"We had a digital photo frame that died.  I thought that the Echo Show would be a good replacement as we would also have Alexa skills available. Little did I know how hard it would be use this as a photo frame. I set a Prime Photos album as the background, but it doesn't rotate as an actual slideshow. I can ask Alexa to show an album, but it only displays all albums and I have to select the album I want. Then if we use Alexa, I have to go back to the photo album manually again. Using one of these to default to a digital photo frame seems like an obvious feature of something like this, but it fails completely at that. What use is an always on screen sitting in my house without being able to easily display photos?",Poor photo management.
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2019,Erock,"This is a great product. We’ve had it for three weeks. Our main takeaways: - The power of this device is multiplied if you are already an Amazon prime/unlimited user. Even if you are not, I would seriously consider becoming one as a prime membership costs more or less the same than services that give you a similar access to media on other platforms, but also comes with free shipping for amazon items and other perks such as photo backups on amazon photo etc. - This device is amazing for music if you have a compatible subscription. Keep in mind that amazon prime already gives you access to many songs. With this device, when I subscribed to amazon music unlimited, an add on, it cost me 3.99/month (although that only gives you access to this service in this device). It can also connect your cell phone to play music you might have downloaded there, and is compatible with Apple Music. Sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors. - We also use it to get our daily news brief. You can select your sources and we play it as we are getting breakfast ready, very useful. - Has some other interesting uses, like coordinating shopping lists between multiple users through apps, as well as reminders and alarms. - Great for cooking as well with full integration with Allrecipes and other recipe skills. - It has some quirky interesting games as well, but this is not a defining feature for me. - One area where it lacks compared to some of the competition is trip/drive planning. I have deducted one star for this. There is no embedded map feature that I could find. Others have this. It will however tell you how long it will take you to get somewhere, but in my experience even this is a work in progress with times being shown differing from what my phone shows me. - Outisde of news videos, have not had a chance to test the movie feature. I have not seen a Netflix skill, although I have read Hulu is supported (have never tested it myself). All in all, don’t regret the purchase at all.","Great for news, music and organizing daily tasks"

We have several dots and needed a base to help manage them. It fixed the communication issues we were having with our sticks and dots and added a TV screen to the kitchen (where cable cannot be run in our house) so I have some entertainment while I'm cooking/cleaning.  I really enjoy being able to pause a fire stick in one room, walk into the kitchen and ask the show to resume whatever movie I am watching and she picks up seamlessly from where I left off with little effort on my part.  My ONLY complaint so far is that the only movie apps currently available on the show are Prime and Hulu.

Therefore, to me, the sound is not as clear as before.  Also, when the music is more loud than not, it is difficult for Alexa to hear you when you want to pause, cancel, or change the song.  I have been having to reduce the volume before Alexa will recognize that I am trying to make a change.  This never happened with my previous device.  Still, it is great to have such a device, but I am not sure I care for the 'improved' version for those reasons.",Sound is bass-y

Won’t play music when you ask unless you unplug it and you may have to unplug it right after you just unplugged it just to hope to get it working. Contacted support and they make it extremely hard to get a replacement almost as if you will never get a replacement. You can only return through ups and you can only go to specified locations.

I was hoping this would be better.  The sound is good, very good.  The screen to clear and sharp.  I could do without the incessant, ""try this"" or ""try that"" across the bottom of the screen.  As an Alexa device, it does what is supposed to, but as a video capable device it is poorly executed. Streaming anything is poor...never mind that you cannot stream Netflix or another service other than Hulu or Amazon Prime Video, they are buggy.  Stream Player is skill that can be enabled, the choice for viewing is limited and very unstable.  I cannot seem to watch for more that 5 minutes without having to direct Alexa to give it another go - very annoying.  Navigating is a chore and I find that the Show does not remember my progress, if I am on Season 2 Ep 4 of something on my Fire Stick or computer (they sync nicely) the show has no idea where I am.  Therefore, I must try and direct the device through a glitchy touch screen menu option.  Shows that I have finished watching still appear with outdated data and you cannot refresh, at least I haven't managed to.  In fact, It is so difficult to try and maneuver around to watch what I want that I just give up in lieu of using another device. I will mention one HUGE improvement, the device finally has a usable Blink security camera skill.  You can now ask Alexa to show live footage from a Blink camera on your network and it works!.  About time.  So, it is still evolving (thankfully) but it has a very long way to go.",Waiting for it to be better

By way of example, I subscribe to a couple of sports teams calendars linked to my apple calendar.  These show up on my apple calendar.  These subscriptions also show up on the Alexa app (so it does know they are there), and are checked to be included on the device...yet they are not. Called about it was told it was being sent up (as they also told me with a FireTv issue) and that I would hear back in 2-4 days.  As with the still unresolved FireTV issue I never hear back from anyone and so now I have two unresolved issues. Normally I would not care but I do a lot of umpiring and all of my assignments come through Arbiter (probably has no meaning to most reading).  But I am subscribed to an Arbiter calendar that automatically puts these events on our family apple calendar.  I purchased this so the family could see when I had games.

In calls to another person using the original show, feedback (squealing) is always an issue at the beginning and there are frequent  problems with freezing and pixelation which I never saw when using the earlier generation model.  Sometimes it quits altogether and must be rebooted.  It may be an incompatibility issue with the old and new versions. I figured this would be fixed eventually with updates but it remains as bad today as when I bought it. Otherwise, the bigger screen is a big improvement. The sound is mostly better but can be a mixed bag, depending on the environment. Speakers fire backwards and up instead of forward so sound quality is affecting by closeness of walls and ceilings at the location where being used.  This model does produce a wider sound field using some sort of surround sound technology.","Better sound, screen but video calling worse than earlier generation Show."
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2018,varasztan,"I own two of the first generation Echo Shows.  I love them both.  Upgrading to the 2nd generation was a no brainer with the larger screen and speaker.  However, the Show still has a ways to go before Amazon gets it right. 1. Yes, speaker is larger and more powerful but you lose the intended effect when the speaker points away from you.  The actual sound experience for someone standing in front of the Show is a disappointment and actually felt more like a downgrade.  Amazon needs to address the directional flow of sound better.  The round Echo's are great in terms of projecting sound throughout the room because of it's shape and position of speakers. . . obviously.  The Show is too directional and moving sound away from you is not an upgrade in my humble opinion. 2.  Tried the video call yesterday and I was shocked.  Streaming can be fairly choppy and reminiscent of some of the first web cams that came out onto the market.  Low resolution. . . Don't expect to see anywhere close to the same quality streaming as you will get watching something from the Amazon library.  Amazon dropped the ball on this one. I was hoping to pick up additional units as gifts, but at this point, I'll wait until next year to see how Amazon improves upon this year's mode.  While I love the larger screen, I would not recommend an upgrade unless you really want the larger screen and don't mind turning the Show around to benefit from the larger speakers. And finally. . . Amazon decided to take a picture of my package at the front door with a link that asks me how I feel about posting a picture online.  Seriously?  While the picture is only visible in my account, my first thought was that they're trying to move away from any culpability if thieves steal from your house.  I have an enclosed patio, out of site from the street.  What's to keep a dishonest delivery person from picking up the package after it's been documented online as delivered?  Not everyone may feel this way, but it felt like a violation of privacy and an effort which came across a little too aggressive and with no explanation.  If Amazon is that concerned, require a signature.  I'd rather pick it up at the post office the next day than to have a level of risk which clearly leans against the customer if delivery issues arise.",Streaming video calls surprisingly mediocre

Alexa integration is just as good as any Echo non-video device. And, oh joy, you get to see the weather forecast or your schedule or your shopping lists or whatever. But the Echo Flex I just bought for $100 less can report all of that to me, or I can go to FireTV Cube if I need to see it. I wanted video in my kitchen. But I also wanted to control what I watched. So far it's been nothing but frustrations. Apparently, before a recent OS update, starting a show on Prime Video or Hulu recognized the episode last watched from whichever service. It doesn't work that way now (but there may be a workaround that I'll note later). Not only that, but both of those Apps do not permit you to display a list of episodes. I've also tried ""Watch [show] season 2 episode 4"", ""skip to episode 4"", ""skip to next season"" and different similar options. The only thing that seems to work is ""play/skip to next/previous episode"". And, since I don't have no-commercials Hulu, they have to get ads in periodically while I'm trying to skip episodes. I suppose Netflix is waiting until Amazon figures this out, because there is no app for Netflix. And why can't I watch FireTV Recast? BTW, are you looking for ""My Stuff"" on the Echo Show Hulu app? You won't find it. FWIW, I discovered that if you have another device to watch Hulu, you can ""reset"" the last episode watched by starting the next episode you want to see and Echo Show will catch up. Performance is AWFUL. Sometimes I can't tell if I should have double-tapped. BTW, if that's what I'm missing, touch screens should never, ever require a double-tap to select something. FWIW, the quality of the images on screen is really good. But not good enough unless you get to see what you want to see. Sound is good once you take the time to adjust the equalizer.

So during black Friday, I was glad to trade in the dot and upgrade to echo show. What a mistake! 1, The voice recognition is much worse. The echo dot used to hear me fine from the living room while I was in the bedroom (small apartment). With the echo show, it will ignore me 80% of the time unless if I walk up to the device and speak to it within 3 feet. 2, The slowness. It always show some headline news with a promt ""ask Alexa, show me the parasite video"". I did exactly that, and it replied, ""here is your story"", and the screen went black for more than 2 minutes without video. I gave up. Another time, I have 2 timer set. I asked, ""Alexa, how much time is left on the timer."" It took 1 minute to reply to me. The dot never had this issue. 3, Lost voice. It's been 2 months since I bought it. It happened twice already. All of sudden, it become muted. No matter what I do, it remains silent. Unplug the power doesn't help. I have to do factory reset. 4, The speaker sounds worse than the dot. Because the design of the show, the speaker is facing side or back, and the screen is facing the front. I place the device on the kitchen counter, with its back close to the wall (counter space is valuable). The echo show has much more powerful base. With the speaker close to the wall, it sounds awful with that base. On the other hand, the dot is tiny and can be place farther away from the wall. Overall, I'm really disappointed with echo show.

The Echo Show was purchased for $229 in January 2019 and the warranty expired in January 2020.  It was my “big” Christmas present that year and I was excited to have it.  It is literally in almost new condition and the keyboard function has been used *MAYBE* 25 times over it’s lifetime. Look at the photos I’ve attached, I even still have the white tie that came with the cord. The issue: In July 2020, the Echo Show began randomly playing news and music.  We checked our history to find no requests for these actions and so did a factory reset.  During the reset as I was trying to type my email etc. I noticed that random characters and letters were being added even though my finger was about .5 to an inch off the screen.  As I hovered without touching the keyboard, more letters & spaces were being added. I called customer service and while the agent tried to troubleshoot, tried to get a replacement and then tried to see if I could send it in for repair.  After her attempts failed because someone told her no, she offered me a 15% and then a 25% discount to buy a new one. If this were something like my computer, which I use every day, I could maybe understand that I had gotten my “Year and a Half of Use” out of it.  MAYBE.  In this case, I think that the offering of such a low discount is completely insulting.  Amazon, you can clearly see that I am a vested customer from my account history and the number of Amazon devices I have purchased as gifts and for personal use.  The fact that you do not see fit to stand behind this product is disappointing. This was a DEFINING MOMENT and you failed to do the right thing. The result: My $229 Echo Show will be tossed and I will not be buying a new one.  It’s probably a great device, but your response today fell completely flat, even though your agent was nice about it.  You failed to recognize beyond this one device how customer loyalty works. My recommendation: Think twice before investing in Amazon devices.  They are good when they are good, but when they go bad, you’ll be out $229…or $179.99.  That’s a lot of money to some people, Amazon!

I actually purchased this device brand new from ebay.  The sell had just went off on amazon.  The Gen 2 Show is better than Gen 1 in about every way except for the audio in my opinion.  The speakers are placed on the side instead of the front to accommodate the larger screen for Gen 2.  This seems like a good idea but not having a front facing speaker does not sound good in a large room.  If you have the unit close to you on a desk the audio probably sounds descent.  I ordered the echo sub for this device which will greatly improve the sound for this echo show Gen 2. The main purpose I purchased this Gen 2 Show was for the hub to control smart devices.  I have iris by lowes which was my alarm and home automation.  Iris by lowes is going out of business March 31st so I got this hub for home automation and I got simpli safe for my alarm. Gen 2 has a bigger screen, better graphics and probably a better device.  In my opinion the upgrade is not needed unless you need a hub.  The Gen 1 plays just as good and has better sound quality in my opinion because of the front firing speakers.  Gen 2 has better quality speakers but because of the side speaker placement the audio seems distant. I still am a fan of the Amazon ecosystem and they are constantly improving their products.

She said there had been an update to correct the problem, but my unit showed that the update was current. She told me to hit the mute button and make sure it turns red. She said she would call me back in about 4 hours to see if that corrected the problem. She said this, along with the update would correct the screen issue, also. She said the light on the mute would go off when it finished. It has been almost 5 hrs. and the light is still on and my phone hasn't rung.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jun 2019,B. R. Fleming,"I love the idea of Alexa and the devices associated with the app, but integrating them all together is not as simple as made out. Sure, you might be able to ""connect"" the devices on the app screen, but whether they will integrate correctly to function the way you wish often runs hit or miss, and attempting to find answers to questions leads nowhere more than not. Operating the devices separately usually presents no problem, especially with simple requests. But put two devices in proximity, and you're liable to find some confusion on Alexa's part. When I ask Alexa to play music on my music group, I get a completely different response, though that is the phrase suggested for playing music on all of my Alexa connected devices. So, what really is the problem: is the app not in a state of complete functionality yet? Does Alexa not ""hear"" my voice correctly? I don't know, and I can't find answers to my questions on the help sites. For now, I can listen to music, if I carefully make a simple request, and receive answers to basic questions, ""What's the weather forecast?"", but beyond that the functionality of the devices is limited . . .",Integration Issues

As luck would have it, one of the lights in our bar went out and now we had a need.  Screwed in the bulb and Alexa recognized it without much hassle.  The take away is that we did not need to purchase a smart home hub like the other Alexa devices, which is a bit confusing for new buyers and the set up was incredibly easy.  Now, we can have multi-colors at the bar and different light intensities using a plain old light socket.  The sound is pretty good and the touch screen makes this Alexa device much easier to use.  My only complaint is the device is not easily mountable.  They should have made the design VESA compatible so people could easily mount it under kitchen cabinets or against a wall.  So, I am taking a star off for that because it seems to be a design decision straight out of the Apple playbook.",Best Alexa available with built-in smart home hub.  Case design needs work though.

Since she only speaks French, I wanted to be sure it has French language capability, otherwise no point to get it. After some research on line I found out that there is a way to enable French (from France or Canada) on it, when creating a new Amazon account then select French at setup. Then I set up everything in French on it, and gave it to my mother. The power plug that comes with it supports 10v to 240v, so it's totally compatible with the French power as well. Otherwise, the unit works flawlessly so far, without any troubles with the camera or sound. The only minor issue we have with it, is that no matter the language spoken, the Echo seems to have troubles to get the voice command said to it right away, and we will end up having to repeat ourselves from time to time. I will update this review later after to see how this device does after few month of use. But so far so good !",French is a go !

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Apr 2019,bassoprofundo,"As the headline mentions, this is a great device that is excellent at what it does.  Its mics and Alexa integration are every bit as good as the audio-only Echos.  Its audio quality is outstanding.  My favorite use for mine is as a speakerphone when working from home in combination with my Echo Connect and home phone service.  The screen is beautiful as well.  Basically, I have no real complaints.  If you're heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem and can spare the $$, I think you'll find this to be a very nice compliment. HOWEVER...  I put this squarely in the camp of ""nice to have"" vs a real MUST have.  It's not cheap.  If you're looking to integrate Alexa into your home, you can quite literally put her in every room via the excellent 3rd gen Echo Dots and still have plenty of spare change vs the cost of one of these.  While the display interface is nice enough, other than answering calls, I seldom find myself interacting with it because it's just as quick to ask for the simple things I need (ex.- Weather, Home lighting, Security cam feeds, etc.) by voice.  It's mostly a nice enough photo frame with an excellent speaker.  Having said that, the G**gle Home Hub that currently sits next to it is a far better picture frame due to its Ambient mode lighting adjustments and has the killer feature of Chromecast support.  Almost any app not natively supported by the device itself can be casted over to the Home hub's display, and the HH can be integrated into more than one group for home audio playback (vs only a single group per device for the Amazon ES). In summary, it really comes down to your own individual needs/wants and whether or not you've bought into either ecosystem.  If you're already bought into the Google ecosystem, this one isn't for you.  If you're a Google Play Music and/or heavy Youtube user with an Android phone, it isn't for you.  BUT...  If you love Alexa, it is.  If you're looking for the one, killer device to bring Alexa into your home, this is it.  If you want multiples and have a large house to cover, maybe you should start with the audio-only Echos and work your way up unless you get a killer price on one of these.  All in all, Amazon did a great job with what they have here, and I'm confident they'll continue to improve it within the confines of what they can do as compared to Google.",Excellent at what it does.

First, if you’re not VERY specific, you’ll probably get “hmmm, I don’t know that”. So then you’ll go through a dozen different ways of saying the same thing, before it will finally “get” it. It’s not intuitive at all. It should have come with a manual stating exactly how you have to say something in order to get it to work. Try adding multiple lights in the same room to a group so you can turn them all on or off at once. Do it perfectly the first time, or you’ll find yourself telling it a dozen times what you want, only to have it repeat the wrong thing back to you. Over. And over. And over. Amazon needs to hire someone to program these things that actually understands how to account for the multitude of ways people may want to program it to accomplish the tasks they want, without coming up with a “hmmmm, I don’t know that”.",Find myself constantly telling Alexa how dumb she is.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2020,krisr2005,"I’ve very much invested in the Echo/Alexa ecosystem since the first Echo. Since, I’ve had various models of dots, shows, the auto, and some of the other obscure models. I decided to take my Show V1 and put it in the kitchen, opening up a spot for a new Echo Show in the living room- in reality I really wanted a reason to try the new Show! My primary usage is music listening; I’d say 95% of my Show V1 usage was playing music, with the occasional smart home control, weather forecast or general question. It also served as our electric picture frame, since we store all of our pictures on Amazon Photos. When comparing this new Show to the V1- I’d consider this upgrade to be.. just okay. The new Show is a great device- indeed the new screen is bigger, brighter and has excellent improved contrast over the original- not to mention the speaker setup has been relocated behind the device to allow the front to be a big screen with a slight border. The sound is definitely improved- bass is fantastic comparably. Mid range is still slightly muddy, but definitely improved over V1. The new Show also plays at higher volumes with more clarity. All that said, I’m just not as impressed as I expected to be. For one, there’s a definitive lag in Alexa recognizing its key word compared to the V1 Show and even other Echo devices (Dot V1, V3, Echo V2). Ultimately I think it’s a disappointment in value. Compared to other Echo devices I’ve purchased, I always felt the cost Amazon charged was worth it. With the new Show, I feel like the cost doesn’t justify the final product. $179.99 (I bought during a promotion as well) for an admittedly better screen and sound isn’t worth the upgrade over my original V1. All that said- perhaps my expectations for Echo devices are so high my perception of value is skewed. Again, this isn’t a bad product at all, I just personally don’t think the cost of admission justifies the upgrade compared to the original V1.",Just okay..

Example, forget trying to chose a night friendly clock face, it’s not supported yet.  Forget the manual shutter to lock out the camera. They took it out (save < 1 Penney?). You can buy an add on but why should you have to?  Trust their software? Only if you want hackers watching you. The 5 is too small. This model is a bit too large for my use but I’m sure their are folks that will think that it’s too small. Again, the base costs you extra as an option, no doubt costing more than if it were simply included (I’m sure Amazon loves that.) Finally, ignoring all other faults of a simplistic language ability, there simply need to be independent settings for volume. Try turning out the bedroom lights without waking your wife. Thank you Alexa for screaming across the room. (Maybe she needs a nighttime voice.) Finally, there needs to be an option in the software to set how long she listens without having to say “Alexa...  Alexa... Alexa... every five seconds until she manages to understand what you really wanted.”  Starting over because you named a movie and (the movie being unavailable) she started playing music instead. “This is what I found...”. “Don’t bother, it’s not what I asked you to play.” Still waiting for real language recognition, not a menu of pre-programmed stupidity with a thin facade of comprehension.","One step forward, one back, more sideways."

Although my adult children made fun of me and said they had no interest in any Echo—the show has made them converts. My granddaughters love to use Alexa for music and stories. The 4 year old works on improving her pronunciation so Alexa understands her. I like that the 6 year old can read the words to her favorite songs as they play.

I wanted the clock on the small Echo Show to be bigger.  After using the small Amazon Show, it goes through a bunch of tips, but will eventually show the full size clock which was ok.  I very much DO NOT like how Amazon does not allow you to customize the device quite how you want it (NO TIPS at all), but at least it eventually did it.  Fast forward to this device. Beautiful HUGE screen.  Beautiful depth of sound.  Probably one of the nicest sounding devices I have heard in a  long time.  Absolutely ZERO ability to make the clock bigger.  Even as big as the screen is, I cannot read the clock from across the room.  There are no settings to make it bigger.  Amazon made the bigger, more expensive Show LESS customizable than the smaller one!!!!  I cannot express how disappointed I am in this.  Reading many forums, this is a known issue that lots of people have reported, but Amazon seems to have no desire to make it bigger. Save your money, and buy the smaller one if you would like to be able to use this as a clock when not being used for other things.  It is a shame to say that when this is easily a 5 star item every other way.","Amazing sound, lacks some obvious customization settings"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2019,Springer Dinger,"We got my in-laws a Google Home for all of 20min until we realized they were Prime users and my MIL was a big Amazon Music user. My brother had just gotten me an Echo Show so we returned the Google and got them a show instead. The Good: I will say this integrated much quicker than the Google Home since I'm a Prime User. Setup was extremely simple where as with Google I don't use it much more than for an old email account. I really enjoy the screen. Calling up a News Flash, weather, shopping list and being able to see it was really nice. Screen is only 720p but honestly at this size you cannot tell. Sound quality is pretty good. We've got an echo dot and you can absolutely tell the difference. We have an open floor plan downstairs and the sound travels well from the kitchen to the living room. It works with my Nest products (google owned) with one or two minor issues I'll add in the Cons. But it can control my thermostats and pulls video from my doorbell camera. Has a built in Smart HUB which is great. Makes pairing other smart devices extremely easy. Usually the echo show can detect automatically which is a plus and if it's another amazon product it's extremely easy. Works extremely well with Amazon Music and Spotify. It does have a working web browser and can connect to Youtube. It can also call up recipes easily. Shopping list is fantastic and the phone app pairs nicely to it. Bad or Could be Better: It can connect and show video to my Nest Hello camera but no sound. Nest is Google owned so they don't always play nicely together. Not a huge deal though. My other Nest complaint was the Nest Skills you must download on the show. I would select the Doorbell and it would take me to the security camera skill. I eventually learned through some message boards to just download the security camera skill and it should recognize it which it eventually did. Just took some time. One noticeable difference is Google's AI is better. It understood me far more frequently and did not struggle with questions nearly as much. Alexa isn't bad, it just isn't as good. Some setting features are in the Show and some are in the app you have to download. I found it a little clunky especially on the show side. The whole skills thing so far seems lacking. It looked like a bunch of junk so far or that's at least the recommendations I keep getting. I'm more interested in productive integration...not jeopardy. Video calling works. But the recipient has to have a Show or the app downloaded. Just like facetime on Apple, you can't use it on an Android. Most of us seem to have an iPhone so no big deal there, but this is a much smaller market at this point. I've heard skype is coming soon so that should help. I haven't done a Show to Show call yet so I cannot comment. Not a big fan of how shopping on prime has been setup. It feels super limited so I'll stick to a computer for purchases. Overall: Really like this product. If you're a Prime user it's fantastic for music, video, shipping notifications and delivery. If not it might not be as great but it's still a smart speaker so it doesn't lose too many points. I think they could iron out a few issues regarding software design and making it more intuitive, and they could deff spend a few dollars getting Alexa to Goggle AI levels. I will say I'm still learning to full capabilities of this device so my opinions could greatly improve in the future as I learn more features and add my smart products to my home.",Pretty Good so Far

Occasionally it will appear to stop playing Pandora music but when I come back later and ask to play again I am told Pandora is already playing, but there is no music playing. Added the Echo Sub and that was another layer of fun. It works when it wants to. Most of the time I end up having to delete the pairing and go through the painful steps of creating a new sub pair, then repeat it sometimes the same day, others a day or two later. Amazon released these devices way before they were ready for prime time! I have to admit the sound is great when they are working together but the time I spent making them work is really worth the sound quality improvements.

The device itself is very nicely built (heavy, quality feeling parts). The display is nice enough for its purpose and functions. The clock needs to be adjustable both in styles and sizes. Would be nice to just have a straight wallpaper+clock idle screen for those of us that don't want all the Alexa crap all over it every ten seconds. A screen timeout function would be nice for hands free things like recipes, which are now useless anyway but that isn't Amazon or the show's fault by any means.

I’ve had it over a year now. The skills are limited (like the Apple app store when iPhone first came out) but this is a relatively new product and it’s slowly getting better. I do wish Youtube were integrated as its own skill rather than having to use a browser. One of my main frustrations (which us more Alexa/Echo in general rather than this product specifically) is the alarm. I set multiple alarms each morning. When setting alarms you can choose to repeat:never, daily, weekly (on the day for which you are setting the alarm), weekdays, or weekends. I really wish you could just choose to repeat an alarm, then choose the days you want that alarm repeated. I have more than one job so I have to get up at different times on different days. So, for example, instead of having 6 alarms (6am, 6:10am, and, 6:15am) that repeat Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and (5am, 5:05 am, and 5:10am) that repeat Tuesday, Thursday(6 alarms total), I’m having to set 18 different alarms. 3 to repeat every Monday, 3 to repeat every Tuesday, 3 to repeat every Wednesday, and so on.  Also, it would be nice if there were more sound options. I know you can choose different things by voice, but I wish it gave you more options/control through the app when setting alarms.",Good Product Overall. Alexa/Echo Program Needs Improvements

But to get any video to happen is a nightmare!  Try to play a video from Prime by name-forget it! Try and try again, no luck. Try to go to home screen for Prime videos? No idea how to get there. Nothing seems to work. How about playing live streams on Hulu? Say “Play Hulu”, wait a while and you have the Hulu app. Touch the display to pick channels, wait.  Pull down through channels to find CNN and touch it, wait. Now touch live and recents, wait. Now touch the live show and wait again, this time a long time. Finally a live stream! But oh no, its a commercial and I want to change to MSNBC or FOX. Forget it! Its back through the entire sequence again just to change channels. Yes you can say, ""play CNN on Hulu"" and then to change channels say “play Fox News on Hulu”, but it will consistently fail to stream the second choice. Unreliable and frustrating.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 May 2019,Stephen J,"The device is basically an Android tablet with speakers and no accelerometer, so most critique goes towards the Alexa service, I believe they're Lambda functions for a voice server. I can't really filter what news shows up, so I see sports even though sports is a meaningless pastime of a primitive society. You can't tell it to never play a genre of music either, so if it mishears a Metal band name, it will play a rap band... not something a person would do. If you're trying to play a song on Unlimited, but only have the regular subscription, sometimes it ""mishears"" it, sometimes it goes to an app that has that song (radio app), and sometimes it will do the ad to upgrade, and that ad is relatively long, every time, and no way to tell it automatically ""no"" until you hear the whole spiel. It's very annoying. The translation will censor words, even harmless insults become ""beep"" noises. The Audible controls are nice, and the fact you can have music or books stop in any amount of time, or skip X seconds/minutes is awesome. Unfortunately Audible likes to open to your last book by default, so you have to remember the specific command to display all books. Ready apps include sleep noises, but the playlist for Sleep using music, and electronic music, is filled with a bunch of songs with blaring noises and only half of them work, while the other half just wake you up.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2018,Daniel C,"Wow! Deciding between Echo Show and Google Home is tough because most reviewers don’t own either. I finally decided on Echo Show because it controls more things, allows video chats, has a bigger screen, and gives me extras at no cost because of my Prime Membership (like Amazon Music). Be aware that you need to decide which control convention to go with (Z-wave or Zigbee). I chose Zigbee because the switches and plugs that use Zigbee seemed to be a little cheaper than Z-wave devices. That means Echo’s higher cost can be offset by cheaper accessories. As you add more items, the difference adds up. WiFi controlled devices will work with either Echo or Google but could begin to slow down your Internet due to traffic jams in your router. Z-wave and Zigbee apparently don’t go through the router. Also be aware of the feud between Amazon and Google is kind of like between Sony’s Beta Max VCR and the VHS format. One will win and half of us will be left with outdated technology. Smart ahome setup is beyond the capabilities of most home owners and you may need the help of a Tech Guru at additional cost. But if you just want to plug it in and surf while you cook, it’s not too hard to do. Being able to check who’s at the front door, see when packages arrive, remotely control lights, are all easier for those with limited mobility, but they still need enough tech smarts to be able to make it work. Probably not a good option for a Grandparrent who doesn’t know how to use their smart phone.",Echo Show is My Choice

I put the older Echo downstairs so that my spouse could communicate easily with me upstairs on the Echo Show if she wanted to (she just had a baby).  This feature seems to be working well. We also often use it for recipes, our Echo Show is on the kitchen counter.  While the recipe displaying functions are great, the Alexa service is lacking in how it searches for recipes.  Many times if will hear you correctly, but present you with a list of recipes that are nowhere near to what you asked for. We have also used this device to quickly look up a product that we might quickly need for the baby or for mommy and it seems to do well in that regard, presenting you with relevant items. Aside from that, it is also great at the general Alexa-type stuff; weather, sports scores, etc. One kind of odd thing I noticed is that after enabling the 'messaging' (intercom) feature, skills I was using that had the word 'text' in their intent requests wouldn't work; the Alexa service would recognize the word 'text' and hijack the intent, ignoring the context of the rest of the user's input and instead asking you who you would like to text message.  Not cool.","Great sound, useful for the home"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Feb 2019,MIKEYP,Wish the screen wouldn’t timeout so fast or Atleast have an option that you could change that setting.  Would like to be able to monitor my cameras without always asking Alexa. Overall this thing has everything. The sound quality is amazing. Picture quality is perfect. I’m still messing with it and trying to figure out how I can use this in everyday life as I’m slowly transitioning my house to be a full smart house. But for now with cooking and listening to music this thing is amazing. Add a screen time out setting and I’d give it 5 stars.,Great sound

For the price I paid, it isn't worth it.  Google knows much more.  Maybe the company should have considered putting in a search engine.  That way, you a have 50% of getting the right answer. I had it put printing on for a screen saver.  If you ask about the picture, she has NO clue what you are asking.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2020,nf,"We really wanted to love this and we were very sad to have to send it back! My mom is 92 and still lives independently. She is still very with it but now almost completely blind.  She has two Alexa dots and an Alexa microwave that she uses daily. They are both completely voice activated and have given her back freedom and independence in her life. Verbally she can cook a meal, ‘read’ a book, listen to music, set reminders and timers, use a calendar, ask for information, listen to the news and even make phone calls with these amazing Amazon devices.  Unfortunately, the Echo show does not add any helpful skills that can function completely by vocal commands. Currently, with Covid 19, all religious services are being done virtually on zoom and Facebook live. We have gone over and helped mom to tune-in and she loves being able to hear the services and she can see a little bit on the monitor. This has made her very happy BUT she hates not being able to do this independently. We were really hoping that the Echo show would be able to help with this but there is no way to verbally accomplish most tasks without having to see and touch further prompts on the screen. We were also very excited to see that the new Echo show had visual recognition technology. This is a nice feature but it is still very rudimentary. It can read a label on a can and, sometimes, a prescription bottle but that's about it. Verbally you can ask Echo show to go to a site like Facebook or Prime video but then the info is displayed on the screen which is very small for someone with limited vision and then you have to  'touch' the even smaller icons on the screen in order to accomplish the next steps. Just imagine...If you could ask for a site and it would go there or use follow up verbal prompts to get you where you want to go. Mom currently uses the verbal cable remote and it hears her requests and reads the additional information to her so she can make a selection. Imagine...If you could hold up a piece of mail or an announcement flyer and have it read to you. Currently mom has a device that she can scan slowly over a document and it enlarges the text so she can see a word at a time. It is very slow going but it is independence for her. It would be amazing to have the Echo show 'read' these kinds of things for the visually challenged. Imagine…If the design team turns their R&D on its head. Instead of fun and novel things that these devices can do instead think of how they can be so much more and can really impact and change lives. Maybe they can try designing and using them while blindfolded and see how it makes you realize what else needs to be there to be useful and create independence. Currently the Echo show is fun and has a lot of novel features for your household but it has the potential to be so much more. We are hopeful that the design team will help these devices to continue to grow and develop. They have the potential to go beyond fun, novelty items and become invaluable tools for so many!  When these things happen we will be first in line.",So much potential to help visually impaired but not yet there
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2019,Marcus Rodabaugh,"I received my Alexa Echo Show 2nd Gen and loved it from the start. The sound quality was great, the AI intuitive, and voice recognition did amazing at even understanding me with food in my mouth. Within 20 days, the screen flickered and lines went across it. The next day the screen didn't even respond. The device still worked as an Echo but no longer showed you anything. I called support to get help and they had me ship it back. It was never mentioned it was being sent to a 3rd party to be evaluated to be repaired or replaced. To me, this should have been an immediate replacement and apology. It was within the first 30 days. Its technology, you can't control every little semiconductor or the fluctuation in power going to it. So, I understand some will fail. Most happen within the first 30 days. As a consumer, I don't believe I should have to be waiting for any device to be repaired within the same month I bought it. Support on the other hand, was trying over and over to justify why I should wait. So that way I can be happy to get my original device I purchased back in 1 to 2 weeks. I guess what I should have done, was sent it back as broken. Then, bought a new one. It would have cost me nothing and I would have my new one in the mail the next day. I was a computer tech for 10 years, I sold computers and their parts, as well as, fixed them. In those years of sales experience I would have never thought about telling my customer that just purchased an item, they would have to wait until someone else (other than me or my shop) evaluated the item to determine the issue and then decide to fix or replace that item. So, I guess in the end, it was poor support and quality that is forcing me to give this device a 2 star rating.","Great Device, Poor Quality"

My grandpa was in his 90s so John began delivering the food to my grandparents. My grandpa passed away at almost 102 and John continued to bring food to my grandma.  Johns wife had passed away so him and my grandma became friends. They would talk about how much they missed their spouses and would share memories.  John volunteered for many years at the food bank. Now almost 80 years old and still helping out. He recently called my grandma and told her that he wouldn't be able to make her deliveries anymore. He said he had cancer and had only 2 weeks left to live and he won't be leaving the hospital. My grandma went to visit him and took him some red roses as she knew he loved red roses. As she was leaving, John began to cry. My grandma told him that it's ok and that he will be able to see his wife and daughter that had passed away.  She also told him to tell my grandpa that she misses him and that she still loves him and will see him soon. John passed away a few days later. My grandma was left missing her friend and my grandpa. I won a set of 2 of the Amazon Echo Shows from my amazing job at a Christmas party that was held in February. I know it sounds odd. This was the best way to ensure everyone could attend. So I sent one to my grandma and had my cousins husband set it up for her. I can tell you that my grandma has found new life thanks to Alexa and this Echo Show. My grandma is legally blind but can see some things. The screen on the Echo Show allows her to see pictures of the family and she can zoom in.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2019,Vicky,"Compared to the show v1, this is a massive upgrade. The sound system, and the display make this device so much more comforting to both look at and use. Voice recognition is fantastic, sometimes maybe a little too good. However, this device has many more flaws than expecting. The first show v2 I had came with a type of ""ghost tap"", where the screen taps without you actually tapping there. Not normally a noticeable problem, but when typing anything or scrolling through a page with hyperlinks, automatically typing in an extra letter or jumping away from the page is extremely annoying. Contacted amazon, and they replaced it. Great customer service. The replacement device started working fine and obviously came in pristine condition. This time, the bluetooth was the one that began malfunctioning. The bluetooth would break connection, which by itself is not a huge problem. However, the echo claimed that my iPhone was still connected when it clearly wasn't. Turning off bluetooth on the phone did nothing. The echo still remained ""connected"" to the phone - when it wasn't. Not a horrible problem, so I tried to manually remove the phone and commence repairing. However, the show refused to disconnect from the phone. It would say ""disconnecting"" yet would never actually disconnect. It was only after a factory reset that the phone was truly disconnected, and the problem was seemingly gone. Paired just fine, music played just fine, yet a few minutes in, the problem happened again, and now, Amazon has gone to try and solve the problem. Another complaint I have is the home screen. Mainly, about why the time remains so small. It's got a massive screen, with a lot of just background space, so why not let us, the consumers, customize it more? I'd love to enlarge that time display, and be able to utilize the home screen the way I want it to. All in all, with the issues solved, this is a phenomenal device that I'd love to have back in my life.",Fantastic device with quality control flaws

With everything I've gone through with this device on top of the price tag ( I pre-ordered when this was first announced), I can honestly say don't waste your money.  I would 100% return this if I could. EDIT: Amazon reached out to me to essentially ask if I had tried turning my unit off and on again (thank you for wasting my time with that call btw).  Since this unit is continuously having issues, an offer of a new unit or a refund would have been great, but no, I got ""have your tried updating"".

The sound quality is much better than the Echo Spots we have. Also being able to visually see multiple timers is very handy. Honestly I am extremely disappointed that I can not read my kindle cookbooks on the Echo Show. Sure you can have it read to you in Alexa's robotic voice but that isn't practical. I think not being able to access the kindle books is a huge flaw! If they would allow full access to your Kindle library that would make this product much more useful. Also would be handy to have icons for skills on a home screen because lets be honest some skills require very specific wording that doesn't roll of the tongue naturally.

We have had the Original Echo with Alexa for 5 years. I cannot be without Alexa!! We have always used as a timer, shopping list, Pandora, prime music, sleep sounds, and various other skills. I like the Show, but I had higher expectations. We are going to use it with the Ring Doorbell system and to video call relatives, but so far I have used it for recipes while cooking and prime video. So my problem is while using a recipe, I also wanted to set a timer. Once it goes to the timer, you can't tell her to resume the recipe, you have to ask her to find the recipe again and start over. I was also watching/listening to a movie and had the same issue. She won't just go back to where it left off. I had to ask for the movie again from scratch. But it did pick up where it left off once I got it back up. ""Third world problems""! Overall, I'm glad I got it and cannot wait to find out what else it can do and see how it gets smarter over time, like the Echo.","Still needs some work, but good"

Showing the actual information that i request is a lot better than hearing it.  Overall it seems to take the Alexa automation system to the next level. I haven't found how to turn off the display yet. It does dim automatically after a while. I bought it for $179 including a smart bulb from Best Buy. I have the Alexa app installed on my phone and tablet.  Both work seamlessly.  I can control Alexa devices between different locations from either device.

I just don't get the disparity between the marketing to skill set of the equipment - this product seems to be a donosaur pre-release of something that could be good that's coming in the future that we don't get to have or enjoy because we bought the lesser functioning version FIRST. NO HOME SCREEN TO CONTROL THE MACHINE & it's capabilities are non-existent to VERY DIFFICULT to harness or control in ANY way. I would not have bought this had I known. I would like Amazon to give us updates that improve this machine, like allow WEB SURFING & an actual home screen to control this machine. Even if I watch Days of Our Lives online episodes, all it allows is to go forward or backwards but not to control a 'refresh' option when Alexa Show goes frozen for hours during a commercial or show... this product I thought was going to be sci-fi-fun absolutely perfect advanced technology - this system IS SO LIMITED IT'S a NIGHTMARE to try to operate.  Voice commands are so minimal in scope and ability, I was shocked. What an overpriced product for just a wonderful speaker and a dinosauric operating screen even if it does have touch screen.  Like I said, you can't refresh anything, you can't ask it to find a business, or a local transportation website  which seem to show that it does not access the actual entire World Wide Web which is just loaded with useful information ti draw upon  - no web surfing at all through it. In other words, it can't even do what the web can and go to a place to get you the information it couldn't give you. It had a hard time finding my purchased amazon music, it can't go to a website, it can't play online episodes well of things: IT FREEZES and no refresh button, no controls, no voice capabilities with these things.

Yes..but the less expensive, no 'Show' devices can do that too along with all the other skills like lists, calendar, news, etc... Can you watch a show on this? Yes...but if you have a tv, don't waste your time on this. Long story short, I would never get this for myself and will never recommend it to anyone.  One of the best rated apps for the Echo Show is the 'escape room' game which I tried to play with my child and was immediately disappointed. The 'escape room' is just a still shot of a room and all your 'clue's' are spoken...slowly, by Alexa. My daughter was like ""what is the point of this?!?!?""

Tucker,"Not going to beat around the bush here, the next version of this device must be able to tilt the camera out of the box.  I mean really, this is my only issue.  Where it sits, or really anywhere in my house it is always aimed up at the ceiling which means there is typically a light in the background and as anyone that has ever taken a photograph knows when you have a light in the background it will darken the overall image to adjust for exposure.  If you look at the second picture I posted you can see how it has a very high angle, capturing more of the ceiling than the rest of the room.  This was done so you can stay in frame while talking, however with those lights in the background I or anything I am trying to show someone on the camera come through darker making it difficult to see details unless I move to block the lights with my body or whatever I am holding up.  The ability to either tilt the camera or adjust exposure manually would help this issue.  Second, we are about to have out first child and my in-laws live about an hour away.  They wanted a way to be closer to the family without always having to drive back and forth.  So when I purchased this device I also purchased one for them.  My initial idea was to put one in the nursery so they could ""drop-in"" on the baby, issue is all they will be able to drop-in on is the ceiling and maybe a top rail of the crib.  So unless I am in there holding the echo and showing them the baby or holding the baby in front of the echo it just won't work the way I wanted it to.  Which is why it is now in the kitchen. Hopefully Amazon will design this feature in to the next version of the echo show.  Until then I think I am going to grab either the tilt stand for the echo show 2nd gen (while it will help, it sucks having to purchase something that could have been built in and I don't know if it will tilt down far enough to accomplish what I want) or I can purchase an Echo Spot and a tilt able wall mount that I can mount above the crib. Everything else about the Show 2nd gen is amazing.  Speakers are great, has very clear audio even at high volumes.  Image quality is good.  The presence of the device is unobtrusive.  Amazing build quality.  I love the device.  Just wasn't expecting such a high angle on the camera, it may be obvious to some but it took me a bit by surprise once I started to use it.",One drawback keeps this from being a 5 star device.

I have a family of six, each person owning a dot and we have the show. The kids all want to set their own alarms and reminders and it is quite frustrating. This technology Seems like it is in its infancy, unfortunately.  Alexa get stumped very easily on questions, and you have to have just the right wording. However she does search for recipes and you can scroll through them and pick the one you want. That is helpful in the kitchen. It does have a large selection of music on Amazon music, however to get an unlimited amount, again, you have to pay for it. This is why we got the Google home as well, So we can get what we need without the hassle of trying to re-word every question we ask Alexa.

The biggest problem is that sound died after 30 minutes, and won't come back even after powering off and on and resetting the device. It's pretty useless at this point without sound. The software is also rather awful: - Ring integration is sluggish. Half the time, the camera stream won't appear. The rest of the time, it takes about 30 seconds for the stream to come up, and even then it's very pixelated. - The device is very slow. Every menu takes several second to load, including the back button. - The developers don't understand hit targets.

Alexa integration works really well and if Amazon music/videos and Alexa is all you want this for, than it's easily a 5 star. The sound quality is fantastic. However for me, there are several limitations on a 'show' device (since it's not a full tablet) that I did not know about (and should have done my homework). First, you can't stream from most other sources, like Netflix or Youtube.tv etc. Second you can't really customize the home screen, it just rotates through a bunch of things and Alexa tips I'm not really interested in. I'd really like the ability to customize what's on the home screen carousel. Last and least important, there's no battery so if you want to move it to another location, you have to wait for it to boot up again once you plug it in (it doesn't take long but it's still annoying) So I returned it, and will hope that eventually Amazon simply puts something like a full HD10 tablet in a similar desktop mount with good sound.",Great sound and size however issues for me that kept it from being 5 stars

She can video chat with her friends and family if she chooses or just speak to them like a regular phone. At one point she actually watched a movie on her SHOW.

She does useful things like display the day’s weather, and silly things like give you ideas of how to dress for that weather! (Linen jumper, espadrille, and a woven handbag for recent temps!) The home screen scrolls with pictures the kids ask her to take of them and suggestions for news stories, skills, or tasks she can complete. Every day my kids ask for the birthday lineup and what happened on this date in the past. We already had Echo Dots, but the suggestions on the Show have taught us so many new things we can ask her to do. She quizzes multiplication tables, tells the kids how to spell words, and was the center of family game night with Escape the Room (awesome!).  I wake the kids up by asking her to play playlists on the Dots in their rooms and we listen to our music all over the house. If my big kids are home alone I can use my phone and to video chat on the Show and see that everything is all right.

The app settings are minimal. When trying to set up the Echo Show to have the camera show my living room to view my pet in action, there wasn't anything even remotely close to showing me where I might find how to do that. Fortunately, a friend has an Echo Show and told me to go to CONTACTS, then go to my own name, then look at the icons. Find the one that shows a house and tap it. Geez. Who would ever have thought to do that? The positive remarks are the sound quality is excellent when playing music. Also, AFTER it was set up and I was totally frustrated, I received two helpful emails from Amazon that gave a little more information about the features available. That info definitely should have arrived in the box with the device. Alexa and I are gradually getting to know each other. I am hopeful that this device will become more useful to me. Otherwise, it is a very expensive radio. I am sure if I subscribe and pay for other features it will be even better, but I don't appreciate having to invest more money to enjoy those features.",Minimal instructions!

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 May 2019,Bonnie R.,"I’ve got two echo shows first generation and one echo and when I saw this large screen echo second generation, I really wanted it. I liked the idea of the bigger screen because I occasionally will watch a movie on it. Other than that, it’s really not much different than the first generation. One of the things I do not like at all, is the amount of bass. I’ve turned the base all the way off and it still vibrates terribly. Enough that I almost want to take it back.  As far as voice recognition, I often have to repeat things two or three times before it understands me. That can be very frustrating. At times it doesn’t hear me at all, and other times it gets the entire thing wrong. You just never know.  But that’s no different than the generation one. I have gotten it to integrate with a few things in my house, but not as many as I would like. I will need to keep trying. Sometimes the directions are not easy to follow. I would like to have the same music in several of my rooms but have yet to be able to accomplish that. I do like the ability to keep adding to my shopping list by voice or to check my shopping list by voice and then pull up the shopping list on my phone while at the store. I use that quite frequently.  It’s much more limited compared to Siri when trying to look something up.  It will often say, I’m sorry, I’m not able to tell you that, etc.  It is constantly updating the  little stories that you can read or see a video but unfortunately, it usually doesn’t give you enough detail or kind of just leaves you hanging. I’m pretty much always disappointed with their little stories. I will keep investigating what else I can do on Echo, I’ve only had it a few weeks so I guess I need more time. If anything changes I will update this review.",It’s ok.

The trickiest part was getting aunts and uncles authorized to drop in (they had to down load the app and enable to the Alexa communication).  I had to enable them to drop in (it was a little quirky but we eventually got everyone up and running). I chose to keep this device under my account so I could keep control of it, my aunt accidentally dropped in on my kitchen Echo, when she was trying to drop in on my parents at the assisted living.

Gen is not good as the Echo period. The biggest problem is and I think it is the most important one and that is... Voice Reconition. If there is any little noise around  while you are talking to Alexa, Alexa will not understand. You will wait and nothing will happen. Will not give you any indication that is not understanding either. Plus, the receiver (mic.) volume is super low so in general you have to scream for Alexa to get it. I wish it had a microphone volume adjustment it is this unit not there yet. By the way this is my second 2nd. Gen version too, I returned one for the same reason already.. This 2nd. one it started OK. but now is back to not understanding again.

I actually bought myself the show to see my daughter who lives an hour and a half away and trying to stay close to my first and only grandson.  I bought one for my mom and she is a senior struggling to live on her own still. She is not too good with a cell phone or or any kind of technical stuff she's used to be what you kind of lost that when she started to lose her memory.. So I thought this might be a good thing and it works great. I said it so I can just drop in so she doesn't have to touch it I can just call it or name and I bought a stand for her so I can point it and the direction where I can see pretty much her living room kitchen the area where she hangs out the most.. not to leave little cheat sheets around for her to talk to Alexa like if you follow them on say Alexa call Linda. Alexa what is the date Alexa what time is it? Alexa what's the weather today! I set up all the reminders on it for her meds & I can do it from my cell phone cuz I set up her account. so on my phone I sign out of my Alexa account sign in to hers to leave the reminders I know it seems like a little tedious thing but until they come out with something different this is perfect it's hard to drive over there everyday 5 times a day... her memory has really fallen so this is awesome she likes to watch the Patriots or golf I put reminders when they come on. The cute thing is I will say to Alexa remind you and she will say, oh no I remembered.. all her appointments, all her to do list, everything I put on Alexa to remind her and have her repeat several times so she actually gets the job done.. I think it should come on adjustable stand, I think it's kind of crazy that we have to buy a stand for it but that said if you buy it on sale it's not so bad but at full price they should give you a stand. Another great thing I like is if you have Amazon photos it can be a photo digital frame and no offense one of those aren't cheap so that alone is being andespecially for her senior I can load pictures up all the time as you can keep looking at them.  I just wish more people would have them. and the other complaint that I have would be the show doesn't seem to understand my voice as well as all my other dots.  I know that sounds crazy but it's totally true.. anyways I love it I think it's great for seniors especially and for checking on kids it's amazing. I think that there's other things that they could put on it to to make it a little bit better hopefully they'll kick it up a notch.",Totally worth it!

So far I am not happy with it.  First the screen always looks dark even though I set the brightness to high and turned off the adjust with ambient light.  On my original Show the screen would automatically go to sleep after several minutes.  If the 2nd gen has that setting I cannot find it.  The best I can find is to tell it to turn the screen off.  Why not a setting for sleep with several time options.  Last, my original show came with a very nice screen saver set of beautiful pictures from around the world.  The 2nd gen comes with a slide show of pastel water color type drawings or a blank gray screen.  There is an option to upload and create your own slideshow.

We loved so much we decided to get the Echo Show.  We thought bigger would be better and we were wrong.  Such a disappointment.  We were expecting everything would just scale up from echo 5 to the Show.  It doesn't. Text is small. The clock is smaller than on the Echo 5. We leave our Echo 5 showing the clock. We tried on the Show and it is so small we have to walk up to it. There is a zoom but it lasts about a minute  and the goes back small. Voice recognition is worse than any previous Alexa device. We often have say the wake 3 times to wake it up. Amazon should fix it so you scale text and clock on this unit. At least the clock shouldn be scalable. I'm afraid I can not recommend this.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2018,Michael Erickson,"I'm satisfied with my purchase. It does what it's claimed to do. I bought it as an upgrade to the Aamazon Dot I got a year ago. The crystal clear sceen is excellent - very sharp colors for any picture or video you might play. I'm not that into music, although I do you it occasionally for that. I mostly enjoy watching YouTube Videos on it. In regards to YouTube access, you just ask Alexa ""Open Silk"" to open its browser, and use the touch screen to open YouTube. I found it easy to use. It's cumbersome typing in the specific video you want, so it's best to touch the microphone icon and simply speak the name of the video. Once videos appear, you can use the screen to scroll to the one you want. I only have a couple minor complaints: The screen is always on unless you tell Alexa ""Screen Off"". But if you happen to bump the screen with your hand or arm, it comes back on. There is no ""off"" button. You can use the Do Not Disturb feature to have the screen be off at specific times, but again, if you accidently touch the screen again, it comes on. Secondly, the reviews rave about the sound quality. But I've found that the bass seems to be pretty strong, resulting in a sort of a muffled sound when Alexa responds to a question. You have to adjust the volume in those cases where the voice isn't super clear. The voice on the Echo Dot is clearer at times in comparison. At least that's my opinion. Others may disagree. Overall, I really like this product. It's screen is big, but the unit isn't much bigger than the screeen so it doesn't take up a lot of space on a counter or table. I don't use the Echo Show every day, but I'm still glad I spent the money on it.","Quilty product, sturdily-made"

Amazon should have included a battery which would allow a small amount of portability.  While the stand Echo can be located near an electrical outlet and function, the need to locate the Show at an outlet often negates the effectiveness of the camera and screen.  I'd love to be able to place the Show on the a kitchen counter or table and have a video chat.  If I wanted to move to the family room, it would be a simple matter to pick up the Show and move.

Frankly, it's not very useful.  It shows topics you can learn more about (which to my knowledge cannot be customized to be what I’m actually interested in knowing), but you have to enunciate very clearly for it to pick up on what you are saying, even though it’s a suggestion from the Echo. Then the information is frequently inane and not worth the effort.  I’ve also searched recipes on it, and it does give multiple suggestions and allows you to add ingredients to a shopping list. But when cooking from the recipe, the ingredients are on one page, and the instructions are on another, so you have to toggle between screens to see how much is to be added at each step.  I does play music well, and listens to commands such as to operate the connected Wi-Fi plugs I have throughout the house.  But for general information questions, it’s poor at best. Frankly, I wonder if I’d like Google for the home better for information.  I frequently ask Alexa something, get a wrong, off topic answer (or hmm, I don’t know that), and go to my phone and ask Google and get what I’m looking for.  For the money, not worth it.",Not that useful

Has a large, vibrant display, and arguably the best sound of any of my Echo devices.  I cannot compare it to either ""Plus"" - don't have either one of those, but can compare it to every other one and this Show produces a rather decent thump with the bass and the treble carries well.  The passive sub adds more to the depth of sound than one might expect. One complaint, and this is common to both this new Show and the original.  When you get a notification or a message on most other Alexa devices, you get a yellow ring on top that pulses to let you know at a glance that you've got one or more of them waiting for you.  Nope, nothing on this screen unless you happen to touch it and see the banner that says ""new message for..."" or whatever.  Would be really nice to be able to see at just a glance from across the room if you've got a message or notification.  I'm sure they could fix this with a software update, but I guess not enough people have complained about this for them to address the issue.

Unfortunately, the show falls short in this category, so I have returned my device.  For a device that has such a great video screen it seriously lacks support for video streaming.  There is no native support for YouTube, Netflix or any of the major streaming services, except Hulu.  You can access them through the Show's internet browser, but you can't use voice commands to do this, which completely defeats the point of having the Show.  Because of the limited streaming options that are available with voice activation I am giving the Echo Show only 2 stars. If you want a device for your kitchen that will let you stream videos from your favorite services a better option would be to get a Kindle Fire HD 10 put it in Show mode and hook up some decent speakers or to get a small TV and attach a Fire TV Stick.

Used the Amazon trade-in program (with my 1st gen Echo Show), which worked exceptionally well.  As for the new one, I have it in my kitchen on the breakfast bar.  And yes, with speakers in the back, it does need an open area so sound isn't muffled - no big deal IMHO. The screen size, sound, and color are superb.  It certainly dims well at night, so believe it would work fine in a bedroom.  Although some folks have entered negative comments about the various banners that come across the screen, I love them - they give me ideas about how to better use my Echo Show, as well as catching headlines and trending topics that I'd never think to ask about.  As a Prime member, I can easily stream music from Amazon.  Also, yes, the Echo Show can stream SiriusXM, which I have.  All you need is to pay for Internet streaming from SiriusXM and enable the skill for Alexa.  Works great (although you won't see any info about the song or artist, which does show up on regular SiriusXM device screens).  I use my Echo Show not only for music but to search for recipes, get the news and weather, change channels on DirectTV, call friends and family that also have Alexa devices, etc.  Very versatile!  Glad I upgraded!",Love the screen size and sound!

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jun 2019,MB,"It can’t multitask. And no Netflix. Say you’re listening to music or watching a YouTube video in the web browser or watching Hulu if you ask Alexa to set a timer. It cancels out whatever you were doing just to display the timer. Then you have to go back and restart whatever you were doing before. Also if you’re watching Hulu and you are finished you can’t say “Alexa Stop” or “Alexa stop playing” it doesn’t do anything. You have to say “Alexa go home” which doesn’t feel very intuitive. And it would be nice to have some Audio EQ options don’t get me wrong the sound quality is pretty amazing for the size but I would like to turn down the sub just a little because it vibrates all the knives and plates that are sitting on my counter and creates a negative listening experience. Would also be nice to have quick access to apps and other functions on screen instead of requiring you to use voice commands 100% of the time. Physically this thing is clean and solid good quality, software wise functionally it works well, the UI needs some more improvement. I’m glad I got it and also glad I waited for the 2nd gen to release before buying.","Excellent quality, UI needs to utilize the touchscreen more."

You ask for it to do something and it doesn't understand or hear you or give you the option of saying him I'm not familiar with that. And she says that quite often. I don't know if it's a faulty unit however, just has difficulty understanding when I ask to do something sometimes it does, or most of the time it does and sometimes it does not. For example, she said, you know you can ask me what the temperature is at a certain hour during the day, so I said Alexa, what temperature will it be at 2 o'clock this afternoon? And her response was, hmm, I don't know that one. Even though less than just two seconds prior to that she specifically asked me to ask for that question, perhaps I need to communicate with Amazon customer service and see if anybody else is been having these problems.",What you need to know prior to purchase

Because it is an item that is always on it is very annoying. While researching the show it sounded like a wonderful household companion that would fulfill my every need. After receiving it all I hear is I don't do that or I don't know that you are saying while all the time scrolling things to try. (my attempt at humor) Seriously I have set it up with the smart plug and the security camera and enjoy listening to classical music. I do hope they find a way to get rid of the Alexa tips and ways to adjust the clock size as not everyone has young eyes. After Christmas will set up a calendar etc..,Just like being married

There are forums lamenting how dogs are adversely affected, they cower, tremble and hide in fear.

I'm not going to get into voice recognition capability or accuracy of queried questions or requests because that is something we've been fighting with for the last 30 years.  I don't expect a miracle any time soon.  The speaker is very good considering the unit isn't meant to replace the studio module, and the screen is nice.  Calling out songs you want to hear is going to be annoying without Amazon Music, so be prepared to either pair your own playlist from your phone over bluetooth, or fork out a subscription to Music.  I do wish, although it's obvious not particular to one company, that you don't have to keep paying $10-$20 a month for this, that and the other.

I was very excited that he can play his music by voice command since he is not technology savvy. The hope was that the voice command will allow him to listen to music when he wants. Unfortunately Alexa pays two to three songs and stops. He has become so frustrated with the process of constantly asking to play songs that can't be found, and going to Youtube and getting bumped off so frequently that in a few days he said he does not want to use it anymore because it is too stressful. My internet search shows this is an inherent problem with the system and many have sited this short coming with Alexa.

I was worried about them not being loud enough but they are and the sound is pretty great.  It looks good and love that we can put our own picture on it as the homepage.  I love that it engages you throughout the day by adding interesting facts and new stories that show up on the screen.  However I have to remove a star for the same reason.  Let's say that Alexa shows a fantastical story about a huge banana someone has sculpted and it made headlines all over the world.  When you ask her to tell you about it, she reads the story but there is no true picture of the object in question.  Instead, you get to see a regular banana instead.  The name is Echo SHOW.  Please show me what you are talking about.  The video quality is pretty good when talking to others in different rooms and the recognition of voices is better than other Echo units.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2019,Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,"3rd UPDATE: I am now updating my rating to five out of five stars. Seems this latest update not only fixed follow up mode, it also fixed the annoying auto-wake function. Voice recognition has improved as well. Very satisfied now. UPDATE: Amazon released an update for the echo show that just loaded on mine, and now the follow up mode works perfectly. No more redundant commands just to perform one operation, excellent! Now if they just put a function to disable the auto-wake on the echo show, so that a shock sensor doesn’t wake it up every time you bump or even loud sounds wake it up and start flashing, stuff I don’t want to see. Overall great device, I change my review to four stars. There are a lot of good things about this product but bad things too. Right now it’s laying face down on my table, because I refused to have it bother me constantly by waking itself up in any movement, or even some sounds wake it up. For about the last week the follow up mode has refused to work, and this is a hindrance because the echo show will keep flashing mindless garbage on the screen until you tell it to turn the screen off. I didn’t want another voice command just to enter each operation. The intelligent thing to do would be to ask Alexa to perform an operation and then she does and after about 5 to 10 seconds the screen goes dark again. Sound is very good, real bass and treble.  Nice display, useful to have video information added. So, please fix the follow-up function, and maybe even change the programming to make the screen go black after the intended operation has been completed.  Subtle irritants in an otherwise excellent product.  But then again irritating enough that I’m considering throwing the echo show right in the garbage.",Very Good

It works well listening streaming music, radio, and some movies. Streaming movies that work well on my phone and laptop DON'T work well on the echo show. I suspect the echo is simply too slow to handle the job. I have a 5-year-old tablet that is somewhat slow such that some movies stutter and time out. The echo show behaves the same way such that it stutters and breaks up the movie. If I simultaneously watch the same movie on my laptop, phone and echo show; only the echo show messes up. However, if I watch an old YouTube black-and- white western on echo show, I don't notice any problem. I suspect the echo show is simply too slow for HD movies.

P.,"Super amazing device, I am only giving it five stars because of the quality. Really wish this had a camera cover slide like the show 5 or 8, I would like to keep the mic on without the camera sometimes. Also, Alexa can really suck at times. Sometimes an echo will not recognize what you are saying on one echo until you talk to another. Sometimes an echo in a completely different part of the house will respond for no reason. Search results are usually the craziest possibilities, often having nothing to do with what you asked. The most infuriating thing though is the smart home devices, they must be uniquely named but literally any overlap and you get a constant question about which device you mean because there are multiple devices with that name. No matter what device you say at that point the device is not found. The weirdest part is that the devices are grouped into being paired to a specific echo, so why can Alexa not figure out the device in the group? You cannot group lights together inside a group so you end up with many crazy named groups for your devices, instead of groups being nested. Say the wrong thing and the other side of your house turns on. Alexa will recognize the user speaking but this seems to only apply to two things, asking who is speaking and asking which account. Unsure why the account doesn't change based on the user talking. Family members have different names for things and asking who's account is logged in constantly is tedious...",This is a really cool device but Alexa has room for improvement

One negative is that the processor they chose for this model can barely get the job done. There is considerable lag to video operations, like clicking the screen to get the pause/back menu, asking Alexa to back up a few minutes etc. Sometimes it seems like it isn't going to do anything but it usually works after some pondering. I can't imagine that it would have cost much to make the thing slightly faster - look at the Raspberry Pi 4 for $38. The second negative is the sound. It is loud enough to hear over kitchen noise (just), but it is all base with very little highs. There are settings you can use to balance it out.

I'm highly disappointed that this doesn't have a web browser - lots of issues there because it can't do much because of that.  Beware if you're buying this for recipes as I did.

The only bad thing is that you can't load a Netfl;ix app, they do not have one that works with the Show. So while Amazon advertises watching video on the Show, what they really mean is that you can watch Amazon video, and only Amazon Video. You can't watch NetFlix because they did not make an  NetFlix app for the show, and Google owns Youtube, and since Amazon won't sell Google devices, Google won't let Amazon have access to youtube. This needs to be taken to the FTC to force them to work together. Amazon does not have the faith in their own products to keep selling. I have no intention to get any Google Device. I did have one, but I quickly got rid of it. My house is full of Amazon devices.  Now I have to consider sending the Show 2nd gen back, as it won't do what I bought it for, which is watch Netflix.

I thought a screen could ""screen"" almost anything - nope.  Even though others have reviewed the limitations of the show, it was difficult for me to picture how a device so beautiful could be so useless for streaming video.

I just don't see how I can use this unless I fork over hundreds of dollars to purchase prime videos and tv. Even though I have prime and the first season of a show is listed as free - the show told me I needed to go to the webiste and pay for the tv show in order to watch it. So, if you are happy watching whatever show manges to scrounge up for you or you really want this for video conferencing/camera monitoring, I would give this a hard pass. Yes, the sound is decent but I tried placing mine against a wall (normal) and the sounds is awful and bounces of the wall. This really needs to be placed a couple of feet away from a wall.

It is fun to begin understanding how to communicate with Alexa (she even has a birthday...November 6th). I'm going to get a book that explains in detail all the things Alexa can provide. As for the sound, it's fine for a small box that sits on my kitchen counter. I haven't received my 2 Echo Dots so of that is the integration I don't know yet. Though it does find songs I want and books I'm listening to on Audible. I'm sure I'll enjoy it more as I learn all of its capabilities.",The Echo Show is everything you'd expect.
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2020,Carol Meaney,"We got our original Echo and Dot and Auto as soon as they became available.  But, we waited on this one because we wanted bigger and better.  The sound is awesome, and the highest volume is too loud for us to ever use it!  The screen is amazing.  We love that we can view our own pictures and short videos.  We haven't called another user yet, but we will!  It's on our kitchen counter, where I do work from home, so we placed it on a small bench under a cabinet, so that I could see it over my laptop screen.  It functions verbally just like any other Echo.  The only downside is that you have to wait for a blue flashing line after you say the wake word before it will hear you. It's fast, but not as fast as our others, with the exception of the Auto Echo - that thing seems to take forever!  The best is when I say, ""Computer, show me Fleabag,"" and there it is.  We had to call it Computer as it is within earshot of Alexa in the living room and Echo in the TV room. It gets confusing sometimes, but we laugh a lot around here.  We also like that we can see and manage our shopping and other lists right on the screen. It's like having a giant app that opens on demand.","Almost like having a guest in the house!

I was hoping to be able to read all the Kindle cookbooks in my kitchen that I have bought over the years.  That really needs to addressed by Amazon, really disappointing.  I have tried a couple of recipes from Alexa.  Ok, but I would like to read my cookbooks instead.  I have tried the Fire for this purpose but it has more bloat software than any other computer.  I also hate how Alexa has to suggest something every time I ask her something - just answer the question! And the screen is always on with some bs on it I don’t care about (? the weather in Singapore-I live in Wisconsin).  I just unplugged it this AM because she would not close/turn off  the screen - who knows when I will feel motivated to plug it back in.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 May 2019,Amanda J.,"Echo show seemed to be the answer to my search for a device I could play music on and watch shows while I clean the kitchen/ house.  The idea of having a Smart Screen with voice recognition is great. But here is the thing it is super limited. Though Echo has a touch screen you can't actually touch and scroll through everything. I have many videos on Prime but I can only access my last 25 purchases or so. Hulu is available, but it won't allow you to switch accounts if there are multiple users. Also you can't pick which episode you want to watch on it, it automatically starts with the first or last viewed episode. For the cost of it I was expecting to have more features and to be able to do more. I can't pull up recipes I have on Pinterest or other sites only the ones  Alexa suggests. All in all unless you have the ring doorbell and a family member with another you want to ""face time"" with this isn't the best bang for your buck. I wish I had just held out and saved more for an iPad which would have done everything this does and more just with a lesser speaker. What's good: Speaker quality is great. Pleasing to the eye Not Good: Limited use on apps When you ask Alexa todo anything her voice is way louder than what you are actually listening to Doesn't always work and I have to repeat myself a lot.",Wanted to love this but....

The echo show is just OK. I bought this to replace our original echo and I really don't think it sounds as good. I have played a lot with the equalizer to try and make it sound better but still has a funny bass sound and just doesn't sound like I would like it. It doesn't sound bad just not as clear as I had hoped. I was also hoping that it would also do better at picking up voice commands but does about the same as the old unit. The addition of the screen is nice sometimes but not as much as I was thinking. It can also be very distracting for little kids that tend to be drawn to screens. I am always telling the unit to turn off the screen. Probably the most annoying thing is the volume control. It would be nice if it could normalize the volume. Different apps YouTube, Amazon music, etc. all play at different volumes. You also can not control the volume of her voice separately from the main volume. So if you have to turn up the volume high to hear a video on YouTube or another app the voice volume is crazy loud. It would be nice to have a system (voice) volume control separate from the main volume. Maybe this will be fixed with an system update or something in the future.",It's just ok

The 5inche screen turned out to be too small for video calling. That was the reason I purchased the 10inch echo show screen size, the improved 5pixel camera, and the improved sound. I am very happy with the echo show 10 and the main reason I purchased the 10inch, staying in touch with my family throughout these Covid-19 pandemic times. I really enjoy the big screen. I am new to this and have a few problems I am sure it will resolve with time. One problem, when video calling, the screen seems to focus on the other end, get darker or gets distorted, and then it might return to normal. Also, I receive many emails about Alexa’s skills and it is hard to remember them all. I should be able to access a list of the skills from the Echo and find what I am looking for. What I also would like to see, is the portability of the unit with a rechargeable battery support for transportability within the WIFI range. For the night, I would like to put the screen on black, only showing the time, date, and temperature. I probably will find the solution and be able to apply that function. At times, it automatically does go into it. Time will tell. Generally, am very happy with it.",It is a very nice screen size for video calling

Wallace,"It is great being able to see our Ring cameras on simple voice command. We have integrated some Kasa switches and can ask Alexa to turn on or off numerous things (lights, heating fans, heating pads). We integrated a Sensi thermostat and can control the temperature. The three things we do the most is check the weather, set timers for cooking, and play music. The sound quality is pretty good. There are two things I would change. There should be a micro RCA jack so that the system can be plugged into an amplifier when one wants to play the music on a larger scale. The other is Alexa should inventory the commands that we give and get better at recognition. Alexa doesn't seem to learn that I have about 10 commands so it makes the same mistakes over and over when I don't quite enunciate clearly. We are repetitive in our commands, Alexa should learn what we ask for more readily. Overall it is a tremendous device with speaker independent, continuous, untrained voice recognition.",It works well
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2019,Stefanie,I wanted to use my show for streaming music mostly. But it isn't very helpful. you have to know exactly what you want to listen to there is no way to browse which is very disappointing as it has a screen. You're better off just getting an echo dot.  The to do last and shopping list are huge pain to use. Almost everything wants to default to a shopping list which makes it next to impossible to make to do list and you can't change the default name on it. I am a big Google user it's nice that I can see our household Google calendar through echo show. However that is it there's no way to use any other Google functions or Netflix Hulu kind of works but is not that reliable and once again the browsing capability is not there.  In general probably should have gone with a Google home unit. It would have sucked that my Amazon music wouldn't stream but I end up using my phone and going through Bluetooth anyways because I can't browse for my music on my show. Also with Amazon show I don't like having the drop-in feature so anybody can drop in on us so I just don't use it instead. Where with Google home I could use their video calling and that would have worked awesome.,Disappointed.  Was hoping for more from a touch screen

I'd also like to use it to see who is at my front door and connect with ring. Rarely will it ever connect. Between ring being slow and the Show being even slower, whoever was at the door is long gone before I ever see anything, if I even get connected at all. She's pretty much only good for a few laughs and playing some music. Maybe good for the weather if I don't feel like stepping outside to see for myself.  Sound is decent.

No activity, user might be on vacation. There have been some home robbed and I wonder if this is what is going on.

Making video calls with family members on the second generation Echo Show allows us to be closer with a larger viewing area, crystal clear video and quality sound.  Watching videos on the 10.1"" HD screen or listening to music with the premium sound speakers while completing daily tasks has made these daily tasks so much more pleasant.  In addition, using the recipes to make new dishes is so much easier to read and follow.  Answering the Ring Video doorbell or watching a live view of your outdoor areas through the second generation Echo Show provides you the ability to view who is at your door or view your surroundings while standing across the room from the Echo Show.

It often responds to requests to playing music, adding reminders, or setting a timer with ""I don't know that one"".  it often takes multiple tries to have it understand us.  When pausing or stopping music, it acts as though it's obeying and then 5-10 seconds later, it starts playing again.  the poor quality has been mostly over the last 2-ish months.  I've tried resetting the device multiple times without improvement. there are no updates.  Customer Service hasn't responded via the alexa page.

I did a bit of research and decided on the Show and traded Sling for Hulu +. I am enjoying it immensely with only a few complaints.

Also, I will be watching something and when I ask the Show to turn on or off the lights or drop in to another room it doesn’t return to the program. Lastly, Alexa is so much louder than the programming so am always physically turning up or down the volume.  I know,  1st world problems right?

Touch is a 50/50 to work and I often have to tap things multiple times. If it does work there’s major lag. For example: I swipe left from the right side of the screen to pull up my smart home controls, it take two or three seconds for it to actually do it on the screen. It’s like an old computer that lags. Voice is much the same. For a $229 product it’s unacceptable. Unfortunately I’ll be selling mine and hoping for a better product in future generations. Sadness.

Hardware aesthetics are elegant, sound is great (Not as good as my true studio monitors, but this is for casual listening), and the screen is crisp. The automatic screen brightness and far-field microphones work flawlessly so far. Other reviews cover its qualities very well. I have two gripes with the device, one software and one hardware. My software gripe is that there are few options to change the time, weather, and suggested phrases on the home screen. I expect this will be added functionality in a future update. (Amazon, I hope your SDE's are reading these!) I'd like to have an invocation button on the device as the Echo/Dot/Plus do, but that's minor, and something I knew before purchasing the Show. My hardware gripe is with the rubber base. I was playing music with notable bass at 80% volume.

Maybe I just got a defective piece because I had issues right out of the box. There was no sound when I initially set it up but tech support person told me that software update will fix the issue. It was working for few weeks and then lost sound again. I reset it to factory defaults and it started working again. Now, I have no sound again for the last two months. I finally contacted Amazon device tech support today and this was my worse customer experience with Amazon. I tried to provide details of my experience but my review was rejected. Looks like only positive reviews for Amazon are allowed. It is a nice device when working properly but unfortunately mine hasn't been since I bought it. It has been rather frustrating experience so I had to share it.",No Sound from time to time

It can stand being more of a versatile unit, say having internet access but then it would be something else and not the echo show.  But I do like having it in my craft room where I can have access to something else besides music and sound.  I recommend adding more channels for video entertainment options.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2019,Keith Kramer,"Normally, I would not grade so harshly - especially with the limited evaluation time I had.  I have a Gen 1 that I have had for quite some time and it has worked well.  Gen 2 seemed like it would be a step up in nearly every way and I was very interested to try it out.  However, the Audio failed within a week. Alexa would get the commands but then was not able to output sound. I called and asked and hoped there might be an easy fix or a new device might be sent fairly quickly as a replacement . Instead, they had me ship the unit back for evaluation and repair if possible, or replacement if not. I finally heard back with an email that wanted a clarification of address so they could send the unit. I responded immediately to the email with the chat option.  Here I spent 40 minutes before they could even determine the device I was trying to get help on and then they finally reported that they couldn't proceed with the promised repair or replacements.  Instead, they had the audacity to suggest I buy another device and they would refund this later.  So... Now they have my money and my device and their solution was to ask me to purchase ANOTHER device. I asked for a refund.  I'm still waiting to see if that goes through.  The rest of these devices may be good.  Maybe I just got a lemon but this situation has made me very wary of purchasing another Amazon product.",Audio failed in a week then a customer support fail

I have the original Echo, Echo Dot, Echo 2, and the Fire TV Cube. I wish I can give this more stars. Pros: the screen is clear the integration with my ring doorbell and some of my other cameras are great and the Hub features very convenient. Cons: the sound quality if the screen is facing you the sound is not that great if you're facing the speakers the sound is amazing. The other issue I've had is my microphone there's 8 microphones and it still has a problem hearing is especially if the TV is on but my Fire TV queue which is right next to the TV here's me very well. I think with a few software updates they can make this unit great and I can give him more stars.

So much better than previous Echos and dots.  Starting with the packaging which was phenomenal how it was engineering to fit this gem just perfectly.  Instructions couldn’t have been easier, literally plug and go.  We haven’t begun to tap into all the new features but are looking forward to trying them.  Way to go Amazon!

Having now got it, i must admit that its a must have at every home. Compared to the Show 1, the screen size is a big improvement while HD quality display makes watching the Show 2 a pleasing experience. The sound quality is far improved with an in-depth Base sound on the new Echo show. The touch panel is also more sensitive and responds to even a slight nudge. I received the Echo Show 2 with a one months Hulu Subscription. Now that's what i call music! This Echo Show plays all our favourite Live TV channels (CNN, Fox, Cozy, Boomerang for kids .......) available on Hulu. This is indeed a new chapter in Television entertainment. In addition, Echo Show now has apps that can also play back some free to air Live News and entertainment channels. I have so far no negative feedback on the product. I did however noticed that once connected to a Bluetooth speaker (in my case to a Yamaha bluetooth), there was a little lagging in the sound track. This is not the case with Echo Show 1. Maybe at the next software update, Amazon can fix this minor concern. As always, A great product from Amazon. Try it Guys - it's sure worth the price!",Best Echo Show thus far!

For me, the sound is good (i'm not an expert on sound, so it wouldn't surprise me if you disagreed), the picture is good, and it just straight up works.  I personally think the device is great.  I like how it does food recipes and music.  I don't really use it for smart home use, so I can't comment on that.

Emery,"Bought this with great excitement to be able to play prime movies while in the kitchen. Sadly this Alexa is very hard of hearing. Some commands went unnoticed. The worst was trying to get it to play Prime Movies. That's right Amazon's device could not play movies from it's own streaming service without us wanting to pull our hair out. Most of the time she ignored play commands, other times the movies would just never start even though she showed the movie, and said she would play it. 1 star is to generous.","Awful device, pure frustration"
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,Juli,"Wow! I LOVE the Echo Show! The ease in set-up is excellent. I remember all too well how difficult it once was to install/set-up any computerized device...those days are long gone. It's only been a couple days, but, I'm astonished at having recipes and the companion videos available without lifting a finger! I loved my Echo Spot, but the Echo Show is phenomenal! I'm giving the Spot to my son and I'm sure he'll upgrade to the Show at some point. The HD is excellent. The sound is excellent. I'll update this review as I work with it more, but I'm extremely happy so far! My only major, major COMPLAINT is the ""Have Alexa Try This...,"" which pops up at the bottom of the display, which is a problem the Echo Spot has (many users complain about this). With the Spot this took up the whole screen; with Show it is smaller but so what. If Amazon wants to stay ahead of Google and Facebook gadgets it best listen to the complaints...the Show is not cheap and the feeling of being being used is palpable. At least give us the choice to have the suggestions on or off. Can't this be changed during your updates? Anyway...yes, it deserves a 5-Star Rating!",The Echo Show is phenomenal!

It will do everything that an echo (I have 1) or echo dot (I have 2) will do with voice commands. The sound is better for music as it has a better bass response. I can have it show me the camera from my ring doorbell but I have to tell it to show me. I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to come on automatically when motion is detected or the doorbell rings which is what I hoped to use it for.There is a lag time of a second or two in the video & sound from the doorbell. I don't think that the lag time is from router speed. Could be from the ring. I have an Orbi mesh router system with 2 satellites. The test speed of my router is 84mbps which should be fast enough.,Excellent picture & sound

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jul 2019,Jon,"I had always wanted to have something like this in the kitchen. I had often used an iPad for looking at recipes. This just blows that concept away.  Having the visual to along with things you already use everyday with Alexa is one of the best ideas Amazon has come up with. I love being able to see the lyrics for songs as they play. I love being able to watch my favorite movies and Prime originals from my Prime account while I'm cooking dinner. I love being able to see the weather forecast with icons and multi-day outlooks. I love being able to pull up recipes using ""The Sous Chef"" app. I love seeing everything that is on my shopping list as I create and add new items. We have so many different Alexa enabled devices in our house and I can control everything from this amazing little hub. The screen allows me to dim lights I have in different zones in the house. I can check our baby's room with our Wyze camera. I can drop in on other rooms to communicate with the rest of the family when they are in a different section of the house instead of having to yell ""dinner's ready!"" at the top of my lungs. The sound quality is superb compared the generation 1 echo and echo dot devices. The picture quality is stunning for such a compact device. I watched one of ""The Hobbit"" movies the other day while cooking and I could not get over how crisp the picture and sound were. Some things are not fully integrated yet, which is why I did not give it 5 stars. I have Kuna lights and I was hoping to be able to see my Kuna cameras at each door, but this hasn't happened yet. Also, there is no way to set a screen time out on it yet. You can turn off the screen by saying ""Alexa, turn off screen"" but otherwise it stays on for quite sometime before shutting down. Also, with the screen time out, if you are in a web browser, like Silk, watching something streaming online, it will go back to the home screen after a few minutes. This is frustrating if you are watching youtube videos or streaming content from Netflix or something like that. Overall, I love this device. It has taken the great Alexa-enabled home we already have and enhanced it to juggernaut status. I think some of the things which are cons right now will eventually come through in the form of an update of the software. The price, design, and features are on point and worth the money. Thank you Amazon!",Home automation Juggernaut

The sound quality was outstanding, and she could always hear and understand our conversations (unlike the telephone, which didn't work well with her hearing aids). The drop in feature allowed us to do video chats without the need for her to do anything, other than come sit in front of the screen to see our smiling faces. She was even able to make outgoing calls just by saying ""Alexa call Sue"". However, if Alexa asked any questions, such as ""phone or alexa device"" it confused her. Fortunately Alexa learned to call the most recently used device, so that was not a recurring problem. We also set up a Amazon Prime Photos album to display family photos on the screen when not in a call, which she loved. It was a bit annoying to have Alexa suggestions appear on the screen over the photos - we turned off as many features as we could (weather, calendar alerts, etc.) but it still showed stuff over the photos frequently. I was able to control most of the features remotely from an iPhone logged in to the same Alexa account as the Show. We could also check the status of the Show from the Alexa app on the iphone, and alert the staff at her facility if the Show needed to be reconnected to the wireless, which happened twice over six months. Overall this Show was a huge factor in helping us all stay sane and in touch with our otherwise isolated loved one.",Godsend for visiting with grandma

There is no way to adjust the screen sleep time apparently. I contacted customer service and tech support and was informed that it's not possible to do at this time.

We started with a Echo Spot in our kitchen with the idea that some music or an audio book might be nice to help pass the time while stuck in the kitchen. Once we got used to the Spot the Show started to sound like more of an good idea. I've had the Show for a month now and am really pleased with it. The sound is great and the video is nice to have for YouTube or other videos. It even connects to my Ring doorbell although I haven't used this feature much yet. A couple of nitpicks... The shape of it does not allow for the Echo Show to be easily mounted to a wall or under cabinet. Important for those of use with limited counter space. YouTube has to be set to 'desktop' in order to watch it without the screen timing out. This was frustrating to have to work out. The touchscreen could be easier to use. At least for my old and inflexible fingers. I might purchase a pen for it.,I use it every day

Now they have taken that away. I used to be able to ask it to spell words for me and it would actually show the word on the screen which was nice.  No it now longer shows the word on the screen.  Why the heck would the developers remove that feature. Browsing for movies on Prime is clunky and slow. You can not play U-tube or Netflix on this. I have spent a lot of money on Alexa devices, now I am worried that maybe I picked the wrong infrastructure.  Shall I see what google devices can do for me? The weather has very little detail.  You would think that a radar on the video screen might be a nice touch even, but you can hardly get a basic forecast that is more than a few icons and a temperature. I was hoping things would get better over time....Instead it is getting worse!! Also note how they rig the review with just the 3 features that it can do.  Sure it can do Voice Recognition as well as the $30 dot, sure it has Alexa integration as that is a basic feature, sure the sound is pretty good and better than $30 dot.

The 8"" screen is superb and the sound terrific.

The screen quality is excellent and the sound is fantastic. While i love how the image quality looks and how the sound performs, it does have a few flaws. There is no main screen where all of your apps will live, You will need to ask the Echo to open things up. For some reason when ever i ask to open spotify it asks me to set up a video provider on the alexa app. The Hulu app is limited in what you can search or watch and its the same thing for prime video. It is almost impossible to get the echo show to open up the correct show when you ask her to. I have found i have to ask the echo to open something and then look for it manually. It is pretty bulky and takes up a bit of space . The alexa app itself is a little hard to figure out and has made me use a google home to control my home devices.

I have had nothing but problems with this.  Hulu does not steam correctly.... half the time when I ask Alexa to find a movie she does something else.  The voice recognition is crap.  I have several other Echo devices and do not have the same problems that I do with this one. I purchased two.... one for home and one for work.  I seriously can't get either one to work correctly.  I really wanted to get one for my grandma so that we could video chat, but I don't think she would be able to get it to work. Also.... if you want it to be touch screen you should be able to pull up the skills to use them.  I like to use Spotify but forget it on this thing.... it has no idea what Spotify is let alone telling it to play a certain play list.

Voice recognition and sound output is considerably better and it remains easy to setup.

The bulbs were free as a Christmas incentive from Best Buy. We have used this as a timer to remember when to give medication and when to use medical devices, like ice machines, that you can only use for a certain length of time. We just speak and the Echo Show sets the timer all day long. The timer displays as it counts down, say for 20 minutes. For timers that are set for hours it shows how much time is left until the next alarm without asking. We don't touch anything. It has been a life saver!

How about dimming and stuff? - Most annoying if you're watching a video and say ""turn on/off lights...!""

Yowell,"I really like this device it resides in my Kitchen The Alexa functionality is good and getting better all the time. Sound and screen size is pleasing but like the rest of the device, it could use improvements. My two main complaints are #1 the is lack of multiple users control and #2 tablet type functionality.  If you want to make a call you can only pull from one address book which is cumbersome for a device meant to serve a home as a centralized device. The device is limited to the echo show mode and Aleza only and has no tablet-style functionality like adding your favorite apps which is limiting at best and a gross omission at the very least. I do hope the platform improves overall. Look at it this way if I want to add a new Hue or smart thing device I have to pick up my Fire HD 10 or phone or laptop to add it so Alexa can control it because the Echo Show is useless in this regard. Not what I expected and I'm sure very frustrating for many less tech-savvy DIYers.","Not all that, Yet"

Sound is mediocre. But I didn't expect much on that front. I have it right on my kitchen counter. I will call out alexa from 10 feet away and instead of echo show answering my call, my echo in another room thirty or more feet away answers. I physically have to stand close to the show for it to answer. Connection pops on and off constantly. My echos don't do that. Had so much trouble trying to get pinterest up which is main reason for my purchase so I could use it to read my pinterest recipes. Also i keep bluetooth on as I also have a fit that is connected. I had paired my phone bluetooth with echo show so I could make phone calls but now it hears me on phone and responds thru it.  What a mess. Not happy.",Not happy

I love everything about the Echo Show, except for how it works with my Nest Doorbell.  Echo show  will not tell you or display, if someone is at your door or ringing your doorbell.

I bought 3 so my kids and parents have them and we can video with granddaughter. It is easy to use for things like turning on movies, music, video conferencing, viewing security cameras, and video conferencing. HOWEVER, I cannot even fathom the reasoning behind not having even a short term battery. It comes with a six foot cord which won't even get you out of the room you're in.  My plan was to be able to keep it in my office and take to kitchen when needed.  I cannot do that without unplugging, replugging and waiting for it to set up.  The only reason I can come up with for no battery is Amazon doesn't want you to be able to take it room to room but wants you to purchase additional shows for each room you would need it in.  I find that frustrating...and a little infuriating. I am currently looking into whether a longer power cord can be purchased and will update when I find out.",Handy & Easy to Use...BUT No Battery

I have a pair of Sonos play 5 mounted on top of my kitchen cabinets my wife was playing some music and I had to ask if the sound was spraying out of the Sonos or the echo show. As for the echo show itself . I’m not super impressed with its functionality. It kind of crashes when trying to watch Hulu.  We have a large open kitchen / dining / living room we used to have a echo dot on top of the fridge, it could hear us at normal conversation level in any of the rooms . The echo show is on the counter directly across from the fridge , and now we have to shout commands when we are in the living room . One of the features I do enjoy is having it show my camera roll . Most of the Alexa apps are designed to be used with out a screen . We have rings and the integration seems week. I would like the camera view to come up on its own, with out my having to say the command .","Great sound, but that’s about it"

The page slide is snappy and quick. The OS is android based and operates smoothly. The YouTube integration isn’t the best and still takes several steps to get to. The voice recognition is as good as it gets; however, I recommend selecting “short answers” to avoid having to listen to the rather long and drawn out default responses. Adding smart home devices is a breeze and so far I’ve added smart outlets, Wemo smart dimmer switches, Philips Hue bulbs and a couple of echo dots.

Don’t really like “booming” bass sound while listening to rock music so I had to turn bass down using equalizer. Besides music, we use it for timers, reminders, weather reports, phone calls, recipes, jokes and various skills. What a great “toy” as well as useful device!

It feels half baked, mostly because the screen in not very functional or useful. I think this will be great for my mom to be able to make video calls and I've decided to give one of mine to her. I'll keep the other one to talk back and keep it it in the bedroom or office to replace the alarm clock. To make this better Amazon needs to make the screen more functional. Just give us a control panel with different screens. Let us put the home automation controls in there so that I can view (and change) the settings of all of the items in my smart home setup. THAT is what this should be. Actually I've been using one of my Echo Shows in the same room as my Fire TV Cube and that setup is almost impossible. I just wish this was functional with the voice control turned OFF  and that this and the Cube could work together rather than against each other as this would be a perfect control/info panel.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Aug 2019,JJ,"In all honesty I really did not need to purchase the Echo Show 2nd gen. But couldn't pass it up during Amazon Prime Day!! Anyhow it took me a week or so to install do to work schedule but after setting up I could have done it in less than 10 mins. Pros: 1. I really love the on screen display. It alternates with weather info, news articles and makes suggestions on current events you can watch. 2. If you are not into that you can setup for it to show you photos from your amazon account. 3. If you own a Ring door bell, another cool feature is that you can ask it to show you camera ""xyz."" This feature comes in handy if you need to see an alert you got at your front door. Yes guys if you set it up as a routine you can have your Alexa say "" someone is at the front door. "" 4. Each time you trigger her name ""Alexa, Computer, Echo"" you hear a nice tone that lets you know she is listening. This comes in handy if you are not facing the unit. Other wise if you are able to see the unit you see the typical blue lights as a bar across the bottom of the screen. 5. When playing music from Amazon Music, the echo show, displays you lyrics which for the kids is a lot of fun. For adults who thought the lyrics were something else you are in for a learning treat as you sing along to the correct lyrics. 6. You can integrate multi room speaker setup so that you can play music simultaneously throughout all your alexa devices. 7. The sound quality on my echo gen 1 was pretty nice. The sound quality on the echo show 2nd gen is AMAZING! 8. I went with this model because it has a lovely 10.1 screen, big enough that you can see pretty well across the kitchen as you prep your ingredients from a recipe. 9. I don't watch movies yet on the device but I do watch videos 10. I don't make video calls yet but I do send messages to friends and when they respond back you can see an icon letting you know you have a message. 11. The echo show 2nd gen is terrific about showing you your events. For some reason echo gen 1 when I would ask for my events for the day it would tell me I didn't have any. Perhaps operator error. This unit shows me everyday what my events will be!!! 12. When you ask it to do something you get to see that it is turning on lights and at what percent those lights are on. You can either manually change the percentage or you can ask her to change the percentage. Just really cool that you can see it being done in front of your eyes. Cons: 1. Not a big deal but the echo show 2nd gen seems to take a few seconds longer when I ask it to do something. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase, the family loves using the unit more than before, and I would highly recommend this product to friends and family. I can’t wait to see how they continue to improve on this device.",Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase

Sound is very good and overall a great product. I had been using an echo which I liked but was going to purchase an echo plus but decided to get a Show, Spot, and fire tab 8 with Alexa. My biggest complaint is you truly cant get the display to show what you want. With some effort you can get close but ultimately you get messages that say Try""Alexa …. Playing movies and such is also not convenient. I have several fire sticks and they work great and way easier then the Show. Another issue is if you start adding hi Res cameras you better have a very good internet connection. I run dual band DSL and upload speed seems to get in the way with a few devices running. With a few software changes it could be a great product, the hardware is overall very good. My spot and show went back.

I just ask Alexa to either tune me into my favorite radio station to listen to my favorite DJs in the morning or I have her play some of the songs I have on file or I have her show me some of the films we have available on Prime Video.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2019,Jon H.,"I like the product. The larger echo show for the kitchen (2nd generation) has great sound quality. The video also seems to be better quality than smaller echo shows you might use to replace an alarm clock by a bedside. It’s a little confusing out of the box knowing how communication works, especially if you have several and family members have one or more. You will want to know which shows ring in somebody else’s house. Does one ring, or do all of them ring in their house! I think they are tied to a contact, and their amazon account, and a mobile. However, you could call them from the Alexa app in your cell phone, or a landline, or Alexa amazon device to another one. It gets a little confusing if you have kids and they do not have their own amazon account. So if you call the parent’s large echo in the kitchen, the kids echos might also ring if tied to the parent’s amazon account, and mobile. In summary, great product, wish there was an extensive manual on communication features for the show product since they have video capabilities. People buying that product will focus on interconnecting with family via video calls. I liked the vast array of commands Alexa responds to. Many of them are useful, such as maps and directions, weather, cooking recipes, and playing music. Ability to pair your phone for music is nice too. If you have several they can work as an intercom throughout your home, and more.","Great sound, handy helper, stay connected with other family, and supt. for smart devices."

Since I still feel they are targeting the this for a corner of your kitchen all of the sound is now reflected from the back and while it is much more ""spacious"" and ""immersive"", its not nearly as clear as front fired speakers, this is true with TVs, phones, tablets, laptops etc so its not a device specific behavior.

I thought surely not, but yes, the Show was face down on the tile, shattered.  The bass of the music must have slowly been moving the Echo Show back until it fell off the end table.

I don't like amazon music as much as my other music app.  Some of the music titles they play in their stations aren't the #1 hits I want to listen to....some aren't desirable at all.

Bought another (on sale this time) and magically the same issues.....I own 9 echo devices, I am an early adopter, but this is truly impacting my trust in the Amazon brand, it took me 30 mins to get a replacement sent out...This should not be so hard to fix, both the hardware issue and the customer service!",2nd 2nd Gen Show with Camera Failure

I have just finished a chat with Amazon support who confirmed there is NO WAY to turn off these ""Things to Try."" Clearly whoever came up with this does not have children, because my children interrupt Alexa every 4 seconds to ask her whatever she is suggesting. Or maybe they do have children, because who else is going to ask her to ""tell me a horse joke"" or ""share something weird""? Beyond that, I do not necessarily want my children to be aware of all of these skills, especially when she is suggesting they play certain videos. We've had a kids' Echo Dot for a year, and it's been fine because as far as my kids have known until now, the only thing Alexa can do is play music and read stories. Now they are NONSTOP asking it to do all sorts of stuff. Not okay, Amazon.","No, you cannot turn off ""Things to Try"""
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Sep 2020,Shannon McMillen,"I bought the 10.1 inch echo show for my mother of 88 years old.  I wanted to buy her something very useful and something that she could use to make her life more easier.  I was correct to buy a 10.1 inch echo show. The 10.1 inch is a larger screen so it would be easier for her to read things from it and see the images better.  She only has one functional eye which limits her vision considerably. She also likes the picture show and she can glance also to see the time and outside temperature and what day it is. It's getting harder for her to get up and walk around so much to do things now.  She can now turn on the air conditioner, various lights in the home and also the fan.  She can also change the channels on the direcTV.  She likes to ask it with the temperature is and the seven day forecast.  She likes to see the video news briefs and if she wants to watch one of them all she has to do is tell Alexa.  She has commented quite a number of times but she just dearly loves this echo show and it was the best thing I ever could have bought for her.  In the beginning she thought $230 was way too much for something like that, but now she does not care how much it cost because it does so much for her and it makes her life more enjoyable at home alone when I'm on working.  I surprise tour with the video call from my cell phone sitting in my truck over 1500 miles away she was just absolutely thrilled that she could see me and when I moved my cell phone around looking out the doors and windshield she saw what looked like where I was and it made her happy and she felt a lot less lonely and depressed living alone while I'm working away from home.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2019,K Lehn,"My first Echo Show was the first generation, so when I bought the 2nd generation, I figured it was an improvement.  Screen wise it is, speakers, there's too much base (there is an EQ, even with the base turned all the way down, still too much base).  The other issue is the speakers facing away from you, behind the device.  The first gen unit I could hear throughout my apartment at lower volumes, the second gen unit, I can't unless I really turn it up loud.  As I said my apartment, I use my Echo Show as an alarm clock, and listen to music while I wake up.  Getting back to the base issues, the last thing I figure my neighbors want to hear is the base coming from my Echo Show as base travels very well through walls.  So if you live in an apartment, and you wish to use this device as an alarm clock, I would advise finding a gen 1 Echo Show instead, as it's a much better choice, even with the smaller screen size.","Nice large screen, too much base"

It's wonderful and I actually find myself wanting to talk to the experimental AI bots. They can have an entire conversation with me, with which I'm fully enamored!

You also have an  option to integrate it with your surround sound system, via Bluetooth. It was extremely simple to set up and get onto my network.

The highs are crisp and clean and the bass delivers a decisive boom. When ie..... asking Alexa for to play the news flash aka flash briefing as I do on my dot every morning, I was pleasantly surprised by the Echo show which played a video flash briefing (watching the news instead of listening) This sevice allows some Apps (Amazon calls them skills)  like Hulu,  Prime video, You Tube, plus a few others,  but sadly like many Amazon devices they dont allow competitors like VUDU, Netflix, Google Play.

I wanted this to replace a kindle fire I use to stream videos and live TV in my kitchen. Needless to say the kindle works better. This Echo Show does not do what it says it is doing. For example I ask for a Prime Video by name and episode (yes I am that specific) and Alexa says here’s blah blah blah (exactly what I asked for) and NOTHING plays or it says it is playing something completely different. Also cannot add apps or really do anything. Big waste of money! Use a Kindle Fire attached to an Echo.,Does not do what it says!

The design is definitely a nice upgrade ...the bigger screen definitely a plus. My one gripe is ,  performance , although it seems slightly better not enough considering the huge upgrade in design. It works well and as expected( as most Amazon echo devices)and as with all the Amazon echo devices there's so much untapped potential and I say that because there's such a high learning curve for making things happen with Alexa / echo that is hard for the average person to use alot of smart home functions... My only other real gripe and despite the speaker sounding great its still positioned in the back... Oh well I guess that's the trade-off for that great screen.",Loving!!! the new design but...

Have a few things connected to Alexa such as, lights in different rooms, home thermostat and a ring doorbell. Everything works great with Alexa with one personal drawback with the ring door bell and that is you have to tell Alexa Show to ""show front door"" in order to view the video, otherwise it only announces there is motion or your door bell is pushed. I wish it would automatically show video in order to give you a faster response. I have a bulb in a tall floor lamp beside my chair that works with Alexa. The light is a little out of reach for me and all I have to do is tell Alexa to turn the light on and can be dimmed too, works great.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2019,A. Beasom,"These devices are great.  I own two of them.  The display is sharp looking and the sound quality is fantastic.  As a digital picture frame they are terrible.  The problem even occurs on the gen 1 Echo show.  I am talking about the background picture display and NOT the slideshow mode that is also possible on these devices. For the background, I choose a folder of pictures from Prime Photos.  It cycles the photos every 90 seconds or so while showing the overlays I have selected (weather, drops ins, sports scores) and also transitions between the Amazon trending topics.  At least once a week, it will get stuck on a picture and never change it unless I power cycle.  Also, when it gets to the last photo in the album, it will usually just go back and show the last 10 pictures again, rather than start back over at the beginning. I have contacted Amazon product support about this and they ignored me.  I am not a software engineer, so perhaps programming for pictures is a very difficult thing.  It is possible though, as I've seen other devices do it.  I would also like to see some options for the background pictures, such as picture duration/speed and a shuffle option.  This request to Amazon has fallen on deaf ears too.  Maybe they just don't care. I have tried about everything I can to fix this/trick it to work and have not had luck.  Others I know have the same issues with background pictures.  I would use the slideshow mode, but it doesn't display any overlays or additional information.  If Amazon would fix this I would give it a higher score. UPDATE:  The show devices keep getting worse for using as picture displays.  I have an album I use as the background (not the slideshow feature).  It changes between a photo in the album and the Amazon trending content.  Every 3 cycles the picture changes to the next one in the album.  It has got progressively worse.  It used to get stuck on a picture forever, unless I reset it.  Then it would get to the end of the album and instead of starting over, jump back about 10 pictures or so and loop them.  Now, it skips pictures in the album randomly and gets stuck in a loop randomly in the album.  This keeps getting worse.  This should not be that hard to program.","Great device, but background pictures continue to loop and not cycle correctly"

It has become terribly slow even after resetting, and is nothing more than a good speaker. You could just buy a really good speaker for less money than this paper weight. When I first saw this product announced I was super excited.  After spending far too much money on it, I'm left sad.  As the title alludes to, the hardware is there.  The hardware of this thing is amazing, the sound quality is great, the screen is great.  But the software is terrible.  Alexa herself certainly needs some upgrades, but the actual OS of this machine is terrible.  It is not intuitive to get to anything, including the browser.  It also has about no app support so no Netflix like I was hoping, and youtube is usable at least through the browser, but definitely not great.

I have several Alexa enabled devices that function just fine including an Original Echo Show, (2) Echo show 5s, an Echo Dot, and 2 Fire Sticks but the 2nd Generation Echo Show does not live up to the hype. It often does not recognize my wake word “Alexa” or has an incredible lag of 30+ seconds before it recognizes it. If I’m streaming a video and I give an auditory command such as “Alexa Pause”,  the blue light often comes on acknowledging that the device heard the wake word but refuses to comply to the directive.

I Moved one of the echo plus upstairs and then tried to pair the echo show with the sub and the other echo plus.  Found out that only similar devices will pair with the sub.  So you need two echo plus or two echo plus shows to pair with the sub, you can not mix and match which to me seems a bit ridiculous.  If the alexa ""plus"" devices can communicate with each other and broadcast to each other why would they not be able to mix and ""sync"" with the sub.

I was bummed to discover that there isn't a skill for Netflix and that video streaming services like Hulu and Prime don't have their full capacity.

Spotify should allow us to select playlists, radio, or artists from the echo touchscreen. We should be able to use a basic web browser to find recipe's online instead of the terrible ""all-recipes"" app and search functionality. We should be able to cast from our phone, or at least do something like ""pushbullet"" does, where we send a link to the show, and it loads it in the Show (I'm thinking for random web recipes, or youtube links, etc... Without these basics, I don't see the appeal to the show right now - these are really bare minimum to me to make it useful. The Google Home Hub does a lot of this already as well from my experience with it. The sound is quite decent, the form factor is good, the screen is nice, it's still an echo and has alexa. It's just not quite there yet, and I hope it improves.","It's ok, It's good mostly, but it should do more, and it drives me crazy"

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Apr 2020,gavin,"ive had my Echo Show 10 and Show 8 now for about 4 months and i love to listen to music on it and otherthings but it leaves MUCH to be desired on the voice recognition side. i have to yell at them for them to respond when their playing music loud they can barely hear and they are SLOW  very very slow at times. specialy when watching youtube or videos it acts like a slide show at times and takes forever to load. Now i also have an Echo Dot 3rd gen and Echo 1st gen they can hear much better over music and my echo 3rd gen can even hear me talking low from across the room i do not have to yell at it. The main difference between the screenless echos and Echo Shows is the CPU that is used. the regular Echos use ARM cortex Proccesors which are the main player in tablets, most android devices general and Even Raspberry PIs. Even Amazon Fire tablets use ARM CPUs hmmm i wonder why. BUT The Echo Shows use Intels ATOM proccesors which i am almost 100% certain is why The Echo Shows are so slow at times. Intels Atom line is extremely inferior to ARM and Snapdragon when it comes to running tablets and small devices they are slow and do not sport nearly as many cores theirfor the RAW power that is needed to run a Tablet smoothly or an Echo Show HUB is non existent. I now ask amazon WHY did you use ARM CPUs inside regular Echos as well as your Fire Tablets YET you used Inferior ATOM CPUs for your Most expensive Echos with screens that need that Raw power ARM can provide. ARM CPUs are cheaper as well so i do no understand why you would undercut your loyal customers. Intel ATOM CPUs barely even work inside Netbooks with Linux or android tablets i wouldnt even Expect them to do Remotely well in voice recognition/AI based Smart home Device that is basicly Multifunctional Stationary Tablet",Inferior CPU to Screenless Echos

This glorified bluetooth speaker never seems to want to connect via bluetooth and in trying to connect she just starts spewing out dumb trash about something completely irrelevant every time I try to connect my phone.  If it wasn't for my wife wanting to keep it around to ask it what the temperature is outside I would have thrown this useless brick into the trash immediately.  I despise this thing with every ounce of my being.  Not only that but the stupid thing is just sitting around listening to my every word and reporting it back to Jeff.  I was talking about clothes hangers to my wife in the nursery and boom clothes hanger adds online.  Jeff, you come in second place in my hate rankings.  Stop listening to me and my family you terrible demon man. Anyway, don't buy this.  All it does is not work how you want it to and invade privacy.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2019,Colin P. Fraizer,"I like the Echo Show. It's in my kitchen and I use it a lot. (I also have Echo or Echo Dot devices in my living room, bedroom, home office, and the kids' bedrooms.) A couple improvements that would have made this a 5-star review: - It does not support the same set of apps available on the FireTV and FireTV Stick (which I have on my TVs). Notably, it apparently does not support the Netflix app. I don't understand why. - It lacks some nice features that FireTV and FireTV Stick support. For example, I subscribe to YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) and like to skip ads and share video history between my devices. Signing in to Google (YouTube app) on a FireTV is EASY-PEASY. You visit a link on your phone or computer and it gives you a short code that you enter on the FireTV. [If you use a password manager or use long/complex passwords, it's a real pain to get them and type them on a non-keyboard device like FireTV. It's a similar pain on the Echo Show touchscreen.] - If I ""drop in"" to the Echo Show from the Alexa app on my iPhone, it does not do video chat, though it seems like it should. [I actually tried it with the Alexa app on several camera-equipped and reasonably-recent iOS devices.] More nice-to-have features: - Allow Echo/FireTV devices to belong to multiple, overlapping groups. I want a groups like ""whole house"", ""upstairs"", and ""downstairs"" where the latter two are subsets of the first. - Allow the announcement ""Alexa, tell everyone…"" feature to be directed to groups or individual devices, so I can say, ""Alexa, tell group 'upstairs' to come to dinner."" - Allow Audible book playback across multiple Echo/FireTV devices just like music playback (so multiple devices act as if they were speakers attached to a single stereo receiver/CD player).",Doesn't support some apps from FireTV

Remove the ability to use Netflix and most other relevant streaming content. Make navigation very awkward and really really slow. Make the Alexa digital assistant just slightly less smart than she is on any of the other Echo devices. Reduce the quality of the image and the sound. And cut the screen size about 50% from the smallest Smart TV you can buy these days. If you're still happy, buy another Echo Show. I have no idea why people are buying this thing. I purchased a 49 inch Samsung Smart TV for only slightly more than the cost of this expensive paperweight. Not saying a 49 inch TV is comparable, by the way, so please don't try to online shame me for my opinion.  I have 5 echo devices which I love. This is simply not worth the money for what it does.

Only two complaints that I have is.. 1) I wish it would come with some sort of internal battery.  Doesn't have to be much, just enough to move it from room to room without having to reboot.

Krystowiak,"If I could it would probably get a 4-½. Bought it primarily for displaying Ring video, because the Ring app, takes more time than it should to load and display. The eShow Ring skill takes somewhere between 7 to 8 seconds from when the Ring Doorbell is pressed. But everyday I seem to find something new. Works just like an eDot, but more interesting with video.. Love the recipe photos, step by step instructions voice controlled, also downloaded 2 recipe Skills one being the Food Network & All Recipes, so quite extensive. Spelling, now you also see the word. Shows any calculation, if you don’t get all the numbers after the decimal point. Weather shows current statistics, followed by forecast. News in some cases you see the person reading the news. Music playing shows the lyrics. Trending topics — some are interesting. Down graded ratings because speakers face backward. Bass level better than an eDot, but not that much better, because of the direction. Works well with Hulu. Overall summary, everything is a little better and more interesting with video. Oops I should have worded that differently. The Echo Show doesn’t automatically show Ring video when the doorbell is pressed. You must say, Alexa who’s at the front door — then it takes 7 to 8 seconds. I guess brevity doesn’t always work for me.","Overall summary, everything is a little better and more interesting with video."

The microphone seems to be pretty bad. I can be standing right in front of it, and Alexa will answer me from my echo dot in a completely different room. Pretty annoying. The microphone is one of the major functionalities so I can’t rate this one much higher than 3*. Also I used the trade in to purchase, which was a racket. Turned in an older model for a specific price, and after Amazon received my old show (which was in great condition) they downgraded it to almost nothing with no explanation at all. Charged my card the difference. I wouldn’t have even traded it for what they offered me, would have been better off keeping it for another room. Not happy with Amazons customer service as of late. Downgrading to 2* for the poor buying experience.","Nice screen, pretty good sound, poor mic, poor service"

The camera does not utilize the full screen and instead shows a small rectangle where your face is, and a small square which shows you what the other person is seeing. The camera quality is low, and takes time to load even when being in a Gigabyte environment. That being said, it's underwhelming for the price tag. I'm intending on keeping it, but for a different purpose now in the kitchen area. I am looking for another device with a better camera than what the Show provides.

However I am incredibly disappointed that my galaxy buds are not compatible with video calling. Meaning I can use them to listen to music but they disconnect during video. Alexa is also incredibly laggy if you try to command during a video call. This and the simple lack of Netflix bring it down quite a bit as far as it being a fun item, it does work well as a smart home hub and I do love the visual aspect. If it weren't for my mother loving hers I would have returned it for lack of functionality imo.

It does everything that the page says.  What the page doesn't say is that the ES doesn't run a web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).  You can't run common programs like Thunderbird or Gmail email programs.  It doesn't stream from Netflix. What this really reminds me of is a smartphone in a larger box plus wireless bluetooth speakers.  If you want to control everything in your house with Zigbee devices do Skype-like video phone calls it will do that.  It has many links to content providers, many of which will charge you extra for their service. If this is what you want, the ES will probably satisfy you.  If you want more as mentioned above, you need a laptop or all-in-one computer, which, granted, is quite a bit more expensive.

Do not recommend that particular brand. No support. Just bought  a D-Link-DCS Pan and Tilt. Hoping for better results. There are some questions that Alexa can’t answer so you have to make sure you are wording your requests carefully. But you get the hang of it. I am still experimenting and figuring it out.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 May 2019,Erez Hazak,"I'm overly disappointed in general from the Echo Show 2, we bought it since we were very happy with the original Echo, and the promise for a Skype integration (which we use a lot), pushed us over the edge. I'll start with the one  thing I think it's outstanding, sound quality. The original Echo had excellent sound quality, but the Echo Show 2 surpasses that easily. Now for the bad: Skype Integration: 1. I wish I would be able to see my Skype contact on the screen, Alexa has a hard time understanding names that are not common - I need to confirm the chosen contact every time I ask her to initiate a call. 2. My video feed keeps getting stuck, and I need to stop/start the camera in order to release it. 3. Call will disconnect, and Alexa will claim there's no internet connection, while it's connected to my home network, and all the others devices connected to the home network are operating without an issue. I have to stop/start the WiFi to get things working again. 4. When you're on a Skype call, or calling someone, or someone calling you - Alexa is essentially absent, she will not respond to any commands. Spotify Integration is clunky at best. The device will only show up in the main Amazon account holder Spotify. It will lose synchronization with the device that ""cast"" the music over, and will sometimes disappear altogether from the list of available devices (old Echos in my home don't have that issue). Only a full restart will fix the problem - why the hell isn't there an on/off button on this thing ??? Video streaming - no NETFLIX integration, really???? I can leave without YouTube, but I think most people have Netflix and not HULU, this doesn't seem to much of a big deal to fix... but it's been almost a year since this was launched, so I'm not keeping my hopes up. Prime Video - works only for the main Amazon account holder - why can't other accounts connected to my account, and also authorized to use Alexa can't watch Prime Video? Also, the UI is horrible, really hard to get to where you want, and if I try to use Alexa to do this: ""Alexa, Play Bosch"" it plays the first episode of the first season, while I'm actually watching the fourth season now. Smart home - same issue with the accounts. Smart home devices only show up on my account, what's the point of having a household in Amazon, if nothing works for the other members. This is more a vent than a review, but it's a lot of small things that make a device that has great potential to something really mediocre.",Very disappointing...

The Echo Show has so many features that make them fun to use.  Everyone should have many Echo devices in their home.  They have so many skills and are extremely easy to use.  We have had many Echo products since they were introduced in 2015 and use them everyday.  Whether it be for Notifications, Important dates to remember, Communicating with friends and family members, News, Weather, Sports or just listening to your favorite music, nothing beats the Echo products.  You can also use them to control all types of smart devices throughout your home.

The sound quality of the Echo show is ok, but not great. The biggest issue with them though is that they don't last. My Show just died after using it for less than 18 months.

I replaced the Echo in my kitchen with the Show.  The Echo has an omnidirectional speaker and can be clearly heard from anywhere in the large room.  The Show is a directional speaker and feels much more muddy and quiet.  Muddy appears to be due to an over engineered sub woofer piping (trying to increase resonance in a small space) which causes a muddy less accurate sound.  The screen is fine the touch is fine.  However the vast majority of uses I am used to via voice with Dots and Echo seem silly when you have a screen.  Perhaps I just don't know how to use the show appropriately.  Also the intergration with my nest cameras and door bell are very minimal.",Interesting hardware that doesn't really have a point

I've tried getting it to play Spotify and it replies with, ""Say, 'Play Spotify.'"" When I do it just repeats the command instead of playing Spotify. Hulu has become a nightmare.

Integrating a VOIP connection like Ooma, Skype, or What'sApp is practically impossible. I have been on the forums to see how to do this and immediately saw that others have the exact same problem. Asking Alexa how to do it is a joke. Alexa doesn't know 'jack' about how she works or can be configured. Going to the Alexa app is a total waste of time, there is no information there about the best way to integrate your Skype contacts into a Skype connection. I can't even really tell which phonebook Alexa is using (I have three contact lists) or how to switch from one to the other. One even wonders why on earth there is a screen on this device. It seems useless unless you need another clock or want to watch liberal-bent fake news stories continually scrolling past. Maybe if I were to use it to watch Amazon Prime it would be OK but I have an entertainment system in my family room and don't need another small tablet screen for anything. It really is just a bigger, more expensive version of Alexa with a screen. Nice speaker, I listen to IHeartRadio on it, but that's about it.

When trying to play the same exact song over the Show, Alexa tells me I can’t play individual songs and need to upgrade to Unlimited.  Then, she starts to play a channel inspired by the song requested.  When I bought the Show it did play individual songs free that were part of Amazon Music.

The sound quality is just amazing compared to our old 1st gen echo. I’m loving the feature that allows “dropping in” on other rooms of the house by using multiple echo devices. We will be getting a dot or spot for every room to create a cool whole house intercom system(though that’s less a review of the Show as it is of Echo devices in general.)

I purchased this one because the first one I bought stopped responding after 5 hrs.  This one did the same thing.  So, then I wanted to try and resolve the issue.  The support team didn’t have any answers since I had called them the first time.  So, I looked online for help.  One person said to turn on the Do Not Disturb under settings and this didn’t work.  Another person said to check the network.  So, the echo show was on an extended network (we have a repeater to get a better signal).  I took it off the extended network and put it on the main network and it works fine.  So, I still had the first one and did the same for that one and now it works fine.  Three days in and they are both responding every time.  Awesome! Also, I had purchased a google home hub and it doesn’t work well with an iPhone.  It’s more difficult to set up and sync then Alexa.  I do like the fact that the google home hun read recipes step by step and pauses until you’re ready to continue.  But, ALEXA my favorite.","Alexa finally works, don’t put it on an extended network"

Because last time, I wrote a review for other product, Amazon didn't post it and they refused to publish it after a few days.  My honest review had never got a chance to be posted.

I use it to ask questions, activate Alexa compatible devices, play Spotify, etc. However, it also makes a great speaker phone since you can link a mobile phone number and have it make calls. Very useful since I work from home sometimes. It also has a browser (2 actually), so you can get to things like YouTube with a couple steps. It gets plenty loud if you want it to. Alexa is getting better at answering questions asked with natural language, but there are still times when I feel like I have to memorize a specific way to ask for certain functions. Bottom line, though, is that Alexa with a screen is a nice plus. I traded in a regular Echo to upgrade to this and I use it a lot more.",So many uses...

I love the  versatility of this device. I purchased 2, and sent one to one of our children who is grown and moved out. It definitely makes for better communication with them. The only 2 design flaws I have are: first, it doesn’t have an internal battery. So if I want to move it from the living room to the kitchen, to follow a recipe, I have to unplug and set the whole device up there. 2nd, it dosent come with an integrated stand that you can control the tilt or swivel with.

I linked it to my google calendar and am in the process of creating a ""family link"" family calendar.  The Show will display the calendar in line-by-line, but not a monthly view.  When I asked ""show me my calendar"", it works.  When I asked ""show me this month's calendar"", the reply is ""Currently, this calendar query is not supported"".  So take the answers to questions about being able to view your calendar with a grain of salt depending on what you're trying to do.  Also, I had hoped I could lock the home screen on a calendar view, but that's not an option either.  I REALLY hope the ability to see your calendar in a standard calendar view a month at a time is made available.  Outside of that, everything else about it is great - works like a standard Alexa device except with video.  Pretty awesome.

Whether I’m listing to a song with lyrics or have a recipe pulled up or ANYTHING on the screen, I only have about 5 minutes with it on the screen until it disappears and I have to awaken alexa and then start from the very beginning, it doesn’t load where I left off. I’ve done lots of research with this and I’m not the only one who has this problem. I have a friend who has the very first alexa show and doesn’t have this issue. She can have music playing for hours and the lyrics are always available on the screen. In my opinion, it defeats the purpose of the show. I really wish amazon would fix the feature.

It will not work. And I have to say that I had it configured both ways and it is defined by region. Not depending on where you are physically but from where you account is from.

Vibrant screen, nice sound quality and I have gone a little crazy adding switches and plugs to automate EVERYTHING. My only complaint with the Echo devices is Alexa integration. I have the Show in the kitchen and a DOT in the living room. When playing music it’s cool that I can create a group and play on both devices at the same time but that’s where the integration seeems to end. For example, we are in the kitchen and set a time. Then we go sit down in the living room. The timer goes off and we say, “Alexa, stop timer” however Alexa in the living room responds,”There are no timers set” which means we have to get up, get closer to kitchen Alexa and repeat the command. Kind of defeats the purpose of automation. I would like to have Alexa all over the house whereas no matter what command I give they can all respond.",Alexa Integration Could Be Better

I looked for how to fix this and found out its been an ongoing issue for many years and i couldn't even find a response from Amazon on how to fix the issue.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Apr 2020,Dee,"So I recently traded in my Gen-1 echo show. I was excited to try this 2nd-gen out. First when I got it, the seal was broken. I didn’t pay much attention to it bc everything inside looked new, albeit a little dusty, but nevertheless it was new. It’s a lot bigger than the Gen 1. Anyways here are my pros and cons: Pros: clear screen: the display is gorgeous, large (a little too big for my kitchen), good for following recipes, fantastic sound quality (Dolby), hella bass. I got this over the 8 for speaker quality; which it does not disappoint. Cons: idk if it’s the update but Alexa seems to lag a little. She’s not quite as responsive as she once was. It kinda slides around if you’ve got the music up loud, I was thinking of getting a stand to elevate it a bit. (Speaker is on the back of the device, so it doesn’t project like the gen 1). Again, not sure if it’s the update but sometimes the music I’m listening to just stops (even though WiFi is fine). The camera doesn’t have a switch, if you wanna turn the camera off, it disables Alexa. So I’ve had to put a little dot over the camera. I’m a little torn here, I had tried to see if I can get this one replaced bc I think either the updated software is messed up or I have a faulty device but due to the Shelter in Place order, customer service is delayed (for obvious reasons). Or I may want to return this one for an 8, as it’s a newer model. My only hesitation is speaker quality. Hoping Amazon will get in touch soon.",Great sound quality but the rest is underwhelming

For instance, the home screen doesn't show the month/date/day - only the current time and temperature. There is no built in calendar display to look at although I can verbally schedule appointments to a linked calendar. If I want to peruse the calendar, on the Show I'm out of luck. Upcoming events for the next day do show up but it would be nice to be able to configure it to show me (n) days in advance. Contacts are also a problem. Although I have my contacts linked and they do show up in my Android Alexa app on my phone, only 5 of those contacts show up in the Echo Show. After doing some research, it appears that the reason those 5 show up is because Amazon detects that they also have some sort of Echo device registered. Not very useful to me because I want to be able to see ALL of my contacts.",A lot of potential but not there yet...

The sound quality is excellent and voice recognition, processing power and image rendering were acceptable for the price. Over the last 3-4 months, performances started decreasing, it doesn't respond to external inputs (e.g.: asking Spotify to play something on that device, falls into a bottomless void), the voice recognition seems somewhat worse and sometimes it answers to me in Spanish (which helps me practice my Spanish but seems like a big code glitch). The lack of integration with Netflix and Youtube apps is also a big gap. To be honest I was hoping for more.",10 months later review
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,CO_Mike,"I upgraded from a Gen 1 Echo; primarily for the better sound and screen. While the touch screen is great and the sound is better (not significantly though), my main complaint is that unlike the Echo which has a clearly visible queue, this unit only has a front facing indicator. So if you're anywhere in the room other than in front of the unit and you call Alexa - you have no idea if it heard you or not (more often not). And since Alexa doesn't respond until after you ask your question; I find myself having to ask multiple times. Another issue but one that I can't definitively claim is related to the new unit; is the Alexa responses seem much worse and off topic. It's as if it is prioritizing responses that support a visual response rather than the most accurate response.  This has led to a lot of frustration and repeated, rephrased questions in an attempt to get the unit to respond with a useful answer. I do not recall having this level of difficulty with my old Echo.",Poor Visual Queues and inaccurate Responses

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2019,Rick,"No sound out of the box.  Will see how Amazon handles it and update my review accordingly. EDIT:  So, after living with this thing for a while, my rating remains a solid ‘1’.  Here are some things to think about before buying: - Customer support.  On the plus side, Amazon reached out to me regarding the faulty sound on this device.  Unfortunately, though, their “fix” isn’t a fix at all, unplugging the chord from the back of the device is a subpar workaround at best.  Worse, there’s apparently no plan for a real fix for these defective devices. - The faulty sound issues persist, bringing three thoughts to mind for me — Does Amazon really think unplugging and replugging the product is a satisfactory fix for this $200 device? — How many times does Amazon think we’ll be able to pull the plug and reinsert before the plug breaks? (the answer is not many) — How much use will a device that has to be rebooted every time you want to hear something get? (the answer is not much) - The device is inordinately slow.  Even standing directly in front of it and speaking directly to it, my other devices in other rooms answer before the Show can - Lack of content.  I agree with some of the others who have said this is basically an expensive echo dot. Yes, it’s nice to watch Amazon Prime Video or Hulu, but where is YouTube, Netflix, etc.  Same with the communication capabilities.  They are much too limited - Too few home screen options.  The home screen can’t be customized to do anything useful and can’t be set not to turn off automatically ... or to not turn on every time you pass by - Limited compatibility with other hardware.  If you have already purchased video cameras/doorbells, etc that Amazon doesn’t advertise, you’re likely to be headed back to the store to purchase new equipment All-in-all, I’d say this is a device whose time has not yet come, in terms of hardware quality, utility, and usability.  It’s a shame ... big promise, little result.  Amazon should recall these defective units today!",Things to Consider Before Buying!!!

Used it during Christmas to play Christmas tunes.  Since I have the basic Amazon prime music, it was annoying that some no-names or “other” recordings of my favorite tunes played when requested if Alexa.  Solution was to just Blu tooth my phone playlist through the Echo-show. I preferred that better.  Initial reason for getting it was to help my 9 year old with spelling.  For now he mainly uses to get the weather and sport scores.  Easy integration to my Nest Cams, Kevo locks, and smart wall plugs and light switches. For security reasons, Alexa will not unlock doors.

I'm surprised by how easy it is with Alexa and the Echo Show.

It's size and clarity of screen, audio and ease of setup. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has limited compatibility with my Nest Doorbell and Arlo security systems.

There's also no Netflix app. The reason I got the Show, though, was to use as a baby monitor.  I tried out a Wyze internet camera, and I liked it so much through my cell phone that I thought the Show would be even better.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jul 2019,Eric,"Update: The first one I got must have been a lemon. Once I unplugged it, packed it up for shipping and removed it from my account everything worked perfectly. I can unplug the one I have now and plug it back in without any of the issues mentioned below. I am very happy with this addition to my collection. The show2 is a great addition to my collection of amazon devices. I have 2 dots, an echo, and now the show2. I really like the screen resolution and the sound is great. My only complaint is when I set up a music group. The initial setup of the group works great. The buggy part comes in when you unplug the show2 to move it. Once you plug it back in and tell alexa to play music ""everywhere""(my group name) the music plays on all the devices but the show2. At this point the show will display the lyrics but no sound comes out of it. If you tell alexa to turn off the music it will. But if you ask alexa on the show2 any question after this occurs you can see her response on the screen but still no sound at all. After trying to figure out what the issue was by messing with the volume and a whole host of other things I figured I just got a defective one. I called support and they had me try several things like rebooting but nothing seemed to fix the no sound issue. They sent me out a replacement. While I was waiting I kept trying to get it to work. I finally gave up in frustration and just unplugged it. Fortunately I am not one to just let things go so I plugged it back in after a couple of hours and low and behold it worked with the ""everywhere"" group again. As long as did not unplug it everything worked great. Once the replacement showed up I did a test with it. I set it up in the ""everywhere"" group and started playing music. I then unplugged it. At that point I went to one of my other devices and told alexa to turn the music off but it would not turn it off. I went and plugged the replacement show2 back in and all of a sudden the music turned off. Crazy right? So what I have determined is that if a show2 is unplugged and then plugged back in there will be no sound and may have other issues related to the music group. The solution at that point for me is just unplug it for a while and then plug it back in and the sound magically starts working again. Amazon need to figure out this bug with the show2 and the music group feature. I can unplug any of my dots or echo and plug them back in and they work just fine once they are booted up and online. So if if you are thinking about getting one just be aware of this issue and hopefully Amazon will read this review and fix the bug. Update: The first one I got must have been a lemon. Once I unplugged it, packed it up for shipping and removed it from my account everything worked perfectly. I can unplug the one I have now and plug it back in without issue.",Show 2 - Updated review

I like that I can add whatever to the list and when I am in the store I can bring it up on my phone. Another feature I use is the reminders, they can be helpful to keep you on task for deadlines and such. It's awesome that Alexa will tell me when birthdays are coming up also!

Over time I have built an ecosystem of these devices and I have enjoyed watching the growth of these smart speakers. I use these to control most of the lighting in my home, my thermostat and my TVs. I also use them daily to listen to music. Unfortunately this is where they fail miserably. The sound quality is acceptable, and quite good if you add the subwoofer. The problem is they continually stop playing music and need to be rebooted to resolve this problem. These need to be rebooted multiple times a day to function properly.

We purchased a large Alexa and then followed suit with numerous echo dots and then a spot. Due to the spots limited use and small screen we did not move to a 1st gen show. but when Amanzon came out with the 2nd gen Show with a larger screen, discount at holiday season, we took the plunge. We ahve also move more in the Ring devises, cams etc. The new Show has a nice large screen, better sound and works well. It now sees our security cams and runs our lights etc. - Con - not much in video content and must use the screen to navigate some apps which makes it difficult to reach across the counter.","Nice Clear Screen, Improved Sound"

The sound is horrible.  Even when using the EQ and lowering the bass as FAR AS IT WILL GO, it still sounds muffled.  I've boosted the mids and treble a bit and made sure not to put the unit anywhere near a wall but Alexa still sounds boomy and music isn't great. How did they get this so wrong? Another issues is that the mic doesn't pick up as well as an Echo Dot.  I can be 3 feet away from this unit and ask Alexa for something (e.g. play music) and my echo dot in the other room hears me first and plays music there!

Monteiro,"As an Amazon customer since 2000, I never been disappointed until now. While the sound quality on this device is great, that’s where the quality stopped. In my home, I have an ecosystem powered by Alexa. It includes devices in the master bedroom (Echo spot), my kids’ room (Echo dots), my office (echo dot), and the kitchen hallway (Ecobee thermostat). I also have Echo Buds, Fire TVs and Fitbit Versa 3 with Alexa integrated but I honestly use those. I did not expect the performance on the Ecobee to match that of the other devices so when my wife wanted a device that could be used to watch some of her shows in the kitchen, I thought the Echo Show would be a great solution. The first disappointment was the assumption  that we would be able to steam Netflix. After receiving the device, I realized it did not have a Netflix app. I tried to connect to my account via the browser, but that was not possible either. The second one was using Hulu. In this case, the device includes a Hulu app, but you are not able to link the different user profiles with the device. In this case, my wife was not able to get to her shows where she felt off. The interface is limited but using Alexa alone is not yet good enough. I’m still a fan of Amazon line of products and wanted to wait for the next generation of this product yet to be released to see if all of these issues are resolved.",My First Disappointment with an Alexa Device

This weekend she got puked on, and dropped face down from four feet. After cleaning and scrubbing the speakers (i'm not sure this is recommended), she works and sounds just as good as day one... amazing. If you're wanting an interactive speaker you can't beat this.

I will say that I use this primarily in my kitchen to watch shows or listen to music while I cook/prepare food. However, I've also used it to do drop in calls with my family and play customized (blueprint) trivia with the Alexa buttons.  My initial thoughts summed up below: PROS - Larger screen size - The screen size is much bigger - Did I mention that the screen is larger? CONS - It seems like any hardware enhancements made to account for the larger screen size, weren't enough to make the Show a faster, more viable hub - Slow to respond to some commands (I.e. stopping while watching a video and returning to the home screen) - Touchscreen isn't a stellar experience, often times having to use it to adjust brightness settings that have seemingly changed on their own (away from the auto adjust) - Buttons pair and work inconsistently (to be fair, not sure if that is a Show issue but that has been my experience) OVERALL The Show 2nd gen does what I am hoping it will do, but I can't help but wish for a few more improvements.","Honey, I blew up the Alexa"

I have the cloud cam in my nursery and use it as a baby monitor which works GREAT. I can view the camera on my phone, tablet, Fire tv (of which all our TVs primarily use) and now I can ask my new echo show to display the nursery as well which works great as a night stand monitor! Only problem is I also use Alexa to control various lights and switches throughout my house and when I ask my show to perform a smart home command like “turn off bedroom lights” when it’s time to go to sleep, it leaves my nursery cam then displays a control screen for whichever device or group the command was for. Which would be fine for a short while so long as it returned back to the nursery camera... it doesn’t... it displays the smart home control for a bit then goes to the home screen... forcing me to have to ask it to display the nursery again. This is very frustrating. As soon as this problem is fixed I will edit review to 5star.",Almost great

However, I'm having an issue with the Echo Show Gen II. On three separate occasions, Alexa's voice stopped working.  The Show seemed to be hearing my questions and responding on the screen.  However, there was no verbal response from Alexa.  After doing some online research, this seems to be a common issue. Mostly with units purchased on or around Prime Day. I did find where Amazon tech support has offered a tempory workaround by recommending that you unplug the power cord from the back of the device and reconnect it after a few seconds.  The process did restore Alexa's response voice for a few days until it stopped responding again.  I hope there will be an eventual software update to correct this issue, or perhaps a replacement unit offered if this issue is a result of a bad batch.

Plus the added feature of the screen for recipes and shopping lists.  Then after two weeks, the screen times out to a blank screen with the clock on it.  Many are having this issue, and the only way to return to the screen is to ""Alexa"".  Stays on for a few moments then goes back to timeout screen.  Checked settings, but nothing to reset or change, and no change if changes are made.  Best part is that I tried the Chat, but the server is not ""working"", so I called, got a call back but no one there (3 times), placed a request on the help forum under Echo Show and nothing as well...  I think this will be going back.  If updates are made or fix in place, then we will keep it and update the review.  For now, its a clock, unless we ask it something.

Really easy to set up and use and the voice recognition is nice for smart home integration and control. It is a little extra with Vivint systems since it will say “ok completed Vivint.smarthome, ok turning off these lights” it’s a little annoying but it still does the job. There are a lot of additional skills that help integrate other services as well which is nice. If you’re familiar with drop in, you say forget the other things like the FB camera thing. Alexa allows someone with the app on their phone to drop in and video chat with contacts and displays the video for both which is cool especially for family.

You have to subscribe to Amazon music. The echo show often talks when no one is in the Kitchen. Haven't figured out why. The only Alexa we know is in the kitchen so we do not have the need to say that name unless talking directly to it. You cannot put your own picture slide show on it.,Overall a good product

He had read the reviews and thought itcwpuld be a great asset in our kitchen.  I believe that the ‘integration’ with things like our dish network and things was strongly misrepresented.  Yes it integrates with these other programs, but you can’t actually use the dish app on the Amazon Show, you can only control whats showing on your tv with the Show.  We thought we’d be able to stream these other services on our Show.  Not the case.  And what little user i terface there is is quite cumbersome to use.  The lack of a homescreen where you can touch icons to do what you would like is frustrating (instead of using voice commands that Alexa doesnt always understand) This device sounds great.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Sep 2019,Alexander T.,"We waited till gen 2 before picking up the show and while I do believe it is a marked improvement from gen one there still seems to be some technical hardware/software issues. Amazon seems to be aware of this as well as when we called in they had a whole system to walk through and said it was a common issue (recall?)- one of the issues is that sound will just stop working which then requires you to reset the device multiple times (which means plugging it in and unplugging it over and over) this error/glitch also effects the screen or sometime the start up of the show. - and the whole device is out of warranty coverage in like 30 days or something from purchase. This first happened to us about 15 days after we got it - in hindsight should have probably exchanged it then - but we hoped it was a one time thing - however this is turning into a weekly routine at this point. Besides that the device is great - screen is beautiful sound quality top notch, for what it is, and our kids (4-2) love it. They can ask for pictures of fish and then scroll through images on the touch screen or to play their favorite song or ask for their kids show on Hulu or the time or weather etc. It really enables them to be able to interact and explore without the ability to type and spell - which for them is very empowering.",Beautiful device when it works...

The screen should be able to show the date and day as it does the time and weather. I don't want to add my calendar and email.

I didn't realize we could get music/video of this quality from such a small device. However, with that said the software has me concerned. I'm staring at my Echo Show right now and it has powered off on it's own. I've had to reboot this unit several times since receiving because it either locked up or for some reason powered off by itself. If this wasn't so expensive, I would probably be more forgiving, but at $200 I expect more. Screen quality is good, video playback is good as well. Touchscreen responsiveness is also good. My biggest gripe is when the unit has stalled.

I purchased the second generation version, mostly because the screen is larger (the main reason ANYONE purchases the upgrade).  One would naturally assume that the text for the ""Try"" suggestions at the bottom would be a little larger also.  We have this Show not more than 7 feet from our couches in our family room, on our entertainment console, under our flatscreen.  It's ridiculous too think that we cannot read the ""Try"" suggestions because they are so small.  BTW, my (and my wife's) vision is 20-20.

Unfortunately, the calls were constantly dropped (up to 10 times in a row), and the camera quality is poor.  I upgraded my mom to FIOS, and we have high speed internet, so I know the dropped calls were not due to wifi quality.  Also, the camera points upward, so if the device is on a table or counter, and someone is sitting on the opposite side of the room, all you can see is the top of their head and the ceiling, instead of seeing a panorama of the room.

This one is very closed to perfect, but I'm ignoring youtube in this review since that have nothing to do with the actual product itself. It would be great if the home screen can rotate some photo/image of the day like the Google Home Hub can, it actually nicer to look at and not repetitive since it cycle differently every day. The Echo show just have some simple repeated artworks and cycle trending news, it gets old very quick. Unless you create your own album to let it cycle. Controlling lights is a bit unorganized when you have a large amount of smart lights in the house. The Google Home Hub have much better organization when it comes to linked smart home products. Though the 10.1"" screen amazing, really great for kitchen use. Sound is MUCH better than other smart display, bass and sound are just really good for what it is.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Aug 2019,Don B.,"Display on the 10"" Echo Show (2nd Gen) is great, sound is great, real world capabilities = not so great. Even an experienced user may get frustrated having to reword their questions a few different ways or you will get the ""sorry I don't know that one"" for a response from Alexa. I asked my google device the same questions and it finds the answer right away (without having to unnaturally rephrase my question a few times). If anyone tries the Echo Show's or anything else Alexa (yes it does have good capabilities)... you should ask common questions about what store is in your town but not the big stores like Home Depot, Walmart, etc. Try to ask in a natural way but you may have to rephrase it a few times for the answer. Try to ask about a local business in your city/town and decide for yourself if Alexa will meet your needs and expectations. You may find yourself almost knowing all the information from the way you have to rephrase the question. You will understand when you start using it for real word information. Hopefully, Amazon/Alexa folks are working hard but there is still a long way to go. Try... ""Where is ______"" and it might know the answer how far away it is inaccurately... BUT it doesn't know the business hours (Google does). Try... ask directions to a known restaurant in your town that you know has a chain in another city... you might get ""sorry, I couldn't find what you're looking for"" or the chain that is far away (Google knew the local one I wanted and also sent directions to my phone). Some pluses... If you ask about restaurants in your town, it will show and tell you the names of a few on the screen (but I question how many it really knows). If it knows a business, you will see the information on the screen such as address, logo, store hours and it will verbally tell you where it is and the store hours. If you want to like Alexa, do not use Google Home or Google Assistant. Once you do, you will start revealing the real world differences. I'd rate it 3.5 stars overall due to things being unnatural and not as fluent as the ""other"" device out there. Display is great.... I think if you let Amazon/Alexa KEEP your voice recordings/questions, the ""voice recognition"" would be 4 stars in a quiet environment but when you add in an A/C or a fan in the room it might not recognize as well unless you look at it and speak clearly and slightly louder. I hope this helps...but again, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is great BUT has ""Alexa"" limitations you should be aware of.","Echo Show (2nd gen) is being held back by ""Alexa"" capabilities.."

The device leaves me wondering why it is designed the way it is. Most in-depth browsing is not as easy as just using the Amazon app on my tablet or phone. For instance, you need to browse movies by voice, which is much slower and more cumbersome than seeing a list of possible episodes, along with a written description of what the movie is about. Also, Alexa is not good at hearing what I want to play, and often the touch screen just does not respond as expected. A common experience for me is to hover over the device, waiting for a response to voice command or touch command.

Generally way too much bass, but muffled voices.  My DOT has better audio voice.  And I have work with the Echo settings a lot trying to improve.

So then I go to my cookbook and get the EXACT NAME OF A RECIPE BY INA GARTEN - maybe I have done something wrong.  I give this to Alexa which SHE CAN’T FIND??  She can answer about 1 in every 50 questions I ask her. However she seems to be excellent at suggesting products and services I could buy from AMAZON.  (imagine that!!)

In the kitchen, the 10"" model is awesome for watching cooking videos, setting timers, listening to music and the news, and watching Hulu. I cannot recommend the 10"" Echo enough. We love the 2nd edition with its widescreen. We upgraded from a 1st edition which had a screen roughly the size of a 5"" Echo (the bottom was all speaker). The updated model is far superior.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2020,Steve Duran,"The one thing I disliked was that there's not a way to physically block the camera.  I saw a model of the Echo Show 5 in a store, and it had a plastic lever that you could use to physically obstruct the camera.  This device has three buttons on the top - the one on the left mutes the microphone and ""turns off"" the camera.  I guess we're supposed to have faith that there's no way a hacker could interfere with that and access the camera anyway.  Fortunately I had a little dot-shaped sticker that covered it up perfectly.  The sticker doesn't seem to interfere with the device in any way - it continues to work perfectly. When I first set up the device and noticed the issue with the camera, I asked the device to show me how to control the camera.  It instead showed information from the web on how a camera works in general.  The device is constantly giving hints on things you can ask it to do.  Eventually it said I could ask it to take a selfie, and that's when I figured out how to test the camera.  The selfie didn't work - which was great.  I can always peel off the sticker if I decide to use the camera. I got the Amazon music subscription.  Now I can ask it to play albums.  Even if the album has the same name as a song on the album, it's smart enough to know to play the album and not the song.  It supports routines, so you can schedule things to run at a certain time.  It has a way that lets you customize it's answers to specific questions.  It seems to have the ability to access radio stations like CNN using TuneIn, but it can also access SiriusXM and iHeart Radio.  However, I think Google has an edge here - when you play a song on Alexa, that's it.  When you play it on Google, Google will play another song like it, and another, and another, allowing you to discover new music.  Alexa doesn't do that, at least not yet. Here's something I didn't expect - it supports Google Calendar better than Google does.  I have appointments coming in from my Outlook Calendar at work to my Google calendar on my phone.  Google Assistant can't see them, but Alexa can.  Isn't that weird? Now that we're on lockdown because of COVID, I can run my smart speaker without disturbing my co-workers, so this thing has been my constant companion throughout the day.  I love it.  News, music, podcasts, books, web searches, timers, even math calculations.  Surprisingly it supports timers, but not a stopwatch, so it can't time how long something takes. But wait, there's more!  Unsurprisingly, you can buy audio books on Audible and play them on the smart speaker and your smartphone, but not every book is released with an audio version.  What if it's just an e-Book?  In that case, Alexa can read it to you!  This means that you can purchase an e-Book, and have Alexa read it to you while you're walking your dog.  Right now eBook support is restricted.  I think it only works with Kindle and Audible. This is still a developing technology.  There are apps called ""skills"" available, but they sometimes have surprising limitations.  For example, there's a ""work tomato"" app to assist with time management.  Once you start it, you can't stop it and you have to let it run to it's conclusion, playing that annoying ticking sound the whole time.  Generally, there are rarely screen controls for apps, and least from what I saw.  From reading the feedback, the impression I got was that the limitations were from the Alexa platform, and not from the skill developer, which makes sense.  I'm thinking that over time the platform will get better, and the hardware I have now should be able to take advantage of that for some time. It's a totally awesome product.  I love it.  Get it, and put a sticker on the camera.","Great touchscreen display, sound quality, and Alexa integration"

With a fairly large 10 inch screen and improved sound over the majority of echo devices this had tons of potential.  Unfortunately Amazon missed the boat. Cons: No ability to reset device other than unplugging the device (seriously?!!!) No list of downloaded skills available on screen (must use secondary device such as cell phone) No options for display clock (even the spot and Show 5 have this) Limited media capabilities (can't access Netflix, Disney+, MLB.tv, etc.) Intrusive ads As their flagship Show device you would think this thing would be more intuitive.  It is actually less so compared to their mid-line products.  The Echo Spot has multiple options to display a clock where this does not.  The Show 5 comes with a lens cover.  The frustrating part is a lot of the shortcomings can all be improved with software updates.  I supposed someone in corporate thinks we'll rush out and buy the Echo Wall Clock since they refuse to implement a clock on this.  Lol, whatever. Pros: Better sound Displays security cameras via voice command Z-wave hub This device does have some good points.  Sound is improved.  I pretty much only use it to display our cameras.  For my needs, this device does not do enough to justify it over anything else on the Echo or Show line of products.  The screen is treated more as a novelty.  Don't get me started on the lack of skills that actually work.  So many (such as NBC) do nothing.  This skills store needs better regulation. So why and I so frustrated?  Because Amazon does make some decent hardware (FireTV line) and I was hoping this Show line would be good as well.  If Amazon (hello Elias Saba) decides to merge the Show with the FireTV we will get a media device of the decade.  A portable FireTV with Alexa capability.  A device that actually makes good use of the screen.  A device that is actually sufficient for media consumption.  That's the endgame folks.  For now, just use your phone or tablet.

It replaced the dot and has much better sound quality.  It falls short on video calling.  When trying to call someone from the show to an iphone it keeps picking up on the other persons echo.  It only works when the person is out of the house away from their echo dot.  It also seems like it only works if I first call the other person and tell them to open the Alexa app on their phone before I place the video call.  Useless.  Went back to FaceTime.  It also doesn’t give enough time for me to answer a call on the show. If you don’t answer in about 2 seconds it hangs up.  Now for the security camera.  I have Arlo cameras.  I can arm and disarm using voice commands.  That’s a nice feature.  You can say Alexa show me the driveway and then it takes several seconds for the video to show up but the picture is good.  The problem is that there is a huge delay.  The video is delayed sbout 10 seconds from the live view on my phone.  This is a problem because if I am watching the camera because I am expecting someone, I can see them park the car but the delay is so long that they are ringing the doorbell before the camera even shows them getting out of their car.

Honestly haven't had it long enough to get the full effect. HOWEVER, if you are thinking of using it for anything that requires the screen to be on for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. DON'T. There is no way to turn off the screen sleep/timeout function. So if you are using to follow a recipe, better get it done before the screen goes to sleep. Watching a video? Better hope it's less than 5 minutes long. Amazon Music displays song lyrics...until the screen falls asleep after 5 minutes. Etc, etc, etc. It seems like, no matter what you are doing, if the screen is active, it will fall asleep after a very short period.

And then I realized I had just spent 2 hours of my life messing with a glorified speaker with a screen and I had only had this device for less then 2 weeks... So I'm done. I hope they actually start fixing this thing. It could be useful, but they've lost me. Not sure I'll continue investing given the advances from google and the overall device usability from apple (side note, a 32 gb ipad is on sale for 250...kinda makes the regular price of this kinda sad). And as a final kick, did the trade in an old echo thing, hadn't sent it yet. So, to cancel, I'll be charged 5 more dollars until they get this junk back...just kinda bugs me. I realize it will work out in the end (if my return is processed), but it bugs me to be charged any more money for this waste of my time.","Slower than a 1st gen echo (original echo).

My $30 Amazon Dot works better.  Why, I have no idea.  The interface is counterintuitive and clunky.  Sound quality is decent but in a “Bose” bass heavy kind of way.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2019,John,"This is a mixed bag; I want to like the Echo Show so badly, but I'm having some major issues. To start with the bad points, if the music volume is over 50%, I can put my mouth 3 inches from the microphones and scream the wake word as loud as possible and it doesn't seem to hear a word I say. How can it be so much worse than my regular Echos, which can hear me say the wake word from across the room with my music playing almost as loud as it can go? I've tried different locations to see if that would help, but it hasn't. After using it for about a week the sound completely went out.  It showed that music was playing, or indicated it was speaking, but no sound would come out. I had decided I had received a bad unit and was ready to ship it back when I found other people on the internet who were having the same problem. Turned out that if you pull the plug out from the back of the unit (but not the wall) it resets itself and you get volume back. The problem hasn't shown itself again. Then about a week later the Echo Show started responding very slowly, or not at all. The display would not power up when detecting someone nearby like it had when I first got it. Unplugging it and plugging back in has seemed to lessen the problem. The Echo Show is definitely sluggish in responding to many actions. There's a noticeable delay after pushing a button or making a request that the action happens. Seems like a faster processor would solve a lot of that. I big gripe on not only this Echo Show, but also my regular Echos is the inability to set Alexa's speaking volume separately from media volume. If I have had music playing loudly the next request I make Alexa responds so loudly it can wake the entire household. On the plus side, the sound quality is very good. Out of the box, the bass sounds somewhat boomy and muddled, but with the sound controls most of that can be eliminated. I'm still adjusting it, and it seems my adjustments for one type of music don't sound so good with other types. Custom presets for the type of music might be helpful. The screen looks great! I was concerned initially because the specs weren't that great compared to some of the other devices I regularly use, but in practice it's bright and clear. The unit itself is nicely designed and looks like a quality piece of equipment sitting on my countertop. To sum up, overall the Echo Show does what you would expect it to do. It looks and sounds nice, but the big issue with it not hearing the wake word when loud media is playing is close to a deal-breaker. I have music playing almost constantly on it, and it not being able to detect me speaking is huge.  There's enough I like about it that I'm keeping it in hopes Amazon releases an update that will improve its hearing.",Echo Show Doesn't Hear Wake Word If Music Volume Is Over 50%

The picture and sound quality are incredible.  You could actually use the second generation show as a beside television.  I do.  I will be buying additional Echo Show's as upgrades for the other rooms in my house.  It is a wonderful product and if you sit down and learn all it can do, It can actually make your life easier.  I use Echo for all my lights, alarms, cameras, intercom, music, shows, news, cooking, etc.  It takes times and the purchase of other products to do some functions, but well worth it.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 May 2019,Renuka Anand,"Alexa is like a helpful assistant which is pre-programmed to do a lot of small inane things like weather, news, give insights, play music, photos, etc. But the biggest disappointment is the lack of seamless integration to videos, existing social media accounts (amazon has none) and most importantly US centricity - all the claims works if you are paid customers of some of Amazon's favourite partners. If you are not too bad for you - you can help Alexa fine tune its AI capability by banging your head trying to get stuff which frankly somebody sitting in a backoffice is trying to help Alexa understand and program for future consumers. Be ready for many ""I don't understand"" and then keep worrying whether it is picking up private stuff as a trade off for your effort to help amazon become better.",A cute device which is still work in progress

She is not able to pick up or hang up any phone.  Neither is she able to touch an Echo screen to accept a call.  However the Drop In feature allows me to pop in and we can see eachother's faces and talk.  She is lock down in covid 19 quarantine in asst living and so this has been a blessing for 2 weeks. However there is a bug that hasnt resolved.  I drop in from my Alexia app on my tablet from my home, and it says that her Video is off.  When we check her device settings, it is turned on.  The only thing that helps is to unplug it, wait and then replug.  However I need the caretakers to go up to her room to do this for me.  When I was calling her on the phone, I was dependant upon the caretakers and that is why I bought the Echo. I found that this glitch has been reported since Feb 2018, and here it is 7/20/20 and still there.

I am able to activate them throughout the day from my App, so she has a variety.  She listens well, but doest watch tv.  As a remote controlled radio, it is an awesome device for someone with dementia.  It also has very excellent speakers.  However it is pretty expensive device for just the radio.

While not electronics savvy, she has quickly learned how to use the simple commands, ""Alexa, show me..."" She would not be able to operate a computer or mobile device for other types of security systems, so Echo Show turned out to be a fantastic option without breaking the bank. The video image is decent for our purposes, and of course relies on the signal strength of your wifi (Spectrum in this case). Have not tried with Prime video, nor any other feature available.

Amazon video works well.  No Netflix either.  Music sounds nice.  If you are on the taller side a tilting stand is pretty much a must have to be able to view the screen and touch it easily.

I purchase an original Echo back in the day and enjoyed it. When the first Shows came out, I purchased one but returned it. I found the “screen management” features off-putting and went back to the Echo. Cue to present time, the Echo finally gave out, one day it just wouldn’t wake up. So, the subject of this reviewed was ordered. It does everything it’s supposed to but, I still returned it. I found the sound to be unsatisfactory, probably due to the speakers residing on the back of the device. The sound of the original Echo was better, IMO. Unfortunately, the display is still a dealbreaker for me. I can’t turn off the endless succession of try this, watch that. Perhaps it’s not a software design flaw but another way for Amazon to raise revenue. So, I ordered a Studio. My review of that resides in the Studio review area.",Not for me.

Right after I posted my disappointing 1 star review, I received both an email and phone call on how to resolve this issue. Sound is working now after an unplug/re plug from the echo itself and not the outlet. I’m upping my review to 3 stars pending further use of this device and also because I’m still disappointed I had to experience this nonsense for a brand new system out of the box. Original review : Right out of the box on first plug in, I would expect a system like Echo Show (2nd gen) to work and this one although somewhat functional, the sound did not work at all. The mic worked fine and Alexa would respond to my commands visually on the screen but zero sound. After reading a few support forums, this one included, I was able to reset and unplug/replug twice before the sound finally worked. After a month of use and having to unplug to the device to move it, the sound stopped working again. No amount of resets and replugging would get this thing to work. A piece of junk if there ever was one. One shouldn't have to reset and fiddle around with a brand new device to have it work the way it should, being brand new and a product from Amazon.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2019,Hendrik Hartsuiker Jr.,"Basically the unit is fine, but there is a glitch with the software. The sound, after a couple of days, just disappeared. I unplugged it from the wall jack and restarted it. No change. then I went through the process of resetting it to factory defaults and still no change. So I went online and found a blog of a slew of people with the same issue. Apparently the fix from Amazon is to unplug from the back of the show, not the wall, and it fixes the problem. So far I have had to do that twice. Obviously it is something that Amazon knows about and there is no permanent fix for the moment. REALLY?!  Other than that it is fine.  BTW, this is the first bad review of any Echo device I have.","All sound, sometimes just stops...and there is no fix yet!"

I have bought this item assuming that everything works as usual without extra premium subscriptions as I am a prime member. This turned out to be a waste as we need either Spotify or premium amazon music subscription. On top of this music streaming issue I found that in order to make this work we need to install amazon Alexa app and also install amazon photos.

The sound is truly impressive and the response times are nice and crisp. However, the lack of an internal battery, and standalone YouTube app severely dampens my love of this item.  Furthermore, more thought should have gone into an optional stand for this. (i.e. one that tilts, swivels and can move up and down.)  It seems the kitchen counter is where it's designers focused but it works in so many other places that a little more design thought would add multiple user experiences.",Fantastic Second Attempt:  Still needs work

When I saw a 2nd gen had come out with a largers screen I was in.  ***Buyer Beware*** voice recognition sucks.  It’s slow to respond.  It often has issues and I have to turn it off and back on at least twice a week.  For the money spent I could have gotten two echo spots instead.  WAY overpriced for what you get.

We have it in our kitchen. While a lot of the features I use most are available on the Echos without screens by using the app, it’s so convenient to just have the ability to have it pull up your shopping list right there. I love being able to see all my individual timers while cooking. Seeing what’s next on my to-do list as I’m finishing something up or adding things as I go, makes my multi-tasking much more efficient. The sound quality is great, we use it when entertaining in the kitchen often. I’m a music video fiend so I enjoy being able to watch those on a whim and sing along to the lyrics as they pop up when just listening to music. It’s great for quick cooking instructional videos from time to time too.

I know what stations I am selecting and why I am selecting them.  I don't have to be further sold on the nature or value of a particular station that I've listened to for years, if not decades. Also, if I want whisper mode, it is not because I want to hear Echo whispering, which is an annoying affectation, and which only works on some things and not others (like the redundant announcements discussed above, which  blast full volume even in ""whisper mode."" Finally, there should be a setting that allows me to speak to Alexa without the screen turning on, which then has to be turned off, each time.  It is the visual complement to the aural annoyances outlined above.  At night, in particular, I don't want to have to have the screen activate every time I tell Echo I want to hear something of interest.  I know what I asked for, and I don't need to be lectured about how worthy my choice is or be invited to see an intrusive splash screen.  If I want to see something, I'll ask to see it. If I only want to hear something, trust me to know that I know what I want to hear and to know to what it is I am listening.

My problem is I purchased it to view and monitor my ring camera set up. But basically all it does is show and warm the motion.

We have the unit set up on our kitchen counter.  With the angle of the camera, we either have to stand in front of it for them to see us or somehow prop up the back of the unit to angle the camera down.

I looked up how to get the sound to work & everything I tried didn't get it going. I thought ""great, I have to send this back already, I got a dud."" I read somewhere that the speakers could come loose during travel & you can plug them back in. Then I realized the device I had is a different generation than the one I was reading about... So I put it back together & figured I'd just send it back. But then I turned it back on & it was working again. After about an hour of messing with it, the sound came back. However, that was a big turn off & hassle, especially since it was brand new. But anyway, I got it working. Other than that mishap in the beginning, I've had a fun time with it. It's pretty simple to get tasks & commands set up on your phone. I like having Alexa wake me up in the morning & saying goodnight to her & the screen turning off.

I have multiple Echos and Echo Shows of all types throughout the house.  My wife is mostly blind, and as a tool for someone visually or otherwise impaired, it's simply a miracle.  I'm quite surprised that Amazon hasn't used that in their marking.  My wife calls and receives calls from all her friends and family from any room in the house.  Even in the back yard.  She plays music and controls all the lights as well with the Kasa devices.  The only reason I didn't give the new Show 5 stars is I feel the processor is a bit slow.

With the 2nd generation Echo Show you would expect the touch screen to have more functionality.  Like if you touch the temperature, it would bring up the daily weather without having to ask Alex “what is today’s weather”.  More “touch” interaction without the need for voice commands would be preferred.  Such as, if i touch the screen while it is playing, I should get quick options like; Pause, Stop, Volume +/-, channel up/down whatever is relevant to the app/skill at the time.

Music consistently plays now, etc. After owning my Echo Show for 3 months now, I have to say that I'm disappointed from a reliability standpoint. I'm surprised to see how consistently high rated this unit is and can only assume my issue is more on the level of quality control. Almost daily, she will not respond to commands at all, and I have to cycle power to resolve this, which at least a power cycle consistently takes care of this.  What's equally frustrating is when I play music, roughly 1 out of 5 times she'll act like she's playing a song (i.e. I can see lyrics moving on the screen) but no sound at all. Again, this is resolved consistently with a power cycle. How is it possible that I am the only one dealing with this problem?",Very glitchy unit

The Show is extremely laggy even though it's pretty close to my router (maybe a software update will help?) Most of the available apps are overly simplified, I'm guessing because the Show can't handle anything more intricate. No app for YouTube. Show gets onto it's own web browser, Amazon Silk, to open YouTube. No option that I'm aware of to change the web browser. Eventually, when videos get up and running, the quality seems pretty good. Also, the audio/music options are good. The design is ok. The mobility is little to none. It's heavy and has to be plugged in, which was expected before buying. All in all, my expectations were high and maybe I screwed myself in comparing it to Samsung tablets. For around the same price, you can get mobility, better design, keyboard/pen, a stand and more intuitive/faster software. Only thing the Show has going for it is it's giant speakers. Besides that, with Google Assistant you can do all the show can and ALOT more...",Didn't meet already low expectations. Go with a Samsung/Apple tablet.

But later the will disconnect and if you try to connect (without powering off the echo) they will claim you have the wrong password for your network. Bad enough that one person in my house has just unplugged their echo show because it is useless. Iphones work great, as does my other non amazon wireless devices. Hopefully the amazon and/or netgear will buy each others products and find out why they are incompatible. They seem to work when you first power up, so perhaps that was as far as they were tested.

Everything SHOULD work well. Device integration and setups for routines is relatively easy but that’s more Alexa than this device itself...it’s just that the echo itself never works properly. It doesn’t stop when you ask it to. It’s a crapshoot if it will even bring up the right song or playlist that you have asked it to even though it’s the 1000th day in a row that you have asked it to.  It will just stop playing music for no reason. It reboots itself at least once every other week. We have to unplug it and plug it back in at least once a week. This thing just doesn’t live up to its potential which is a shame since the Alexa system itself with our other devices and echo dots works great.,A rebelling teenager probably listens better

Fortunately I do have an outlet on my island, but I was still disappointed in that.  Other than that enjoying using it so far.",All one piece

Bought 2 of these, one for us and one for my daughter, so we could video chat with the grandkids. The only thing not so great is the speaker when playing music. It seems to rattle, sounds kind of like something loose inside, but I don't think there is, Once I turned the base all the way down it seems to subside, only doing it once in a while. So don't think I'll be using this as the main speaker for the house, we'll stick with the TV sound bar.",Rattles when I use it to play music

He LOVES listening to Big Bands on our Amazon Music AND Andrew Sisters 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'! The audio is AWESOME! YOU need this.... and get several for ALL your Family Members!

There is a $50 difference in price between a new Echo Show and a refurbished one and the one I received clearly had issues from the start. They said they would happily send out a new replacement right away. A few days later I received my package... a refurbished Echo Show. After speaking with another Amazon employee all they could offer was just a return, no option for what I originally wanted or ordered. In most cases a return wouldn't be that bad except I waited to buy this Echo Show on ""amazon day"" and got a significant discount on my original order.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the Spotify skill, but still have glitches. For instance, I'll say ""Echo, stop music"" I'll see the blue line indicating the wake word was heard, but it'll keep playing music and I have to unplug it to stop. It also will play a play list just fine one day, but then pulls up a random song the next time. For instance, I'll say ""play easy 60s playlist"" and often it'll play 1 song by ""easy A"". I've done the voice training with her too. Other glitches include stopping music randomly, restarting randomly. A lot of skills don't work well including Wyze and YouTube.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2019,Cody Brown,Extremely disappointed in this product. It never listens to me when I ask it to turn on the lights or to stop the alarm. We have a newborn and not only can it never hear me when I'm talking in a regular tone yelling or even in whisper mode. It only recognizes my husband's voice. I have done the voice recognition multiple times. The newest issue is that the reminders continuously alarm even when dismissing in the app. We got this so we can video chat with the grandparents and every time we do the video freezes or is very grainy is always a bad connection. We have great connection for internet So I'm not sure why this is never a clear view of them during the chats. also another downside when you ask it a question it has limited answers since it is not a search engine. It answers basic questions if you're cooking but nothing further than that. Honestly very disappointed in the product I was hoping for more. Hopefully they can fix these issues. I even tried giving feedback to the echo show and ironically it said it couldn't hear me. This just shows the issues that the echo has.,NEVER hears you /reminders continuously go off even when dismissed / not a search engine

The Echo Show is a very good personal assistant, entertainment and utility device for our kitchen. Setup and integration with multiple music streaming services (Amazon Music, Spotify, SiriusXM) was straightforward. Sound quality is good for a device of its size and it’s very convenient to play nearly any song or artist if you are an Amazon Prime or Spotify Premium member. We integrated the Echo Show with our Ring Door Bell (“Alexa, show me the front door”). We use it often to create our shared Shopping List, which is accessible from the Alexa Mobile App (“Alexa, add Milk to the Shopping List”). If you have a second Echo device, like a Dot, in another room, you can use the Drop In feature as an intercom to avoid yelling from room to room or from upstairs to downstairs. It is convenient to have a “hands free” personal assistant in the kitchen to answer basic questions, follow a recipe or set timers. Alexa can also control many ”smart” light bulbs/switches. All in all, I’m happy with my purchase, we use it daily and I’d probably miss it if it were gone.",If only it could display day/date on Home screen

I has brought a lot of good things into my family dynamic. I use drop in occasionally & it always puts a smile on someone's face that I suddenly appear on screen in the kitchen We ask for weather reports almost daily right now (climate change folks!!!) & we have a bulb hooked up to it in a room that has no wall switched lights, so we just tell Alexa to turn the bulb on that in the lamp.  Much of what we do with this can indeed be done with Echo _BUT_ the fact that the Show gives a visual display adds an additional and welcome dimension. I haven't even touched the surface of it's capabilities yet, and I look forward to learning more.",WE LOVE THIS DEVICE

I am thinking of taking it back and getting the goggle home nest max it doesn't have that feature yet but with them maybe sooner, they now have so you can play your sirrusxm radio and they didn't before also you can do youtube on the goggle but not the amazon echo show so disappointing amazon get it together and add the netflix app on the shows I can almost say it would so increase your sales",no netflix

The Echo Show does everything they say it will. My top features are: Sound Quality Ability to hear my voice over audio from Echo Show and background Built in Zigbee hub Screen size is perfect for the kitchen/living room Most of all Skills/Integrations. My wife was skeptical of our use but after getting 60% of our lights connected she is in love (besides looking up recipes) My only wish is that some of the skills utilized the display in a more effective manner i.e. provided more info/better displayed Overall very happy and has exceeded my expectations.,Love my Echo Show 2
Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Aug 2019,Slattery Family,"The Echo Show consistently stops playing videos after on only a few minutes without any prompts or warnings.  She sometimes explains things in German even though the settings say English and we don't speak German. It doesn't acknowledge our subscriptions through Prime Video. We reset the device to factory settings and the same problems continued. So bummed because I was really looking forward to the Echo Show and we have enjoyed the multiple Dots and Tap we have. What was more disappointing was the technical support we received.  We were constantly referred to the tutorial which did not address our issues and when we finally asked for a replacement unit we were told we would be charged $2## which was more than we paid for our unit since we bought it on Prime Day but we would somehow get it credited back. We said ""no thanks"" as it sounded fishy.  Wished they would have worked out the bugs before launching the product.",Too many bugs and poor technical support.

I like having a screen to tell Alexa to show me the front door and have my ring camera connect to it. I like telling Alexa to set the thermostat to 72° and have it done.  I don't like that the home screen is not very customizable.  I'd prefer to have larger numbers so I could completely eliminate my alarm clock.  I'm also not a huge fan of having Alexa suggestions as a background.  I mainly purchased this for smart home integration.  It works well for that. The price is a little high for such a low resolution screen.  I feel that $130-150 would have been a better price point.,Expensive for a low resolution screen

Would have been very happy if the performance was like the old one. But for some reason the performance of the new Show is noticeably slower. It takes literally 10-15 seconds sometimes for it to execute the ask. I would say ""Alexa drop in kids room"" and there would be silence. And then you will hear the ding that it has dropped in. Also the voice recognition is terrible compared to the original. I could say the same command from my sink and the old show would understand it 95% of the time. The new show takes it 50% of the time. Basically I am repeating myself or getting closer to the device 1 in every 2 times.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2020,Kay Tee,I like it but I have to say echo before everything and it’s annoying but I love the aspect of seeing a recipe and having it added  to a shopping list and my kids can tell echo what to add to a shopping list as well which saves lots of time asking and them not actually telling me. So it can’t get any easier than telling echo add milk to the shopping list!! Also I haven’t had it long but for some reason my daughter gets my echo reminders on her phone so I still have to figure things out with it but I like asking echo to tell me the local news or the weather. The more I figure it out the more I do like it. Just wish I didn’t have to say echo every time but maybe I could figure something out!!,I like it and it’s worth it

Wright,"I love the 10 inch Echo Show. I have used it for five months now As a device it is wonderful. Voice recognition is great. Of course integration with Alexa is great. There are however, two problems that I wish to address here. First, from the advertising, I was lead to believe that I could display all of my recipes on this device. However, I cannot find a skill that allows me to do this. Why? I know that there are some third party apps that do this, but not well. This type of skill should be a high Amazon priority and it does not seem to be. The second problem is a little more general. I can find no central forum for suggesting improvements to Amazon for their Alexa platform. I would suggest that Alexa and associated hardware would be well served, as would the consumer, if Amazon would add this type of forum to its website and then publish that information so that the general public could request specific improvements.",Many missing skills and no capability to feedback needed changes to Amazon

There is no excuse for Amazon forcing us to see what is basically continued promotion for their product. And we are not warned about this in the product description. It is annoying enough that we are considering returning the product.  Update- Sadly it’s too late to return it.

I have several Fire TVs, 1st Generation Echo, Echo Dot, several Echo Shows 1st generation, and the Echo Show 5.  I purchased the 2nd generation because of the bigger screen.

I opened a Support Request back on July 31st and up to now, they still have not provided me a resolution.  Support personnel Chris (1st call) and Mauricio (2nd call) were accommodating and followed up on my behalf.  However, the 3rd person (Zack) was not helpful at all and gave me the impression that he wanted to hang up on me because he couldn't do anything.  This is a shame.

So I won’t waste time explaining all the great things about this product you can read those in other reviews.

It connects with our ring camera so we can see who's at the front door. Other functionality for the camera is limited so we have to use the ring app on our phones. We also want to install a smart lock that works with the Echo Show preferably without having to buy another device (smart home hub). But it is nearly impossible to get accurate, detailed, concise information about what locks are compatible. Chat with Amazon reps was useless; they didn't even understand the questions. The Echo Show came with a smart bulb from Phillips. Again, you're on your own to figure out how to make this thing work. How stupid are Amazon and Phillips to offer this bundle then leave you hanging with no idea how to get it to work. It took a while for me to figure it out (and I have two engineering degrees and ran a tech department for years), but I still can't get it to show up in the Alexa app on my wife's iPhone.

What I don't like is the deal they are running a deal that says the echo flex and bulb are free. It's 229$ total. So I look at my order and they drop the price of the echo show to 189$ plus 19 for the bulb and 20 for the flex. Altering a price to still come out to the same price doesn't make something free. Unfortunately due to the pandemic they can't put anyone on the phone so I got someone the first time on chat that had no vested interest in listening to my concern. The second guy did and offered me a 40 dollar gift, which is great but that doesn't fix the issue for anyone else buying this and thinking they are getting something for free. Free is Zero. Not $$$. I'll knock this thing up to a 5 star when it's fixed. Thank you!",The Free extras are not Free.

Be aware the majority of the speakers are rear facing, as the large screen takes up most of the front, but if you have a good bounce wall that its near, it makes for a full room sound. The screen is a very high resolution, and the additional features on it are great. The voice recognition and ""listening"" features catch your wake command and questions very easily.

It will not allow you to put any sort of parental protection on it to block your kids from using it. I've reached out to Amazon multiple times to see if they could do something such as putting a pin on the device, but the only thing they said I could do is remove my account off of the device, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the device.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2019,John G.,"Sound is good and gets decently loud.  I usually love a lot of bass, but I have to turn it way down on this.  Alexa doesn't seem to have quite as good hearing as other devices I've used and she seems slow to respond.  The screen looks nice enough, but I don't feel like I can describe it as very responsive, and I don't really like the touchscreen interface.  But then I remember that the Show probably isn't intended on being touched all that much.  With that in mind, it's the best sounding and loudest Echo I've had (until I get my hands on a Studio), so I'm happy with it.",Worth it for the good sound it makes

After a month of use, the following problems have not been fixed: 1. Volume switches off and doesn't come back on unless I pull the plug and restart. 2. Jeopardy is unplayable. If you answer a clue with ""What is America?"", Alexa will exit out of the game and do a search for ""What is America?"". Unforgivable. 3. Playing music via voice recognition works about 60% of the time. Sometimes she will try to convince me someone else is streaming from my account in another location and suggests that I upgrade my prime streaming service (nice try liar). 4.

Requiring this to be plugged in all the time to operate is really a downer when you’re considering the use of video.

It still responds to spoken commands but if I ask about the weather forecast the forecast is displayed but there’s no audio output at all.

All of my friends that have come over have ended up getting one to. It controls all of my smart devices in our house. Two things that would make it even better is to have a slide show setting. I can tell it to show my pictures and it does beautifly, but it defaults back to the home screen if any messages pop up. I also have an Amazon cloud cam, the echo show will tell you someone was detected at the front door but not give you a video feed to show you without you verbally telling it to do so each time. That should be a setting that we choose to make automatic.",Great device!

It desperately needs some sort of apps and onscreen keyboard to realize its true potential. You Tube and Radio feature work but seem to have a mind of its own on understanding what you ask to hear or watch. It occasionally stops mid way for no apparent reason while streaming radio and videos. It feels like you bought a car but have a donkey pulling it.

The device is great looking and sounds pretty good. HOWEVER, that is where everything stops. The user interface for Alexa and Echo is absolutely garbage. I tried to find another word to not be too crude, but, I couldn't. Amazon, I'm sorry. I'm a huge fan of your great customer service and products. Why did you design such a useless device from the ground up? Say you want to play some songs on your pandora, well you will need to use at least 2 devices. You have to configure the station on a computer after going into 10 subselections (really well hidden). Then start pandora with a voice command on your Echo show. That absolutely defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker with a user interface. Amazon, please allow people to use the screen on the echo show to configure apps, otherwise you sold a very good looking paper weight.",Useless user interface

Love that it can get on the internet, YouTube and other sites. The sound quality is much better than the Dot but is a but has a bit too much bass even when you EQ the bass lower. Yet the sound is not distorted. I guess the only thing I can complain about is when music or a video is playing even at a moderate level Alexa can not hear you call her name for commands. All in all a good product. Now what they need to work on is making Alexa more like a search engine because I find myself asking her things that she should know but she doesn't or you have to be so specific in HOW you ask her the question. Often times it's much faster, easier and less frustrating to ask Google the question from my phone. But buy the Echo Show you'll like it.",Alexa can't hear well.

Cons: Netflix is not available, but I wouldn’t be watching it on this device anyway. The whole “Skills” thing is annoying and not the most user friendly.

I highly recommend a stand for it too. I like to adjust it for optimal viewing if I’m right on top of it at the stove or across the room. The speakers sound great for this price range too. The only bad thing I can say is that with the speakers on the back, if I push it too far into the corner under my cabinets the sound bouncing around can get a little weird and the bass goes a little wonky when it gets really loud under there.",Get One.

I don’t feel I got a major upgrade from just using the dots. Everything is meant to be done by voice control but honestly that isn’t always convenient. For example, we really wanted to use this for recipes. So I setup the push buttons for Firefox, then click on Pinterest, then find recipe, click on it to open full recipe. So far these are all pretty standard items. But the screen goes back to the home screen after so much time, haven’t found the setting to change this yet, and then you have to start ALL over. The webpage you were on is gone!  The show also doesn’t really act as a hub anymore than the app on my phone does for the Dots.

We could do drop‐ins and when wouldn't need to do anything. First off the constant try this is very confusing to her and there is no way to turn it off. 2nd the video camera stops working quite frequently and the unit has to be rebooted which isn't something she's able to do. I spent over an hour on the phone with Amazon before I got the unit making sure that nothing would be required of her for us to have a video chat and it's turned out to be a huge inconvenience. I've gone back to contacting one of the aid workers on duty and getting them to go to her room with their phone so I can face time her. The constant Try this messages confuse and upset her but Amazon made sure they can't be disabled.

The screen is nice, the voice recognition works fantastic even from across a large room, set up was easy, and having a simple “brain” to manage much of your smart home devices is a huge perk.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2020,Dilan Pradhan,Worked for 6 months. During 6th month Alexa stopped responding. Called customer service and tech. After 1 hour of resetting and rebooting. I was told there is something wrong that they have to check. Rep offered me to send them the item and they would check and fix for me. I was shocked but asked that is the only option. He checked with Technician and came back with good news. They would send me new device and I have to return old. At least that is not so bad warranty. Giving 3 star because this is 2nd device to have same problem for me. Not giving 1 star because warranty service helped to exchange.,Second device to break but decent warranty

It wasn't long after I started using it daily that the 2nd gen came out and I purchased right away. HUGE improvement with screen real estate and sound. Big improvement and I now use the device everyday. I'm a bit impatient though with some much needed updates. Besides the normal voice enhancements we desperately need across all Alexa enabled devices (e.g. understanding user intent based on previous commands), I found the screen to lag a bit when browsing Amazon Prime Watchlist and it bugs out once in a while when playing movies.  I've had to manually reboot (unplug) a few times.",2nd Gen v. 1st Gen

As an AI AND GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF YEARS ALEXA HAS BEEN AROUND it just baffles me how stupid alexa still is even after all these years.  It makes me feel like were going backward in time when I talk to this machine.  I wouldn't waste your money on this.  What you want to do is just get alexa stereo echo or whatever just for music.  The show cant really do much more than what the stereos do.  Alexa cant hold a conversation alexa doesnt know anything I'm talking about.  Alexa can only recognize my voice 85 percent.  And not to mention the security issues downloading these skills ie apps.... allowing information to be sent even video across the world oh whatever it's the world we live in today.

Hair,I had a 1st gen echo show and was skeptical about it. But I loved it and the one thing that would make it better was if it had a larger screen. That is realized in the echo show 2 but with one major trade-off. It seems that the microphones had been reduced or are not placed well in the new version I have to repeat myself a few times and shout just to wake the device from across the room. I never had an issue with the first gen. In fact the 1geb echo show is placed in another room and it will hear me over the echo show 2 even though it is in a room much farther away. I am very disappointed with this functionality and may put the new echo show in a different room because in my very long galley kitchen the old echo show is much easier to use.,Microphones are not as good as the first gen

The speakers on the echo show V2 sound fantastic with the bass produced quite literally astounding. I did have to turn the bass down just a tad to stop slight distortion at 100%. Otherwise i have clear, crisp audio on full blast with bass that easily fills a room. The large screen and amazon music are magic with lyrics scrolling across the very nice 720p display. The cooking capabilities are awesome and the ability to control my hue smart bulb lights using the built in zigbee hub is awesome! The screen although beautiful seems to be where amazon may have cheaped out or i may have just been very unlucky. I had my show running for a solid two weeks and sadly the screen couldn't keep up. I came home from work only to find long streaks going across my echo screen. For a device that is meant to be on 24/7 you'd think a better more reliable panel would've been installed. To make matters worse the policy for replacement is a joke. I called and was polity greeted to being told i'd have to send it in for repair rather than what I had expected. What should've happened is i should've had a new show sent out with prime shipping and a return label for the defective one. I understand that people lie to get a second product but that is where the customer would be charged for the second product upon failure to send back the defective one. So for now i am without my show for the next 4-5 business days. The customer should never have to experience down time or feel penalized for having a defective product.

Although Amazon replaced the first one promptly, it wouldn't turn on, the second one I feel they have been dragging their heels on replacing this one.

Since we have it sitting in a corner we'll sometimes spin it around when playing music to let the speaker project into the room.  This is made easy, as I bought a rotating stand for it (ATOPHK Echo Show Stand Aluminum)...a must addition.  I'd say this gen Show on a stand looks and feels just like a small touchscreen home automation hub should look and feel like.  Speaking of hub...that's a feature not to be overlooked.  Purchased this model specifically for that feature...so far so good.  Much easier than creating multiple device accounts and linking them all together in the app.  Very pleased to date.",Great improvement over previous generation Show.

The one thing that I find a problem is the processor. I feel like I purchased a cheap tablet because of the delay. When I purchased the Echo Show, I was thinking Amazon creates quality products. But when I used it for talking with my children there is a delay for the picture to be clear. When ever I touch anything on the screen there is a delay to change screens and or a delay to open up the options to what I chose. The processor needs to be updated. This doesn't require extra memory because it isn't something you download a ton of games/applications. With that said, I would think there would be quick responses when touching any part of the screen. It's also heavy! I'll give it a 3.9 star rating.",3.9 Rating - Delay in the processor

However, the light can be distracting if you don’t usually sleep with a light on, and there is no way to disable it. You can use the “Do Not Disturb” mode and the screen will darken, but still display the sound and alarm. As for the software, I’ve had multiple issues. The first time I plugged it in, the sound didn’t work (It said Alexa was speaking but I couldn’t hear anything). Once, the screen wasn’t working (nothing displayed but Alexa could hear me). I can’t call any devices because it will cause a bug. The only way to troubleshoot the issues are to unplug, wait, and plug in the device again.

I’m happy with the picture quality when I check I’m on my kids. I ordered a stand for it because it doesn’t tilt or move and I was only able to see the top of my kids foreheads. I haven’t figured out the audio setting but it has too much bass for my liking. “Dropping in” With the dot was horrible because of the sound quality so I’m much happier with the Echo Show.,So far so good

Like its predecessors,  it doesn't always get what your asking but I'm used to that. Sound is full and better bass response.

The only flaw I found was the inability to drop in on my mother, because she has more than one device and if they’re on the same phone number it doesn’t know where to call, something that might want to be considered in the future revisions of this device and other echos... ie, using IPs to separate contacts for drop in rather than phone number, or the ability to call a specific device.",Nice picture and sound

I connected Hulu Live and it works great; however, I do wish it came with a remote... trying to switch channels can be cumbersome unless you tell it exactly what channel you want to watch, e.g. “tune to ESPN” There are many more cool features but one other that I like the beat is the digital timer.

The speakers are the main reason i upgraded but I did not realize how much I would enjoy just asking Alexa to find me recipes and not having to print it out or get food particles all over my phone. Also with the use of some of the available apps and skills it can give you a TV where you didn't have one before. I used to not be able to see my TV while i was at the stove but now i can watch TV while I am Cooking.

This is not the case at all!  All the video apps (hulu and prime video) are lite versions.  If your in the middle of a TV series good luck getting to the show much less the actual episode you want.  If only they did a casting update to where you could pick the episode or movie on your phone and have the Echo Show play it.

Also, with the second generation model came new software features, like Hulu video. I purchased the first gen show last year and to be honest It became a music player with a screen. Minus the occasional video call with someone else, that was it's primary use. The screen was pretty small in comparison to the second model and I never would have considered watching anything on it. The second generation feels like a small TV (requires Hulu w/live TV) in my kitchen on top of being an Alexa / music device.

Alexa speaks clearly. The screen very bright and  huge compared to the 1st generation. I still have not used it’s full functionality as far as watching Hulu and adding home security. Maybe, later.

In addition to communicating easily face to face, she loves the music, timer, weather...  After a few minutes she relaxes back in her chair and tells me about here day (even showing me her pedicure color :-).  The only negative comment I have about this product was the requirement to have a smart phone for set up/authentication.  I am sure she's the exception but that was a pain to deal with.  A lot of seniors have Amazon account but not a smart phone (more PC or tablet driven/no text).  Once we got past it though, works really well.

That way you can move it around without worrying about keeping it plugged in at all times. It would have through web searching availability, and would have the ability to download apps.

I love this product, and have talked my sister and my cousin into buying them for their children homes as a x-mas gift.  I think one bought 6 and the other bought 5!  They all love them!

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2019,JaY,"The echo show could be really awesome.  I really love all of my Alexa devices but the amount of errors the show experiences is inexcusable.  Whether it is frustration with Alexa hearing me properly, cutting out in the middle of songs (Apple Music integration is a joke), failing to load videos, or just caught in an endless loop of “thinking” (the blue light just getting stuck on the screen) the amount of times I have to reset this thing is ridiculous.  When it does work, it sounds great, and the video looks solid.  Unfortunately those special times are rare.",Just not up to par

Often takes a few different sentence structures to get Alexa to provide the desired response.  Occasionally have to resort to a good old fashioned Google search.  The sound system is really great for the size of the unit.  Bass response is well balanced with the mid and high range.  Volume is fine for typical usage.  Amazon music is a wonderful service that has obscure albums like Pablo Cruise Worlds Away from the 70's.  Tried to get Alexa to display Claude Monet artwork on the screen to no avail, but she knows who he is.  All in all I'd say it's a good purchase.

Enter the router's gateway IP, like 192.168.1.1. Enter network prefix by entering this number: 24. Enter first DNS same as your router, like 192.168.1.1. Enter second DNS as 8.8.8.8.

You can't add multiple items at a time without stating the command with each item. It doesn't categorize so you end up with a long list in random order which is a pain when shopping. It seems the designers put no creative effort in product development. If you synch another app with a better list, you can't change the default on Alexa or delete the Alexa shopping list. Essentially, Amazon designs one of the most vanilla apps and then forces you to be stuck with it. Lately, our Alexa has been interrupting us with its own ideas of what it wants to show us which makes me wonder if Amazon is starting a partnership with advertisers.  The call video feature is nice and the music ability but overall I'd say Alexa isn't very AI smart in comparison to other products. Hopefully, product development will go back to the drawing board.",The Alexa default shopping list stinks and you can't change or delete it

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2018,Robert W.,Sorta like there was a party going on in a dark room...and then the lights got turned on. An excellent addition to the Echo family. Quality and performance are superb. The 2nd Gen Show sound is as good or better than the original. Image quality great. And processing performance very good. Tried the Show to Show calling at 240 miles distance and it performed well. Got me all fired up to enable and include my automation and IoT devices - which gathered my devices under one umbrella - added programming features - and prompted me to add new devices. Great product. Anxious to get my hands on an Echo Auto.,Alexa goes visual!

The speakers sound great although 95% of the time use our surround sound speakers. This leads me to my top two complaints! 1. If you're selling an upgraded item, the new and improved, make sure it can do all the previous electric did + more. Especially when customers pre-order. The new Alexa show does not connect to your surround sound speakers properly. It sounds like headphones that are not plugged in all the way. 2. SUCKS to wait all year for the new product, pre-order it, pick it up and it cannot do one of the coolest features the old one did and your family uses A LOT!

Regardless of where the volume control is, it produces zero noise. I called Amazon, and apparently it is an issue with multiple customers. The fix is to unplug from the back of the unit, wait 2 minutes, and replug to fix.

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2018,BRADLEY E SHUTES,"My primary complaint about the first gen Show was the horrible touchscreen display.  The only way to see photographs clearly was to view it straight on.  Any movement to off-angle resulted in a washed out mess.  The second gen is only slightly better in that regard to the first gen. It still has an annoying wash-out appearance when viewed off angle, but the angle appears to be a bit wider.  This is likely due to the larger dimensions of the display, and not any change to the underlying display technology.  For the display tech nerds out there, this is very likely an edge-lit TN type LCD (ie the worst of the worst for image quality)  If you're expecting an IPS or OLED and would be disappointed with anything as low quality as a TN type then you might as well skip this device.  The sound quality, however, is much better in my opinion.  The base is deeper for sure.  Because of the improved sound alone I decided to overlook the screen deficiencies and keep it.  It still makes a good Echo device and the best alarm clock you could possibly purchase right now.","After trying the first gen, the second gen is a keeper, but just barely."

I had to try this new Show (2nd Gen) as my biggest concern with the original Show was that the screen was too small for kitchen/living room use.  I like to check my schedule, weather, recipes, watch videos, etc. while cooking and it was originally a tad small for that from across the room.  This new Show seems the perfect size for the kitchen.  My only issue is that the speakers have moved from the front on the 1st gen (facing where you would be standing in front of the device) to the back of the 2nd gen Show.  I have mine on the corner counter (8 inches from the wall) in the kitchen, and between being in the corner, and with cabinets above, it now sounds a bit like its muffled in a tunnel.  I know some people originally complained because the 1st gen Show looked like a micro old projector TV, but that didn't bother me.  In an effort to streamline and make the screen bigger, the speakers were moved to the rear.  Just something to keep in mind when deciding where to place this device (and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars).  I am happy with it, however, as the screen is a great size, crisp and a wonderful companion for the kitchen/living room!",Good improvements...

Bigger screen.  Bigger sound.  Ultimately works the same as the 1st gen, regarding the user interface, but overall it's more enjoyable to use because of the larger screen.  Playing music and movies on here is a better experience due to the audio improvements.  Much deeper base and gets much louder.  Overall, I'm impressed with this 2nd Gen unit over the 1st gens.",Better than 1st Generation

Echo Show (2nd Gen) | Premium 10.1” HD smart display with Alexa – stay connected with video calling - Charcoal,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Oct 2018,Tomcat,"I have two major issues with the screen: A.  It seems to sense ambient light (or knows the time of day and operates from that) and adjusts the brightness.  The problem is that it is not bright enough in low light making it hard to see.  There should be a manual brightness adjustment available as well as an automatic mode. B.  The clock is too small and impossible to read from a distance.  The digital clock should have a multiple size option from current size to full screen.  Also a twelve hour clock and an analog clock display would be nice. In general, the Echo Show may have a number of display options, but I'm not sure they are really useful.  Why watch a movie on the 10"" screen when the big TV with better quality video and sound is nearby.  I do like the seven day weather display.  One of the nicest features (also available on all Echo devices) is the ""drop in"" and ""announce"" feature turning all the Echos into an intercom system throughout the house.  Overall, I'm not sure it's worth the money given its limited use.",Limited in ability to control display
