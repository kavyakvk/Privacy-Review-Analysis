Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jun 2020,Hihydy,"If you have cats- it will become annoying at certain points. I bought this for my mom, we have a security system already. But owl doesnt have the feature of live streaming on the phone and being able to talk through the camera like this Ring Floodlight has. 

    My mom can be at work and gets notifications if were leaving or if someones at the door in general. Its so sensitive, that even a cat running by can activate it. So just beware it can be annoying due to that sensitivity. But the safety you feel is priceless. And she loves it",Mom loves it

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Sep 2020,Johnnyexxo,"Seems to work quite well.  You can widen or narrow the area of focus which has is merits.  However, I’ve noticed some deficiencies:
-The loudspeaker isn’t very loud
-The people only setting does not pick up vehicles.  Only pedestrians.  
If you switch to another setting to pick up vehicles, you get everything.  Cats, squirrels, etc.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,MonMon123,"Installing it was costly because it is wired, so I had to get an electrician to do the job.  However, once installed, the camera was clear and the lights are bright.  What disappointed me is the alarm—-it was not really that loud.  I guess that level would be enough for quiet evenings, but daytime, it’s probably not useful.  Overall a decent product and works well with my Ring ap.",Bright light & good camera

We can see everything that’s happening from our house and our two Neighbors house. The light is definitely bright.

I installed a second WiFi access point to ensure I get a great signal not a mediocre one.

Used this device for about 6 months and sold the house they were mounted on. 

Presently installing two new units on my new residence. 

Motion detection works well and it can really see a good distance in the dark. 
Minor motion (such as a cat) will easily turn on the lights but not alert you. Larger motion such as a medium dog will turn on lights and alert you.",WiFi issues occasionally
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Firecracker,"Put up over garage, had one before but the leaves moving on the trees set it off.

Pictures are very clear   Actually was recommended to us by a friend",Actually works
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,epreske,The light motion sensor is spot on. It is able to pick up movement through one of my trees in the yard so it helps illuminate the walkway. The customizable camera motion area is great. My neighbors going to their cars don’t activate but if someone walks between our yards it will activate. One minor issue was a power failure required a reset of the camera which meant getting the ladder out & pushing the button on top to reconnect. Not too bad if you only need a step ladder. Any higher would be tough. there is a minor issue as to where you can mount it. Manual in the box says only mount on a wall but website say mount ceiling or wall. Mine is on the soffit & works just fine. So I guess mount in either location.,Great floodlight/camera combo

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,Anonymous,"I bought it - and I absolutely love it! At first i wanted to buy Arlo LED 2k cam but after I learned that in order to achieve maximubrigtness i have to purchase addl power supply and cables, - screw that!- i went with this option- always powered on- even if smb wants to shut down my electricity- they would be on recording which is stored on the cloud( $3 per month for one device), awesome! Me and my wife love our new cam! For the whole time i had it( 1 month)  the server had only one time glitch where my mail came in and i was at home but the notification did not alert me - i called ring support right away - they apologized for inconvenience and told me that even I couldn’t see my video in the history- once they finish upgrading the server i will be able to watch it( honestly I thought it never will happen) lol, but to my surprise, the next day i saw the video of mailman putting my package on the doorsteps! Again- this thing is awesome bcs you don’t have to worry about any batteries or if how most of them are non replaceable- to throw away your “toy” after couple of years! Lol. P.S. angle of view is awesome too and you’re able to change the motion zones( and you can have multiple separate motion zones), so it won’t bother you when you just let your dog out.

It works great and the best thing is you can talk through it and tell people to get off your property. Which we have actually done. Letting people know that they are on camera. If you are technically challenged like we are, have someone set it up for you, we did. There help line is great and people actually answer the phone and are very helpful.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Jul 2020,Sherry,"I purchased the Ring-Floodlight Cam after a couple of houses on my street were robbed.  I called Best Buy's 1-800 number to get advice on what I needed but was disconnected after a half hour wait the first time and the second time spoke with someone who knew nothing about the product, tried to transfer me to someone knowledgeable and put me back into the same queue as before, so I hung up and ordered the product on-line.  Right next to the online order was an option to have the product installed for $199.  I went ahead and purchased this and scheduled an installation the earliest day possible, which was 2 weeks out.  The night before Geek Squad was arriving, they called to confirm.  I told them what I needed to have installed and they told me they were not able to install it because it was 110 voltage.  I then called the 1-800 number and got such a run around I vowed to never shop at Best Buy again.  I ended up just hiring my contractor to install it.   The lack of real customer service at Best Buy is really appalling.  I was beyond frustrated and just writing this I can feel how upset I still am by the time I wasted on the phone with people who know nothing about their products and have no ability or authority to actually resolve a situation.",Don't buy the installation!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,18 Nov 2020,Cardholder,This has been one of the best purchases I've invested in. The quality is good. Our house is already hard wired so it worked perfectly! I may get another in the future. We've had it for over a year now.,Still love it!
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 May 2020,Shelly,"The geek squad rep that came out to install. didn't even pick these up before he came out. It's like he knew he was going to up sell me.
He said I needed power to the locations not just the camera wiring that I had. He tried to sell me another camera system that would be wifi. I didn't want wifi as Ive had connectivity issues in the past.
Long story short. I called my electrician who came the next day. I had to go pick up the cameras. and You still charged me for your geek squad which I'm not happy about. My electrician had them up and working in a few hours. They are a great camera and I love the bright flood lights.  I did have to buy 2 extenders to make these work.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Jul 2020,ThinBlueLine,"I purchased Ring products because of the $100/yr unlimited devices monitoring/cloud storage.  
The device was fairly easy to get on-line.  It is not an under eave install, so it may take some planning and modification.  I was lucky I already did a modification for my previous light.  
This floodlight camera does a very good job of detecting motion over a large area, and provides a lot of light.  Notification of motion to a phone is typically 1-3 seconds.  Picture quality is good, even during darkness.
My biggest complaint is the inability to know that a spider building a web should not be reported.  The decision at 2am between getting out of bed to clear out a web, or just turning off alerts, is usually turning off alerts.  While I will capture video of nefarious activity, I probably won'g catch it as it occurs.",So sensitive to spiders
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Fred,"I bought this device wanting security over my driveway and the cars parked in front of the house. It works 95% of the time as intended I would say. The Ring app can mess up sometimes and won’t show you the live stream or anything without being reset at times. We have very fast internet and a router right above where the camera is installed so that shouldn’t be the issue. This camera is pretty much worthless if you don’t plan on paying the monthly or yearly subscription for ring protect, please be aware of that. They have plans are cheap as $3 per month tho.",Works well if you are willing to pay
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,Maineiac,"This is the third piece of Ring technology we have installed over the years.  Very good at detecting motion and alerting via the software, but it is slow in connecting via a phone.  If you really wanted to talk to someone or listen to an event in real time, it takes way to long to connect and sometimes doesn't connect.  Saved video is quite good, real time connection  could be greatly improved.  Although the lack of speed could be caused by connection factors other than the camera itself.",Great most of the time

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,Bill,I had an electrician at my house doing some general small jobs so had do the install.   I already had the phone app installed as I previously installed Ring doorbell.   Using the existing phone Ring app the device went active very smoothly and instantly went active on the phone and computer app.,Installed easily with my Ring phone app
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2018,Road1,"The Ring Floodlight Cam works a lot better than the two battery operated Ring Spotlight Cams, which I took back for a refund. The motion sensing and video recording are more consistent and works about 98% of the time. There have been a few times the Floodlight Cam failed to record video during a motion alert, but a Ring representative emailed me in a timely manner and gave suggestions on correcting this issue. Video quality during the day is good. You can easily identify who's in your yard and whats going on. The video quality at night is just average at best. I've seen better on cheaper cameras. If something were to happen at night, you better hope the person being recorded is within 10 feet of the camera or you might have a hard time identifying this individual. 

NOW FOR THE WORST PART OF THIS SYSTEM............THE APP
I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with Andriod 7.1 and everything is fully updated on my phone. My home wi-fi is not an issue and the Ring Floodlight Health Status always shows my connection as good to excellent. No problems there. Checking your motion alerts at home when your phone is connected to the same wi-fi as the Ring Floodlight Cam, all is well and the app responds most of the time. Now here is the problem.........75% of the time I've had motion alerts being away from home using my data network through Verizon, the app fails miserably. I get a motion alert, go to live view and get noting but a black screen with a rolling icon. This will eventually get you to a screen that states "" Your Phone Is Having Trouble Connecting To The Ring"". This is not caused by a poor cell signal. I have had full bars on Verizon's 4g LTE network and get nothing. How in the world are you supposed to view, talk or sound the alarm if needed when the app fails to deliver. I am not the only person out there with this issue. There are a lot of complaints posted in online forums, Google Play reviews of this app, YouTube and other sources stating the same issue. Ring needs to correct this problem. We have all seen the commercials of people out and about making it look so easy to respond to Motion Alerts, but this is not the case.","Good Floodlight, Decent Recording,Bad App"
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,21 Nov 2020,WG26,"This is one of three Ring cameras I purchased. It is mounted above a garage door, overlooking a driveway.  The wide angle coverage gives a great view of the driveway.  Almost no false motion alerts. The LED floodlights come on when motion is detected in the dark and do a nice job of lighting up the area. Picture quality is quite good.  I needed an electrician to mount an electrical box on the outside wall where the camera is mounted, which added to the cost, but it does not need a battery, so it was worth this extra one time expense. Very pleased.",Great solution to covering large area
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jun 2020,KingC,I love this ring camera. I bought the version that has floodlights and goes wired. It’s great and does not require changing batteries. It’s surpassed my expectations. There is a small $3 per camera monthly fee if you want to have everything available.  If you have more than one ring device you might want to consider the $10 a month for unlimited amount of devices fee rather than $3 per device.,Ring is amazing
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,bpuma,"This is a great combo. The flood light is pretty bright. We have other LED flood lights on our house and I like the brightness and color temperature of these better. It has a good range of movement to be able to change where the lights aim. The motion sensor is pretty sensitive and has a good reach (depending on how high off the ground you mount the light. The cameras look good and you can adjust the sensitivity of when they detect motion. I am able to read license plates from where I have it mounted on my garage, about 12-15' off the ground. I have one that the speaker doesn't seem to work on and I keep forgetting to try the other. I really like that it is all powered by the electricity that powers the flood light and I don't have to worry about charging or swapping batteries on my exterior cameras, and that it works with my doorbell app. CONS: I can't view all my cameras on a singe screen in the app. It takes a fair amount of navigation to get from one camera to another, if you just want to see what's going on. As of right now (Nov 2017) there isn't any integration for the camera, motion, or lights with Smartthings. I really like the integration with my Ring doorbell and Smartthings and though that I would have the same functionality with the floodlight. So far, I own 2 of these and have been happy with them.
Make sure you have good wifi coverage where you want to mount them, I am on the fringes and the quality of my doorbell videos and floodlight cam videos suffer as a result. I plan on improving signal in those areas to help them.",Great camera and floodlight combo
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Jul 2020,Okieboy,"can't go wrong with Ring and this floodlight is no exception. it gives great video quality and the lights are nice and bright. The reason I dinged the floodlight one star is for the pathetic siren. It is not the reason to buy this light, it is way too soft and wouldn't scare off anybody. either have a siren that's puts out some volume, at least as loud as a car alarm, or just leave it out of the unit.",great product

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2018,RighteousRob,"Camera 1080p Video quality is very clear day and night. Range triggering flood lights is Limited. Lighting is bright. It seems the range triggering video recording is not the same but actually a little better than lights. Sound system works but is not very good. I am paying the fee to record on Ring Servers. Video Review software is a big issue. It seems I cannot choose a specific past date to review. Scrolling to past dates is exhaustingly time consuming, scrolling page by page. Distant past dates are nearly impossible to review because the app always crashes after going back more than a month or so. I am assuming authorities could get those videos if they had to. Because of good video quality and ability to view from both an iPhone 4 and 6, I give the Ring Flood Camera a Passing Grade.","Good Lighting and Camera, Poor Software and Sound"

The installation went quick and I am not the most skilled handyman. The quality of the camera is great. It is about 60ft from my Netgear nighthawk router and through about 2 interior and 1 exterior wall I still get great signal. I have had to dial the sensitivity down a little as the light would come on all night long from the motion of flying insects.  Be weary if you have a gutter downspout near the camera because at night the IR will reflect back off of the downspout and white out the camera.,Very useful

The camera picture quality is much better than I expected and the features on the app are very good. I am planning on getting another camera for the back of my house. I'm very happy with my purchase.,Good picture quality.
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,AMoore,"We added this to our home to replace an older security flood light.  We like the added feature of the camera.  The lights are very bright!  We like being able to turn the light on and off from the app on our phones.  Downside- spiders in webs set it off as do other flying insects.  

We know now that our driveway is the neighborhood cat super highway along with raccoons and possums.  

Looking to put one out back too.",Great addition to our Ring family of products
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Apr 2020,Grant,"The light was really easy to install.  Ring's got a handy hook to hold it in place while you wire it.  After installation, setting up the camera was easy.  Worked as well as you'd expect so far.",Easy to Install - Quality Picture
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Matt,Much easier to install than any other flood light.  Comes with all the tools.  It also works with alexa home,Very easy camera
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Happycustomer,"We really like the Ring Floodlight Cam!  It did not come with instructions on how to use the app, but just play with it a bit or go to Youtube for information.
One thing to note is that if you set it to only recognize people, it sets a predetermined sensitivity level.  Our driveway is long enough that motion was not being detected until the motion was almost halfway down our driveway.  This was the case even though we had set the area to look for motion was all the way to the end of the driveway.  We changed the setting from to only look for people to look for all movement.  Then we set the motion sensitivity detection level to the highest level.  That worked.  Now we get all movement in the area we specified.  We will now get notified of animals and cars in the driveway as well as people, but that's okay.","Only had it a couple of weeks, but it works great!"
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Rolo,"Bought this after someone was in our yard at 3am. Works as advertised. Floodlight is very bright. Enough to illuminate my whole back yard which is 36 feet deep from the house. The siren isn’t very loud but loud enough to scare some one off for sure. The only draw back, besides a little pricey, is I had to get longer screws from the hardware store to attach the light. The ones that came with it were way too short. Apart from that, works great. I have it linked to my echo show 8 and works seamlessly. Also, if you have other Ring cameras, you can have them start recording if this picks up motion. Can’t put a price on safety, but I will be getting a couple more of these.",Another excellent Ring product
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,22 Nov 2020,CoreyIsham,Great Product that I set up by my self in less than 30 minutes.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Beachmom,Love the Ring Floodlight Cam!  We have it in our backyard and we have it adjusted so that the camera is able to pick up motion that goes the entire width of our yard but stops at the rear fence line.  The yard is wider than it is deep and we are on a walk path. So by adjusting the area that is picked up by the camera we eliminate the number of false alerts.,Easy to adjust to irregular shaped lawn

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,20 Nov 2020,Slipper,"Good item, my only concern is getting the settings correct. Even on a low setting, even snow triggers the floodlight. So it’s going on and off continually. So I then have to set the sensor on the lowest possible setting, but then I’m concerned it won’t pick up the important stuff, like intruders!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Jun 2020,jhconsumer,This camera is great. the picture is clear and the lights really light up the area. The reason I gave it a 4 is I replaced one of my under the eave flood lights with this camera. I had to loosen the base and flip the camera adjustment over to get a good motion sensor range. I am satisfied with the results I have. I just had to make a adjustment that I think Ring should have suggested for horizontal mounting.,Great video

At first, there is a 30 day trial period, and then you have to purchase a subscription to cover one device or multiple devices. It offers recorded video clips based upon motion detection. However, after the trial period ends, the subscription allows you to view those video clips. 

There is a night vision mode when the lights are off, but then whenever it senses motion, it turns the led floodlights on, and records video clips in color with sound. You can connect it to the same Ring account as your ring video doorbell. Importantly, you ca Control it from anywhere you have WiFi or LTE coverage.

The wide lens range is the best I've experienced, showing me more in view than my other high definition cameras. I absolutely love the options it comes with such as talking through the cameras, the multiple motion and light settings, the nice floodlights, and the sensitivity. 

My only issue is that I have to pay $30 a year for cloud storage. I would like the cameras to include 24 hours at least free. I have bought the cameras because of their options and nice lens, but having to pay or not have any evidence to give to the police in case something happens is a real turn off to investing more into these cameras.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,SimpleTruthes,"The Ring Floodlight Cam is well recommended because there is usually  no issues. Not in my case. I had the Ring installed by a licensed Electrician who also owned several ring products. Went through setup. I could view past events, turn the lights off & on, turn siren off & on. But could not view ""live"". Went up and down ladder at least 10 times  alternating with the Electrician.  Resetting and redoing  setup. Day 2, up and down ladder at least 15 times with phone in hand. Day 3 with Ring support  on phone went up and down ladder at least 8 times before being told to return it to the store. Day 4,went to 2 Best Buy stores to pick the minds of employees that own Ring Floodlight Cams. Conclusion exchanged the Ring. Installed it ,did setup same outcome. Ring support chat ,up and down ladder at least 5 times before they gave up. Day 5 new Ring support chat up and down ladder about 3 times, then on hold 15 minutes to check out things. Only to be told return it .Returned it, and was told about another customer .Earlier that day customer complained about his Ring - Floodlight Cam. It worked randomly  sometimes at home and never worked at all  away from home. My problem was no 'live view"" ,no ability to change motion sensor settings. Which meant I got a ridiculous amount of alerts .My router was up against the other side of the wall the Ring - Floodlight Cam was installed on. The connection was very good. Even switched WIFI, and used 3 different brand routers. yet when trying to view ""live' ,I would just get ""your phone is having a hard time connecting"". When trying to change motion settings the screen said "" trying to register phone"". It never stopped trying to ""register"". The  Ring Floodlight Cam if worked had some very good features such as the Neighbor hood watch feature. But sense there is some kinks still needing to be worked out, Ring support unable to point you to a true resolution, and no reset button built into app for re setup (hard reset should remain on hardware) … I give the Ring - Floodlight Cam 3 stars. Recommend to a friend ? yes as long as the Ring is installed low to the ground (no up and down ladder) and cable not At&t internet(possible issue?).",didn't work for me

My phone is going off for birds and squirrels and even bugs and leaves. I am happy it is sensitive but it can be annoying. Maybe there is a setting that I haven’t figured out?  I do believe it was over priced. I think $150 is fair and the $250 it normally runs is high. Happy it was on sale when I bought it,Awesome flood light

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Tony,"I love everything about this product!!!! Now I don't have to be home and I can watch my house or be warned if anyone enters without my permission. You do have to buy the cloud to store the videos but only $100 a year and worth it. The app for the computer, you really have not much control but if you are using advanced phones or iPads, you can have full function and it is great. The company is super good for help and even give a lifetime replacement for each item. With the videos, you can download or send to Ring neighborhoods so they can keep their eyes open for bad guys. I have already sent a video to the cops and gotten my next door neighbor a ticket for loud music when they lied to the cops about it, the cop played the video to them and then gave them a $100 ticket. Overall, I am very happy and feel well protected now even if I am not home. You can also assign family or friends to your account and they can see and control your system from their house.",Outstanding product

I would give the camera 5 stars.  The flood light part of this product is said to last 10 years.  It has very specific lights that are suppose to be top notch.  The lights crapped out on our family 1 1/2 years in.  The product has a 1 year manufacturer warranty.  Best Buy has extents warranty options.  I’m so mad I didn’t take Best Buy’s warranty option.  Disappointed that the product wasn’t as reliable as advertised.  Can’t replace the lights, would have to purchase another unit because of how the product is made. Flood light portion 1 star.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Jan 2020,amtn,"We've had this Ring floodlight installed for about 3 weeks. I like that you're able to change the motion zone so we can skip getting alerts every time a car drives down the street. There's also a People Only Mode that will alert only when people are detected - I haven't tried this feature yet. My only complaint about this is the floodlight sensitivity. Our old floodlight would turn on when there was motion at the end of our driveway. With the sensitivity all the way turned up on the Ring floodlight, we still have to get 3/4 of the way down our driveway before the light turns on. When it does turn on, it's a good bright light. I just wish we could adjust the settings for it to turn on when motion further away is detected.","Great camera, good floodlight"

Let me tell you, so much goes on when you're not at home. You're able to two-way talk, turn on the lights, turn on a siren, and live feed any time you want.

During the day, the feed is crystal clear. During the night, it's clear, but not like during the day. Even then, night time video looks great.

I also like that when motion is detected on the floodlight cam, it send signal to the doorbell to start recording right away.",Great camera for the home!

If you have other ring cams like spotlight you will like the floodlight cam that much more. it will hook up to newer electrical boxes but if you have a old 3"" rectangular box you will have to got to Home depot and find the right bracket to make it work. one that has screw threads in it and you will need to buy the right screws for it. the ones with the kit won't work with the bracket that makes it work for this older outlet box.",works better than I thought

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,TechGuy,I am impressed with the video quality.  Great for both day and night vision. The motion detection to set off the video recording is impressive.  It detects cars on the street about 80ft away.  I had to set the motion zone not to include that area.  The interesting part is that motion area does not turn on the lights.  The lights on setting is a separate min/max setting.  It is good but I would like it to be more sensitive to turn on the lights.  The brightness is about the same as my original dual 150watt light that I replaced. It does not disappoint.,Very Nice

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Fyerman01,"Since COVID closed down schools but I still had to work, I decided to add a few cameras to the house so I could monitor while the kids were home.

I have installed and managed several professional systems over the years. I had my doubts about the claims of quality and features Ring claimed but I needed something fast and decided to give them a try.

To say I was safisfied would be an understatement. Installation could not have been more simple. If you can change out a spotlight on your house, you can install a Ring spotlight camera. It was dead simple and the easiest camera I've ever setup.

The field of view on this camera is huge! I can see my entire front yard, both next door neighbors, and the houses across the street from ONE camera on one corner of the house.

Image quality is equally impressive. The picture is crystal clear and good enough to make out a license plate in the driveway across the street.

The only downside is that you have to purchase a subscription to get full use out of the system but it is well worth the price. I get asked all the time what the best system to get for security is and Ring is hands down the best.

They are a tad pricey but you get what you pay for and won't be disapointed!",Amazing Quality and Easy Install!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Feb 2020,OriginalQBall,"It is extremely sensitive which is fine, you can turn down the sensitivity but I like it recording everything that happens day or night.

I installed one in my backyard last year and now installed one focusing and patrolling my driveway. Works very well and bright covering 3-car garage drive way. I am little unhappy, actually annoying to receive alerts for things out of my motion zones. May be i need to find out how to control that in the app. Other than that, it does all it's advertised for.  If you can afford it, pretty solid product.",Very nice. Works awesome
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Deen,I purchased it 2 months ago and they haven't failed me yet. Now I am linked to everyone in my neighborhood through the app and last night I received a notice that my neighbor's house had an attempted theft of his outdoor smoker/grill. I immediately contacted Ring through their app and told them to activate the recording service. That same man came to our back porch within minutes of leaving my neighbors house and tried to steal my brand new outdoor pizza oven. My Ring light came on and scared him away. My camera footage was able to assist the police in tracking down and arresting the man.,Very Good
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Jul 2020,Ronnie,Not functioning as well as the two I purchased in the past . The light portion doesn’t come on when Motion is detected . I had one in the same location and it did as it should. Call ring to see if I had a bad camera/ flood light . The representative said it was due to the fact of my outdoor wall sconces which is definitely not the case as I stated above I had one located there that function correctly.,Not functioning as well as the two I purchased

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Feb 2020,Bestbuygeek,"This was an almost perfect flood light with camera except for the weird static noise that I get when using the mic. The camera itself is great and goes well with my other ring products. However, this is not meant for an easy install if you have an older outlet box that doesn’t support the supplied mounting plate. I had to buy additional parts. I bought it during a sale so saved a little as this product is expensive.",Almost perfect
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,BIN1010RYM1010N,"The fact that this is a flood light and camera in one that provides a wired solution in place of a normal flood light mounting bracket makes this product worthwhile to consider. However, setting up the sensors to turn on the light and detect motion/with notifications are separate settings and are not consistent. Meaning it is possible that the light turns on without sending a notification that motion was defected is a all too common occurrence. The other aspect is that the light, and separately, the motion notifications occur either way too often - detecting either no movement or detects falling snow/rain/leaves - or not enough - can’t seem to detect people or animals. I currently keep the light and motion notifications as sensitive as positive which wastes energy to turn on the light and I manually check every notification to ensure there is no issue near my property.",Good single solution (floodlight/camera)
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Feb 2020,Curry,"Recently had our floodlight cam's installed and LOVE them!

If anyone gets close to our door at night the lights come on and we are notified right away. If it's a ""false"" alarm meaning the lights came on because a car drove by the lights will turn off after a couple of seconds. You can also go into the app and turn the lights off yourself. Only con I have is the flood light and the ""ring"" sensor are 2 different things. Sometimes a bug can fly in front of the sensor and I dont get an alert on my app but the light will come on so it is very sensitive.",Great product

Sometimes it takes awhile to connect. Ring has stopped giving free one year subscription for new cameras. That was a bit disappointment.

The doorbell tends to give off far more false positives then you might imagine.  Soon causing you to simply ignore the notifications. Until that day some guys steals its. (True Story) 

I have found the floodlights to be far more reliable.",Consider the Floodlights before buy the Doorbell

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,RobertG,"Nothing wrong with product, to my knowledge.
However after researching mounting instructions, I saw where it was NOT RECOMMENDED to mount horizontally -under eaves of house - where my older sensor floodlights are currently mounted.
I contacted Ring support just to be sure, as I do not want to mount this vertically on side of house. A vertical mount would require moving wiring & I’d have holes in the soffit from the floodlights I have now. Ring recommended their Spot Light Cam instead for horizontal mount, citing possible safety & functionality issues. Wish this had been advertised better or the tech would’ve known this.","Advised NOT to mount under eaves, soffit"

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Bwande,"Overall I am quite pleased with this camera system. The light housings and base assembly are made of steel or aluminum (not plastic) which gives the feel of a solid constructed product. Due to limitations on the range of motion for the lights and camera, this product cannot be mounted horizontally.
Sometimes the motion sensor fails to detect motion. This seems to happen sporadically and so far is unpredictable as to when it will happen. My Ring Doorbell Camera which I’ve had for over a year has a similar issue so I can’t say this was entirely unexpected.",Good product overall. Minor issues.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Jan 2020,Gbomb,I have three of these cameras. I like the coverage that they give. The only negative I have is the delay of the notification and wet weather.

So if something happens quickly you will miss it and have to wait for it to load to see what happened. Other than that the cameras have been great.,Good camera

Works like a charm with the ring ecosystem. During installation, the plastic pieces came loose and would not tighten back up. When I tried to put them back in the threads were already shredded… which means that the product quality is just OK. If you get it right the first time and it gets on the wall, you may be OK.

These are made to be surface mounted against the house and replace lights over a garage door.  If you don’t have that, you can mount it upside down in the eaves.

There are different settings, such as keeping the light on or turning it off completely. Also, you can set the sensitivity of the sensor to be more or less far reaching. When it senses motion within an adjustable range the light comes on and a message is rec'd on your cellphone (similar to the Ring doorbell). You can view the person in the designated area, you can have a conversation with the person! Best of all, like the Ring doorbell, you don't have to be at home.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Apr 2020,Norbi,"The camera is amazing in quality if its  wifi connection is  2 feet away.I bought a floodlight,doorbell and alarm.After 30 days I can use the floodlight and doorbell only for live view.It doesnt have even a sd card slot like the old ip cameras to record the motion.Its like getting a surveillence camera from a company that you pay monthly for a subscription but at least you get the gear free of charge but with ring you pay for everything.
Using the camera without subscription is useless because you cant review the motion sensor recording.Only for live view but for that you need a good connection and like all the reviews online the wifi receiver from ring is very bad so its gonna show low signal.After reading reviews without subscripon you are fonna have problems accesing the camera for live view .Remeber that everything is with subscription.Without they dont work properly
I wanted to return the floodlight and doorbell but Im not gonna unscrew them and do all the work again for removal.
Shame on Ring and other companies.I read only the good reviews before purchase but now I know that people are not very smart ,they like to pay monthly subscription for almost nothing.Dear people this is like a ip camera probably it is one but old ip cameras have at least a card slot for recordings to review.
Ring,Nest,Arlo and other more that I owned use the same subscription.My main cameras from business are with a hard drive.Ceap and reliable but I wanted something new but this arent the one.

Ring should have recalled the 1st set of Ring spotlights after the first few complaints about the product, but instead they appeared to ignore the online complaints.

  The sales people at Best Buy don’t know crap about these products and I went in green! 
I did have Spectrum come out to make sure that there were no lose wires etc. he read my numbers and said my WiFi was weak due to the router. 

 I went online searching for one that could work with concrete walls n still it’s not a 100% pulling the strength for WiFi outside.  
I even bought a 25ft long Ethernet cord to put in the middle of the house for the outside cameras side n back yards and for the front door camera and the pro chime to alert me somebody’s somewhere.
still not working 100% !

 Now you can have Geek Squad to help you.  Buts going to cost you for help.   Sales people don’t tell you this much and what I would have to go through. Or I would have never bought RIng.

I was told I need to have the internet.  I have 4 Ring products n it’s a work in process to keep it all on line.

I had to go out a buy a new Router! This is what needs to be strong strength in signals!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,kurtedward,"Well we really like this camera and its ability to light up our front yard and track all the Little critters that run around at night. The initial setup process was anything but smooth it took nearly two hours back and forth between two different wireless routers. We ended up having to place one of the routers much closer to the unit as 15 feet seem to be too far to our main router. for some reason we endlessly had to push the pairing button and go through the the process in setting up, it kept failing over and over again. Then for some reason it just accepted it and it seems to have stayed connected ever since. We also purchased two additional cameras that did not have the flood lights attached to them and each of those took about an hour's worth of effort to get them connected to the system to the exact same router. I am unsure why this isn't issue with ring devices but our ring doorbell as I recall had similar connectivity issues when we first install it. But that being said now that they are connected I can't imagine a smart house without them. So if you have patience and don't mind calling tech support then these are good choice and the monthly monitoring fee is more than acceptable at $10 a month. But then again that is optional, but I see a lot of value in that small fee.",The camera is great but set up was a royal pain!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,BRUTUS,"The flood light cam is a great concept. I bought 2. The first one was installed in the backyard just above the door.this cam works great. The lens captures the back portion of the yard with great resolution. This cam is within 20' of my WiFi and works all the time. Now with that said , the second cam is installed directly over the garage door it too ( now) has a great pic .this cam is roughly 30' from my WiFi . before I added the WiFi repeater/ extender the cam simply didn't work at all .lots of buffering with no pic or video and when I would finally get videos there would be tracers and the video would breakup. Als the cam would always be off line. So if you have a large property and need multiple flood light cam you'll also need multiple repeaters/extenders for the Ring flood light cams to operate properly.",Great concept

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,Xian,"Video Quality:
When it captures video, it's not what I would consider HD quality. It may be HD in pixels, but the detail is definitely not. I said, ""when it captures video."" That's because it will sometimes completely miss motion and not record anything.

Motion Sensor:
This is probably my biggest beef. I have 3 dogs and a cat. The heaviest animal in this house weighs 16 pounds, and yet the animals are constantly setting off the motion sensor on the floodlight. I had a spider building a nest in front of my side door floodlight that set off the sensor more than once. All three of my floodlights have their motion sensitivity set to ""Person,"" and all three of them go off for spiders, cats, a small wolf, our dogs... Basically, something the size of a baby setting off the motion sensor and clogging our saves recordings w/ nothing of importance!

Lights:
They actually light up the area pretty well. Unfortunately, it seems as though they're always on! I'll look at the app and see that the light is on even though I have no alert that something triggered it! Also, if I want so sit on my deck, I either have to be very still or cut the power to the floodlight because there's no way for me to disable the motion sensor that controls the light for any period of time.

Alexa Control:
Non-existent, except that the Alexa app sees the devices. Unfortunately, it can't do anything with it. If I ask my Echo Show to show me the front door (Ring Pro 2), it says it doesn't have any devices called ""front door"" even though it's right there in the list of devices as a camera! Same if I ask to see the back porch (ring floodlight), I get the same response.

These are nifty in that you can see what's going on around your house from anywhere via your mobile phone. That's about where the ""smart"" capabilities of this device end. If there's no wind at all on either side of the connection, you can remotely carry out a conversation with someone via these devices. Other than that, these are very pricey security cameras with very limited ""smart"" capabilities.",Thoroughly average in every aspect but one.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,2,23 Aug 2020,Allen,Well seemed like a good idea at first. Bought this to go on the garage but never installed it after realizing that you have to pay for a monthly subscription to see any video footage. You can activate the camera and view remotely but that's it. If you want to see what caused the motion alert you will have to pay Amazon for that feature. They also sell the data to police departments and have the ability to run facial recognition on all the footage stored on the pay access servers. Not really a citizen friendly system.

He seemed like he was in a hurry to get them installed but not to help us get them online. I ended up on a ladder to Pair the 4 cameras.  A couple of the floodlights seem to turn on and off each evening quite frequently which must be a setting we haven’t figured out yet. Best Buy should be assisting us in learning how to use them.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,iceman,"The camera provides good clear view which compliments my doorbell camera. However, not sure why, but sometimes when motion is detected, t takes a while to view what was detected. This is true even with the doorbell camera. I have the latest whole house WIFI, installed to insure strong signal everywhere. The other thing I am not happy with is that they don't provide a way to add storage payment in combination to the Doorbell monthly payment. Would prefer one monthly payment for both devices instead of desperate payments for storage. I gave a recommend to a friend with reservation.","Provides clear view, But.."
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Nanj,We purchased this floodlight camera in February. Love it. We have one car that is parked in the driveway so we feel like the camera light will deter anyone . The camera is clear & we can see the back of the house & out to the street. Very pleased,Great Ringcameras
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2018,Sorahkh,"I purchased and installed both a ring doorbell and this floodlight. It's been about a week now in full operation. I pay for 50mbps speed internet, but I'm actually getting closer to 5. This is a huge issue as both my Ring products are not working that well. 

The doorbell in the front has a major issue with the sound quality, and it's impossible to actually speak to someone who is at your door to the quiet. It's not adjustable, so that feature just plain does not work. Rumor is the Doorbell Pro has an even smaller speaker making the problem worse. The doorbell is less than 10 feet from my WIFI router. The camera is also a bit choppy and freezes occasionally. One time already in the first week of operation, someone rang my doorbell and all that was captured was a pure black image. It doesn't really give me confidence that it will work if someone tried to steal a package or break-in.

The floodlight has issues because it is farther away from my WIFI router, although it's still less than 50 feet from my router and should be perfectly within range. The floodlight camera freezes....a lot. I mean every day and every motion detected. It catches frozen images about 5 seconds apart. It's spotty and choppy at best, and the sound coming out of the speaker is not at all audible. 

The backyard of my property is adjacent to the interstate wall, so both Ring devices capture a ton of traffic background noise which cuts in and out and makes the devices sound like a dial-up modem trying to connect.

Before purchasing any Ring products, I would suggest verifying your internet speed AND checking your router/WIFI strength at exact locations where the cameras will be placed.

I am still considering returning the Flood Light but will likely keep the doorbell. I'm also annoyed that I now need to try troubleshooting my internet speed and my router signal strength. Everything else in my house works perfectly fine and even devices inside the home that are much farther away seem to stream 4K video just fine.",Be Cautious when Buying and know your WIFI limits

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Nov 2019,DaveB,This camera failed miserably right out of the box. The lights would randomly turn off and on. Spent $190 to have an electrician install it. Spent several hours on the phone with Ring support and they made it even worse by rolling back the firmware which has caused the camera to totally freeze up. Ring said it cannot be repaired. Fortunately Best Buy was willing to replace it for me but I now have to pay another electrician to replace the camera. I have lost most of my vision or I would have done it myself. I have to replace it with the same camera or I would have a big hole in the front of my home above my garage.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Nov 2017,Cdub,"I've had this product for a couple of months now and I can clearly say that I wish I had gone another route. I read a review about the uplink lag time between camera and phone and was told from a sales associate that that reviewer probably didn't have a great wifi connection.

Well I have a great wifi connection - 3 eeros w/ 1 Gbps speed - and the response time is considerably lacking. In addition, you must purchase a plan after 30 days in order to view any videos unlike other cameras that simply erase the videos once you've used up a determined amount of cloud storage. Yikes!

Sometimes instead of working poorly it simply doesn't work at all!",Not very consistent - find alternative

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jun 2020,Carmen,"These are pretty amazing and very simple to install. I purchased 3 of these along with a doorbell camera after shopping a higher tech camera system. The ability to link all of these ring devices is what won me over. I like the doorbell because I have a porch and an unsightly ‘security love camera just wasn’t the look I was going for. So onto the floodlight cams. Both the light and camera are adjustable. After the wiring part is done the setup is simple thru the ring app. The light is very bright and overall the camera does what it’s supposed to do. You can set different motion zones and other settings thru the app which is perfect. The only con is the picture quality. Compared to the other brand I shopped, ring didn’t stand up so well. The picture quality is very good until you zoom in. Keep that in mind, if somebody is in your yard for example, you’ll have a good look at them. If they’re across or down the street you just won’t get a good image. I have no regrets on going with ring for my security system. For me it’s something I wanted to have but not necessarily thought I needed. If you think you NEED a security camera system I’d recommend shopping around a bit. Hope this reviews helps.",If you have existing flood lights..

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,BDogg,"I’ve got 3 Ring Flood Light Cams that are direct wired in that run flawlessly. Great color, great picture, great features. 

My problem with my 3 Spot Light Cams is their slow at initializing or “activating device” for live view. Slow to wont even activate. Also, the camera only catches about 50 percent of the motion. I’ve adjusted the camera from height to tilt position in ever direction. I also bought the best WiFi extenders with satellites so my RSSI is like -16 to -38. My internet speeds are untouchable. Changed settings. Been back and fourth with Ring and we keep doing the same steps.. unplug modem, wait 10 seconds, then plug back in and try again... for the price and then all the accessories you gotta buy to make it run with out errors and you still have errors, it’s not worth the price until the issues are solved. I don’t recommend this spot light camera. 

I hope there’s a software update that could possibly fix the issue but, still interacting with Ring to find a solution. I don’t feel like it’s going to get fixed though.",Great Camera & Flood Light

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Aug 2020,squired,"Easy install, and simple to use.  I decided to go with RING instead of ARLO because the simple 3.00 dollar a month subscription, and the 10.00 dollar a month unlimited devices subscription.  From I have been reading the other companies nickel and dime you to death.  The lights are very bright and motion detection is great.  You can set the sensitivity and also block out time that you don't want it alerting you.  Camera is clear, and retrieving videos is very simple.  The alarm feature is fine, enough to call attention outside but not a siren to alert the neighborhood.  The 2 way comms are fine too.  You can hear what is going on and if within 20-30 feet able to have a conversation.  I am very happy with this product and I have other Ring products that are great too.",Good product
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Jan 2020,LiReviewer,"I bought this to replace motion activated security lighting over my garage.  I bought the hardwired system.  This was easy to install and connect to my ring doorbell system.  The area of motion detection can be adjusted and this unit has a feature to set the motion sensor on snooze.  The video is fairly clear.  It has night vision capability and an alarm.  All good.  The only downside is you have to buy a monthly service from Ring to save any video.  Although you can get motion alerts on your phone, if you are not home it is rare that you will have good enough cellular service to watch what is going on in real time.",Better than plain motion activated security lights

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Sep 2020,NotDub,"I have a Ring Doorbell and so wanted to stay within the Ring ecosystem for a motion/security camera product and was not disappointed.  I used it to replace an existing outside light fixture, and installation was easy enough.  There are lots of configuration options as far as the range of the camera, sensitivity to movement, etc. so you can tailor it to your yard or other area pretty readily.  The  LED lights are very bright which is great, and they are very adjustable so you can point them so as to avoid angering a neighbor.  One thing I did not expect - the ""lights come on with movement"" feature is slightly different from the ""record movement with the camera"" feature, so you can have a situation where the lights come on but no movement is recorded.  The software is excellent, lots of ways to customize when it is on and when it is off, etc. 
Overall a great product.  Remember that if you want to be able to keep historical recordings of movement events you do have to purchase a monthly support plan from Ring...it is not too expensive and I find it helpful to be able to go back and look at stored recordings but just be aware.",Excellent motion light/security camera

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Jan 2020,Savannah,"This thing is designed to be mounted on a vertical surface, so if you need to install it under an eave you're out of luck. There are hacks on the web to mount it that way, but when I got to the point where it said to use your Dremel to cut big chunks of plastic from here or there, I decide nope. Gonna take it back.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Mar 2020,Technoguy,"There's really nothing negative I can say about Ring products, even in light of some bad press they've gotten due to no real fault of their own.  This device works great, I love being able to see my back yard and watch the dogs when we put them outside.  I rarely have any connectivity issues and when they do happen it's usually just momentary.  These may not be the best solution in all cases, but in terms of ease of use, quick peace of mind and quality for the money.. you cannot beat these products.  Ring has always been super responsive and very helpful with technical issues and honestly, people who complain are likely not very technically literate to begin with.","Great quality, great video."

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Apr 2020,nrgdoc,We had the Best Buy Guru come to the house and review our needs. He suggested  2 Ring camera lights which light up and record activity around our home. Security is important in the city.  Further we are connected to the community as well as the  police.  Best Buy hired techs to put up the cameras and help me set them up to the service. Ring gave 30 days of free service to get used to the cameras. The pictures are sharp and clear.  The program is easy to learn and use. The service is reasonably priced. Much less expensive than professional security cervices with better safety.,Great product

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,ChezRubenstein,"I wanted a replacement for my dead ""dumb"" floodlight near my front door. I wanted a hardwired light with the camera so that I did not need to charge batteries or run new wires.

Self installation was easy. I routinely do minor electrical work like replacing light fixtures, switches, etc. This was no different. Connecting to your account is quick and easy. The field of view is great and the picture is clear. You can even customize the area that triggers the motion sensor. That's very useful. 

In order to review and save footage, you need to get Ring service. Would be nice if you could save it to your own local or cloud storage, but $30 per year isn't bad. I still haven't mastered the sensitivity. A busy spider at 3 am has woken me a couple times. I'll need to mess with that too stop needless notifications. And last, if you're a Google Home person, this doesn't nicely integrate. Understand that Ring is under the Amazon umbrella, so there is not a smooth integration with Google.",The only one that ticked all the boxes

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2016,boatramp11,"Install is easy if you have a light already mounted, 110v wires already there. Working with the app on my phone with the light is very easy. The app and program you use to operate and adjust settings with this product is easy to do and better than I expected. Many online reviews are accurate when I now look at those compared to my installation and setup and how it went from beginning to end. It initially did not get a good wireless signal. My router is on the opposite end of the house from the garage where the light was mounted. I bought the Ring Chime and it did not help near as much as I thought it would. From router to floodlight is 60 feet single story and signal goes through many walls. Chime had to be plugged in closer to the light than the router in order to allow a better signal to the light, for me. RSSI signal strength went from I think 66 (poor signal) to 45 which is now listed as good. Nowhere does it say what this rating is. I found on the Ring site somewhere it goes from 0-100, 0 being the best possible to 100 the worst. It says that when you troubleshoot signal issues on the Ring website somewhere.","Excellent flood light camera, highly recommend"

We've had a Ring doorbell for a couple of years and we got this light to monitor our driveway/frontyard area. It took less than 20 minutes to climb up and replace the old motion light on the house and another 5 mins or so to set it up on the app. I like the video quality from it, it gives a good amount of light in the evening when we come home and the app/service feels top-notch. I'm looking forward to adding more Ring products as sales happen as we're replacing all of our outdoor lighting over time.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,NewHomeNightmare,"This is my second floodlight cam and I absolutely love it. The setup was extremely easy and it literally took me less than 30 minutes for each camera. I had an existing floodlight in each location which made the installation easier.

The installation kit had everything I needed including tools so I didn't have to use my toolbox, hardware kit or run back and forth to the hardware store.

The setup was also extremely easy. I got connected and up and running in less than 10 minutes after installation.  The key, however, is a reliable wifi/internet coverage.

Really like the custom configuration. I can set sensitivities, detection zones and motion schedules very easily.

The video is clear with the ability to zoom in on your cell phone. It works well at night even when the floodlights aren't on because of the IR LEDs.

The coverage is also great. I have a decent size backyard and I can see almost every inch of it with adjustment of the camera.

Switching between devices on the cell phone or tablet is very easy. I can easily switch between Live views on all three devices.

The phone app works very well. Both my wife and I​ have this installed on our phones and we can access the same devices at the same time with no issues.

These devices give me peace of mind when traveling or leaving my wife or kids at home. I get notices any time someone is around my home no matter where I'm traveling.",Very satisfied; great for DIY home security

I was able to hardwire this to a wire connection that turns this into a standard 3 prong outlet end. It has been a nice addition to my home security.

The installation was a straight forward remove and replace of the old lights and was made simpler by the supplied tools.  My only quibble is that the lights activate even when in the snooze mode.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,Davidf7958,I have 3 of these surrounding my house so now I wonder why I installed an alarm system.  ! Actually I put SimpliSafe  system in my house. I’m SimpliSafe and Ring both have wonderful security systems. I started to go with all Ring systems so it would all be integrated with the cameras. SimpliSafe so far doesn’t have any type of outdoor video light (I have 3 of the Ring flood light cams). But then Ring does have an interior alarm system but I went with SimpliSafe for that because they had some things like smoke and fire alarms and also water detector alarms (one unhindered each toilet and one next to water heater so in case water heater blows out our toilets back up hopefully will let me know ! But I had already put in SimpliSafe and it works well and didn’t want to rip it all out especially since I wouldn’t have the water and fire/smoke protection. But that’s ok the apps are side by side on my phone.,Works great

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Accupulse,I have a few Ring products. I wanted to see in my backyard. I bought this instead of just a camera. The flood LED lights are bright and do a good job lighting up the backyard. The motion sensor is a little finicky but I'm working in the app to straighten that out. This is the hardwired version which was pretty simple. It will replace an existing light if you already have one wired. I did not have an existing light so I had to add an outdoor junction box (Lowes $5) and hardwire it to a switch inside my garage.,Solid Flood and Security Light

Open the Ring app and get all my Ring cams showing real image of each one real-time. I can also check the history for triggered events and download the files I want to keep on my phone for police!",Easy to add security floodlight camera
Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Apr 2020,NetworkEngineer,"I have an assortment of Ring products (thousands of dollars invested) in Ring floodlights, doorbells, spot cams, chimes, etc.  I also have other brands of camera systems (Arlo, Simplisafe, Logitech, other non-consumer brands, etc. ).   I’ve mostly been involved in non consumer projects related to these devices.   There are three major deal breakers for me with the current Ring systems.  

1.  NO REMOTE RESET CAPABILITY -  If your Ring system goes down for whatever reason (i.e. power failure, software glitch, wifi connection issues etc.), there is NO method to reset the system remotely.   You have to physical access the Ring device and press a button to reset it.  This is ridiculous design.  This might not be a problem if your system is physically at your primary residence or if you never go on vacation, but if not, your system could remain inoperable until you can physically be at that site.  So.... when you go on vacation and your house experiences a power failure, you may not be able to use your cameras until you return.  If you have a second residence, rental, or business that is remote and your cameras go offline, in my case it can be months until I can get to those locations.  My other camera and system brands CAN be reset remotely.  I do not have to be physically present to get them back up and running.  

2. INADEQUATE WIFI ANTENNA AND CHIP.  When I contacted Ring about my issues, they said this was a known issue.  In one of my applications with Ring, my cameras are 6 feet line of site, 20 feet line of site, 15 feet through one wood wall, and 3 feet line of site, and door bell 15 feet line of site.  Another property I have 15 feet through one brick wall.  Even at these close and unobstructed distances they are severely limited and unreliable connections.  I have not experienced this with other camera brands.   

3. NO ALERT OR COMMUNICATION VIA TEXT OR EMAIL THAT YOUR CAMERA IS OFFLINE OR NOT WORKING - My other cameras and security systems let me know when the system is down.  I can get text, email or opt out and get nothing at all (not sure why you would not want to know that your security system or parts of it are down).   Ring DOES NOT CONTACT YOU WHEN YOUR SYSTEM IS DOWN.  I found out two week later that my remote cameras were down and only so when I happen to look on the app (I suddenly realized Ring was a bit too uite). I could have easily been robbed without knowing since my Ring cameras (that I depend on) were not operational.  This is unacceptable for a security system.  My other brands notify me via text or email when my system or cameras are down within seconds when they are down and when they come back up.  

---------

My current personal Ring systems (that I also use to demo for businesses) goes down at least every 4 to 6 weeks due to various condition such as power outages, wifi connection issues, or hardware/software glitches.   Sometimes they come back up... but 50% of the time they do not and I have to reset the system, if and only if, I have physical access to the camera.  The power outages are not Rings fault, but I do have all Wifi equipment on backup power supplies that keeps power to the network infrastructure for up to 3 to 4 days. Keep in mind, my other camera brands always come back up when the power is restored ( our power outages last anywhere from 30 seconds up to 8 hours but typically are a few minutes ).  I first brought these issues up with Ring five or six years ago shortly after Ring changed their name from Doorbot ( I was an early adopter).  Each year, I would report the same thing.  This last time I contacted them (March 2020) I received a very competent and experience senior support tech person (not going to mention their name to protect them and because he was up front and honest and cared about his company and customers).  That person’s response -  ""No, it's not you... I've been at Ring for quite a long time and we hear about Wifi connection complaints all the time from our customers.  Unfortunately, upper management has known about this issue for some time but have not taken our internal recommendation to resolve the issue... these are very cheap and underpowered chipsets and antennas which is why your non Ring cameras from other manufactures don't have those same connection issues within the same or very similar environments.  We (Ring technical support) have also brought up the remote reset issue as well.  I don’t know why they engineered the product this way, but upper management refuses to listen to us or the customers... I absolutely love working fo this company but its very frustrating for tech support to deal with angry customers when management doesn't listen to their us about customer complaints.""  I have to mention, Ring did come through with an acceptable agreement with me regarding my yearly service (appreciate that Ring), however, I’m stuck for a few months (or more with COVID19) without cameras protecting my remote property. 

Final Thoughts
Ring is a security company.  They have recently included home and business security systems to compete with Simplisafe and others.  I am a technical cyber and physical security professional by trade for 30+ years.  I've designed physical systems for fortune 100/500/1000 companies, government agencies and made recommendations to family and friends for their homes.  I have in-depth hands-on day-to-day experience with multiple camera and security system brands and technology (including legacy IP cams and closed circuit). I do not work for a security manufacture or sell security products.  I am consultant who is product agnostic and selects the best and economical security solution based on threat and risk profiles that fits the particular agency, company or private consumers unique situation and needs.    We have a phrase in the business - ""Security is only as Good as your Weakest Link"".  In my opinion, I would absolutely not buy these systems until these issues are addressed.  If you’re currently invested in the Ring ecosystem and effected by similar issues, I would let your opinion be known to Ring as well as delay any expansion or upgrades until fixed. 

No camera system is perfect.  Each has their advantages and shortcomings.   Ring products do have several nice features and in some ways better than other products.  However, bottom line, if they 1. Can't connect reliably and consistently with Wifi,  2. Cannot communicate when the system is not working, and 3. Can't remotely reset - they are not providing critical functions needed in a security system, and in some cases, creating added risk of undetected property theft or personal injury.  Do your research and choose wisely before investing.  Wishing the best for Ring.  Thankful for their technicians honesty and offering some resolution with my yearly subscription.  As in most situations, Best Buy is the best place to purchase technical equipment especially with their price matching guarantee, extended warranty and Geek Squad support.",Critical functional design issues to consider

My issues: 1) even with the sensitivity set to ""people only"" the cam picks up small animals re cats and even debris floating in front of the camera; 2) when the iPhone is in ""do not disturb"" mode, there is no option to allow Ring to alert me which defeats the purpose of having a security camera.

This light/cam is very easy to install and ring provides all of the tools you need in the box. The night vision is great quality and you'll be very pleased with the video quality. If your wifi is weak or don't have a strong signal where the light/cam is located, make sure to get a ring bridge to help increase the wifi strength.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Ohiomom,"I love this flood light like all other Ring Products. They think of everything to install, making it easier. They even had a hook to hold the light as an extra hand. Only downfall, the hook was to short. But everything else was easy to install. The lights are not replaceable, but according to the ring supportline, if you subscribe to the unlimited amount of products per location, they warrant any of their products for life. Even the light bulbs.
Only negative, I think they should have a button to turn on lights while watching the live view or viewing your motion.",Love all Ring Products

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Jul 2020,KitsapCraig,"I would have taken the unit back but for two reasons - it went on sale the day I was about to return it and it's a huge pain to have to uninstall after all the installation hassle.  The thing detects motion 3 or 4 times a night and I have yet to ever see anything on the recording.  To make matters worse, the camera detects motion and starts recording but the spots don't come on.  Yet, I go out and stand in front of the camera and it detects and lights and records and oh boy.  If only it worked under normal circumstances.

And, if that isn't enough, the audio is useless because it's drowned out by a loud crackling sound.  I spent a couple hours on the phone with tech support and, though their tests showed the installation was good and all the numbers (signal strength and such) were fine, they were unable to make the noise stop.  So there's that.

And, there's the monthly charge that isn't mentioned until you try to use the light.  That alone would have kept me from buying if I'd done a little more research and learned about the charge.  My bad on that one.

I wanted to buy 3 or 4 of these lights for around the property and was planning on staying in the same ecosystem, but I won't buy another one of these.",Too many negatives

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2017,Rasco,"I love this product but I must be honest about it. 
Video quality is good enough for 100 feet but sharp 80 feet or under with 1080. Better then the arlo only at 20 feet for 720p. 
The ring works but it has a process issue 10% of the time. (The screen is black and doesn’t complete the video fully) it is a great product. Worth the cost but it would be better at 4K. It will also be a lot better when ring corrects the video processing but this should be an easy update. 
Check it out. Buy it too but know what you are getting. It’s a fairly good deal for $100 each year to pay for the online ring video storage and it links right to your phone so you can watch and see it any hour of every day. 
Easy to share and set up neighborhood surveillance in a community with flood light cameras too. If one camera takes a glitch while processing another picks it up also. I’d buy this again too. 
The ring door bell 2 is awesomeness too.",Very good but maybe 60 percent.

You can set the ""zone"" that you want picked up in the app, so you are not getting false alarms from animals, etc. in other parts of your yard you don't need to protect.

The whole block knew except me because I slept through the whole thing. Well since I have the Ring on my front door, I’ve decided that its time get one for the back of my house. As for the features, I like that it has it where you can talk to people through the app to scare off intruders and I have set it to 'people only' since my neighbor has a flag that constantly blows and the camera picks that up as motion.  I really like it so far and hopefully I will be aware of anyone trying to break into my car next time. Well worth it….",Wont get away this time....

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Zack,"I had flood lights on my home with motion detectors, but that didn't stop criminals from burglarizing my home.  I work 2nd shift so I couldn't just turn them on at 2:30pm when I'd leave to work.
     With the Ring Floodlight Cam, I can set a time for the lights to come on, or manually turn them on/off whenever I want with the app.  I also like that the LED is a 'warm' light, and not a crazy bright white light like my old floodlights.
     I can also set monitoring zones, event alerts, and check out Live feeds whenever I want from my cell phone.  The cameras also have two way communication so there is no reason to have these plus a Ring doorbell at an entrance.  It also has its own separate siren that you can turn on if you see a creeper lurking around.
     At midnight I turn the lights off on my side entrance, but I can still see everything clearly with the colored Nightvision that the camera has!  It is super awesome!
     The camera automatically records in 1080p HD when motion is detected, and the recordings are sent to the cloud in case a criminal tries to smash the camera or tries to look for the 'security tapes'.  When I'm on break and when I get home, I check the motion sensor recordings on my cell phone and 'Star' anything that I think may be important.  This makes it quick to find important recordings.
     Within a week of using the Ring Floodlight Cam, I caught a woman trying to open my car doors at 3am.  The motion detector turned on the lights and I caught some video of her.  I was then able to post it to the 'Neighbors' part of the app so that others could see the video and watch out for the woman.  I could also share the information with the Police Department.
     Some people may be concerned with the price, but when you think of ALL the features you get, I am surprised it didn't cost more!  HD camera recordings, two way communication, flood lights, siren, motion detectors, Nightvision, and the Smart tech that is in it and the app, all controlled with your cell phone!
     I would definitely recommend the Ring Floodlight Cam.  I bought two of them and couldn't be happier.  It only took one incident, and the whole system would have paid for itself!",Great camera with many Awesome features!

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 May 2020,MikeW,"I'm a fan of the Ring Floodlight Cam. I've installed seven across two homes, and I've found them to be reliable and extremely easy to install. Having said that, it's time for Ring to refresh this product. The current design is several years old, and I'd like to think that a more modern and capable product is in the pipeline. The camera unit/motion sensor is quite bulky and is starting to show its age. (I'm guessing that the lack of a big-name competing product has Ring resting on its laurels a bit with this particular device).
The lighting is sufficiently bright. The accompanying app is ok, but not quite as user-friendly as it could be. 
Bottom line: it's not the best security camera, and it's not the best floodlight, but it is the best combination camera/light product available.","Good smart home addition, but time for a refresh"

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Aug 2020,Kyle,"I bought this during a promotion w/ an included Echo dot, expecting pretty tight Alexa integration.  There is some, but not the basic stuff you would expect, and contacting Ring suggests no interest in correcting these issues (there is a reddit thread about the fact one can't ask Alexa to turn the lights on and off from 3yo IIRC in which a Ring representative suggested upcoming improvements that have not occurred).

You can:
Ask your FireTV remote to ""show the back yard"" and see the video feed on that device.

You can't:
Ask the Alexa app on your phone/tablet to show the back yard on the fire tv.
Ask alexa to turn on/off the lights (as it the Alexa skills seem to be oriented around this one being a camera vs. a light - I think the lights w/o cams might not have this issue).
Ask Alexa to change the mode.

The good news is this is a software issue that Ring could correct, but there isn't any indication that they ever will.

The instructions want you to mount this on a wall, but I was able to mount it on an eve by loosening the lights sufficiently and rotating them, albeit a bit fiddly to do that.

The setup was kind of cool apart from these quirks once it was installed.  The thing talks to you and has lights that flash to indicate status and the companion app walks you through that process.",Alexa interoperability needs some work

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,GroovyMan,"This was my first Ring camera - I now have two.  I originally connected with 5G, but after having internet connectivity issues I called the company and we deduced that 5G signals do not move well through stucco siding - which I have.  So switched to 2.4G, little better but still could not view front door on my phone, so had to call internet company and buy a whole new router that allowed me up to the fastest internet speed they have.  It is better, but still takes a while to load video while I am away at work, but it still records and saves so I can view at home at have a record of what happened.  Caught the neighbor kids damaging my back yard and trying to hide from it.  I have 80 mbps now, a new phone, the best router from the phone company, and I would still consider having at least 1 Gig coming to your house or faster for this to work like it shows in the advertisement where it just instantly shows the video on your phone.  It gives me the alerts, records and saves the video, but takes about 20 seconds to load on my phone.  BTW, my new phone is a One+ from T-mobile, 128 Gig (not even 20% of it is used), and an unlimited plan.  I'll keep it - obviously I purchased it a year ago, and have since added one more to my backyard - I just want buyers to be aware of what they'll need connection wise.  I also have the Chime adapter to help boost the signal for both devices, but it also gives the audible door bell sound when you are at home and someone comes to the door - so that feature alone is helpful.",Good camera after fixing Internet

If you have an existing flood light with a circular box, this install is very easy.  I have 4 Ring devices and they have all set up very easily.  This was no exception.  The motion detection actually goes further than the specified zone in the app so just be aware of that when setting up the motion zone in the app.  If it weren’t for the under mounting issue I would have given this 4 stars.",Good Camera

For some reason my driveway and front stairs are frequently used as a hangout spot for the neighborhood drunks and drug addicts.  With my new floodlight cam I get instant alerts. I’m  able to communicate through the built-in speaker to get them to move on.  If they refuse, I can activate the built-in siren! It is super loud and 9 times out of 10 they will scatter!!

The LED spotlights not only light up the night, but they are motion sensitive and can record whatever sets them off. They have a two way speaker that allows you to communicate with anyone in the nearby vicinity and an audible alarm that can be set off remotely. The wide angle of the camera can cover most of my large back yard.

They need to be plugged into your home electrical system through an existing outdoor lamp fixture etc. Geek Squad helps a lot with the installation. The picture is clear and the floodlight casts a wide and bright light that will get the attention of anyone (be sure not to point to close to your neighbor's home). The picture is clear and the night vision is almost perfect. Insure good connectivity with your wifi via a chime pro or a wifi extender.

however, ring still have a lot of work to do. i don't claim to be an expert, but i have no trouble with most related products. i would say i am above average tech savvy at least. 

i have a doorbell, a chime pro, and this floodlight. they all installed and worked fast and easy. but for some reason, ring was seeing my floodlight as a different address than my doorbell. when they are clearly 10 feet apart on my house. it took ages and a ton of frustrating time to get it sorted, and its still a big problem in that, if you ever go through setup to correct address or connection, it gets crazy and wont see your internet, the tech was very nice, and she agreed that it has a ton of problems. their website also has a lot of room for improvement. and it takes a lot longer than it should to get help. probably because its a popular item. 

i would give the product 5/5 . but ring service still needs work. i an hopeful that it will get better. just be ready for a long wait and a lot of time on the phone doing exactly what the tech tells you, and it still not working. then come back 2 hours later and it works. that type of stuff. they are making a fortune on these things, they need to ramp up their support numbers and put real effort into working out the service hiccups.",great picture.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,foundawall,"I LOVE the clarity of the camera, however, it's downfall is in its sensitivity settings and weather resistance. There's nothing between the lowest and first sensitivity setting, which is where I think it would probably be excellent for my needs. There's ONLY 4 sensitivity settings, and even then it can be hyper sensitive. It's got some weather drawbacks, according to the customer service representative, it isn't designed for bad weather (like a heavy rain). Well, the TV commercial and packaging shows it mounted in a non weather protected location, and yet it's not supposed to get wet. ""Weather resistant"" my foot. Selecting your monitoring zones is a nice feature, but if a large obstacle blocks some of that area, it doesn't effectively sense anyone approaching at the extreme limit of the zone. I would like to see a 3rd light on it as well to cover the wider type of driveways so an overlap of light will fill in the middle darker area if you point the light fixtures too far right and left. Overall, it's acceptable and might need a little patience and fine tuning to satisfy your needs.",Finiky

My only gripe is there is a long lag from opening the app and viewing the video captured by the camera. Same lag for the live feed as well.

Because I have dogs and need light in the backyard for when it’s potty time it was a no-brainer to get these lights. I have an older mesh wireless system and unfortunately the ring cameras I bought don’t have an uninterrupted signal. I am left wondering is it the Ring product or my mesh router. As I see other people’s footage from the neighbors app that allows you to post and see incidents within a 5 Mile radius from other ring users it leads me to believe its more the inherent short coming of wireless products. My other complaint is the motion control for the light. My side light seems to go off all the time with street traffic if I leave it even a quarter range. To get where it doesn’t turn in every other minute I have to take almost to minimum and then sometimes the light doesn’t even go on. The floodlight in the back seems to get trigger by the smallest of things and even there it’s hard to find a happy medium. With the next iteration of cameras I am sure it will be better but for now if you want true uninterrupted security best to look elsewhere.,"Easy to install, inherent problems"

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Supernatfan20,"What I like about the camera is the amount of light, the ease to link to your Ring acct & other Ring devices as well as linking with the Amazon Echo. The sound is clear sending and receiving. I it was very sensitive at first and I had to adjust the settings but that was easy to do. I gave it 4 stars because certain at distances it isn’t very clear. I don’t have a long driveway so that was a little disappointing like the mailman’s face. It was easy to install but can’t be installed on the eaves of my house where my lights were. I had to bring it down to the front wall of the house. It couldn’t be adjusted that way. I hope this changes. I have other flood lights I’d like to replace. Otherwise I am pleased.",Good camera and lighting

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Dec 2019,SeanL,"I installed this camera as a replacement for my front porch lamp. I had to turn the lights straight up because they are beyond bright, so this is probably best used as a flood light/camera for a larger area.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,2,23 Nov 2017,Silentium23,"It's very easy to install that much I can say about the product that is good. The rest goes downhill from there. The video quality is not that great, can't really make out the faces even at closer distances. The alerts don't always come or go to your phone. It records when it wants, and as for recording they want you to pay to keep the recording which kind of defeats the purpose of getting this. I didn't want to pay for ADT or any other security service, but with this it's the same if I have to pay for a service.",Not that great

The 140 degree field of view is good but If it is 180 degree, it would be awesome. The light is bright. No complaints. This camera needs a strong WiFi signal so an WiFi range extender is a must unless and until your router is within 15 feet of the camera. I bought Netgear AC750 WiFi range extender and it does the magic. The Ring App is easy to use. Anyone with basic English knowledge and commonsense can use it. One thing I have to mention here is about the Ring customer service. They respond promptly and address the issues seriously.",Looks good

So far, it has been great as a motion light and I am enjoying the added security of having a camera as well. As it is mounted on my garage, pointing at the drive and side door, it does not get great images of people's faces. It suits my needs and I hope it proves to be durable.

I mounted it on underside not against wall.  While it was possible lights tend to not move and line up as well if it was mounted on wall.  They need to work on desing to more easily accomodate both mounting styles.  Motion detection is very touchy and still playing with that, but this is a great camera for price and DIY'ers.",Great camera and service

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,iJohnny0,"This is an awesome security cam. Video is crisp, motion sensor turns on lights and camera quickly. The main flaw with this security camera is that if you have to mount it to where an existing flood light is with a pre-installed junction box that is located in the overhang, the camera is going to point straight down. It is literally mounted on your ceiling, pointed straight to the ground. It does not say anywhere in the packaging that it is designed for wall mount only.",Cannot be mounted on ceiling

Now the required minimum download & upload WiFi speeds for the camera e to function as designed is 2 MB per second. 
Now Personally, I recommend no less than 3 MBPS just so you can avoid any connection issues.

Our mounting location is less than ideal but the camera can still see most of the back yard. As with the doorbell, it takes a little bit of adjusting to minimize false alarms. Pro tip: leave the lights on motion detection rather than on for a timed interval if you don’t want a 3a.m. Wake up alert caused by a bug, attracted by the light, crawling down the camera lens. :)",Works well

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Dec 2019,AllenB,"I currently have an Amcrest hardwired camera system, no notifications, no sound, basically just records onto a dvr and I can view them on my phone. I paid $469 about 4 years ago.

I just purchased the floodlight camera (black Friday sale price $199, reg price $249) as well as 2 other ring cameras , so far I'm thrilled night vision, sound and notifications which can be set to whatever ringtone I choose. Love that it's recording into the cloud instead of onto a dvr that can be snatched. I'm still a little disappointed that I can't read a tag from 75 feet, I would have given 5 stars if the resolution was higher. I can define areas to block out, like my yard flag that was causing constant notifications, it also backs up the video about 5-10 seconds after it's motion triggered which let's me see exactly what triggered it.

The motion works well, but does have some trouble with motion coming directly to the light. Sideways movement is captured immediately. The switch does need to stay on, so I ordered some nice switch protectors. Setup in the Ring application was just as easy as their doorbells.

The reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because after 30 days you HAVE to pay for membership or you won’t be able to see any previous recording. You will only be able to live stream. If something happened and you’re not near your phone, you won’t be able to see it at a later time because you don’t have a subscription.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,JRC23,This Ring Floodlight Cam is a great product and easy to install. The range that the camera can view is great. The only downfall is that I was installing under my soffit and when it makes the viewing angle to high. I was able to easily adjust this by angling the base in the front which angled the camera lower to get the view I wanted to. I wish nest had a kit you could purchase to angle it if you are hanging it underneath a soffit. Otherwise I would have gave it a 5 star review.,Great Product

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,AbuAmiri,"Purchased this camera from my local Best Buy and installed it the same day. Installation is straightforward with only three wires involved. Following installation, camera went into setup mode but would not connect with my home Wifi network. Eventually it stopped going into setup mode, and the floodlights would turn on but not turn off. After a week of futility, I picked up a second unit from my local Costco and installed that one, which worked perfectly. Could be just a glitch in the matrix, but took two attempts to get it right. That said, the working unit works as advertised. If you're familiar with Ring's products, this is no different. Powered units appear to retain a better connection to Wifi and the Floodlight Cam is no different. 3 stars only because the first unit did not work.

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,Unimpressed,"So after reading reviews and watching some videos I decided to purchase the floodlight camera. I was impressed with the packaging and the equipment. Instructions were good. Installation wasn't hard. I followed directions for setting it up. Here's where trouble began. It worked as expected once or twice. The problem is when I go to ""live view"" or to answer an alert, I get a spinning blue circle and then a message the phone is having trouble connecting. So I can't see or communicate with someone at the door. This defeats the purpose of having this product. I bought this on Black Friday. I've interacted a few times to resolve this with ring. Last week ring finally suggested either the camera is bad or the router firewall is blocking the camera access. So I disabled my router firewall. I can live view and respond to alerts. I enabled my firewall again and the problem returned. So, diagnosis is firewall issue. I now have to figure out how to allow the camera to be used with the firewall enabled. I'm giving it a two (2) star ""fair"" rating. Customer service is ok, equipment is ok, the issue is, set up and troubleshooting isn't as easy as they claim. It definitely requires some tech savvy. I'll update if I ever get it to work as intended.",Disappointing experience

Ring - Floodlight Cam - White,1,1,23 Nov 2018,ccsoccer03,"I consider myself extremely savy at installing smart products. I've beta tested products even before they hit the market. I know that this experience won't be everyone's experience but it is mine.

To start off, the mounting bracket is not ideal in that it frankly doesn't have enough holes to mount to my electrical box (small 1 gang box mounted sideways), so I had to somewhat rig that to hold it steady.
Setup started off well all up to the point of Wifi Connection during the setup process.
After attempting setup 20 times or so (including even setting up my phone as a hotspot) I've called ring support. They've given me one more thing to try when I get home, otherwise, its going back.

With that said, I'm not saying its a bad product, but there must be some type of firmware issue or this is literally just a bad one. Not a great first experience and nothing like my experience with the Gen 1 Ring Door bell.","Great Potential, Horrific Setup Process"
