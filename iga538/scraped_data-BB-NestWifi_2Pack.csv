Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,OldGoat,It works better than I expected. I live in an 1800 sq. ft. house with the modem in an 1800 sq.ft. basement. I had been using an extender to reach the main level and was receiving 1/4 the download speed on the main floor. I set up (very easily especially for an 80 year old) the nest wifi system and now receive approximately 70% of the download speed on the main level.

His recommendation was the one I purchased. Only complaint is that the system did not accept certain characters in my Wifi name which I had to change which required I change the Wifi name in all of the devices on the network (phones, computers,  security system, thermostats, etc..",Excellent system
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Sharon,"I love the Google Nest Wifi Mesh System.  This is the second one that I bought.  I set one up in my house because I started working from home and my ""office"" was far away from my cable modem/router so I had a really weak signal and could barely connect to the Internet.  I bought the Google Nest Wifi Mesh on a recommendation from a friend. It was easy to set up and now my Internet connection in my office is great. I actually went from a 10 Mbps download speed to 88 Mbps. Best of all, it tells jokes.

I bought this second one to set up at a friends house because they were holding Zoom classes and their Internet kept freezing. After I installed the Google Nest, no more freezing.","Works great, easy to set up"
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Davidson,"I updated my google wifi to nest wifi in hopes of getting some signal in my garage and driveway. Not only do I get a signal out there now, the nest point dubs as a speaker.",So far so good

Installing this has definitely help boost our speed from 7 mbps to around 140-160. Well shy of the gig we are supposed to get, but at least our zoom calls work now!

Pro-tip - we have Spectrum and the way their modems are configured, they are always looking for their WiFi router. We had spotty results at first, but the technician explained that we should have plugged the nest into the WiFi router, not into the modem. That will help increase your speeds if you find you have issues after installing this directly to the modem.",Works great looks great
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2018,IslandTosh,"Setup was very simple, and WiFi coverage is much better than my previous setup (Router + Extender).  Much easier when everything uses the same network.  I'm used to administering my network, so the simplified interface takes some getting used to, but the time savings is appreciated.  That said, if I insisted on having more control over the Routing functions I'd probably look elsewhere.  As it is, I'm happy with the product so far (about 3 months in.) 

Oh, and having the access point also function as a smart speaker is one of the features my family loves about this item.",Working great so far.
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,20 Nov 2020,LaurieEP,"After downloading the Google Home app on your phone, it just walks you through easy, quick installation. The Google WiFi app offers more control and monitoring settings, but technically not necessary, just nice if you want more detail about your network. The mesh network was a huge improvement from our old system. We don’t use the Google Assistant feature, but it’s there for those that like it. Definitely would recommend this product.",Easy set up
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,XenoWolf,"We recently replaced our ISP-supplied wireless network with the Google Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh Router and Point to cover our house better as we prepared for at-home remote school. Prior to the installation, most of the rooms in the house struggled to keep up with the demands of video calls, despite ample upstream bandwidth. 
I replaced the network mid-day, and while one of the kids in a problematic area was on a live call. I added the Google Nest Router and Point as a new network while the ISP router continued serving wireless on the old SSID. I switched from one network to another on his Chromebook while he was on his Zoom call and saw a *massive* increase in the streaming quality instantly. He went from a practical slideshow to a crisp, clean video stream instantly.",Does the trick and does it well
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2019,DThomas,"I bought this to replace the XFi gateway I got from Comcast. We were experiencing wifi dead spots around the house, and it all got worse with several Zoom meetings going on in parallel with shelter in place. This was super simple to set up, and I can report that we now have super-strong signal throughout the entire house (about 2700 sq ft) including the downstairs, garage and backyard. This was a great purchase and completely solved my wifi problems.",Great upgrade from XFi

We originally bought it for its primary use as a router, and man! did it really improve our signal in a 2600 square-foot house. We decided to place it inside of her office in the front of the house, and reap the benefits even in the back of the house and upstairs. It’s small, compact, sleek, and easy to use. Just get it!",Great router!
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Aristides,"This is my second pair. Got it for mom. She's extremely happy as this handles internet speed like no other. She had the apple airport antenna and her speeds were lagging. With this, her speed quadruppled right away. If you have long spaces, I recommend you get several, as the coverage in length is not that great. I can get reasonable bars up to about 80 feet, from there on, you'd need another access point. Deffinately  worth the purchase",Love the internet upgrade
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Rheezrluv,"Amazing product! Works wonderfully. We went through 3 different routers trying to find one that would allow our internet to reach our back house and this is the only one that worked! Wireless extenders never helped boost the signal either. This router reaches every area of the house, the front yard, backyard, and backhouse. The signal never drops and stays strong throughout our 1200 sq ft property. Another perk is that the google assistant comes with it.",Love it!
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Anon,When we moved into an older home that is a similar size to our former even though we still use the same internet provider and  have the same plan we could no longer receive signal throughout our entire home. In our back rooms signal strength was always great but in our living room it would always cut out. We've had the nest router system for about 8 months and haven't a problem since.,Works like a charm
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Nov 2019,KNix,"Although it didn’t work for me and my situation, I’d still give this product 4 stars because it was super simple to set up, I was able to connect and it gave pretty decent service. I’m in a very rural area where many WiFi service providers don’t cover so I was looking for this to boost my WiFi to a level where I could qualify to work from home. It did give me a little boost just not enough. If you are near a major city where service isn’t so spotty, I feel that this could work very well!","Great for cities, maybe not for rural areas"
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Dec 2019,Wolfendoc,"The Nest WiFi mesh system by Google is really cool!  It delivers a strong, fast WiFi signal with devices that are VERY low profile.  Unless you knew where I placed mine, you'd never even notice them in the house.  The set-up was really easy and the app guided me through along the way.  It took about 5 minutes (each node) to set up everything.  The connection is maintained well and all of my devices, even older ones, connect without problem.  I get full signal throughout my entire 1600 sq. ft. home without any glitches or slowing.

My only complaint is the price.  $250 is steep, but worth it, if you can or want to afford it.  My only hope is that Google drops the price on the individual nodes sometime in the near future so I can extend my range even further ( like to my pool).","Awesome, fast coverage...big $$"

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jun 2020,BVGIOCX,"Our service provider gave us a modem/router combo and our wifi speeds were terrible the fastest speed we were able to achieve consistently was 25mb/s while a wired connection was able to achieve 260mb/s. I purchased this system and after setting up via wifi we can now achieve the same speeds as a wired connection wirelessly. I would recommend this if you don't need a modem but your wireless speeds are terrible, to check if your router is limiting your speeds just do a network speed test on a device using wifi and another that is using a wired connection to the modem. If the connection speeds differ greatly then your router is most likely the issue.",Does a Great Job
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Davidski,"After contemplating so much and after hearing my friend bad experience on this product, I finally decided and bought this product two weeks ago and test it out myself. My old Netgear Nighthawk router caused me so much headaches (intermittent disconnection) aside from limiting the actual speed of my internet for some reason. Though it took me a while to initially setup the google nest, so far it works perfectly with the current download speed beyond what I have paid for from my provider. My kids love the voice interaction from the nest point. I will report back in a month or two to give you the latest status. Thanks.",Solid Product

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,TechFam,"I bought this because it seemed like I could use it be used to extend my google mesh. At first, when I opened I was nervous because one of them was clearly designed to be plugged in and one was designed as an extra point. It took a bit of time for me to figure it out, but I got the router to act as a point. I had to use the google home app and not the google wifi app (the app that i used with my old google mesh), I had to follow a lot of steps, but I was able to drastically increase the internet speed in the far corner of my house.",Two extra points for my old google mesh

They had to add the router to their inventory, whatever that means. The only other problem was the app showed the router to be offline but I was still getting internet. I unplugged the router and my ISP's connection, let it sit for about 30 minutes and reconnected everything. Worked like a charm since then.",Awesome Router

It was intended to replace the router function of the AT&T Arris gateway (modem/router). The Nest base would work but the extender couldn’t get a good signal, even right next to the base unit. Google tech support was very helpful on the phone but could not get it to work, deciding that the gateway needed to be put in bridge mode. I tried several methods found on the internet, followed by AT&T tech support (as usual, unhelpful), and gave up after spending about 9 hours on it. It seems to be well made, and is attractive, though. I think it would be good for users who don’t have to deal with AT&T’s gateway.",Hard to say

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Mattieus,"I have slowly brought more and more google smart home products into our home within recent years. They have all performed what I have asked them to well. I have started to notice that my old Asus RT-N66U was struggling to keep up with all of the wifi devices I had connected. Between my wife's laptop, our multiple smart tvs, the doorbell cameras and my son's tablet/switch, it would chug at times and reset. For six years that little router did his best. 

I was looking at mesh systems and the google wifi kept coming up as a nice option. I kept biding my time trying to limp the router along. Finally I retired the poor thing and picked up the Nest Wifi 2 pack. I have a ~2500 sq ft brick ranch home with a basement, and this seemed perfect. I was right. I have always setup my own routers and tweaked a lot of the settings. You cannot really do that with this router. That is ok for me, but might frustrate some who have specialized needs. Then again, if that is something you are looking for I bet you are not considering this.  

Anyway, setup was a breeze. Connect 3 cables, use the Google Home app to set it all up. Then take the point, set it somewhere out in the open and do the setup of that. The point is not only a part of the mesh system but also a google home speaker as well. Keep in mind that the base router unit is not a speaker however. 

The only bad thing I have found with this particular router is that it only has 1 ethernet out of the router and zero of them on the point. It works for me as it sits next to my gaming desktop with the modem and that is hardwired. The rest of the networking is wireless. 

Overall I am very happy. 
TL;DR: Great mesh system, ~10 install, simple router interface, single ethernet out, do recommend.",Great Mesh Wifi System

This was a big deal for me because I have cameras set out outside and previous routers I’ve used were not able to reach that far. Setup was very easy as well. The only con I can think of is there is only 1 Ethernet port, so if you need more than that you’re going to need an adapter if your modem doesn’t have additional ports. Other than that it’s perfect!",Excellent Overall Mesh System

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jul 2020,SteveL,"Bottom Line: the Google Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System will improve your connection stability and speed over an equivalent single point router.

Pros: easy setup, built-in Google Voice on point, reliable and fast WiFi signal

Cons: dual-band even though competitor products offer tri-band

Review: I had been using a single point AC router for years, which provided good service to my 1300 square foot town home. However, with all the video conferencing with the stay-at-home orders, I was constantly seeing connection issues (dropped audio/video) on Zoom. I tried moving the single point router closer to my home office but to no avail.

After doing some research, I settled on the Google Nest AC2200 Mesh System, since it seemed like a good balance between price and performance. Set up was simple with the Google Home app, and I had the network up and running in about fifteen minutes out of the box. The point has Google Voice built in, although, I tend not to use it that much given the other voice assistants we have in the house.

I have the point setup in my home office with the main router across the house. Since I've setup the network, I haven't had any drops or connection issues on Zoom, so I'm highly satisfied with the stability and speed of the connection. It also extends the WiFi signal further into my yard with the point, which is a plus.

My only criticism is that this system only offers dual band signals, whereas many of its competitor products offered tri-band. I haven't had any issues, though, with network congestion where I live.",Big improvement over a single point router
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Jun 2020,JoeB,"It just works...well usually!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,3,23 Sep 2020,JohnnyBFree,"I picked this up from Best Buy after doing a lot of research online and watching video after video on YouTube. Where this Google Nest Wifi does have a lot of good, it definitely has a lot that left me wanting for more.

Pros:
1) I am seeing better internet speeds in my home overall. I pay for 250MB/sec but was only seeing around 3-4 MB/sec in my upstairs office with my old Nighthawk router. With this, I am now seeing speeds reach over 20 MB/sec. It isn't the speed I wanted but I will come back to this later.
2) This design of a router is way more ""aesthetically appealing"" as my wife puts it. She hated looking at the black router we had before with all the different antennas coming out the back and pointing every which way. If someone wasn't actively looking for our router, I don't think they would even notice it was there. It just blends in with the rest of its surroundings.

The middle:
1) Google Voice responds to and picks up our voices a lot better than our Amazon Echo does. We find ourselves having to repeat ourselves a couple times with the Amazon product and, even then, it still doesn't always get what we are asking it to do correctly. Where the Google Assistant is better in this regard, one off putting feature of this is when it comes to the ""mute"" switch that is located on the back of the unit. When you switch Google to ""mute"", a couple things are put in motion. First, there is a yellow ring that is constantly shown on the bottom of the unit. In the light of day, this is barely noticeable; however, when the lights go down, it sticks out like the nightlight you never knew you bought. We have ours mounted on the wall (which is lightly colored) and it casts around a five foot diameter halo on the wall. Someone might love this but we find it distracting when we are trying to power down at the end of the day. Second, the Google Home app, which you have to download in order to get everything to function, starts pushing notifications every time that the ""muted"" device starts picking up someone talking. It pushes to my phone constantly (android) and my wife has less pushes (iPhone) but they are still coming through. Last, if the notifications weren't enough, if you ever use the word ""Google"" in a normal, day to day sentence, the unit will kindly (but annoyingly) remind you that it is in the ""mute"" mode and to switch it back on if you want to use it. 

Cons:
1) As stated before, I am having better speeds than I had before, but I am still left without the internet I wanted. I don't live in a very large home (700 SF each floor). My ""router"" unit is located on the main level on the far side of my house. The ""point"" unit is up in my office, one level up, on the other side of the house. With this, they still talk to each other and I am still getting 20 or so MB/sec; however, that is all. No matter how I position them in different rooms, walls, etc, they will not pump out anything higher than 20 or so MB/sec. The only place I was actually able to get them to produce faster results was when I put the router at the bottom of the stairs on an overturned laundry basket and the point on another basket on the top of the stairs. Only then did they get up around 50-75 MB/sec. 
2) One thing that completely boggles my mind is that the ""points"" with this system do not have their own Ethernet connection slot. The router unit does have two connection ports, one for the ethernet from the wall and one to another close device. If your computer or device that needs a direct, wired connection is in close proximity to the router, you're golden. If it is somewhere close to the ""point"", you're out of luck.
3) The google ""customer support"" (or ""lack of support"") wasn't very helpful when I called to discuss my connection issues. The only thing they seemed to be able to think of was ""buy another point"". ""Buy another point"" and put it directly above your router on the floor above and then it won't have issues communicating with the point in your office. ""Buy another point"" and put it directly under your office on the same floor as the router and you'll be fine. I understand that they would suggest this in order to shorten the connection distance but the thing is that I moved my point throughout the entire upstairs (directly over the router, directly under the computer, in between the router and the computer, etc.) and nothing seemed to help until the units were in direct, unobstructed sight of each other. I get it, buying another point might help spread the coverage better but when you advertise on your direct website that a router and and point will cover a home 3800 SF and I am having issues covering a house with less than 1400 SF, I have serious trust issues when it comes to your ""customer support"" telling me to just shell out another $150 for another point (which then should put me up over 5400 SF according to the all-trustworthy website) that doesn't seem like it would help anymore that what I already have to deal with. 

Overall, I would probably not purchase this again and would most likely shell out for something like Orbi but it gets the job done for now. We'll probably keep it for a couple years but will definitely be looking to upgrade at that point to another system.",It's good but leaves a lot to be desired

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Apr 2020,Truck,"For the past few years we've been AT&T Fiber subscribers and used AT&T's bundled modem/router. It seemed to work okay, but WiFi was always flaky at the opposite end of the house and the speeds never quite matched up with what we were paying for. I know WiFi is typically going to be slower, but I didn't feel like it had the total throughput to satisfy all our devices - streaming boxes, PC's, etc. The network would bog down, and we had 300 Mbps service at the time.

Finally we cancelled U-verse TV (which ran through the modem/router) and upgraded to Gigabit Fiber, which opened the opportunity for us to use a separate router. Within 5 minutes of unboxing this thing, I had a perfectly usable and fast connection all over my property. Only hassle was figuring out how to disable the router of my AT&T box so the Google WiFi got the public IP - a quick Google search and I was on my way. 5 minutes total from unboxing to fast WiFi all over the home. It probably would have worked fine had I left it as a cascaded router, but do it right if you're going to do it at all.

It doesn't bog down with multiple streaming boxes or PC's going. During the current pandemic, we've got multiple TV's streaming and laptops working from home pretty much all day. Wireless printers printing. WiFi speakers streaming radio. Even 4K streaming movies on our living room TV. All wireless, no sweat.

Only downside - there's only one downlink ethernet port. For us it's no biggie, the WiFi is great but eventually if I want to add more wired devices, no big deal to hook a relatively cheap Gigabit switch to that port and add pretty much as many devices as I want.

The mesh repeater is also a Google Home smart speaker, but there's a switch on the back of it to disable that functionality which we have done. It only needs power - it meshes wirelessly with the main hub. Simple to set up, you do it on your phone in 5 minutes. If I can do it, you can do it.

You can get cheaper WiFi routers, there's no doubt about that. But if you're like me, you're okay with paying a reasonable premium for a better experience. I wouldn't spend twice this price on a router, but this unit is a good choice I think.",Reliable WiFi for the whole house.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,2,17 Nov 2020,LSUTigers2019NC,If you know nothing about Networking or Routers this is a great router for you. If you have a basic understanding of network setup or Router configuration do not buy this router. You can only setup and edit through a phone app. There is NO GUI or Browser based management of this router. You cant even connect to it if there is no internet to make any edits or run diagnostics. So it only works if you have an internet connection that is working. To me that makes zero sense. I understand they want to make it simple but anyone born after 1970 will find this router extremely frustrating if you wish to modify its settings.,Great for novice - terrible for anyone else.

My experience wasn't great. Initial setup was simple and worked perfectly fine out of the box. Everything stopped working after it's initial software update and a factory reset was all I could do to bring it back to life. It worked great after that until some internet problems I ran into weeks later. When internet connectivity drops, I'm not able to use the app to manage the devices. The only insight provided is a flashing yellow light on the unit. I got out my old wireless router and the internet started working again.

Google phone support doesn't exist during the pandemic, so I didn't press this any further. Maybe it was a defective unit but this was anything but simple and straightforward for me.",A good Wi-Fi solution for most

This setup required some advanced tweaking in comparison to the Google Mesh setup. And in comparison, the Google Nest Wifi setup was easier to setup and the speed across devices is also much faster regardless of the range. 

The access point comes with Google Assistant built in so that's a huge plus if you are trying to setup smart speakers throughout your house. I have my Alexa devices connected to my point via Bluetooth so I can play music in all my devices including Alexa devices.

The Google WiFi app is fast and responsive as well and you can use that to manage all your WiFi settings. I have the Router connected to my Xfinity Xfi Gateway and my internet speed isn't throttled--i get 600-800 Mbps in my wireless devices even if its connected to the AP wifi.

This nest router pretty much just switched around how well it does in certain rooms. I dont get as much in some bedrooms now.

I've noticed a huge boost in my Wi-Fi speed as well. With all of the work-from-home due to COVID-19, I had so many people on the network, it previously created congestion. No longer. I did have several devices that needed a wired connection (security system, home automation, VOIP phone, etc.) but this device only has one ethernet port.. The way around it is I shut off the Wi-Fi radio in my old router, plugged it into the Nest ethernet port, and was able to use the 4 port switch on my old router for all my wired devices.

For about a month it worked, playing music, telling jokes, controlling devises but then it stopped working.  Whenever you’d ask for something it would instruct you to sign into the Google Home app.  I’ve tried many things but can’t seem to make it work again.  While researching fixes I found that this is a common occurrence and a known problem for google for almost two years.  It’s frustrating that this hasn’t been rectified after such a long time.

Set up Nest WiFi, and I now have a strong, fast connection in every corner of my apartment.  

Setup had some hiccups though, but I blame it on Comcast/Xfinity.  During setup, the device couldn't get a solid connection to the internet.  Unplugging and plugging my modem back in fixed the issue.  Outside of the issue, setting up the network was as simple as download the Google Home app, plug stuff in, and follow the prompts on screen.

This thing does not keep your devices connected to wifi, it’s constantly dropping different devices. It claims to be able to have several devices connected at once but it really couldn’t handle more than 5-10 at a time. I spent countless hours chatting with google support to change settings on the device itself as well as other devices connected to it but nothing worked and now it’s too late to return it.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jun 2020,bbison,"My Apple Time Capsule WiFi router was starting to get long in the tooth, and the connection reliability was becoming intermittent and spotty with every device I added to my network.  I opted for a new standalone WiFi router, and initially purchased a mid-range Netgear Nighthawk RAX WiFi 6 router. That was a huge mistake! After several weeks of reoccurring disconnects and firmware issues, and merry-go-round customer service troubleshooting, I returned it, and instead went with the Google Nest Mesh system with main router and one point.  This has been by far the fastest and most dependable home WiFi network I've ever used! Initial setup was super simple and intuitive, using the Google home app, and I was up and running in about 5 minutes (after placing my router and point, network configuration and firmware updates).  In nearly three months of use, I haven't had to restart the system, nor reconfigure any of my settings; it's a pretty much setup and forget type of router.  The router and point have been more than sufficient in providing high speed whole home coverage (approx. 2200 sq ft) to over 50 smart home devices, 4 smart TVs and multiple streaming boxes (daily streaming 4k HDR and Dolby Vision content) and several laptops and phones in my home, without any stuttering.  It would be cool if this was a WiFi 6 router, since thats all the hype right now in home networking. But, since I only have several AX WiFi capable devices in my home anyway, AC WiFi with the Nest mesh has been more than sufficient for my needs.",Solid and Reliable Mesh Network

The app is easy enough to use and the features are easy enough to access - device priority, family wifi, etc. The only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars is that it lacks the ability to add timers to devices -eg. the xbox loses access after 5 hours. It allows me to set up on and off times, but the timer would be better.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,2,23 Jan 2020,Leigh,"I combined this purchase with a Netgear modem, since I realized my internet was performing super slowly -- lagging, cycling, etc. Then I remembered that my equipment was several years old.  Since I have about 15 devices online regularly (cell phones, laptops, Smart TVs, etc.), decided to upgrade my set-up. 

I went ahead and splurged on these....But aren't these little nestie things so cute though?  I love the small footprint!  Thought this would be a perfect solution for my 1,200 sq. ft. single story apt. Initially, the set-up and connection process was really seamless.  

The nightmare came when I tried to hook my Ooma Telo to it.  The Telo would not get back online at all.  I literally wasted like five hours on the phone with Ooma tech support, Spectrum, etc.  No one could help me.  

It wasn't the firewall, either. The Ooma just wouldn't connect to the internet.  Since there is only one ethernet port on the Nest, there was no other wiring option that I could figure out -- nor could Ooma tech support! 

Since I LOVE my Ooma and am not giving up my $5.00 a month home phone bill for any cute Nest, I took this back to BestBuy and returned it. 

Solution:  Exchanged it and bought a Netgear Orbi (the pack with the router + two receivers - 6,000 sq feet coverage).  It has multiple ports on the back....just what I needed to get my Ooma back on track! 

Had the Orbi router and two points + Ooma all set up and running in less than 15 minutes -- BAM! 

As a side note, although expensive, the modem + router upgrade was totally worth it. My internet is fire now!!! :-) 

Although cute, not worth it for the money or the aggravation.",Small and cute but not for apt living or Ooma Tel

The second point has a google speaker built in so a win win with this product. Got for $200 in April 2020. Also let’s you have granular control over which devices can access WiFi.

This is unacceptable as I work from home and am constantly in meetings.  I wanted something that I could easily deploy without too much pain.  Installing Nest Wifi was a breeze.  I was up and running a few minutes after unboxing it.  I have around 30 devices, most connected 24x7, multiple HD/4k streaming wifi cameras, and several power users.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 May 2020,Seanqu,The Google Nest Router solved our spotty internet signal in our home.  The remote point improved internet access on both the upper floor and the far corner away from the main router location.  We are so dependent on wifi in our rural community that this solution was a lifesaver.  It was easy to set up except the need for a good phone signal during set-up.  Our location required going outside for the phone signal to complete set up.  Once done this solution has been wonderful.,Google Nest Excellent Router

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,mrkato,"I have been a used of Google Wifi for the past 3 years and have been more than satisfied with it. I was starting to get some slow areas in my new house at times so I thought why not upgrade. I have a new ranch home that is about 2300sq. ft with the garage. Some of the things I really liked about the Nest Wifi over the Google Wif are as follows: Look is much sleeker and fits in better with our decor. Google Assistant built into the Wifi point. Ability to consolidate Google Wifi and Google Home app. together. Able to add Google Wifi points to Nest system. (I now have 4 wifi points in my 2300 sq. ft., probably overkill) Ease of setup. It probably took me 20 minutes to set up the system. It took about another 30 minutes to add my old wifi points to the system.
I just ran a speed test and my 400mbps Spectrum internet is currently at 435mbps download and 19.3mbps upload so it is blazing fast. You can also ask the Assistant in the wifi point to run a speed test and it will repeat te readings back to you. If you have not used the Google Home app it is very intuitive and easy to use but you may have to dig down into some menus to find what you need. The ability to set up schedules for certain devices works well and I could turn off my Grandson's X-Box from Florida when he was in Wisconsin watching our house. The only drawback that I have found is the wifi point with Google Assistant built in did not seem to be hearing us very well when I had it in the area below a shelf in our tv console. As soon as I moved it out in the open more it works great. I am very satisfied with this system and highly recommend it to anyone unless you want to go in a tweak a bunch of settings which this does not allow.",Many great improvements over Google Wifi

However, they are no longer interchangable (one has to be the router, and the other has to be the extension).

My wife came across Google's mesh wireless. I'd heard of it, but didn't understand it was a router alternative. We love in a 2-level townhouse, and while the one router downstairs had always been mostly sufficient, I always thought our speed would be a bit better upstairs if we had some kind of repeater. 

We love the mesh setup. We're very much Google devotees, and the way Google WiFi integrates with Home and gives us options like device prioritization is great. We love the bonus that the Point unit doubles as another Google Home speaker.

But overall it is very easy to setup and performance seems very good. Coverage is good.  Having both the router and point allow me to cover a hard to reach bedroom.

My home is a brick 3,500 sq' two story with a large attic. It is also foamed for insulation. Initially, I had considered getting the router and two points but ultimately decided to get the router and single point. I put the router central in the attic and the point down stairs in the living room with our TV and such. With that, I have complete coverage even in my shop which is about 30' away from the router. That shop is also bricked and foamed. I have a Blink home security system which was performing poorly with my old router and in part why I purchased the Nest system. It  was greatly enhanced with the Nest system. The set up was super easy, can't imagine anyone having issue with it. The app is awesome and I can do everything on my phone.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Jun 2020,SetterDad,"I spent weeks researching different routers and mesh options, and after multiple forums which rated this pretty highly I decided to go with the Google Nest. I needed up upgrade from the router I had been using because it couldn’t keep up with the increased demand with my partner doing ZOOM calls for class on top of my already pretty bandwidth heavy work. 

While I don’t need an additional access point at this time, I did like that you have the option to purchase the 1st gen version as additional access points for a cheaper cost without compromising the quality of the network. 

I set the mesh network up in a matter of minutes, and it was honestly the easiest WiFi network setup I’ve had in my adult life. The Google Home app makes it very easy to manage, and the simplicity honestly surprised me. 

I was surprised to learn that the second access point doubles as a Google Home Mini, which either wasn’t clear in the description or I just overlooked it entirely. Either way, a nice feature I wasn’t expecting. 

The turnaround time for delivery was very quick. A few days after I purchased it, it actually went on sale and Best Buy was very gracious to refund the difference which was appreciated.",Easy to Set Up!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,3,23 Dec 2019,Aterry,"We seem to have bad luck with routers. We have enjoyed the Google-Nest Wifi. It has provided great wifi for devices that we are able to connect. I would give this device a 5 star if it allowed an option to switch to the 2.4GHz instead of just allowing the device to decide what is best. Since we are not able to get our phones connected to the 2.4GHz, we are not able to set up several smart home devices as they will only complete the set up on 2.4. The router will not allow for a manual change from 5 to 2.4.

Pros: Router is small. The wifi point is much like the Google Home or Alexa in addition to providing better wifi coverage. Set up was easy on the App.

Cons: Unable to manual connect to 2.4 to allow for smart home device set up. Wifi doesn't show if it is connected to the 2.4 or 5.",Great as long as you don't need to access 2.4GHz

I researched options to try to fix this issue, and I decided to give Google Nest a try. It is a little pricier than other options, but I am SO happy I chose it! Our WiFi went from being extremely slow (less than 5mbps download speed in some rooms) to being extremely fast throughout the home (on average now we get about 500mbps download speed!). We do have a smaller home (about 1100 sqft),. so you may have to get additional points if you have a larger home, but this definitely works for us.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Marvin,"Our FIOS router left many dead zones in our old, 1940s house. A neighbor suggested the Google Nest Mesh System as a solution. The house is three levels, about 3200 sqft, with plaster walls, so I assumed we might need the three-pack, but the two-pack has worked great for the six weeks we've had it. Much more reliable connections all over the house. And now I still get wifi on my phone from four houses down the block. Set up was a little trickier than I thought it would be. (There's some useful info to be found with a web search if you're trying to connect the mesh to an existing router, as I did. One key step involved going into your router settings -- info on the side of your existing router -- to turn off the wifi signal from that device. This comment may only prove to a techier person than me that I'm not much of a techie, which is true. But it worked.)",Excellent solution

• Simple, clear setup and administration
• WPA3 support
• App is classic Google design

Bad:

• No web/PC interface; you have to use the app
• Web filtering cannot be customized
• 'Gaming preferred' is really just an advertisement for Stadia. I like Stadia, but it's not my only platform

The Terrible:

• The extender has randomly stopped working on more than one occasion despite the app indicating it has 'good' connection. Multiple devices just stop working randomly even when they show as connected. I expect network equipment to do their basic function at a minimum. Unfortunately Google WiFi (aka Nest WiFi) does not do this.","Good for most, but limited options, and random dro"

Thomas, the so-called expert, was put in charge of setting up the delivery and installation of my purchases. He promised that he had things under control and I didn't need to worry about anything. After noticing that my smart TV installation was scheduled to be delivered to my new home before I closed on it, I tried to contact Thomas. He assured me, again, that things were under control. I also noticed that my Google Wi-Fi system was scheduled to be delivered and installed AFTER the delivery of my smart TV. How are you suppose to work a smart TV without Wi-Fi unless you want to run a cable, which I did NOT want? Long story but the bottom line is that Best Buy as a store is awesome and I love most of the staff there but Thomas is a complete fraud and should NOT be in charge of the In-Home consultation program. Once this nightmare experience is over, I will never again use Best Buy for any in home consultation as long as Thomas is with that program. I had to go to the store to pick up my Wi-Fi system because it was sitting in the warehouse waiting for Thomas to do something with it. The product is great but seeing as how it was suppose to be delivered and installed professionally, I give it a poor rating.","Great Product, Horrible In-Home Consultation"

Anyways, with some deads spots around the house and meh performance from a couple year old LinkSys extenders, I decided to give these a try. 

LOVE IT. Install was easy for the first one, the second one ended up being a pain. Pro Tip - set up the second one close by to your first, then move it out farther to your other rooms. When you try to set it up farther initially, it struggles. Also, it may take several attempts to get the second one going. Don't give up after 1 or 2 tries.",Love these! Boosted my FIOS/Frontier

This Nest Wifi is easy to set up, performs well, and easy to use. This is the best Wifi system I've ever had. I can set up a ""Wifi timeout"" to cut screen time to a specific time for my kids with just a couple of clicks using the App on my phone.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,2,23 Apr 2020,RavenTBK,"Original Netgear R7000 failed after years of faithful but buggy service.  A replacement was needed.  I figured I'd give Nest Wifi a shot, mainly because of all the great reviews.  Setup was a breeze, almost too simple for a tech guy like me.  I wanted more options, but left well enough alone and went along.

Nearing a month later, I've found some incredible shortcomings that make this system not the best.  The first one is power output.  The Nest Router alone provides barely 40% of available coverage of the old R7000.  So you are forced to use the ""point"" to relay signal to areas that previously had it.  The biggest issue with that is that the ""point"" does not function as a mesh relay as originally described, but rather a ""range extender"".  It repeats the 2ghz signal while using 5ghz has its backhaul to the router.  So devices on the outside of the router's available coverage only get 2.4.  The problem with that is I've yet to find a microwave that doesnt leak enough to interfere with 2.4 wifi.  So yeah, each time its fired up, the three televisions that rely on the point go offline.

1.) I wish you could manually remove a device from your list instead of needing that device to forget my network or me changing the password altogether

I've read the threads online and followed suggested fixes. I found many others having the same issues and there is not answer as to why. The Point also doesn't respond to ""Hey Google"" every time.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 Aug 2020,Swada,"After doing my research, I decided to try this Google Mesh wireless. I read many good things about it and although it had some known downsides, I thought i would give it a try. 

Walking into this, I knew that i would get only 1 direct ethernet plug, we use 4 today. I decided to move our storage devices to the cloud to clean that up.

Installation was pretty straight forward, no issues. There's some nice things you can do with grouping devices together if you want to pause the internet. Pretty cool. 

It's only single band, which i didn't realize but no worries. The devices are cool and that was part of the appeal because a router looks horrible in an office. 

The network was running less than 4 hours and it crashed. I was worried because the only way you can restart it is from the app and the app was being odd. Otherwise i would have had to power it off. 

All of what i read ""no spinning"" or waiting for network. Never had this before, but now i was seeing this on our AppleTVs. I looked at QOS and you can't permanently set QOS, it's only for up to 4 hours. what? well, i did that and no improvement. I thought it would improve 'in time' because it is supposed to be self-learning. 

A week later, the network crashed again. That's twice, i'm done. I will put my 5 year old Linksys dual band system back in. One of the antennas is busted and we get perfect performance with it and QOS that i can permanently set. 

I wanted to upgrade given I have a broken antenna, but this won't be it. I really wanted this to work. We have 100MB internet and 20 or so devices, with 2 AppleTVs and 2 gaming computers and 2 productivity (including web conferences) in the house.","Not performing, Crashed 2x"

I still get loading signals and labtop suddenly  disconnects from wifi network.I thought i was actually not going to experience the same quality of signal being that this set costs more than $150. Also, the cameras that i have at home run basically the same way( takes about 4 min) to connect to the network. Idk hopefully this wasnt a waste of money.",It's alright
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and Point (2-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 Sep 2020,Tglane,"TL;DR version: there is a software issue that causes connection instability. Until that’s resolved, and who knows if that’ll ever happen, don’t buy this router.

A couple years ago I started my Nest system with a thermostat. I’ve added several speakers and the doorbell since then and everything ran great. Then, I decided I wanted to make Nest WiFi the backbone of my smart home with the ultimate goal of getting the security system, door locks, and cameras. So, a couple months ago I bought the Nest WiFi when it was on sale. It worked great for a few weeks and then it started inexplicably rebooting itself multiple times throughout the day. Turned out that some of the equipment and cabling outside needed to be replaced, which Spectrum did plus they gave me an updated modem/router. I thought, great, now this router should work just fine. Nope, it still rebooted itself. So, I just had Spectrum turn the WiFi on the router and went with that, which basically meant I’d wasted $200 on the Nest WiFi. Shortly after all this, I lost connection to all my google smart speakers in the home app. They were still connected to the internet because they would respond to me, I just couldn’t go into the app and control them. After much research and reading on message boards, I discovered there’s a compatibility issue with the modem/router that Spectrum gave me and Google devices. The solution was to purchase my own modem (Arris SB8200), which I did. Now I thought, great, I’ll be able to fix the issues with accessing my smart speakers AND I’ll be able to run the Nest WiFi with no more issues. False! The Nest WiFi still is not working properly. The problem has changed slightly, the router isn’t rebooting anymore, but the internet connection is highly unstable. The modem shows I’m connected to the internet, and if I plug directly into it I’m still able to surf the net, but the router itself loses connection. There is a lengthy thread on Google’s WiFi support forum of other people having the same issue. Google hasn’t provided much, if any, support to fix the problem; and the general consensus is that it’s a software issue.

That’s a long story, but at the end of the day, I’m now looking at other mesh systems. I’ll still stick with Google’s smart home system because it’s worked with no problems prior to this episode with the router, but the Nest WiFi is pure junk until Google decides to update the software.",DO NOT BUY!!!

When you’re connected for a little while, you’ll just loose data for no reason. I have factory reset it 4 or 5 times, spoke to online chat and phone support from google and they’re no help. They just continue to try resetting things. When I asked for a new one to be sent in exchange, they wouldn’t do it. Now it’s too late to return to Best Buy. Avoid this router at all cost.
