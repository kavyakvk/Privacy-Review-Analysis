"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2019,Cynthia,"I am very disappointed in the functionality of this product. Having indoor security is a great thing but I do not wanna have to give up all of my privacy to get it. There are plenty of reasons why a person may not want to be recorded inside their home. Currently, you have no options for turning off the cameras from the app. After more than half an hour on the phone with customer support, they made it clear that there was no option for privacy except for physically unplugging the cameras.  This is extremely impractical. My cameras, for instants, are mounted up at the ceiling and need a ladder to access.  I'm sure that I do not need to give you examples of all the reasons that this would be problematic, since I can think of a half dozen off the top of my head. Another possible partial solution would be restricting what information shared users can see. Currently there don't seem to be any options at all about how much someone can see if you share your account with them. If they were option settings for sharing, I could decide how much they see.  But there aren't. I am still deciding if I will be keeping these new cameras or not.",Zero privacy

I am really impressed with this camera, and also own the Echo Show 5.  The wide angle lens covers a lot of my living room.  So happy I can monitor the activities of my 3 cats from the bedroom.  Setup is a breeze if you have owned a Ring device.  I also have the doorbell.  *****  Highly Recommend this item as well as a great price. One thing that is a bit troubling is the volume on the cam does not appear to be adjustable and is rather loud and distorted.  I have a support ticket in with Ring.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Sep 2019,Finkledinkle,"Pros: Cost Daylight video Easy Setup Cons: Hardware that comes with it will not mount into studs (screws too shallow). Power cord is a proprietary micro USB (plug recessed deep on the camera) so unable to use just any micro-usb plug. Night video has issues keeping everything in focus (blurry top of the screen) First and foremost, its a 60 dollar camera.  The least expensive camera Ring has produced.  I have the Doorbell Pro, and the floodlight camera watching the front and back of my house, so was excited to see a cheaper option to put one in my garage. The camera itself is incredibly small, almost the size of the ring doorbell itself.  Setting it up was a breeze if you already have a Ring device.  Took me 15 minutes to get the camera up and running and added to my existing Ring app. The video quality is on par with the other devices in the daylight.  No complaints about that.  The night vision however,  seems like it has some issues.  I've noticed that anything on the top of the screen comes off blurry and out of focus in night vision.  I haven't experienced that with other ring cameras, and may be due to mounting the camera high on the wall and it having an issue keeping everything in focus.  I know they increased the viewing angles on this model, so it may also have to do with that.  Its purely speculation, but it is a 60 dollar camera, so not a deal breaker for me.  Its not like Spiderman will be breaking into my garage. The biggest negative on this device however (and why I took away a star) is the hardware.  The mounting screws are far too shallow to get through drywall and into a stud.  So they include the anchors for drywall, and you will need to mount this into the anchors.  This seems like a huge miss considering most Ring devices account for this and always have included the appropriate hardware. The other negative is the power cord.  Six foot is hardly enough to work with.  With the camera being powered with a micro-usb, if you're thinking ""well just buy a longer usb cord"", that won't work.  The plug in on the back of the camera is far too recessed for anything other than the cord that it comes with.  So unless you're looking to use a typical 120 extension cable, make sure you're planning on mounting this close to the outlet.","Great Camera for the price, if you want it mounted near an outlet"
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Oct 2019,3rd Time is a Charmer,"I needed a cam to see the inside of the house when we are out. Decided to give this one a try since it was meant to be indoors. Pros: - smaller profile (I placed this cam next to the Ring Stickup Battery Cam, and an 8oz bottle of water for comparison) - easy setup (took a total of 2 minutes to get up and running) - two way audio had a delay, but still less than my Arlo cams. Cons: - initial lag. At least on my device, there seems to be about 2 seconds worth of feed that is “fastforwarded” before the stream stabilizes. Not a deal breaker, but the other ring cams I have do not do this. Overall, great product that fulfills a niche purpose. Cheap alternative if you need specifically, an economical indoor cam.",Literally a fraction of the size/cost of its bigger companion!

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Sep 2019,MariaSmiles,"Very easy setup, great image quality (light or dark), great audio quality, nice form-factor, perfect integration with my Ring network. INSTALL: This took about 4 minutes to set-up. That includes opening the box and updating my Ring app. Amazing! This is my 3rd Ring camera (first of this type), and I also have 3 other d-link cameras and 15+ other network-connected smart home devices and this one had been the easiest to set-up, by far! Most have required at least one call to CustSvc at some point in the process (& I'm very familiar with IOT and network installs). I didn't need any of that knowledge with this new Ring device. I'd recommend you install/update your Ring app first, as that was my only hiccup (old versions dont have the new hardware listed). APP: So: install/update Ring app > Open box > remove and unwrap device & plug (usb to 2-prong usb) > plug in to outlet > in the app, tap add device (or devices > add...) > Quick scan of barcode w/phone camera > and viola! you're off to play with some settings and have more convenience/security/peace of mind in your life! In the app, you can adjust motion zones, notification sound/volume, link to other devices, snooze motion, and other functions, as with the other Ring cameras. MOUNT: It can be mounted on a flat shelf surface, on the wall, or on the ceiling. Wall anchors and screws are included. And w/your own philips head screwdriver, the base moves to the back for wall mounting. The base also articulates quite a bit, maintaining stability, and holding its position well. It seems very well thought-out in that regard. USE: I'm using this in an unconventional way. My laundry room isn't easy to get to, so I have the cam pointed at my machines in the hopes of being able to check on loads before stopping what I'm doing and making the trek to a mid-cycle load. (Or for a quick chat with hubby if he's in there). I also plan to position it to capture other utilities, to check on any alarms that might be triggered (fire, smoke, flood...). Here's hoping i never need it for that. (pics to show light & dark quality; no editing or filters. I know I gotta clean up in there 😄) I rely on reviews to help me make informed decisions. I hope this review helped you :)","Very easy set-up, well-designed, great functionality"
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Sep 2019,Tracy,"I love Ring products. They are a great idea and work well. I just received a two pack indoor cameras which arrived promptly but one of the two power supplies was defective. I decided to chat customer support. In my opening chat I gave my name, described the problem, explained what I did to troubleshoot the problem and how I confirmed a dead power supply. The agent didn’t even read it and wasted my time asking questions that were already answered. The support chat took over 20 minutes with long delays between responses and the agent was still not able to confirm shipment of a replacement. It was as if the agent was working several calls and not focused on my chat. Defective product plus poor customer service is a recipe to loose loyal customers.  I was an early adopter of Ring and have many of their products. This experience has given me pause when considering them in the future or recommending Ring to others.",Defective product + bad customer service = loss of loyal customer
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2019,K. Thomas,"We were looking at getting another smart camera to monitor the entryway coming into the house.  So far, I've been impressed.  I've only used 2 smart cameras before.  The first was a Yi camera that we bought from Amazon back in late 2017 for our baby's room.  It was an ""Amazon's Choice"" item and it was about $80 so we bought it, but it was a piece of junk and constantly dropped off the network despite claiming to have a strong signal.  We looked around and decided on a Nest camera for her bedroom.  It has worked flawlessly, but it was $250!  Even though we like it, I was not going to drop that much money on another indoor camera.  Then, Ring came along with this new (and small) indoor camera that's right around $60, so I decided to give it a shot.  Here is my review after using it for a few days. Pros: The video quality is great and does not seem to lag at all Has a built-in panic alarm, which I don't care about but others might (it's kind of weak though) It's small Setup is pretty easy Cons: It has a rather short power cable, which is not modular.  If you are going to put the camera on a table near an outlet, you shouldn't have an issue, but if you want to mount it on a wall several feet from an outlet, it's probably not going to reach.  Also, the micro usb port is inset into the camera inside a tiny tunnel and the USB cable happens to have the same shape at the end of it to make it easy to insert.  The cable length is an issue for me.  As a test, I tried using a regular micro USB cable and an Apple 2.4 A power supply.  It took a bit of jiggling, but I got the Micro USB end of the cable to seat inside the camera.  The 2.4 A power supply worked fine with it (the includes power supply is 2A) so I will be ordering a longer micro USB cable and using that instead. Another potential con is the ""Activating"" screen when you click on the thumbnail in the app to switch to the live view.  Sometimes it may take 2-10 seconds before the feed actually comes up. One other minor annoyance is the blue LED that turns on when the camera detects motion.  There is no way to turn it off nor is there any way to tell when someone is actively viewing the feed.  Our Nest camera provides the option to turn off the LED, but in normal operation, the LED is solid green, but when someone is watching the camera feed, it turns into a pulsing blue.  Not a big deal, but if you really wanted to make this thing incognito, it's not really possible unless you put tape over the LED. Conclusion:  For $60, this camera is perfect aside from the included power supply, but I can deal with that.",Great camera for the price
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Sep 2019,Blunt Honesty.,"I think it's best for this cam placement if you put it with a crowded counter or shelf to not be as noticeable as a recording camera. Once set,  it hides well. I already have 2 doorbells and 3 chimes and an outdoor cam with siren and security lights. I have another type of indoor cameras, the WYZE cams ... you can see my review on that in my reviews section ... they are not reliable at all. They are very hard to use when away from home .. can't share the videos from the phone. One even just stopped working!! Low priced,  and in this case,  you get what you pay for! This new indoor cam was easy as heck to set up and connect to the app to go right with my other cams. The view is amazing! The picture quality and sound is the best! Yes,  you'll pay more,  but do it! It's worth it. None of the RING products have EVER let me down,  close to home or away!","The RING products are the best,  in my opinion!"

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Oct 2019,Sickpup94,"I ordered a 2 pack of the Ring Indoor Cameras. They are small and very easy to set up. The video quality during day and night are very good. I’ve tested the cameras out over the past few days and the sound quality is not good. It is choppy and a lot of the time you can’t hear anything. I’ve checked the settings and done multiple tests with people talking or making noises and the recorded sound is spotty at best. One camera is inches away from my WiFi router and the other camera is about 15 feet across the room from the WiFi router. I have two Nest indoor cameras and they have no problem picking up noises and sound. They even alert me to loud sounds, like breaking glass. and voices. I think Ring needs to go back to the drawing board for their audio recording microphones and audio software. I’ll keep the Ring Indoor cameras and find someplace for them, but they won’t be replacing my Nest cameras as I had hoped. ***UPDATE 12/18/19*** A Ring customer service representative reached out to me after my review. They asked for video/audio clips, so they could see and hear what the issues are with the Ring indoor mini cams. I provided them quite a few. I also let them know that sometimes the recordings were just black screens with nothing visually or audio recorded. The Ring customer rep advised that the problem wasn’t with the Ring indoor mini cam, it was my internet service provider (cable company). They told me to see if my router was updated and that I probably needed to upgrade to a package with greater upload speed, instead of my existing package that had an upload speed of 5mbps.  Ring also told me that on average, each Ring camera needs 2mbps upload speed, although not all cameras use it at the same time. I contacted my internet provider and they advised that the router was updated and nothing needed to be done. So I bumped my internet package to their highest upload speed of 10mbps and a download speed of 100mbps, which also got me a new router installed by a technician. I’ve had the new router with faster speeds for about a week now. NOTHING has improved with these cameras. The Audio is garbage and choppy. The movement in the video is choppy. I’m feeling like the Ring indoor mini cam is just a $60 piece of junk that is overly packed with crappy Alexa software that I’ll never use and that is adversely effecting the video and audio capability of the camera. Save your money and BUY A NEST CAM or some other brand.","Choppy Video, Horrible Audio"
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Dec 2019,Dparke,"We recently bought a Ring alarm system, which so far, I am pleased with. I wanted the camera to augment the alarm system. My desire is to have the camera off when I am home, but then turn it on when the house is empty so I will be able to see what is going on in my home when I get a notification. But I was amazed that I could not turn the camera on or off remotely from the app. This seems like such an obvious feature to have. All I can do is turn recording of video/audio on or off.  I do not want people in my home to be under 24 hour surveillance if they are by themselves, that seems a little creepy. Also, given the stories in the news lately, it increases the creepiness factor. I spoke with a Ring rep, and he said I was not the only one to make this complaint and they are looking into it. But after reading other reviews it seems that a lot of things are said to be coming, but have not become a reality yet.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jul 2020,OSCAR,"I used the indoor camera as an outside camera. Let me tell you it works amazing outside. I have it underneath the flashing of the  roof. I drilled a hole through the wood and into the garage to plug in as a permanent placement. I live in Arizona and have had the temp at 105F degrees. Also now it is monsoon season. The camera has been working great for the last 4 months under these conditions. I modified the color by painting it black with plasti-dip as I figured it would “seal” it from the elements.  I believe that if I didn’t plasti-dip the camera it would have been fine. An additional reason to paint it was to subdue the white from being seen easy outdoors. None of my neighbors knew I had a camera outside and even my close friends had a hard time finding it.  Due to the size of the indoor camera versus the outdoor camera this was a good pick. I looked for reviews all over to see if anyone had Weathered the indoor camera outside and I couldn’t find one. Let me tell you again if you are able to place this in a good area outside where it can be shielded from the elements, it will be fine. The pic that I have is viewed from underneath looking up. The metal piece is the underside of the roof and the wood is the inner/uppermost part of under the roof. I am able to see all my driveway and street with no problem.

Their wired products are usually absolutely wonderful (battery powered devices leave a lot to be desired) with that said, this wired cam is as cheaply made as could be. The power adapter is extremely flimsy, if you want to use this thing mounted better make sure the cable and micro usb plug-in is reinforced with a home made adjustment, as this thing has absolutely NO snap in at all, horrendous. In my situation it just keep popping out. I’ve already had the device need to go through the setup process again to get it to work, I have no idea why.

Notifications are sent ALL your Echo devices with no way to just pick the ones you want. I made a routine to notify just one Show 5 that worked but I still couldn't turn off the other 8 devices.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Dec 2019,JaneDoe966,"When this camera works, it works really well. The first week of owning it, I was 100% happy. Then I slid down a steep hill to being most unhappy. Like I said, *when* this camera works, it works well. After not a single problem, suddenly now it is almost never on. The Ring app also says I don't have any devices set up when the camera turns off. I have gone through the setup process now innumerable times, and I get it working again, until it just decides, for whatever reason, to disconnect itself from the world again. I don't know if you have to have the best internet in the world, or what, but when I go through the setup process each time, and attempt to connect the the Ring network, it checks my internet connection. Then I get a message stating that I may have no internet (I DO have internet.. and have multiple devices functioning just fine, on it.) It will then wait until the network quality improves before reconnecting. After attempting to connect the camera each time, somewhere under a half hour or so goes by and I will look over and suddenly notice that the camera is back on. It's exceedingly frustrating to go through this, and you are not connected to your home network when you choose the Ring network (to set up your device), so you cannot use it. So all the while waiting for so long for this thing to connect, I can't,  for example, turn on a light via my Alexa app, because Alexa connects through my home network... that I'm not on because.....Ring. The camera is pointless if it's not on, and one of the worst things about it, besides the obvious, is that you don't get notification that the camera is off. I also don't understand why, since its set to automatically reconnect to the internet, it literally never does. If I don't come up with a solution, this this, as well as the 2nd one I bought, is going back. EDIT: I had to keep re-adding my camera to the Ring app constantly. I mean at least 2-3 days a week. Finally, I disconnected the camera from my wifi network, then reconnected. At THAT point (knocks on wood), it seems to be staying connected and listed as a setup device on the Ring app.",Great...*when* it works. *EDIT at bottom of initial review.
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2020,Richie Rich,"Wireless performance is poor. I bought this thinking I was getting a good deal for better home integration for my home surveillance. I have a ring doorbell 2 that has constant poor connection errors disallowing me from answering when people ring the doorbell or doing live view, yet it will record every car driving by my house all day long. Signal strength on the doorbell is -48 and when I test the connection it says signal is great. All software updates have been completed. I thought maybe it’s just the doorbell being outside. Wrong. I set up two of these cameras inside and they both have signal strength  between -42 and -50, show strong signal, but constantly were showing poor connection when I would try to watch live video. I know my wireless is good because I have the Orbi Mesh routers positioned for the best coverage at the same time reducing congestion on one single router. Video quality was just okay, field of view is decent, but the worst part is how short the power cord is so forget installing it on the ceiling. The integration with my ring alarm seems to be good, but what point is it when I can’t watch live view even when I’m on the same network. I don’t think I’m going to keep it and will likely keep the Kasa cameras which are similarly priced, but with much better performance.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Apr 2020,Arnell,"Good camera and quality built but very disappointed in the high price (bought this at $60 starting price). I returned this when I realized that you have to pay monthly fees to keep your recorded events and all of the features of this are found in the $25 wyze cam (which includes 14 days of free cloud storage). If I were somebody that blindly shopped and was content with the camera just because of the brand name, then I would have been fine with this camera. But because I know that there is wonderful competition with same specs but for much cheaper, I genuinely got upset when I realized I spent almost 3 times as much for the same thing I have with a Wyze cam. The video quality and night vision on the Wyze is better as well in my opinion even though they both say 1080p recording. And for those that wish to complain that Wyze previously had security issues, ring is absolutely no better. We plugged in both the ring and the wyze cam to a smart plug that turns on when we want it to and then turns off when we don’t want it on. That way there is physically no power going to it rather than just some button on the app that “says” it turns off. Ring is truly over priced just because of their name in my opinion.",Do your research on the competition. Very over priced.

I bought my 3 Indoor Cams in early December 2019, and during the month my data usage with my ISP (Comcast) jumped from 490GB in November, to 1.2TB in December. I have a 1TB cap on my internet usage, and took a financial hit on my last bill. Since I work from home I had very small motion zones set up, but since I knew the only new items on my network were the Ring Cams, I had a major issue. The first time I called Ring support, i asked them for help and was told there was nothing they could do for me. That was in early January. Over the last couple of weeks, i roughly blew through another 500GB of data. I called Ring support again, and this time I asked to be escalated to a second level engineer. When I explained the problem this time, he suggested that I delete my motion zones and see if that stopped the excessive data consumption. It actually seemed to work this time, as I’ve only consumed about 20GB of data in the last couple of days (vs. about 45GB/day in December). I’ll keep monitoring my usage, but as long as I stay under my data cap, I’m satisfied. But there is no way to control data consumption, except by eliminating the motion zones. That turns the cameras into nothing more than on-demand tools, and defeats the purpose of the built in intelligence of the cameras. Maybe this incident (and the experience of others) will compel Ring to allow users more control over data usage. If they do that, then I’d be more inclined to rate the cameras higher. But until then, beware of how motion zones influence data usage.",Nice camera but burns lots of data
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Oct 2019,Nicc,"Ok, so the camera itself is very good. Excellent picture, in daylight or dark. Has a wide field of view and you can zoom in and out easily. Motion detection and other features. It has good two way sound with a clear microphone and speaker. Along with vesitile mounting options so you can place it in a variety of locations. Brought the system to check on my dog while lm out and it works well for that. BUT! The problem is in the RING app! Download is ok, set up is pretty quick and simple, the issue is that the app is unstable and very buggy! I have excellent high speed home WiFi and unlimited 4G cellphone data but more often than not the app video will either not load; lock up; freeze; go out of focus or lag horribly! I noted this issue was reported by numerous users in the RING App reviews, so it is not a problem with my setup. I really want to like this camera but the excellent hardware is let down by slow buggy software in the app! So if you buy it, be aware of the issues... C'mon Amazon/RING you can do better! Please fix your app! UPDATE! About four days after posting this review RING contacted me to help work out the problems! Very helpful technician went through my set up with me and we discussed a couple of options. Turned out setup and internet/wifi were all fine but to speed things up he suggested l use a different app - RAPID RING It's basically a stripped down version of the regular app - less bells whistles and frills - and goes directly to live cam when you activate it. Since then lve had no more problems! Much happier now and upped stars from 3 to 4! The main app should work better but the Rapid one fixed things for me.",Great camera let down by slow buggy app!

I am tickled pink with these Inside Stick Up Cams, will recommended to all over other brands.  I have replaced two of my three Wyze Cams with these Ring Inside Stick Up Cams, well worth the added expense. I have at this time, the first generation Stick Up Cams (outside and in the garage), Pro Door Bell and two Ring Spot Light Cams (one wired and one battery powered), all are in excellent working order.  The video on these Inside Stick Up Cams exceeds expectations in comparison with my existing Ring cameras. Inside I had three Wyze Cams, one that was chronically loosing itself from the network, another two that intermittently would loose themselves from the network.  All were chronically unable to provide a video within the app without crashing or without taking valuable time to do so.  My internet is very, very stout, throughput is excellent, download of 500+ Mpbs's and upload at over 30+ Mpbs's.  So internet speed, latency and throughput are not the issue where any of these camera's are concerned.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2019,WM,"Switches to night vision mode randomly during the day; motion detection is erratic.  Sometimes disconnects even though the router and internet connection are solid (it's only 15 feet from the router) and you don't realize until you happen to open the app and look. UPDATE:  After having this for a couple weeks, another flaw has surfaced.  When the camera ""activates"" on account of motion, there is a perceptible ""click"" noise when it turns on, and again when turning off.  This clicking happens even if every single setting for motion detection is disabled in the app.  I have this camera on a bookshelf in my family room and I decided to sleep on the couch in there the other night.  I had the TV on at a very low volume, and I suppose the camera picked up the changing light level in the room as motion, so all I heard was click....click....click for hours as I tried falling asleep.  Eventually it got so annoying that I unplugged the bloody thing.  I suppose the clicking is some sort of internal shutter. This has been a lousy experience with this new product, and I'm really starting to regret investing in a variety of Ring products.  The app fails to connect to doorbell and other cameras Abbott 50% of the time; and half of the time when it does connect, it only does so after a delay of 20-30 seconds.  Pointless for trying to interact with someone at the doorbell. 2nd Update:  Received a replacement in light of the experiences noted above.  The new unit has addressed most issues; the clicking sound is now gone, night vision doesn't randomly come on mid-day, and the connection is much more reliable and quick to load.  Complements to Ring for proactively reaching out to try and solve the problems.  Withholding one star because there are still instances when the live feed is slow to load, independent of connection issues on the camera or phone end.  Hopefully will improve with later firmware and app updates.","Initially Buggy, Replacement Mostly Works"

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Mar 2020,32bits,"[updates] So I didn't return it and I did get it to work after I stopped swearing out loud at the app. I found that some of the bugs in the app have to do with the camera not synching with changes unless it's restarted. For example, if you turn off the IR illumination in the app it will say it is off but it isn't. If you restart the camera it will turn off. I've found similar bugs with ""modes"" and motion notifications. In all this is a decent bit of hardware and the Ring eco-system is becoming more and more compelling but the fit-and-finish of their app leaves a lot of room for improvement. After looking at the competition, however, only Wyze is better and most, even Google, have much deeper problems with their products. If you just want indoor cameras I'd still say get Wyze but if you want the full Ring setup including doorbell cameras, outdoor cameras, security systems, etc. this is the right indoor camera for you. [updates] After being contacted by Ring support I tried again and found yet more keyboard integration bugs with the app. Here's the first one I ran into: 1. open app and click on login 2. get notification that a code was sent to my inbox. 3. switch to the gmail app and see the code. 4. switch back to the ring app. EXPECTED: The same code input prompt should be still showing with the keyboard on the screen. ACTUAL: The keyboard is missing and will no longer appear in the app. You have to force-quit the app to get the keyboard to return and cannot switch to your email app to complete the login. The only way to login to the app is using a different computer to get the code from your email. CONCLUSION: Please provide a *native* ios application or do not advertise support for ios. ------ After turning off the cellular data on my iphone and dealing with the keyboard bugs I finally managed to get the camera to connect to one of my wifi routers but not the one I wanted it to connect to. Meanwhile, Wyze camera, sensors, and app worked first time and have been working in my garage for the last two weeks. Wyze seems to be the better choice here. [original review] Amazon got this to me ahead of schedule despite COVID-19 which was great but then the app was frustrating and the camera didn't work. I'm having to return it so the fast shipping didn't help me much. 1. The APP Please, please, please please please, stop. writing. non-native. ios. apps! <nerd-rant>If you can't afford to hire an IOS developer then don't advertise support for it and don't write a crappy Cordova (or whatever) app and put the pain off on us customers. If you need to share code write it in C which is perfectly portable across Android and iOS.</nerd-rant> Specifically, your non-native app doesn't tie in with password manager integration through the ios keyboard. I have EXTREMELY long WPA passwords that I really can't remember. I rely on Lastpass to autofill forms but this does not work with the Ring app. Additionally, the setup workflow is dumb. Each time it failed to connect to wifi the workflow stared over from the start instead of simply repeating from the last failed step. This meant I kept having to reselect my location and re-typing in my custom location name. Please take the time to hire professional mobile developers before you foist your poorly-designed mobile apps upon us. 2. The Camera It didn't work. Tried four times to connect to two different wifi access points getting increasingly angry at the poorly designed app. I don't have it in me today to sit on hold with tech support for an hour so back it goes. 3. The alternative Going to try wyze and Nest. The former seems too cheap to be good and the latter seems too expensive to be bad so I'll get both and return the one that doesn't exceed expectations.

I recommend ring products to people very often (I work with law enforcement)  and will continue to recommend their products! Just for information purposes, if you plan on using it through a window, you have to disable the night vision and cover the blue light to prevent reflection on the glass.

An orange ad pops up on the bottom of the IOS app cajoling you to buy an upgraded “protection” plan in the next 30 days. This plan stores the videos for a little while. I didn’t want that, for privacy reasons (easy to hack ring cameras and these were interior) and saw no reason to pay for something I didn’t want just to get rid of an ad. Being patient with tech, I waited the month.  But you guessed it, the ad is still there telling me it’s not too late. I searched everywhere for how to disable it.  It’s annoying.  No luck. I chatted with ring support where the rep cheerfully typed that the only way to get rid of their ad is to buy their plan. Sell the poison then the antidote. Crazy.  I wish I had never bought it.

Them running a nag ad at you is uncalled for and should, worst case, be able to opt out from.  This is a disturbing trend lately.  Look at LG smart TVs.  They are actually doing 3rd party popup ads--on the tv!  Not Netflix, not Roku or Apple TV, but on the hardware which you bought and are captive to.

The motion sensing on these items,including the ring dobell, is ridiculous. No matter how you set your zones up, your cameras are constantly going off. In other words, constantly sensing motion.  It also appears that all ring cameras has a bubble like vision of what you're looking at. Opposed to having a square view. I have only hooked one camera up so far. And I have checked the part of the camera that you can speak through and that part does work. At least on 1 camera. If you're expecting to put these cameras at a distance from a receptacle, then you definitely will need an extension cord. As the power chords for these cameras Are no more than 6' long which does not give you much Room to set your cameras up high. The ring company certainly has a long way to go in making their cameras A lot quicker in their  Functionalities.

It would have been helpful to know that before I made the purchase, but I am grateful that I now understand the situation.

The image and sound quality are very good, similar to the Stick Up Cams that I have enjoyed owning for a long time.  I found the power cord to be a little short for one of the locations where I placed an Indoor Cam, but I have a small supply of 1- and 2-foot extensions so it isn't a major issue.

I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up. Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice. I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 May 2020,Mike Armistead,"I have 4 Ring products.  Out of the 4, 2 have gone bad within a month.  Ring's customer service is good and they answer the phones quickly.  You'll spend 30 minutes being lead through troubleshooting you've already done and then they'll offer to swap out your defective unit.  In the case of these Indoor Cams, 1 went bad all the time (dropped connection all together even though it's 5 feet from the router) and 1 just drops some times.  Customer Service offered to swap out the ""bad all the time"" one and asked if I wanted it in white or black.  I said black.  They sent me white.  Pretty much par for these products. I have a Doorbell Pro that works great and I've never had any issue from it.  The Spotlight Cam Battery I have in my back yard has been replaced once under warranty.  When these devices work, they're better than Arlo at a much more palatable price.  I'm batting .500 on these devices right now.  Take that for what it's worth.  I've also had Arlo Pros and 1 of my 4 cameras went bad within a year. Set up is very quick and easy on these products and only require an app on your phone.  No hub or anything like Arlo.  If you want to have more than one device be able to record video, you'll need a subscription for Ring.  2 cameras for around $100 isn't bad at all and the picture quality is good.","If It Works, It'll Be Good"
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Mar 2020,NightCrawler,"I bought a camera for $40 from China because I wanted to save some money. I kept having problems connecting to Wi-Fi and the app being really slow to respond. I thought it might be because I was having a hard time connecting the Wi-Fi to my garage, I have the camera set up in my garage.  I finally had enough of it, caved in and bought the ring security camera for $60. I am so happy with my purchase. Night vision is great, no issues connecting to Wi-Fi in my garage and so far it has worked smoothly.  I’m a huge fan of Ring cameras now and want more!  Also, I use Alexa so I’m sure ring will work flawlessly with my Echo. UPDATE: March 18 Very good camera but sometimes it is late to record motion. I have it setup in my garage because I’m Feeding a stray cat and I like to see her on camera. Sometimes the camera will not start recording her walking in or out it seems to trigger late, It may be a weak Wi-Fi connection to the garage I can’t be sure. But it is still a really good camera and I’m going to buy another one shortly. UPDATE:  I don’t believe this. When I bought a camera for my garage to watch the stray cat I’m feeding I didn’t think I had to pay to watch my own videos.  Now I’m finding out my free trial has ended and I have to pay to watch recorded video of a stray cat!  If I knew, I would have just bought a normal camera that doesn’t make me pay to watch my own recorded videos from the camera I purchased! UPDATE:  April 20, 2020 Changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star to now 3 stars. Even though I don’t think I should have to pay a monthly fee to watch the videos recorded on MY camera this ring camera has very good quality and connects well to the WiFi in my garage even though the signal is very weak in there. So I’m bumping it up to 3 stars, I guess. UPDATE: May 2 Changing my review down to two stars because it can be slow to activate even with proper WIFI and of course for making me pay to watch my own videos on a camera that I bought.",So happy with my purchase

Im soooo tired of being constantly bombarded with notifications.  Yes, I've turned down the sensitivity.  Yes, Ive adjusted the area it looks for movement.  Yes, I've made it look for humans more than leaves.  Still, with utilizing all the features, now when I hear the ring chime sound - all it makes me want to do is throw this ""stuff"" in the trash. Also, I've done some thinking on Ring in general.  The real differentiator is the ring sound and that's it.  Now a-days all camera systems come with cloud, and scrubbing, and motion detection - but you know what they don't have?  A constant, incessant, need to notify you about every. single. thing. that. happens. (unless you disable it of course - which defeats the purpose). How about I buy a professional camera system from Costco or wherever (MUCH LESS MONEY FOR MORE COVERAGE THAN OVERPRICED RING) and then scrub through it at my leisure - with better quality.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 May 2020,Zatt,"Recently switched over to RING and decided to try out the (2) pack of these mini cameras and well I was more than impressed.  The reason I say this is because I use both of these to look outside through glass to see whats going on while I'm not at home. These things work great during the day and very well at night with the color night vision turned on (No IR lights) and I never knew how many critters move around at night that these cameras pick up. Skunks, Doe, raccoons, stay cats and thankfully no people yet. Great to know when deleiveries come and it records the person coming and going (I have one mounted looking down my driveway through a window). I had Wyze cameras for these 2 locations but were totally useless at night and never recorded anything or picked anything up. These mini cameras worked so well I bought another 2pack. One is mounted in another window looking outside and the other is setup to view the inside of my house. As with ANY camera you have to set the motion settings to your needs. My indoor camera is set where my cat does not set it off but yet a person will set it off which is kinda the point! These cameras can be setup with multiple ""motion-zones"" to further eliminate false triggers and can be setup to use at certain times as well great for when its windy outside and you dont want a bush or shrub triggering motion (MANY flase triggers unsing the Wyze cams!! due to wind) These motion zones can be resized for iregular shapes like I said great for shrubs. Yes these are more expensive than Wyze but these WORK at night through glass and worth every penny to me. I had thought about just buying some RING outdoor cameras with the solar backup but they are more expensive and require drilling and mounting as I prefer just mounting these on window sills and easily adjust when it's 20below outside because these are inside my house! The other reason is my house is brick with wet-plaster inside and getting WiFi outside would require extenders and more wires and more hassle that I didnt want in the long term. I already have lighting outside my house and these cameras work well and suit my needs. Better peace-of-mind when not at home plus I can check up on my pet as well and talk to it if I wanted with the 2way audio. I've had MANY camera brands over the years but these intergrate with RING and can see everything right in 1 app and one screen - Alarm status and cameras. At $60 these are still inexpensive for the feature set you get. I plan on buying another 2pack to cover my gagarge and inside my home. My free trial is almost up and I will be signing up with the $10 a month plan which is a no-brainer for the alarm celular backup and the cloud-storage for the cameras. I started with the 14piece kit and added these cameras and have been very satified with the whole system. I also added the Dome siren in my garage and have a very robust security system for around $700 total as I stand. Ring is also expanding getting into lighting, plugs and more so, I can add things to the system as I go! It's a great eco-system and am happy I went with Ring.  One last thing is Ring works with Alexa and I set and disarm my system and locks right from my smartwatch while leaving or coming home (With a preset security code) without even pulling my phone out of my pocket. I'm sure the system will continue to grow and become even more robust in the future....",Great small cameras added to a solid security system!

I had trouble the first time I was setting it up, because I was initially going to set it up in the garage. However, I changed my mind... so in the den it went. It worked well for a month and then I decided to install it onto the main ring account that I have. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to pass the connection phase of the set up. Pretty much, the camera is now a brick and I’m unable to use it. I tried contacting amazon for assistance, but I opted out of the device insurance 🙄 the amazon rep tried to get someone from ring to help, but I didn’t t a phone call in a timely manner. I will eventually call ring in my own to see if they can resolve this issue, otherwise I just threw away $60 for a bricked security camera. ——- Update 9/26/2020 I contacted Ring on 9/04 to receive a new camera since the one I purchased was still under warranty. I deleted the camera from my account, so the representative had an issue pulling up my information but stated that I would receive a replacement in the mail. It’s been three weeks and I haven’t received my replacement device.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2019,robertonuno85,"Update (1/1/20) Changed from 2 stars to 1. After I wanted to setup a guest WiFi network and a stronger main WiFi network (funny enough, specifically because of the recent ring camera hacks) the camera is now completely non-functional. After changing the WiFi password, the camera was offline (as expected). I then proceeded to restart the setup process to get it on the new network. Although is appeared to be successful (the camera said so and it is on the network via the router page) the Ring.com account on my phone is completely nonfunctional. I've tried reinstalling the app (errors), I've tried using the website from my desktop (still errors), I've tried creating a new ring.com account and factory reset the camera (I have to remove ""ownership"" of the camera on my old account, but my old account is not working!), I've even tried deleting the old account (different error!). I now have a non-working camera. The customer service chat was helpful in walking me through troubleshooting steps, but ultimately wasn't able to fix the issue. He told me someone from the ""advanced team"" will be contacting me via email shortly. For something that is supposed to monitor security, this is utterly unacceptable and unreliable. OLD REVIEW I really want to like this camera. But it's not at all ready for prime time. At least, not yet. When I ask Alexa to display the video stream on the fireTV 4k stick, one of the following four things happen: 1) Endless waiting for ring.com screen appears. Video stream never shows up. (50 percent) 2) Alexa says ""Ok"" but then literally nothing happens. (30 percent) 3) The screen that says waiting for ring.com appears for about two seconds and then it goes back to the homepage. No video stream was ever shown. (10 percent) 4) The video stream shows. (10 percent) All software is up to date. Wifi signal to camera is strong The android app works far far better. The fireTV is not at all reliable to display the camera video stream. Unfortunately, that was a primary reason why I purchased this camera. Will update this if software fixes improve things. Until then, if you were looking to pair this with your Alexa and fireTV, this camera is NOT functional for that purpose.",Not at all reliable.

This is great for indoor privacy, especially since Ring hasn't received great media attention over privacy the last few months. I don't know why they're dragging their feet, but I still don't have the alarm modes feature available to me when many other customers do. These slow roll outs are frustrating, especially when I have many different Ring products installed in my phone. You would think they would want to roll out the new features to their customers who make the most use of the products. I have been wanting an indoor camera for a while, but didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. I was happy to see that Ring released this camera. I have the doorbell, security system, and other cameras and it is nice to have control of everything in one app. Ring is always releasing new features and I look forward to the security alarm modes, which will disable recording when the security system is disarmed. The video is very clear and motion detection zones are customizable.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2019,Brad,"EDIT:  Ring support contacted me and sent me one of their new 10 foot cords, with a USB plug at the adapter.  Much improved power cord.  So I updated from 4 to 5 stars based on the new cord but also for the proactive customer support.  Original review is still below: This camera is small, has a great picture (even with IR on at night), has lots of options (like turning IR off for mounting behind glass) . . . and the list goes on.  An almost great camera.  Here are the negatives . . . short power cord, and you cannot extend it.  The plug where it goes into the camera has a unique micro usb, and the other end does not detach from the power supply.  So if you want to extend the low voltage cord, the only option I see is to actually splice the cord yourself.  And . . . be careful with the plug into the camera, it does not fit tight, I found myself losing power, you need to place the cord so there is tension pushing it in or tape it.  You can put the mount on the bottom, top or back . . . flexible unless you want to mount the camera from the side, like in a window jamb.  They could have included an ""L"" for the mount as one solution.  So I think this is a really good camera, but no one thought out the power supply issues, or considered side mounting . . . so four stars.",Updated to 5 stars

Well, it has been a problem ever since.  It constantly loses its connection and no, the wifi is not far away.  In fact, it is less than 20 feet away.  Throughout the day and night it starts speaking to me because it has lost its connection.  After a dozen or so times, I contacted support and they sent me a replacement.  Went well for about a week or maybe 2, then the same problems began to happen again.  Here I am at work, got a notification about movement in my kitchen, went to view the hallway after and the phone cannot connect it says.  That was my final straw.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Feb 2020,Twisted Stitches,"I ordered 2 of the indoor cams and we've had them for about 2-weeks now. Set up was super easy but then again, we've had other Ring cams for about 4-years now. So far we're pleased with these indoor cams, viewing is clear, and motion sensor is very sensitive, can hear the videos fine and mic doesn't have any static or feedback noise. The alarm isn't really that loud though and we could barely hear it outside during testing - we stood on the patio next to our sliding glass door. When we went inside, it's just not that loud; even our dogs and cats weren't phased by it so we're dubious if it would scare a burglar away. As for the new ""Away"" vs ""Home"" features on the app, we don't see any difference in number of alerts or anything so not sure what the purpose is for that on the app (we have 4 other outdoor stick up cams and never used those features on the app before).

Easy to install if you have an existing Ring device. The only downside to this unit is that the charging cable needs to be plugged in at all times and it doesn’t have a stand alone battery. I’m not sure how long the cable is but if you intend on mounting it to your ceiling or close to it then you will need a longer cable. Also, you can’t install this camera to be on the left or right of your wall. The wall that’s perpendicular to your floor. The video comes in sideways and it’s annoying. You can mount it parallel to the floor but you have to have a flat ceiling to drill into or use outside 2 sided tape and tape it to your flat ceiling because there’s a feature to invert the camera but not to turn it 90%. It’s a pain. I would’ve given it a 5 star rating with those exceptions. They should come with a longer cable and I’ve tried with other micro usb cables and they work.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Oct 2019,Shopper,"I've been reading so many of these reviews and they are ranging from Wi-Fi problems to privacy issues.  I have had none of these issues.  Most issues with ring devices stem from poor Wi-Fi signal or slow internet access speeds.  In my testing and use of ring products (since 2015) I have found that the minimum signal strength for Ring Video products to respond to be around -75 dbi (I target -55 to -65 as my goal), anything worse will degrade video quality and responsiveness.  As for bandwidth, the minimum needed at 5 mbps down / up.  As far as privacy goes, I set these cameras to not record and not detect motion.  We use these cameras to check in on the kids and in conjunction with the Ring Alarm when we are away.  This is how I would rate them: Responsiveness: 4.5 / 5 (seems the latest patch made it better) Video Quality: 4/5 (still not as good as my 3 year old Ring Pro, night vision is actually good!) Audio Quality: 3/5 (i can hear people and they can hear me, but its not perfect) Ease of Setup 5/5 (use the qr code and app and it was super easy) Ease of Use 5/5 (works just like any other Ring Product, please add to windows soon!) Overall 4.5 / 5 (wish I could do half stars on Amazon, if a future patch makes them better I'll update my score.  If you already own a Ring ecosystem (cameras, alarm, etc.) this is a great addition!  I also find the video and audio good enough for those of you that just want a cheap and easy to setup video surveillance system indoors. What I would like to see in version 2: 1. 5ghz support! (I get that 2.4 ghz penetrates walls better, but the bandwidth of 5ghz is so much better!) Helpful Tip: If you only have one router, you will greatly benefit from buying 1 or more chime pro(s) to get a strong enough wifi signal to each camera.  If you want to go all out, you can do what I did and just have access points near your ring products.  The extra step that makes my system work well is that I have SSIDs assigned for ring products so they won’t move from the access point I want them associated with.",Great Little solution to compliment the Ring Environment
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2019,Ghent,"Updated Review ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A criminal who had been released from jail on probation because COVID, robbed my garage 2 nights in a row.  I got a crisp and clear video, posted to the Ring app, other neighbors checked their video and found the same man on their property, the police were involved immediately and the perp was taken back to jail. From the press release of our local PD: ""On 5/11/20, [city] Police Department Patrol responded to a residential burglary that occurred the night before. The victim had left their garage door open and went for a walk around the neighborhood. During that time, from about 8 pm to 8:30 pm, an unknown subject later identified as [nam,e] entered the garage, rummaged through the cars and stole the victim’s mountain bike. While [name] was in the garage, the victim’s family was at home in the house. ... When the victim realized his bike had been stolen, he checked his Ring Camera video and saw that the suspect had been inside his garage. He posted the video onto the Ring Camera Neighborhood App, warning others in the area. Many community members had seen the video of the suspect and had been in contact with the [city] Police Street Crimes Unit (SCU). SCU and PROS (Post Release Offender Supervision) Detectives along with Patrol officers began looking for the suspect. ... This was an excellent example of the community working together to put a criminal back into jail. ... A review of the [city] Superior Court website shows that [name] has prior convictions for stealing a vehicle, robbery, using pepper spray to commit a violent felony, being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of narcotics. [name] is currently on PROS/AB109 and was in custody and had recently been released from jail on May 8th by Probation due to Covid-19 concerns."" For a $60 camera, this was a great investment. Original Review ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I had 5 of the Amazon Cloud Cams, purchased about 18 months ago.  Amazon then acquired Ring and Blink, and discontinued the Cloud Cams, although they still provide support (for now). I needed two new cameras, so I went with the Ring.  Primarily because I heard nothing negative about the security, as opposed to Wyze.  However, Ring has some real downsides relative to the Amazon Cloud Cams. 1. More latency. I have great WiFi.  I have multiple wi-fi mesh routers throughout the house with no dead spots.  Still have to wait ~5-7 seconds to connect to live view.  Cloud Cams was 3-5 seconds. 2. No zoom I could tap and zoom on Cloud Cams.  Can't do that with Ring. 3. No live view via Web Browser. Apparently you can download an app on Windows 10, but I'm on a Mac and wonder why I can't view the video in a browser.  I could go with Cloud Cams. 4. I can't see multiple Cameras at once. With Cloud Cam, I could stream audio and video from all five cameras at once over the web.  It was great. Having to switch between cameras, one at a time, and having to wait 5-7 seconds per camera, is a big downside. I get that Amazon needed to simplify its product portfolio after their two most recent acquisitions in this space, but it's a shame the Cloud Cam isn't sold anymore.  It was a superior product offering in this space. Design, Packaging, Ease of Setup, and from what I can understand, Security is all excellent in Ring, and I have no complaints.  The app, in spite of the one camera at a time limitation, is well-designed too. *** UPDATED 3-Jan-2020 *** I found the Rapid Ring app.  It works in conjunction with the regular Ring app.  Rapid Ring has limited functionality, but it does everything I need.  Somehow, it manages to reduce latency to connect to the cameras.  When I pull up the Rapid Ring app, I can connect to anyone of my cameras in <1 second.  The app will also continuously reconnect to the camera after the 5 minute timeout period, so I can stream a camera indefinitely.  I have upgraded my review to 4 stars.  If Ring ever develops a generic web interface to view all cameras simultaneously, I will give 5 stars.",Landed a Perp

However Live Video does not stream smoothly.  Watching Live View is watching choppy stills, one frame every few seconds.  That in itself should trash this camera.  There is no download function of any motion videos without a Ring subscription costing $3/month.  So when the initial 30 day trial was up and I didn't join, all prior videos were deleted.  Suspiciously, a few days after the trial period ended, this camera went offline.  Problem is, this camera was placed in my beach property 300 miles away.  I cannot reboot it without being physically onsite, which obviously, is a major inconvenience. This is a waste of $60.

This Ring indoor cam is about 6ft from my router Shows an EXCELLENT RSSI of -29 and yet it will disconnect at least 5 times a day, or more! What will happen is the cam will detect motion then crash and emit audio static via speaker and in app show Wi-Fi connection Is lost. This crash lasts about 30 seconds before it reboots automatically. Or I can manually reboot by unplugging and replug in the camera if I am in area during the crash. This makes the camera unreliable for home security! During the day the picture quality is excellent, the audio quality is good, night vision is really clear as well. I do have a complaint if you use the color night vision option in settings it adds a purplish hue to video color at night. Before you say “it’s a problem with camera placement such as Wi-Fi dead zone”...I would like to add that where I currently have the new ring indoor camera I had a wired ring stick up cam 2nd GEN in the exact same spot It NEVER had this issue. I moved the ring stick up cam 2nd GEN to my garage and while further away from my router with an RSSI of -41 the stick up cam now in my garage never drops. So as for new Ring indoor cam If not for the constant disconnects this would be a very nice camera to add to the Ring portfolio but in its current state I would say stay away. ***UPDATE 11/20/19*** the Ring indoor cam FINALLY DIED! It’s still had the same Wi-Fi disconnect issues, and the same static issues but late last night it started to show a black screen only would not show any video. attempts to unplug and replug did not help. so I tried to remove from the Ring app reset the device and set it up again. it was stuck on a permanent red LED and was nonresponsive the good news is ring is taking care of me in the sending me a new replacement. ***Update 12/4/19*** Well my ring camera did have some pretty serious issues I will say that after ring got in touch with me they were quick to resolve the issue my replacement was brand new and has zero flaws in it whatsoever so it seems I just got a bad camera as the new replacement seems to be working great no disconnect whatsoever!",Had issues but ring support was great!

I tried other third party cameras, but none seem to have everything we wanted. Then Ring came out with this camera. Talk about A LOT of bang for your buck. Amazing 1080P resolution, a large FOV and color night vision. The ONLY issue I ran into, was that I did not want the camera to record while we were home and wanted this to be automated. The solution, was installing an Amazon smart plug and setting and ""ON"" and ""OFF"" time. It works flawlessly. I already have the unlimited cloud DVR plan, so thwre is no extra cost to view recordings. Definately recommend this camera.",Ring delivers a lot of camera for a small price

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Sep 2020,Isaiah,"I already own the Ring Doorbell 2, and pay for the Ring Protect Plus plan for my home. Since Amazon stopped making the Amazon Cam, I decided to try the Ring Indoor Cam to consolidate my cameras into one ecosystem (Ring). The camera itself is great, the low-light vision maintains color at a far lower light level than the Amazon Cam does while still being able to see clearly. When the night vision kicks on, the clarity is on par with the Amazon Cam, however the Ring Indoor Cam utilizes a single IR LED operating and high power to illuminate the area. This is a noticeably bright red LED that glares at you from across the room. The Amazon Cam uses the typical ""ring"" of IR LEDs around the camera to illuminate the area, so they operate at a much lower intensity per-LED, and you barely see their glow when the room is dark and they are on. I know some people may not care, but I have a black sticker over the status indicator LED so that the camera is largely hidden while on so if I have guests over they don't feel like big brother is watching because they see the camera all lit up with LEDs. The IR LED's intensity doesn't allow it to remain hidden/forgotten on the shelf - you can clearly see it. My real beef with Ring is with their Protect Plus plan, which is supposed to cover all cameras in your home. I paid for the annual plan last December 7th, and everything was great until I purchased the Ring Indoor Cam. When I added the camera to my account, Ring ""activated"" a ""Free trial subscription"" of 30 days for Ring Protect Plus. I started to get notices in the app and nearly daily emails telling me I only had X days left on my ""trial"" and urging me to ""upgrade"" my account to a paid plan. So I reached out to Ring to inquire why I was getting these messages when I ALREADY had a paid, annual plan for Protect Plus. The chat support agent I spoke with assured me that all new cameras added to an account activate a Free Trial of 30 days, after which my account would revert back to my paid plan. Ok, whatever, a dumb system but I can live with that since my plan is supposedly still intact. The chat agent agreed it wasn't a great system, but that's how it's setup for now. Fast forward to today, and my ""free trial"" ended 2 days ago. I didn't think anything of it, until I went to review the footage from earlier today to confirm a package delivery while I was at work, and the Ring app on my phone is telling me there are no recordings because I don't have a paid plan. Wait...WHAT?!? I have 2 days of ZERO footage because the trial ended and the plan that I had already paid for and was already active active on my account as I was told would happen. If something had happened to my home I would be SOL with Ring, as the camera has basically been an expensive paperweight on my shelf the past two days. So I reached out to support again. I was told that because the trial ended two days ago, no footage was recorded or stored, all of the previously stored footage has been deleted from their system, and there was nothing the agent could do but add another trial to my account to ensure I have events recorded while he forwarded my case to their account team (who would respond within 24-48 hours). That was nearly 12 hours ago, during business hours, and I still haven't heard anything from Ring. So as of right now, they have me on another Trial plan, while I wait for them to sort out that I already have a paid Protect Plus plan that should be active. My other issue with switching to Ring is the lack of geo-fencing. With my Amazon Cam, I keep one camera always on in the living room facing the front door. When I arrive home, the camera in the other part of my home automatically stops recording until I leave, then turns on recording again. I don't need my private life entirely recorded while I'm home, just the camera covering the front door should suffice. With Ring, you can set a behavior based on their Disarmed, Home, or Away settings (which seemed to be geared more toward their security systems), so I could set a rule that a camera stops recording motion events when in ""Home"" mode and starts again in ""Away"" mode, but I would have to manually change the Ring mode every time I arrive/leave home - there is no automatic way to do this via Geo-fencing. I asked Ring support about this and their solution was to ""unplug the camera when you are home."" Really?!? Nearly every other smart camera has the ability to automatically turn on/off recording based on when you are home. In short, it's great camera, but Ring/Amazon need to do some serious work on their app/ecosystem before I can fully commit to switching over and buying more Ring gear. I can't have a camera ""maybe"" store events while I'm paying for their premium service. I expect the system to work as intended/advertised, and I don't care to have to remember to turn the camera off/on when I arrive/leave home.","Ring Protect Plus is (currently) A Joke, Otherwise This Would Be A Great Camera"
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2020,Sharon Schilling,"Let me start by saying I received no compensation of any kind for this review; it is my honest experience with Ring products. I am a senior, living alone, in a single family home. Security is a big concern for me but I could not afford any longer to pay the outrageous cost of ADT. My neighbors recommended Ring doorbells. I bought those first. I also needed something that would cover the outside of my home, my yard and driveway. I bought this set of 2 Ring indoor cameras. I installed them yesterday in less than 15 minutes with them sitting in window sills but pointed OUTWARD. They are just perfect!!! Because I live in Iowa with very harsh winters, I did not want to have to worry about changing batteries or a solar powered camera. These 2 little cameras plug into to any outlet and the view outside is absolutely clear. I highly recommend them for reasonable cost, ease of installation and for the ability to monitor the entire outside of my home without expensive installation charges.",I needed something reasonably priced and easy to install.....
"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Aug 2020,Pamela C. Chesnas,"Why Ring? We started about a year ago with a Ring doorbell, but for security cameras we had another system through our cable company.  Because we were so happy with the doorbell, we decided to give Ring stick up cameras a shot. Picture & Wifi The picture is clear, although it gets a bit fuzzy when you zoom in.  The wifi connection seems stable, I haven't noticed it go offline yet.  When I get an alert, it does take several seconds to connect and sometimes the cause of the motion is gone before I can see the camera.  It takes a few moments to process before the video is available for on-demand viewing. Motion Detection Motion sensitivity can be set from low to high so you can adjust it to reduce false alters.  I like the ability to schedule and snooze motion alerts, as well as set modes when you are home or away.  It also offers the ability to set the zones that pick up motion.  For example, if you have a ceiling fan, you can eliminate it from the detection zone so it isn't constantly alerting you. Monitoring Plan There is a  standard and a plus plan.  Both plans include storing videos for 60 days and the ability to grab snapshots.  You pay per camera for the standard plan, but if you have more than 3 devices, the Protect Plus Plan is well worth it.  It covers all your devices for one price, and also adds monitoring, an extended warranty, and give you a 10% discount at the Ring store.  The cost for the Protect Plus Plan is much lower than the monthly fee we were paying our cable company - basically we get a whole year for the cost of 3 months on our old system.  You do not have to subscribe to a plan, but without it, you won't see your video history after the trial period;  you'll only get live view. Overall we are very happy with Ring stick up cameras.","Reliable, decent picture"

I would have given it 5 stars, if not for a couple relatively minor annoyances: 1) There are in-app instructions on how to install the camera on the ceiling, but none on the site (to point out a couple things, like which way to point the bracket). 2) The picture from the ceiling-mounted camera is upside-down, with no easy way I can find to invert it. 3) The power cord (as some others have mentioned) is way too short, and since it has a customized connection (for the recessed port), you can't just replace it with a longer one.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Sep 2020,Eli D. Lee,"We purchased this camera to use as a baby monitor since this is advertised by Amazon as one of it's use cases. Unfortunately, this camera is very dangerous to use as a Baby Monitor.  The reason being is that Amazon imposed a hard timeout on the Live Viewing to 10mins.  After 10mins, the feed will cut out. This is a surprising move by Amazon since their direct competitor Google Nest does not impose this timeout on their camera. If Ring had added a noise monitoring feature, this would be understandable since you can just create an alert when it detects a noise but this does not do this. If you need a constant feed longer then 10mins, stay away from this camera.  This is not meant for you. I wish we can switch over to the Nest eco system but we are already heavily invested in Ring products and we are regretting it.  If they had put the limitation in their specifications, We would NOT have bought any Ring products and went with Google.  We already have 6 dots, 2 shows, Doorbell cam, spotlight cam and these 3 ring cams, as well as the security system.  We even bought a Samsung Fridge due to its integration with Ring, but now we are learning all of this is  worthless since we can not watch the feed longer than 10mins. If you don't need 24/7 live feed, this camera is great.  If you do, stay away.  Get a Nest Cam instead.","Misleading Advertising, Live view times out after 10mins"

The microphone is excellent too. There’s just one problem: you cannot adjust the volume of the speaker on the camera. I could understand having a loud setting for their other items, they have to contend with the outdoor sounds to be heard. But this is specifically an INDOOR camera. So why on earth would you set it at max volume (verified by support)? When attempting to speak to someone through it (such as, in our case, our 3 year old daughter, because we wanted to update from the baby focused Nanit) you sound like a loud drive through speaker. The sound is overwhelming and distorted. I suppose for an adult, it’s usable, barely, but even then it’s way more intense than needed, unless you’re attempting to scare someone. To make it worse, apparently they used to have a volume control built in to the app. That’s gone now, which was news to Ring Support as well. They can not adjust it remotely either, which is a shame because it’s otherwise a great camera at a great price. If you are aiming for something to supplement security for your home and never intend to use the camera’s ability to have two-way audio to do anything other than frighten intruders, this is a good purchase. I suppose if you hate your family it’s great too. But if you wanted to use it to communicate with people you actually care about, get something else. At least until they come to their senses and restore volume control. Seriously, why take away volume control?!?!?",Great if you like to scream at your family

Pros: - Clear video (not 4K quality, but decent enough). - Easy interface with Ring Alarm. - Easy installation. - Motion Detection and Night Vision works as it should. - WiFi Signal...meh.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2019,Michael Siu,"This camera is very reasonably priced, small, and easy to mount.  The picture quality is great for both daylight and night mode.  Again, Nest's comparable is at least 2x as much in price.  And the camera has a siren feature for alerts.  The integration with the Ring alarm (part of Amazon) and Alexa are great - they are most certainly better than Nest cams with the same lighting systems.  The fee for cloud recording is also extremely reasonable for multiple cameras but maybe that's because it only captures motion recording. There are downsides, unfortunately, and they are software related which I hope means they can be fixed eventually.  The Ring app is okay but needs a lot of getting used to.  It is definitely not as intuitive as the Nest app and not as fast.  Checking on a motion alert just plain doesn't work not because it's broke but the captured motion video is ALWAYS ""processing"".  The live view does pop up but that can be slow as well.  And Ring doesn't have full time recording, it only records a bit before the motion to 1 minute after.  I am glad the snooze the motion alert is configurable unlike Nest's default of 30 minutes between alerts.  Ring did announce adding full time recording and corresponding cloud history for a small extra fee but nothing yet as of Dec'2019. And I am hoping Ring/Amazon eventually adds more features like human vs animal vs familiar faces recognition.  Perhaps even sound recognition (like how Echo devices can).

Google Home didn't and still doesn't offer this feature.  Unfortunately, to make the Ring camera do what I want, I would also need the $200 Ring alarm kit. The GOOD:  It has very good image quality, easy setup, and its cloud storage is with Amazon and not a Chinese company with questionable privacy practices.  It has great overall quality, and it ticked all the boxes for the basic things, but that's all this camera is by itself - basic. The BAD:  Its integration with Alexa is virtually non-existent.  Alexa can interact with all my other smart home devices and none of them are owned by Amazon, but this one ignores Alexa like a complete stranger.  Even after installing the ""Ring skill"" in Alexa, she can't make it do anything.  It has an alarm that's plenty annoying when activated, but it isn't loud enough and must be manually triggered.  Really Amazon, all I wanted to do was activate the camera when I leave home, deactivate it when I come home, and unleash sonic fury on an intruder.  This camera is, by itself, nothing but a glorified nannycam. UPDATE: Not long after leaving a slightly more irrate review, Ring support reached out to setup a call.  They listened and explained what the camera is not yet able to do with the app.  So, I need to buy more hardware for it to do what I want, and that sucks, but I'm adding a star for the impressive customer service.

They have reached out quite promptly and offered to help troubleshoot the lag issues. In addition, Ring has recently implemented their control panel feature which allows the account holder to more easily manage their data. The cameras are still not for me, but I do appreciate Ring's actions, and could see how this could be useful for others. My concerns regarding no-knowledge encryption remain. Original Review (2/5 Stars): The camera itself is not too bad, though there is a delay in pulling up video. However, and this is a big however, the trend of the regulatory environment makes this an unsuitable product for a private home. To be sure, it's superior to having a shady overseas company manage your authentication and video storage, but with your video data being stored off-site and not in a no-knowledge fashion, Ring cameras are just not for anyone who cares about privacy. Do yourself a favor and get a hardwired system that writes to a hard drive and if you want, you can have that data sent encrypted to an offsite drive or something.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,Sono-san,"Among all the Ring devices, this one is perfectly priced for the performance. The camera has a stand that has the standard screw for any Camera mounts and tripods, this allows you to use a smaller mount for ceiling installations. The resolution is great, Full 1080p with the newest motion zone technology for the Ring products allowing for Motion zones. I wish they would update the firmware of the Ring Doorbell version One with the latest Motion detection. The word ""Indoor"" simply means that they can't get wet, this means they can be installed under the overhang of your house. And with the power connection being MicroUSB, you can simply plug the USB adapter into an outlet in your attic for a clean installation under the overhang of the house. The camera doesn't have any external antenna, so either have this camera fairly close to your WiFi Router or have a strong WiFi broadcast. I am very satisfied with this model from Ring! They are worth the money.",The Price is just right!

Then you will be in for a series of connection tagging back and forth of almost being connected but not quite being there. When you follow the steps it's perfect. What i wanted was a truly clean experience and the only thing this is lacking and a longer cable, or a way to hide it behind a wall. I have not tried disconnecting the cable from the camera but based on how it comes it's all one piece and thus, unless you're proficient with drywall work, the cable will be on display. This also means that you're tethered to the nearest outlet which means you can't quite get that overhead view you may be looking for. The clarity is spot on, the wide angle makes for viewing of a large area of the space. A few second delay from real time and no lagging and jumping. It's elegant and aside from the occasion blue light for motion and red for night vision, you don't notice it's there. Great product overall.",Cool little guy

It's super easy to set up and it looks soooooo clear.  You can download an app to watch the camera from work out the store so you always feel safe going back home.  Someone has to set off the sensor in order for it to record or if you watch it live it will save it to your recordings.  After a while you have to purchase the subscription if you want the videos to stay and review them.  It is not expensive at all and I feel that it is worth it.  The night vision is amazing!!! Once you turn off the light the camera adjusts so you can see clearly at night.  This is an amazing camera and I highly would recommend it.,Best Purchase

If you intend to use this as a nanny cam, it WILL NOT work for that. Since we couldn't return it we tried moving it to family room to monitor the pets while we're at work during the day, which led to the teen family members complaining about ""trust and privacy"" and they just go over and unplug the thing, so if anyone ever broke in or something happens to a pet it would be useless. Eventually this just caused family arguments. We hoped the camera would help to protect our family and pets and the only thing its done is cause problems.

Though the integration into the overall Ring software is a big advantage for those that have Ring outdoor cameras, the hardware leaves a lot to be desired. While the Nest cams have bodies roughly the size and shape of a tennis ball, the Ring cams are cylinder-shaped. Coupled with a wall-mount attachment that doesn’t push the camera far enough away from the wall, this means that the Ring body greatly restricts the angles at which you can point the camera. We had to find different (and less optimal) mounting locations for the Ring cams as compared to our old Nest cam locations. Subjectively, the image quality is less crisp and lower resolution than Nest.",Unimpressive hardware

To protect my privacy, I do not want my indoor camera to be recording while we are at home. Nest cameras have an ability to detect when homeowners are around and give user the option to disable recording. At the moment, I manually disable recording while I'm home and have to remember to enable it every time I leave. I hope Ring can figure out a way to enable this feature.

The images on those are great. These... a disappointment. Hard to figure how one of these can be placed exactly in the footprint of the battery model and have difficulty with the wifi connection. Obviously, you more ore less get what you pay for. The other units have better image, connection (from our experience) and physical ""heft"" stability. These tended to skitter around. As a bargain these cameras work, but if you're spoiled by the others, just pay for them. We decided quite quickly to exchange. As another plus for the upper-scale ones, the corded and battery cams are the same ... just add a battery. Granted, the battery is another $29, but if your application changes it's nice to switch from the wall socket. Another thing to consider - the Stick Up Camera (not this one) is weatherproof.

However, unless you're already on an Amazon Ecosystem, you may want to consider other options due to the ongoing costs unless you're fully committed to their product line. There is apparently a huge difference between Ring LLC and Amazon Prime in terms of customer service and overall logistics even though they are technically under the same Amazon family. If you order from Amazon using Amazon Prime,  your order generally arrives as requested and if not, they typically make it right for the customer if there are issues. If you call Ring LLC, everyone seems to be fine, well polished, polite, and helpful. You can actually reach a live human. Think Ackbar:  It's a Trap! I could go into the total nightmare of an experience that I just went through with them but I am just tired and frustrated at lack of consideration for the customer.  My recommendation is not to take anything they say at face value and realize that they cannot correct any order issues due to their ""policies"" without excruciating painful interactions and escalations. The Ring product line appears to be a bit more of a trap than normal to up sell you to extract more money for features that many companies include such as cloud recording.  That being said, the product line does appear to be adding features constantly and up-selling might be normal from the home security space.  I am Mixed to Positive Overall on the products. My recommendation is that if you're invested in the Amazon Product Line Family, these products integrate well and may still be worth considering compared to many other options.  The Ring Doorbell Pro is nice as long as you have the correct large transformer to avoid overheating.  The mini-cams seem to be pretty decent for their size. My general recommendation is to make sure that if you order Ring Products you may want to consider using Amazon Prime.  I did actually order 4 more of these minicams through Amazon Prime since I am ""committed"" after ""hopefully"" cancelling my Ring LLC order.

Since I am a blogger I have reviewed several cameras over the years. While I home has cameras all over it to look over the main places in the home they are all three different cameras. Which means when we want to look at them we would have to go into three different apps, not to mention the yearly fee if you want to keep any recordings for play back. We've had a ring doorbell for some time now and it has worked great for monitoring our front door and alerting us to visitors. So when I saw the deal on the Ring cameras I thought these would be perfect to get all our cameras onto one platform. We purchased 4 cameras to replace the cameras in our home. I was quite shocked at how EASY it was to hook up the cameras and have them actually connect and work. The other cameras I have (Arlo and Nest) always seem to have some type of issue when I have to reconnect. I usually have to reset them and try 2 or 3 times before they will finally work. The Ring cameras were truly plug and play and took hardly any time at all to set up. We also prefer the non wireless cameras. While the wireless cameras are great for no cords, I hate having to change batteries. We have not tried the battery operated Rings so I can speak to them.

This one is much smaller but still wide angle. Only problem is it doesn't come with a wall adjustable mount like the wireless one. So I Cant have it tilt enough to see the crib.  I will upload some photo of my real bad temporary solution till I find something nicer (I used thick cardboard Mount on the wall and create a ramp and taped the camera which shows you how light the camera is ) what I did now is real temporary but I hope you get the idea if you need to see certain angle like I do.

"Ring Indoor Cam, Compact Plug-In HD security camera with two-way talk, Works with Alexa - White",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jul 2020,Jjnkx38,"So I've had the Ring cameras since Feb 2020, and have no complaints. I have multiple indoor cameras set up facing doors, as well as the outside doorbell. To make a long story short, my puppy went into the kitchen a little over a week and while playing , hit into the wire that, my fault, was hanging too low, and knocked my indoor camera into the big water bowl used for my adult dogs. I heard the noise from the other room, but since she came back into the room with me, I didn't check until about 5-10 minutes later when I finished folding clothes. When I did, I was kicking myself, as it had submerged completely, the speaker/camera part was under the water that entire time. I shook it out like crazy and set it up in front of a box fan for hours, while still shaking it every now and again. The next day, I plugged it in. The light came on. I was hopeful, but nothing - no connection, nothing when hitting the settings button. The following day was the same, as I added another camera to my Amazon cart in preparation of throwing it out. About a week after, I was still reluctant to discard it. I plugged it in again, blue light came on, it started connecting, and the camera came on! I don't know if RING claims any sort of water resistance, but this review is to tell everyone to not give up on these cameras if they get wet! No guarantee, but they seem to be more resistant than I thought.

I say suitable because it’s not exactly the best one. Video quality? Better than the Cloud Cam. Integration? Amazing, no more separate apps. Space? Small so it can be tucked away. Aesthetics? Blends in to any environment. Here’s where one star comes off: audio. While it does allow two way communication, talking through the app so that the camera is the speaker is less than I was expecting. I mean, sure...it’s a low priced camera but if the visuals are amazing, a bit more could have gone into the audio as well. The other things is motion sensitivity. I get a notification for almost anything. Having a cat, I’m interested in knowing when he’s on the move (jumping on tables or rushing around), yet this camera alerts me even if he’s curled up and licking himself.

I have it set for the 2nd to lowest setting but it picks up leaves shaking on the other sides of the street. Sometimes it skips windows where I know that someone drove by or walked by but it didn't catch it. So it would be unfortunate if this happened during a situation where you really needed to see what happened. The other use is as a baby monitor which works amazingly being able to hear, see, and talk to our son if needed. That has been a much more valuable use over actual security.

I love they come with everything needed for installation and ease of set up. Now, onto this camera. Everything is great, except when I came to find the perfect location, this does not come with a mount to angle the camera. For most camera angles you want the camera high enough to be out of the way to get a good view, then angle down so your not looking at the sky, tops of roofs, or in this case the ceiling. It just mounts flush with the wall. A simple swivel mount would have earned this camera 5 stars. I had to buy mount from ring for  an extra $19.99. I knew I would need a longer cable to reach the height I wanted at, so not a big deal, I knew I'd need to pay $30/yr for the ring subscription service, ok with that too, but not provided a mount that allows you to get the right angle is poor product design on their part.","Great cam,be aware of extra costs"

The audio is ok... Even after setting the settings to “people” only it notifies me of chickens, cats, dogs, freaking butterflies at my front door... and then it’s hurry up and wait. I open the alert and then have to wait for about 30seconds for the camera to show... not my favorite purchase. Probably won’t buy any more of these, just. It as good as my $30 cameras purchased here as well Yeah, update. I still kind of hate them. I will not buy anymore. The incessant notifications for non human activity are awful.

We put on our lanai and it was picking up everything in view, but I adjusted the zone to where it is aimed at the door, the entrance-so no one can come in without this letting us. I have two spotlight rings out on carport and backyard. This front one is linked to the carport so if it goes off, the side light comes on and I’m pretty sure it record as well. I’d hate to say that is a 100% true statement-but I think that is how mine works. But the carport is by the lanai and could be why. Read in their description for fuller details on that. Gives us a lot of security. And being able to change the range of detection really helps on false alarms.

Yes it has flaws. We might not get the video right away but that’s not ring issue.  It’s usually because the connection/the WiFi is not strong enough to transmit the video right away. But I am amazed with how much you can see with this small camera.  And the night vision is pretty good as well. I put one with motion detector on in the garage and it pretty much captures motion right away. People are also complaining about the subscription cost for saving the videos.  But that’s the price you paid if you want to be able to save the videos, otherwise where do you expect the video will be saved?  To me the subscription is minimal and it’s worth it to have especially if you have several ring cameras, which we do. I also prefer to have the plug in one, instead of the battery operated one. With the motion captures and the time we use to turn the video on to check on our dog, it’s easier and more efficient using the plug in one. This camera is pretty small but it has a great view because of the lens. And you can tilt it so you can capture more areas of the room where you place the camera.",Good picture quality

I got this, pretty much. However: I can understand if ""People Only"" detects my cat once in a while, but the sensitivity setting below that shouldn't (and it most definitely).  It also shouldn't think motion is there when a light comes on in the hallway, and the hallway is only 5-10% of the image at most (a light for the entire room I could understand). Also, it doesn't have native geofencing, just like all their other cameras, so you need to use a smart outlet to turn it on/off (which I really dislike doing). Just don't see why it's so hard for them to implement stuff when other companies seem to do it (they just charge a little more).",Meh.

I haven't had a chance to try it since Amazon Key is suspended and rightfully so with COVID-19. Great Audio and visual features is the plus. One thing to consider (unlike say a Lorex Camera) is the cost of monitoring service. It's either ""Protect Basic"" which is a $30 (which is going up with new tax) fee per camera or Protects Plus which covers all devices and professional monitoring for all devices at $100 annually which if I had the entire home system that would be a steal vs what I'm paying for my monitoring system). The catch in all this is you have to pay as the mini camera I purchased to go along with my amazon key does not store video at all without a subscription. Not even for 24 hours like the Amazon Cloud Cam So if you're not near your device when a delivery arrives to view it then you have no record of who opened your garage. I think that needs to be better explained as I'm looking at returning this now in favor of the Amazon Cloud Cam. Its a little bit more upfront but with Ring requiring a subscription for any recording, well in the long run it becomes a better deal. Since Ring is owned by Amazon, I would like to suggest to Ring to either 1. offer tier discounts for multiple camera purchases 2. one or two add on service or for those who are already paying for one subscription 3. or at least provides 24-hour recording 4. or just mimick your parent companies' ACC 4 tier plan",Great Camera

The cable is recessed well into the back and it is hard to tell if it is plugged in and working. On this point I bought the 2-pack, one was extremely difficult to plug in the other moderately. Not a good design, and the reason for only 4 stars. Once over that hurdle, the cameras work quite well. The night vision initially wasn't very good, (all I could see is the reflections off my vehicles license plates) but it seems the cameras have adapted and both day and night vision is very good, both the clarity and field of vision. I like the capability to turn off the cameras when I am in the building so I don't get dozens of notifications as I move around. I will most likely handle this through my WIFI router though, as I can group the devices (inside cameras, outside cameras) and disable them together rather than individually. Maybe the Ring app has this capability and I just haven't found it yet.

You can't have the motion from ring cameras trigger the alarm, you can have the alarm trigger the cameras, but your limited by your internet bandwidth and they don't recommend activation more than 2 cameras, which would be fine if you could select which sensor triggers which cameras but that not possible currently. You can't link sensors to cameras, only the base station, so theres no way to map sensor X to camera Y. Only the entire alarm to some subset of cameras. Good luck dealing with that if you have multiple entry ways to monitor. You also can't select what mode you get motion notifications from your cameras in. You either always get notification, or never get any. That means setting it up to do something as basic as, ""only send me camera motion notifications when the alarm system is armed,"" isn't possible. You either have to deal with unending notifications all the time when you're home and lots of unwanted recordings, or no notifications at all when you're away, that or remember to manually turn on notifications when you leave your house. But whats the point of a ""smart"" system if it's that dumb. They seem to be adding features here and there, but some REALLY basic stuff is missing and it being on the second generation you'd really expect these features. I work in tech and its very disappointing to see these frankly rudimentary features missing. Put it this way, if I was an investor, you'd not be getting my seed money. Overall, if someone asked me if they should get a Ring system, I'd say wait if you intend to integrate it with cameras. It's a good design and easy to set up, but is lacking A LOT of what you would expect from a smart system.","Works generally, but leaves you wanting some frankly rudimentary features."

There is no easy way to save data locally. The Ring desktop app keeps sending motion alert although I disabled the motion alert and it was disabled property on Android app. therefore, whenever I turn on my laptop, it keeps sending me motion alerts.

Il These mini cams are the best security investments I've made in my home yet and I can now have a piece of mind.  I was always reluctant to purchase ring products because of the negative  reviews concerning software issues. Setup and pairing was flawless and a breeze. I'm running the Ring app on a Samsung note 8. The only small gripe I have is the ghosting in live view which is not an issue. I can always download minute by minute videos that are absent of this ghosting effect. I do have my doubts on the claimed 1080p resolution, though there is definitely enough detail in the footage to help prosecute burglars. I have one of the cams in a well lit 12 x 20 kitchen and was hoping for tack sharp stills but am aware that achieving perfect resolution in such a small lens is nearly impossible, either way this is a great setup. Ring cams + Glock feels much safer than ADT where there's a 10 to 15 minute police response time. I've only had the police dispatched twice in 17 years.

I have had no problems at all. Have one camera and have thought for a long time that I should have another one. Thought this mini indoor would be perfect. Got it yesterday and tried connecting it today. Spent over an hour trying to connect it to my system using my iPhone. No luck!! Called ring and they tried to help. I had two people work with me for at least half and hour each and they could not get it to connect and turned me over to someone more qualified. Worked with this person for an hour and she finally hung up on me. Didn't say she could not help me. She just hung up and left me sitting there holding the phone. Her thought was that there was something wrong with my router or something at my end. The router is top of the line and almost new and has the new 5g connection.

So I placed my Arenti and Ring cameras side by side in the shop. The Arenti still connects nearly immediately, while the Ring takes a while to connect. We tested the Ring motion detector in the shop to see if it would trip the Ring alarm quickly, and that did work well.

No issues with WiFi connectivity other than some issues connecting to Echo Show 8 and 5 then again on iPhone while away, other than that they seem to be working fine now. The ONLY reason this got a ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ overall is because of the limited locations it can be installed. There is a 10’ extended cable that can be added but this is still not long enough for where I wanted to mount the camera.

As a senior citizen living on my own I wanted to see if this could be beneficial down the road as a means for my sons to check on me.  The wide angle view and night vision are beyond my expectations!  If anyone were to come in my house there’s no way to avoid getting caught on video (even crawling!).  I have a smaller home but all outside doors are within view in a central location in my living room.  The motion detector is extremely sensitive so my cat trips it up but having the option to let it ‘snooze’ for a while helps immensely.  Having heard the reports many people are putting them in the rooms of family members in nursing homes to make sure their loved ones are getting the proper care would be a great idea (as long as it’s permitted—but if the nursing home has a problem with this I’d recommend going somewhere else!).

I started caring for my ailing mother in January. As she slept a lot, I initially got a baby monitor so that I could hear when she woke up. A few months passed and Mom stopped calling out. I had to go in every half hour to check on her to see if she had woken up. This got old really fast. I started looking at baby camera's that were compatible with the monitor so that I could check on her that way.  They were in the $100+ for a single camera! My husband suggested this camera as he uses it at his office. At more than half the price savings, I jumped on it. I am so glad I did! It allows me to keep an eye on Mom PLUS, it gives my siblings the opportunity to check on her when they are not here. As for privacy, I love that I am able to move and/or rotate the camera whenever I need. It's one of the minor reasons I have not mounted it. The main reason I haven't mounted it is that I want Mom to be the focus so I have it set closer to her than a wall or ceiling would permit. Yes, I can mount it and zoom in on the app, but I didn't want that hassle. I have recently had to start to use the zoom and can say it works great.

So we decided to use our old sound-only baby monitor to keep us informed of the babies sounds and if-when the baby noises alarm us we just say “Alexa, show us the kids room” and on any of our Amazon Devices “even on our TV with Fire Cube” the live video of our baby is shown and we can rest assured he is ok.

The cameras setup was pretty easy and the video quality and monitoring features were very good.  The 1-star rating is due to the way Ring insults our intelligence on their app.  They have a bright orange banner reminding you 24/7 about their Ring Protect Plans and even if you cancel the trial or notify Ring that you are not interested in this service, the banner remains. I followed their support team instructions and canceled the trial, installed and reinstalled the app but the orange banner is back with a different message. ""Your videos are not being saved. Learn more about the Ring Protect Plans."" That was explained to me when I canceled the trial and I acknowledged that I understood.  And yet, Ring decides I need to be reminded of that fact every time I open their app.  Also, the banner interferes with the function of the app. If you want to delete all events from a specific device, the banner blocks the ""Delete All"" button.  Had I known this before I purchased the Ring Cameras, I would have gone with a competitor's product. Ring don't insult our intelligence!

I unfortunately made that assumption. The app does not allow you to set a schedule of when not to record. You can prevent it from sending you audible phone alerts. However when you open the app it will have hundreds of alerts /recordings of you when you are home, even when you don’t want to be recorded. I don’t care about the privacy part however every time I go into the app there are hundreds of two minute recordings of when I am home. You literally can’t stop this unless you manually stop the recording every day. Why you can’t schedule when you want it to record (via motion detection) is ridiculous. It’s hard to find a recording you want to see when it’s swamped by hundreds of recordings you could care less about.","Terrible App, Don’t buy until better"

I have a Ring doorbell and Ring spot light cams and this was a great addition to the inside of my home that uses the same account as the other devices with no additional charge. I had some cheaper “baby cams” that I have used and I was having a lot of issues with them losing connection and they didn’t record. this ring cam is nice because it records all motion and saves it on my account.

Price is good and we already have the Ring app.  Like that it uses a standard usb plug. The Bad:  We tried using this in a nursery but the video quality is not very good in the dark even though it is supposed to be 1080p.  Also, when viewing the live feed, a bright blue light turns on which makes it impossible to check on the crib without waking up the baby.  The power cord is about 6' which is quite a bit shorter than some other camera brands so you can't mount the camera high on the wall unless there is an outlet very close by.  Speaking of wall mounting:  because the mount is so short, it is impossible to tilt the camera downward enough to see the entire crib.

This Ring camera replaced my Wyze cam which hasn’t been very reliable lately. Both are very good in terms of video quality. I also own a Amazon cloud cam and love that the ring camera has faster motion detection vs Cloud cam. However, the Ring cameras microphones are really bad, you can’t hear anything unless the noise is happening directly in front of the camera which is annoying. Also, the mounting hardware is very limited and stiff, I feel like you would have more versatility with a third party mounting hardware. I like how the power adapter and micro usb cable is one piece and low profile which prevents accidental unplugs. However the length itself is too short most other cameras, like the Amazon Cloud Cam come with a 10ft usb cable which is a great length.

I read others who reviewed it and it seems like the bad reviews came on setup. I first thought the same thing when I plugged it in at the beginning. If you don’t look very careful you’ll do the same thing I did. Where you plug  it in has a small clear dust cover over it, so when you think you got it right and won’t come on Look at the device and take out the clear plastic cover and try again Bam ! It’s alive and works grest",Love the Ring devices  PS remember to remove the small plastic covering over the plug in
