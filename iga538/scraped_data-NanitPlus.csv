Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2019,Samantha,"Night vision lights are extremely bright and very distracting. If my baby’s eyes flicker open for even a moment, the lights catch his eye and he’s awake and just stares at them until he becomes upset and starts crying. HUGE design flaw.",Red lights are bright and distracting. Very disappointed
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Nov 2018,Tom H,"We initially had the Nanit (original), and although that product had great picture clarity, was easy to set up, and had a very user-friendly and intuitive app, we were having regular connectivity issues.  As a result, we decided to upgrade and get this product, the Nanit Plus, which we were told by the (very patient and professional) support team, would resolve our previously reported connection problems.  And although the Nanit Plus has a number of other new features and improvements, for us it was really about being able to have a stable solution that was reliably available when we needed it most - for those late-night wake-ups where you're not sure if the baby just needs help getting their binky back, or if they're up and need a feeding, etc. After ordering, the unit arrived promptly and was very well packaged (it seems like they took packaging design cues from Apple; everything is very neatly and efficiently placed; it's all secure but still easy to access, with quickstart instructions right up front and nothing too heavy or looking like ""package gap fillers"").  As with the original Nanit, the Plus is SUPER easy to set up and install, and I had it up and running literally in about 4 minutes.  It was definitely a much better install and setup experience than we'd had with other crib-cams that we've used from other brands.  The only thing that I had to reach out to Nanit about was rolling the associated Insights service/account to the new camera. One of the things my wife and I noticed right off the bat, is that the camera's resolution and picture clarity within the app are really sharp - the images and video are super-crisp even in nightvision mode.  The sound quality is fine (let's be honest, it's going to be as much limited by the speakers on your smartphone as anything else, but it's good to know that the mic and everything on the sending-side is of good quality).  The Plus now also allows you to talk (or sing) to your child with an integrated speaker - something we don't really use, but is nice to have available. Most importantly, though, the camera stays connected to the network!  The Plus has a greatly improved chipset, better antenna/receiver setups, and is able to cling to the wifi network in the house far better than the Nanit original, or the Motorola we had before that.  Because of the design of the Nanit with the floor mount (or wall-mount) placing it directly over the crib, you get the clearest, most unobstructed view of your child - something I didn't necessarily think was that big a deal, until I had the Nanit.  That placement is also key to the Nanit Insights - it's their own sleep analysis service that provides you with information about the quality of your baby's sleep.  Along with insights, Nanit provides tips and pointers (based on sound clinical practice and the latest understanding of sleep behavior, sleep improvement, etc.) that are actually useful and actionable - without seeming condescending or patronizing. There are other fairly typical features associated with the Nanit like sound, motion, temperature and humidity reporting (and, you can set alerts based on user-defined thresholds or sensitivity levels for each) that are all easy to access within the app.  Nanit also takes a unique approach to access, allowing the ""owner"" (primary user) to set up a ""parenting team"" of other users that can access the camera through the app.  It also lets you snap pictures from the live feed, which you can share. Overall, the whole product (hardware, software, app) is exceptionally well-designed and executed.  More importantly, perhaps, the company's customer service and technical support teams are some of the best I've ever had to work with.  When we were having connection issues with the earlier model, they were always super-patient, understanding, professional, and prompt with any followups or offline responses.  Fortunately, with the Plus, you're far less likely to ever need to contact support for an issue resolution, though.  Where we used to have connection issues or have to reset or reboot previous crib-cams, we've had the Plus up continuously for 5 days without a single hiccup. I absolutely and unequivocally recommend Nanit to anyone who's looking for a crib-cam solution that is feature-rich, provides crystal-clear video and audio, and is easy to set up and use.  Don't even waste your time with the other brands.",The Plus is everything you'd hope a Kid-cam could be
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Apr 2019,Emily K Dempsey,"If this worked properly, it would be an amazing monitor option! The problem is the connectivity (or frequent loss of connectivity). We have 1G service to our house, multiple wireless repeaters on each floor, but still consistently lose wifi connection with the monitor despite multiple troubleshooting efforts. We still used the camera function but got a cheap, audio only, monitor to supplement. When it was connected, the audio flickers in and out non-stop, which is fine during the day but horrible when you're trying to sleep at night.  I would also wake up in the morning and it would give me the night time report that the connection was lost for a hour here, hour there, when I was asleep! It is so unreliable, I don't trust it as my only monitor with a newborn baby. I love the Insights feature, it has a great camera and night vision, but at the end of the day I need to go to sleep knowing I will be able to hear my baby if there is an issue, which I can't trust will happen with the Nanit. I wish I would have spent money on something else.",Major wifi connectivity issues make this unreliable!!!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jul 2019,LG,"The camera quality is not great. There is a loud click when it switches from night vision to color picture (daytime) there is about a 5 second delay between the camera and your phone. I didn’t like the fact that some features are only available if you get a subscription. As if the monitor wasn’t pricey enough. If I wasn’t taking care of a newborn, and taking it downs wasn’t such a task,  I would have returned it.",I’d keep looking for other options.
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2019,Lauren V,"After being disappointed with three different models of traditional monitors (we tried Samsung, Motorola and another I can’t remember) due to their poor picture quality, terrible battery life and inability to monitor from outside the home, we decided to switch to a WiFi monitor and bought the new Nanit model. So far we love it. First, I was really impressed with the setup experience. The app walked me through every single step and the whole process only took a few minutes. Once I had it up and running, I couldn’t believe how clear the video was - it’s HD quality, even in night vision. The motion and sound alerts are super clear and without any delay. In fact I really like that I can minimize the Nanit app and still hear my son crying or talking even if I’m using another app or my phone is locked. It’s also nice not having to carry around another bulky electronic device (a handheld) in addition to my phone. Another thing that’s cool about the Nanit is that my husband and I can check in on our son when we have a babysitter over or are traveling on business (something we couldn’t do with our old monitors). Finally, the sleep tracking is an awesome feature but I haven’t had to use it much now that the little guy is reliably sleeping through the night. I’ll certainly be buying another Nanit camera before our second baby arrives this summer and we go back to square one on the sleep training situation though. I definitely recommend this product!",Finally found a baby monitor we love!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2018,Singh,"My wife and I are expecting our second baby and purchased this product to prepare. We decided to test it for couple weeks on our 2 year old daughter and we loved it. We're actually contemplating buying another Nanit plus to replace our current cam!! We love this monitor and after having used multiple baby cameras in the past, we are glad we found the Nanit Plus! PROS: WIDE ANGLE VIEW & IMAGE QUALITY- The HD camera is pretty clear and the night vision does wonders. The audio feedback in the app at night is actually pretty low compared to some of other monitors we tried which we like because we we can really only hear it when she's awake or she cries. SLEEP TRACKING: We haven't really used all the features on this yet but the dashboard is pretty cool, it tells a bunch of stuff about sleep efficiency and how long it took her to fall asleep. TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY - We argued countless nights on whether it was too cold or too hot in our daughters room before getting this camera. This is the only monitor we found that has this feature and its priceless! Now there's no more wondering what the temperature is like at night in our baby's room and we can turn the heat on as needed. EASY SETUP: Wi-Fi and App Setup were very easy and straightforward. Took just under 5 minutes! CONS: LITTLE PRICEY: The monitor was a little on the expensive side but the added features (Room Temp, Easy Setup) make it worth the price SUMMARY: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Overall, we would highly recommend this baby monitor to all the parents and soon-to-be parents out there. The Nanit Plus has all the bells & whistles of a top of the line baby monitor with added features that no other baby monitors in the market have. You will not be disappointed!",Nanit Plus is a great product - Worth the price!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Oct 2019,Sarah,"Update 10/2020 - one year in and, well, its still a good camera, but after the first free year of what is called ""insights"" - tells you how long baby slept, memories, review the night, nap quality, etc. - it is literally just a $300 camera. For that, get yourself a $25 Wyze cam and call it a win. Unless you want to keep paying for insights ($50/yr or $5/month). The insights price is reasonable and I really like the features, but I realize now that there are other good quality cameras on the market, not advertised as a baby cams, that are just as good (i.e. the Amazon Wyze cam). ______________________ Original review: This baby monitor is excellent! We have been using it for a few weeks with our first baby and it has been a relief. We can put him down for naps during the day (because he still sleeps at night in our room) and not worry. The app notifies you when sound or motion is detected. The best feature is that you can leave sound running in the background of your phone while you use it for other things. The picture is excellent and the night sight is particularly impressive. You can also zoom in from your phone to see the baby closer. It is a battery drainer, but still worth the purchase.",Excellent picture and quality

However, it is not pairing with my iPhone as seen in the attached picture. I tried with many different telephones and models but still not working even with iPad. It gives Auth-1 error.

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jul 2019,Kristina B,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This camera has by far been the Best baby camera we have bought!  We purchased several cameras before but I never fully felt confident in any of them as I do with Nanit.  Some would lose connection, some had horrible night vision and others I wasn’t quite sure if it was truly safe. As first time parents we of course worried and continue to worry about everything and we wanted peace of mind knowing our little one was safe at night.  This camera will tell you the temperature and humidity of your baby’s  room and will alert you if either one of those go out of range. It will also alert you if there is movement and sound in the crib. The insight membership truly is worth it because  you can track your baby’s sleep progression.  It breaks everything down in videos and you can make notes and add family members to the live feed. Also, did I mention you can watch your baby sleep from anywhere!  So when I work late, I still can’t see my son sleeping.  Nanit also has a very tightknit security system which was one of the main reasons why we decided to go with Nanit. Our baby’s security was our main priority. So if you are questioning whether you should get this product or not. Do yourself a favor and stop stressing and reading and endless reviews (because, I did the same thing) just buy the camera. It is so worth it!",Best Baby Camera on the Market!!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2018,Amazon Customer,"Very clear when the lights are on but 99% of the time you're using the baby monitor when the lights are off. For the price, quite disappointed at the night time clarity and glitchy video. A friend's baby monitor they bought 4 years ago still has a better night time picture then this one. Music / White Noise feature is not operational yet. Camera automatically switches between day and night vision but rarely switches two daytime vision even when the lights are on all the way.",Not worth the price

Well first thing I found out is all the 'Insights' are $10 a month, or $100/yr for that info. so be aware - this is nearly $300 for the unit, AND $100 a year for the sleep analysis, ect. Then comes the quality of the image. Mine could not seem to switch off 'night mode' unless sunlight was pour DIRECTLY into our nursery. Tech support told me theres some secret setting you can Force it into day mode, but of course the video was very dark and noisey. The night light is basically useless, so dim its basically just enough so you can see the outline of the camera over the crib so you dont hit your head on it. We ended up returning this, and gettin the plus, and its resolved most of the issues, day mode works correctly, nightlight is brighter, insights are still $100 tho.",Not what I expected for the price - the Plus model is much better
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2020,Patrice R.,"The application is ok, but could use some improvements. I'm not sure what justifies your baby as being asleep, but it noted my daughter being asleep when she was not. She had her eyes open and was playing with her hands, but the Nanit said she was asleep - ""I fell asleep 20 minutes ago"". Because this information is not accurate, I cannot rely on it for nap wake ups. Also, as others have mentioned, the night vision light is very distracting. It's a red ring and as it's above the crib, a baby can wake up and be mesmerized by it. Also, there have been times where I can hear the Live sound, but can't see the Live video. One feature I wish it had like the Cubo or Miku is the ability to go back to see video. Yes, the Nanit provides a summary, but it should retain at least 12 hours of video.","Nanit Plus ""Asleep"" notification is not accurate."
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2020,JH2,"This package is for the intended use that the camera is mounted to a wall over the baby's crib, if you don't plan on drilling holes into your nursery, then you will need to purchase separately the multi-stand which allows you to prop the camera on a bookshelf or similar to give you a more aerial view of the room vs. a direct view of inside the crib. I think they also sell floor stands separately that gives you the ability to still view over the baby's crib and not have to drill any holes, but you will need room for a standing lamp-like object if that makes sense. Overall the camera was very easy to set up and install, the app is user-friendly and we've noticed it works fine so far. The speakers on the camera is very clear as well. The only thing we've noticed so far is that the camera ""detects"" movement or activity anytime the nursery door is open and we turn on the outside hallway light, we think it's picking up the light from the hall but even then our crib is a solid 10 ft away from the door so the sensor to this is pretty strong, which could be viewed as a good or bad thing. Happy with purchase though!",Comforting knowing we have a good baby monitor

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Dec 2018,Brandon Roth,"Overall I do really like this camera.  It was really easy to set up, though it instructed us to place it really high up which would've been too high for his crib.  Also, in setting it up to ""see"" his crib, we had to remove his mobile b/c it didn't like it in the way.  We have an older kid so this is the 3rd camera we've used and there are some things i love and some things i don't.  Our other cameras are traditional camera/monitor set up.  This one runs off the app on your phone/tablet which is nice to not have an extra ""thing"" to carry but kills my phone battery and I haven't figured out how to shut off the alerts so when I'm out of the house/at work I don't get alerted for all the sounds/motion (might be nice to have a feature where if the phone isn't on the same wifi network you could mute the alarms).  One other thing that has taken some getting used to is that the sound never goes off - with our other monitor there is a peep mode so if the baby is quiet/not moving it goes into sleep mode and turns on when there's noise/movement.  This just constantly runs so I'm forever hearing his sound machine!  There's also a bit of a delay so I hear the baby cry and then hear it on the monitor.  The picture quality is probably the best of all three cameras we have and the night vision works well.  I have been using it with my 10 month old for about a month and love the alerts of when he makes noise/moves/wakes up/goes to sleep that the insights gives but I don't know that I'd be willing to pay for it beyond the free trial.",Great camera (with some quirks)
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2019,DW,"Let me start at the beginning. The first inconvenience was that you can only pair this piece of crap with the wifi network your phone currently is in. Wouldn’t be an issue, if this piece of crap had a halfway decent wifi adapter built in. My phone is always connected to our home’s 5Ghz network, not the 2.4Ghz. 5Ghz is rated for faster speeds, but doesn’t carry as far as 2.4. This piece of crap is installed just two rooms down from where our wifi router is—mind you, we live in a typical American 2x4/plywood/drywall home, nothing made of concrete and steel—and its signal was so weak that we had to switch to the 2.4 Ghz network. This meant of course that I had to get my phone on that network first. Either way, signal strength was stronger, but overall speeds were of course slower, which degraded the picture quality. No problem, we decided to look past that. After about a day or two, we noticed that it lost connection. So we had to “re-pair” the piece of crap. Two days later, the same thing. Now, it’s at least 2-3 times a day. We live in a major metropolitan area and have excellent wifi. We cannot trust this thing to monitor a pillow, much less our baby. We’re beyond upset and disappointed. Will be returning it.",$300 Piece of Crap!

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2018,JRo,Everything would work great but the main problem of this monitor are the ALERTS...the alerts in your phone wont wake you up at night. Simple as that...and there is no way to customize the alerts. Now the installation on the wall and the lack of stand alone support is a pain. For the price is too much...if you add lack of mobility without paying hundreds for accessories...is not worth it.,Too much money for the real value
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2020,Jenna,"I've been using the Nanit since late September 2019, when my son was born. It has always had issues with connectivity. The connection typically goes out several times a day. However, the break in streaming used to correct itself within thirty seconds or so, which didn't bother me enough to return it. Over the last couple of weeks, however, the system has lost connection for hours at a time, throughout the day and night. Nanit's troubleshooting guide suggests that you check your internet connection, restart your router, etc. After going through all these steps multiple times (even though we have excellent WiFi and none of our other devices are having issues), the camera is still unreliable. The first time I emailed Nanit for support, I received a generic response about twelve hours later, advising that there was a systems issue that had since been resolved. However, I continued to have the same problems, so I emailed again. I never even got a response to that email. I finally submitted a warranty claim request, but haven't heard any response on that, either. The complete lack of customer service is just amazing. Especially when this product is preventing me from being able to monitor my child when he sleeps. It scares me to wake up in the middle of the night and look over to the monitor, only to find that it's not even working. This product is too expensive to be having these kinds of issues. I finally had to buy another monitor and will be mailing this one back to Nanit for a refund. Strongly advise against buying this unreliable product.",Horrible Connectivity & Customer Service
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2018,Z'sMommy,"I've been using the Nanit Plus for about a month now, and have had a great experience. I like that the camera is mounted above your child, so that you get a full view of the entire crib. The setup time was about 5-10 minutes, and my husband did the drilling/wall mounting, and I did the camera setup. I have only used it mounted, but purchased the stand to use when we travel. Night vision is very clear, and the zoom feature is easy to use. The night light offers a low dim that is good for changing diapers, or locating something in a dark room without bothering the baby. I use the sound machine every night, and like that I can turn it on with my phone, usually while nursing to help get the bedtime routine started. This is the first camera I have used that doesn't have its own viewing monitor, and I love that it can be viewed/controlled by my phone! I seemed to always misplace the old viewing monitor, and every time I needed it, the battery would be dead. Also like the benefit of having more than just my phone as the viewer, since we have it on my husbands as well. The Insights is a cool way to track your child's sleeping patterns. This would have been a great service to use when my child was younger, and sleep training felt like it was never going to end.  They send encouraging tips and try to be positive about teaching your child to sleep on their own. The service does come with a free month trial, but then is about $10 a month after (although I have seen several specials!). I would recommend this camera to any parent, and the Insights to any NEW parent. The information that Insights gives would be especially helpful when trying to understand your child's sleep habits and trying to help them to sleep for longer stretches. I am knocking 1 star off since this camera is not just a one and done purchase. You would need to purchase the Insights service if you wanted to, which adds on to the price.",A wi-fi camera/video monitor like nothing else

We had to manually size her crib areas and visitation areas because the monitor couldn't recognize the proper area. I've had it for 3 weeks and  it has yet to successfully log my daughter's sleep. Without properly logged sleep, the insights are pointless. This is just a monitor that sends the image to my phone. It constantly disconnects the live feed (it's 10 ft from the router and the only thing using bandwidth at night). I've swapped between out 2.4 and 5g speeds and still constant disconnects. If by some miracle it does stay connected, it registers that my daughter is awake all night, even when she is clearly asleep. It doesn't pick up half of our night feedings visits. When it takes her 10 mins to fall asleep, it will say hours. Also, the night vision lights have become my daughter's new best friend. They are so bright in her room they she stays awake cooing and talking to them. I have gone in and edited each nights data to try and provide feedback but there is no improvement. My daughter sleeps in a Smilo Bassinet inside her bed with a nested bean sleep sack. She does have active REM sleep but generally settles down after a few mins into a deeper sleep. The monitor misses all of that. I like the quality of the images, the night vision, and that it's available on our phones instead of a standalone monitor.

I have asus 11000 router with 1x2.4 and 2x5ghz bands. The Nanit was installed properly and is easy to setup, but the device feed continously glitches. The device never lost network connectivity, but the video feed will fail to load or glitch. The sound goes in and out when streaming on mobile device or tablet. I use note 10+ and play the audio in background with screen off. After 10-15 minutes the sound glitches in and out. Eventually it will stop entirely. Not worth the money, and we really wanted to love this camera. I worked with nanit support for nearly a month. The router is 5 feet away from the camera. They wanted me to reset and put on 2.4ghz instead of 5ghz. I complied and wasn't able to stream video over the lowest bandwidth setting. Looked like a TV video from the 80s. Was so grainy that we couldn't tell of the babies eyes were open or closed when zoomed in. On the 5ghz I could set it on a network by itself and let it have all the bandwidth it wanted. Also note we have 1gig fiber in our house. I gave the nanit unprecedented access on that network. No intrusion policy, no firewall access restrictions, and no qos policy. It still had issues no matter the solutions that were given. The nanit support was timely and tried to he helpful. But the device is just not there. I asked if it could be defective and they told me it was my router. However, I ran tests and looked into my router configuration and other devices. None of them have any issues at all. Ran extensive diagnostics for 5 days including heavy bandwidth traffic without a single issue or lost packet.","Love the concept, but they fail to even come close to hitting the target."

Too complicated for me to do since you have to have the app too & sync and everything..however once it was all set up above my son's crib ..I instantly loved it! and still do. I like the design of it and the night vision (no need to have a night light on in order to see what your baby is up to at night) which is great! Another of my favorite things is that it records snippets of video through the night for you . that you can go back & review. I love that! What mom wouldn't love that? The only thing I've had a little problem with is the amount of battery it uses on my cell to be able to watch my baby. it drains it so be sure to plug your cell phone at night . Other than that I love Nanit Plus ! the picture is great too . You can also talk to your baby . This has worked great for us since when my boy wakes up, he starts moving around so I can calm him down with my voice while I'm walking to his nursery before he starts crying & wakes up everyone else :) so this is really helpful for us since we have a preschooler in the next room that needs his rest!

This is the third baby monitor that I've tried, but the first without a parent unit. I wasn't sure I would like having to use my phone/iPad as the receiver, but it's really not bad. The picture quality on this is truly amazing, I love it! The sleep analysis features on the app are really cool, but after a 30 day trial period you have to pay for this. I'm not sure it will be worth it for me, but we'll see. I do like seeing the time-lapse videos they have! Pros: - The picture quality is AMAZING! You get a full HD view of the crib, and can also take photos straight from the app. - Set up was so easy! It took no time at all and could not have been simpler. - The app functions well and the alerts for sound and movement are really nice. Cons: - The app seems to drain my phone battery pretty quickly. My phone is not new, so that could definitely be part of the problem. - There is no way to really adjust the camera, so while this is amazing for a baby in a crib, you will not be able to see the rest of the room once the child is no longer sleeping in their crib. I don't think it will be as long lasting as some other monitors. - The cord is really, really long. Our outlet is not very far away from the crib, so we have a lot of excess cord.",Amazing Picture Quality!

AMAZING. I hemmed and hawed over getting it for MONTHS, but finally bit the bullet when our angel care monitor died and the baby started sleeping on her belly. it is worth every single penny. I love looking at the trends, the heatmap of where she likes to sleep, the alerts that both my hubby and I get on our phone and apple watches. We feel so calm knowing that we can watch her and check on her and see her breathing, the temperature of the room, etc. PLUS, the app shows trends and provides some tips/tricks based on how well (or in our case not well) the baby is sleeping. it's AWESOME. don't wait!",Piece of mind. worth every penny
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Aug 2020,Ashley,"We bought the Nanit plus for my daughter who is now one. The connection goes out pretty often. When trying to connect with WiFi the monitor takes forever to load if at all. We got our first year of the free insights but now that we don’t have it all you can do is see live. You can’t see when she woke up or went to sleep. Just seems like very basic features for all the money we already spent. But in order to see any history or any information besides temp and humidity you have to pay extra. It said somewhere that it could be as low as $50 but the only number I was offered was $129. We bought the wall mount and ended up buying the multi stand because I like to be able to see her when we are away from home. That was another $50. It just seems like you pay high dollar and to get any of the features they talk about, you have to pay more. To me it’s not worth it and I wish that I would have gotten a cheaper one that you don’t have to pay extra for everything. Totally regret this purchase.",Not worth it
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2019,Jen Wilson,"We have been using the Nanit monitor for our 10 month old now for a little over one month. We have had a 2 different video monitors and a basic sound monitor in the past for this child and our 3 year old daughter. The Nanit has certainly been the best in several categories including: picture quality, ease of use, and helping us to improve sleep habits. You get one free month of Nanit insights, which gives you data on how well your child sleeps at night/naps and also gives suggestions on how to help them sleep better. After hiring a sleep coach with our first child, I liked this function. It is $10-30 per month after depending on what one you choose, or you can just get the video function without any additional cost. The only con we can think of is that the insights have been wrong, but they offer a feature that allows you to report this so they can make it better.",Helping us get more sleep!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Feb 2020,Lauren,"This monitor is not worth $300. It constantly disconnects (to the point where I've been sleeping and have had no idea how long my child was screaming since it disconnected), has an annoying 5 second delay, and only leaves you one option which is to mount it to the wall. The incentive for me to buy this was the insights option, which is free for the first year. Not at all worth it. I can keep track of how long my child sleeps. There's also a free app that works just as well as this camera by using your phone along with another device. I'm currently trying to sell my nanit so I can buy a real monitor. Don't fall for this trendy option.",Waste of money!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2019,Andrew Long,"This product is amazing!  What I love most about the Nanit is that it's so many different products in 1 with such an easy-to-use app.  The Nanit is a baby monitor, a two-way talking device, a sleep monitor as well as a room temperature device.  The set up was incredibly easy and the picture is so clear.  I love that I can have this app on multiple devices so that my husband can check in on his phone, as can my mom when she comes to babysit on her phone.  And then we have it loaded on our iPad so anyone that is watching him can go right into the app and see/hear him!  The fact that it's not another baby device to have to lug around the house with you, like other monitors, means that you have the ease of using your phone (which you are already keeping my your side anyway.) I love the two-way talk feature that allows you to listen in from afar, speak into the device and be heard into the baby's room.  When my husband gets a notification at work that there is sound coming from our son's crib or that the Nanit detects movement (which is super cool), he can go into the app and chime in to say hi if we are doing a diaper change!  It's a fun feature that makes our infant's head turn when he hears Dad's voice even when he's not home. It gives Dad the opportunity to see him in real-time while he's at work and see what's going on, so you don't need to be in the house to view. Our son was born in the Fall.  We had our first below-freezing night and I wanted to ensure he wasn't too cold.  The temperature is clearly displayed on the home screen so you can make sure your baby isn't in a room that is too cold or hot. What I really love are the notifications you receive.  The notifications allow you to playback the sound and video when sound or motion is detected.  This is great for babysitters.  And a really nice feature are the inbox items- they are full with tips and tricks on how to have your baby experience better sleep based on their age. The Nanit's main goal is to have your baby get the best sleep he/she can get- which means YOU get more sleep!  It is definitely worth the investment merely for the ease of use.  With all the baby gear on the market, it can be overwhelming to learn how to use all the new gadgets.  With the Nanit, it'll be super easy to setup and use (that even grandparents can handle.) Highly recommend!",Awesome product!

Went to connect the camera to the wall mount and it felt very flimsy on the mount.  Tried to power it on and it never turned on.  I went through all the steps properly and did all the troubleshooting I could but never could get it to turn on. I was going to just get a replacement but I noticed the app had a lot of 1 star reviews recently.  I figured I would just get a full refund and find a different camera instead of having to mess with it all again and maybe have a bad experience with the app as well. Not only that but removing the whole thing tore a bunch of chunks of paint and drywall out when I removed it, despite being as careful as I could.",Never worked out of the box

Tech support is slow, and rude. It took 3 days to get back to me with issues when I had no way to monitor my infant. I am not the only one with these issues. I found many many people with similar complaints on Instagram and Twitter. This camera is totally unreliable. I am so disappointed. It was great but after some updates it had been horrible. Indo not reccomend. I've had many many sleepless nights unable to monitor my baby. This is everything I wanted in a baby monitor. I have been using for a couple months now and it is very reliable, sound and video quality are amazing. My husband can peek in and say goodnight from work which is important to us.

We decided to try the nanit plus and were excited for the bonus insights feature. However, we’ve had this camera set up for 2 days and it has “trying to reconnect to your camera” for most of the day. I’ve tried lowering bandwidth, re-pairing to WiFi, and unplugging the camera. None of it seemed to help. My router is on the same floor as the camera and less than 20’ away. All of my other smart home devices don’t have this problem. We were excited for this monitor but unfortunately, I can not recommend it especially for night time sleeping when no audio is heard due to the camera disconnecting. Connecting via Bluetooth as an alternative would be a good feature. It would be helpful to get a notification when the camera is offline/restores connection and also take into account that the camera is offline for the insights report.",Unreliable and disappointing

I liked the Cocoon cam a lot and was sad to see it go, but I figured this camera was so popular on the market that it could only be better, right? Wrong! Nighttime quality on this camera is HORRIBLE. It is literally a blurry mess and you only see the frame of the baby. We also purchased the band that goes around the body of your child to measure the heart rate. This is the worst part of the camera. We have had multiple false alarms in the past 3 months and all it does is scare the crap out of our child! I followed the direction on how to put the band on, we made sure to use plain pajamas and bedsheets so the cameras hear monitoring does not get confused, and yet the loud siren wakes us up in the middle of the night to a false alarm. I can actually playback the moment before the alarm goes off to see my child moving and this thing still goes off. All this is, is an over priced camera! The ONLY benefit I can list is how easy it is to take it off the wall mount to use on the desk mount when traveling. Other than this, it is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",Not Worth The Money

When we decided we wanted to give my mother in law that monitor, we decided to upgrade instead of getting the same optix monitor. Really wish we had just sprung for this one initially considering the other was expensive too. It’s so nice to have the monitor on my phone, which I initially thought would be a downside. My husband loves being able to peek in on him napping while he’s at work. Getting a time lapse of the whole night tells us so many things about his sleep position, exactly how often he wakes but doesn’t cry, etc. He sleeps so well and now we have a better sense of why and when he does have wake ups we can troubleshoot. I feel more at ease with this monitor bc of how it records what has happened and you can go back. Highly recommend this to any parent, esp. first time parents!",Just buy it!

When I was shopping for a monitor, one of the features I needed was the ability to move it temporarily to a different room and to take it along on trips. Among the features listed on Nanit Plus Wall Mount page, along with “unmatched reliability “ and Alexa compatibly, there was a multi-stand, and so I assumed that both reliability and multi-stand come with the product (unlike, say, breathing blankets that are clearly marked as sold separately). When we tried to install the monitor before my baby's arrival, we discovered that the multi-stand is not included. I contacted Amazon pointing out the deliberately misleading description on their page but they refused to do anything about it. Obviously, we returned this product. I ended up buying a much cheaper Philips Avent SCD570/10 Dect Baby Monitor and could not be happier. It works in a large house and can easily be taken on trips and visits.

I have a 4 month old who has been sleeping on our bed.  It is time to have her sleep in her crib, but we wanted a reliable baby cam before we made the change.  I currently have 4 Wyze cameras and I like them, but we wanted a more robust camera. I am not Mr. Handy around the house.  I can hold my own, but  I hate to put things up on the walls or do anything that requires tools and measuring.  With this camera, it was so easy.  Nanit provides a measuring cardboard tape to make measuring a breeze (error proof).  The mounting is also super easy and difficult to screw up.  I intentionally deviated from the instructions a bit and positioned the camera off center from the crib. We could not be happier with this purchase.  Do yourself a favor and if you are in the market for a baby came, this is a great choice. I waited a while to do the review.  I wanted to make sure the camera performed well over time and it has.  My girlfriend and I have the Nanit app on our phones and we use multiple Alexa Shows to display the Nanit.  It has been super convenient!",Delighted

I have always been skeptical of WiFi monitors, however Nanit does a great job with security and made me feel very safe on this topic.  The picture quality is amazing and I LOVE how far I can zoom in (see pics) I can see my babies chest rise and fall!  The night light is a great feature for a nursery and helpful when a babysitter is here and not as familiar with the room.  It was also very easy to set up on a tablet at our home for babysitters or family who might be watching the kids rather than giving them access to the app on their personal devices.

The picture quality is amazing. You can hear everything and see such a wide range of things as well. I also love how the Nanit app will give you a free trial of the analytics of how your child sleeps before you purchase it. If I would have purchased this when my youngest was a newborn, those analytics would have come in such great handy. With her being an older baby, we necessarily don’t need it, but still such a great thing to have access to. The last great thing about this monitor is that I can access it from any where because of the app on my iPhone.

The information and usability is pretty good. The main issue is that certain functions are dependent on their online servers which are clearly overloaded. So seeing a video you can wait up to 1-2 minutes. If you are outside of home and want to see the video be ready to wait or sometimes simply not working. Most camera providers run into this issue where they started providing these services for free then they start charging. At this point it is still free but it barely works,Good product but only works if you are in same wireless

All broke down after a month of use. I decided to finally go for the Nanit after hesitating because it’s not 360* rotatable. But honestly with the Birdseye perspective you don’t need it! And also there is a multistand available to carry the camera to different places. My baby is now 9 month old and he is a really bad sleeper. I like how the app insides provides tips to improve sleeping time. The App runs fine. Every now and than you can experience a small lag but that could just be my internet connection. You are able to run the app in the background and you’ll here live noise action. Sometimes when you switch bAck to the app the camera picture takes a while to load. But this problem is easy solved by clearing the Nanit app from the cache and restarting it. So you’ll miss only 3 secs! The microphone quality could be better but I do not care much about that. Big pro is the nightlight that you can increase or lower percentage wise within the app. So if you have to do a visit during the night you won’t need to turn any bright lights on. A bit of a con are the red light dots on the camera. They are definitely a bit distracting my little one. He had to get used to it.",Nightlight and app insides great!

The quality of video on this camera is so poor, it’s equivalent to 480p at best. I have no idea why a $300 baby monitor does not come with at least a 1080p camera, our $40 baby monitor has significantly better camera quality during day and night vision. Any sort of zoom makes the camera view grainy and essentially useless. Sound and notifications are almost instantaneous, which is perfect for a baby monitor. I do not recommend this camera and will not until they release a version with at least a 1080p camera, at $300 it is unacceptable that a baby monitor in 2020 does have have a 1080p camera.","Great sound and movement notifications, horrible video quality."

In the fog and craze of having a new baby, it's so helpful to be able to look at the sleep metrics/log so I can see exactly when and how he fell asleep, how long which helps me to anticipate his next nap, bedtime, and see how well he's sleeping through the night. These features were also so so helpful in making the transition from bassinet in our room to crib in his nursery. All of the sleep tips provided on the app are consistent with what I learned in the little baby sleep class I took and were actually really helpful to have as reminders right there. I don't know of any other monitor that provides all of these services and the birds-eye view is also something I love that I don't think any other monitor offers!

I love that I can pull up the feed on my phone anytime I want. I also love that I can take pictures in the app to capture priceless moments. The picture and sound are both great, it has a temperature and humidity gage, and the app allows you to talk to baby, turn a light on over the crib, and play either white noise or lullabies through the camera. I love that it doesn’t cut out when the internet goes out. My only complaint with it is that it is a bit passive aggressive because it says hey mom I fell asleep __ minutes ago. But if you rock your baby and/or they don’t fight sleep when you put them down it says hey mom I was helped to sleep. Then they send you emails about how to get your baby to sleep on the own and sleep through the night if it notices you go in to comfort/feed them during the night. Lastly we had to turn off the notifications because they were excessive, but you can adjust that in the settings on the app",Best baby monitor!!

We originally had the Cocoon cam, which had a ton of better features than this camera offers for half the price. Unfortunately they went out of business and decided to screw all of their customers after killing their app and forcing you to use an app that took all of the features away that made it a viable option to continue using. The Nanit camera quality is absolutely terrible for a $300 camera. With the $150 Cocoon camera (and plenty of very cheap $30-50 cameras) you can make out fine details. We can barely even tell if our daughter’s eyes are open with this camera. We honestly feel ripped off! If it didn’t offer background audio (which it does), it would have been sent back the same day. I just don’t understand why an expensive baby camera that is so lacking in features costs as much as it does and has a night vision camera that would be on par with the technology of a decade or two ago. I would save your money and look elsewhere. The installation kit and sound quality is very top notch, but the video kills any pros that I could add for those two things.",Very low quality video for the price

It alerts to movement and sound and allows full time monitoring on the phone.  Since it looks like most of their sales come through Amazon, I expected Alexa integration to be there.  However, the Alexa integration is pitiful and more of a check the box.  That is why it is getting 3 stars from me.  Sticking an Arlo above the crib with Alexa would be better as a baby monitor than Nanit.  It truly is disappointing since they are charging $300 for this.  The Alexa skill is utterly useless.  I would expect you to be able to monitor and receive alerts from Nanit with the Alexa skill, but you can forget about it. Update 10/19/2019 Went from 3 to 4 stars with the new swaddles that monitor breathing rates.  I still want an Alexa app with video.

They both had bad acid reflex and I was so scared they would choke on their sleep. Long story short I had no sleep for years because I could not find a camera I could trust enough. This time around pregnancy number 2 and baby number 3 I did my homework and read all the reviews about all the baby cameras. I feel very confident with this cameras first of all NO FALSE POSITIVES, of baby wakes up I get an alert, same if he cries, the app open FAST, so I can just tap and BAM there it is, also great video quality even in night vision mode, I also love the night summary, I can see how long baby stayed in the crib and how much he slept, how many times you went in baby room, how many times baby was out of the crib. You can easy see baby breathing pattern on the app, I remember how many times I woke up at night with the twins wondering if they were breathing, so this is a huge plus also no medical device attached to my baby just a band.

Installing the camera was fairly easy. I drilled 3 holes in the wall, screwed with the screws, the leveler is already attached and then just hung it up. The cover for the wire has the tape and you just stick it on. It was very simple. This smart baby monitor is perfect for newborns and infants. The Nanit plus is installed over the crib, bassinet, playpen wherever your child sleeps permanently. It monitors when the baby falls asleep, when the baby wakes up and when you go to the crib to care for the baby. You get a night summary of how long your baby was in bed, how long they actually slept and the amount of times you visited their bed. It also records those moments. In the dashboard you get a breakdown of the sleep efficiency and how well your baby is sleeping. Some great features are that you can speak through the monitor and hear as well. You get alerts whenever there is movement or sound. So if you have a smart watch you don’t even need to have your phone on you to know that your baby is awake. Nanit tells you the temperature and humidity in the room.  You can also play sounds (white noise, birds, waves, wind) Some cons Limited movement of the camera. It’s over the crib so it’s really perfect for when they are a baby and they stay in their crib. However, when they get older and you want to watch them in their bed and then if they get out you cant really control it from your phone to move it around the room.

I haven’t started the free trial of the tracking/recording yet because baby doesn’t sleep full time in his room yet.  But I can update my review once that happens.,Love this monitor!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,Ben Webne,We are obsessed with our Nanit. After researching sooooooo many nursery cams this by far is the best. My favorite features are that you can keep the background noise on your phone being the nursery cam as you do other stuff on your phone. I use my phone as the nursery cam and this is awesome! Insights is great too because it tracks your babies sleep and gives them a rating and then tips on how to improve. I didn’t realize I didn’t have a consistent bed time and the camera called me out! I started giving my baby a consistent bed and she slept better and then the camera congratulated me for improving that haha. The night light is great....dim light perfect for night time feedings. The sound machine is great too. I bought wall mount and the portable accessory which I used first for when baby was in my room in the bassinet then use wall mount now that she’s in crib. You def need the portable thing because if baby falls asleep anywhere in house you can leave them and Just bring the camera.  Well worth the money. Love this thing!,Best nursery cam

So now that we’ve been using it for 3 weeks, there’s almost nothing I don’t love. The only con is putting the breathing wear on & taking it off. It’s super easy to do but my baby doesn’t like the sound of Velcro. Other than that, this monitor is a life saver. I love seeing on my phone how many breaths per minute my baby is taking, the “baby is moving” notification, and all the sleep pattern analysis the next day. This monitor gives you the ability to sleep without worrying (if you ever get the time to sleep). I read it’s normal for babies to sometimes stop breathing for several seconds at a time. I experienced that when in the middle of the night the loud Red Alarm went off. It wasn’t a malfunction. He did stop breathing and then started breathing again but I was glad to be notified of it and thankful for this technology.",Love it

Although it is more expensive than most monitors, it has so many great features that I think it's worth the extra cost. The monitor is easy to set up, even for someone who's not very technologically savvy like me. From the unboxing to being full set up, it took less than 10 minutes! The monitor gives a birdeye view of the baby instead of more of a ""room view"". It has great picture quality even in nightvision mode. I love that it also monitors the temperature and humidity. You can hear your baby as well as speak to him/her. I wish that it had a separate parent monitor instead of using your smartphone only however. I know some parents would like not having a separate monitor but I find that it drains my battery down. Overall though, great baby monitor that I highly recommend!",Packed with features!

I must admit I am a fan of this one, here is why: Pros: -Easy to set up, I did it all by myself with just following the simple instructions. -I know exactly what is going on in by baby’s room right from my phone, no additional monitor to keep track of. The Nanit will link to your smart phone through their app, The Nanit will provide updates as to the current Temperature and humidity in my baby’s room. It is a bonus to have the humidity being monitored when the humidifier is going in the room.  The unit also has a soft-glow nightlight that can also be turned off if so desired.  The Nanit monitor also tracks sound and motion to let me know what my little one is up to. -The Naint is compatible with both the iphone and Android devices. This is super helpful since my husband and I are with two different services and carriers. -I felt safe and protected using this monitor, I know there have been crazy stories of people hacking monitors the Nanit comes with enterprise-level security and AES 256-bit symmetric-key encryption this is the same standards used by hospitals. -The monitor is placed above the baby’s bed to give you a bird’s eye view. It has a zoom feature and night vision capability. My husband and I as well as grandparents use the multiple account log in, so we can all check in on the baby. -The Nanit will work over Wi-Fi, even when internet is down it uses local and cloud streaming. -With purchase of the Nanit it comes with a free one-month trial of Nanit Insights. The Nanit Insights will not only give you updates on baby’s sleep habits, but parental habits as well. It will then give you tips and tricks to help improve babies sleep.  I also enjoyed reading in the morning how my baby did the previous night. You can also trend the data and look at the overall picture or age-based comparisons. Cons: -After the free one-month trial of Nanit insights the trial expires, it becomes a monthly payment for the insights app of $10. The app itself that you link to your camera/monitor is free if you want the added features it is what the additional cost is for. -The camera does not have a very good tilt/movement feature to see around the room, you are limited to just what you see over the crib. This product is a really good product that arrived on time and in great condition. I would recommend to anyone in the market for a good quality monitor",Birds eye view video monitor

In addition to that, the nightlight now glitches on my Nanit when I get my baby out of crib to feed at night, and wakes her fully up.  Do not waste your money!!!*** Constantly disconnects and buffers.  Video will drop and so will the sound.  The Nanit Insights will sometimes have the wrong time associated with the action.

During daytime naps, it is constantly clicking back and forth. It has woken our baby from several naps now. We've contacted Nanit about it and they've been responsive, but their solutions haven't worked. We just set it into permanent night time mode, but if you're hung up on the daytime camera, I probably wouldn't buy it for this reason alone. -The breathing monitor chimes loudly (both on your phone and in the crib) even when you decide to stop a ""session"". This makes no sense to me as I'm making the decision to stop tracking it. A couple times it's startled the baby and made him cry when he was otherwise happy. It's also annoying in the middle of the night when you're taking them out to do a feeding and not wake your spouse (who also has it on their phone). -It comes with a one year subscription, but you have to activate it when you set the Nanit up. So if you buy the monitor before baby is born and want to set it up to ensure it works but you don't plan on actually using it for several months, that time is wasted.",Just ok
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2019,Atlanta2018,Love this product. Save yourself the hassle of having to order an additional travel base. Just bite the bullet and order the Nanit Plus with the multi-stand included $300. If you install the 10 feet of wire covers you cannot travel with the original wall mounted Nanit base. e love this product. I had it up and running in minutes. I love that you can talk to the baby from the room next door or from around the world. Checking the baby when you are out to dinner with sound is very reassuring. Nanit plus runs when the internet is down as long as you at home connected to your network.  This monitor if mounted higher could provide a view of nearly the entire room as well. That is going to be great for our daughter who will be moving to a toddler bed. Monitor also provides crib temperature most of the time.  If you want all the other bells and whistles about sleep patterns you have to pay for a Nanit subscription service. I could care less about that stuff and passed.,Easy Install

Perfect for my situation, the wife’s family lives far away in another state. Now they can see the baby anytime she is laying down in her crib. The night vision is really impressive. Naturally you can only see things in black and white but quality is extremely clear. I uploaded a photo of the night vision.

Nanit provides a measuring tape so that you hang it at the appropriate height above baby's crib. They also provide a cord cover so those curious little fingers aren't tugging on the cord. Nice safety feature! Video - the video quality is great. HD video with no lag. In the daylight, it's like you're watching a high quality video - the colors are vibrant. The night vision is better than I expected - we have another monitor where the night vision is pixelated and seems to lose some quality - this is not the case at all with Nanit! Very impressed. Overall, I would highly recommend this monitor. While more expensive than traditional monitors, you do get what you pay for. Nanit's subscription service through the mobile app provides insight into your baby's sleep patterns, records sounds and motions, and allows you to use that information to better help your baby sleep through the night with the use of a dashboard.

Tonight I had to wake my daughter up to unplug the monitor and go through the setup process all over again after repeatedly force closing the app and restarting it, restarting my phone multiple times after that didnt work, restarting the router, and then repairing the whole thing which made me go through the original setup. I should have returned it when it took over 2 hours with customer support to get it set up over 2 different phone calls where they just had me repeat the steps over and over until something worked (this was after I had set it up and it had working for about a day). The only reason I didnt is because I had already drilled the holes in the wall to mount it and they sent me a new camera in case it was a faulty unit. They also dont tell you it doesnt work with a mesh network. So my husband had to split the network into 2 bands and that worked for awhile but tonight just has me mad. And for those of you who think we have slow internet or bad phones we dont - we have fiber internet and samsung Galaxy s9 plus phones. This thing is way more hassle than it is worth.

It works good indeed. So what’s wrong with it? Why I’m giving it 1 star? Because I’m very disappointed with the seller: once the camera came, I was not able to pair it to my phone, because the camera itself was paired to another account. I had to spend 2 days with the (very professional) Nanit email customer service to fix up the problem. Of course they couldn’t disclose the name of the account used to pair my camera, but this is just crazy for a camera sold as NEW. The serial number of the camera was not even the same printed on the box, so I had to ask to the company if they shipped me a Nanit Plus or they scammed me with a 1st generation Nanit. Honestly I’m expecting to hear from the seller for this lack of care.","Good product, but I had a bad purchasing experience"
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2018,Gmajojo,"Great Video quality – love the birds eye view, can see baby much clearer than old monitor. I can have audio on even when using other apps on my phone. I love not having to carry around a parent monitor (can do all monitoring from my phone) but then there is no monitor for the babysitter. I like the cord covers, just wish the cord itself wasn’t so long. Our outlet is behind the crib and so there is a ton of extra cord that is left at the end. You can take photos right from the app and photos of a sleeping baby are always so cute! The thing I dislike most about this camera is that “Insights” is not included and for the price of this monitor I fee like it should be. Yes, there is a 30-day free trial but you have to put in your credit card info to get the free trial and then if you forget to cancel before the 30 days are up, you will automatically get charged. A lot of the things that make this monitor worth the extra money is in the features you only get with Insights, so I was very disappointed when I realized they weren’t included.

It has a great design and is easy to setup and install. The companion app is great as well and lets you stay connected to the nursery at a glance. The app lets you play the audio from the nursery in the background, while your phone is on standby, to save batteries. The night vision is great and the software that senses noise and movement is great as it doesn’t alarm for every little move or sound, it alarms only when those movements/sounds are significant enough to indicate the baby is actually awake and in need of attention. My only complaint about this unit is the quality of the video. At the recommended height for installation, I cannot make out my baby’s eyes, if they are open or closed. Other than that, great unit and well worth the piece of mind.",Great camera and app but the quality is not the best.

I recommend purchasing from Nanit, they have a package that includes the band and swaddle. Buying it on amazon, I lost out on the promo they offered to get a free  Newborn package with camera purchase. I called their customer service to see if I can get at least one swaddle especially because they said they were helping families affected by covid on their website. Customer service wasn’t the greatest. She was nice but not knowledgeable. She seem hopefully to get me one and later responded she was unable to. Pretty disappointing since I spent $300 on this system. Poor customer service when someone just purchased equipment over $300 and they can send you a swaddle that’s $24.

Enter Nanit: an anxious first time parents dream. Being able to set up our iPad on our bedside to watch him through the night gave us the peace of mind we needed to sleep soundly (when we could). Picture Quality: The day time quality is excellent but does require a lot of light in the room to kick in. The night vision is very clear compared to other cameras we’ve tried. Sound Quality: Sound quality is crystal clear even while we have white noise/nature sounds playing. Our little one can be heard loud and clear over the white noise so we wake up when he needs us. Mobile App: Having the ability to check in while we’re doing things around the house without carrying around a clunky monitor is the best! When I come down from putting him to sleep at night I can easily watch him on my phone to make sure he’s fallen asleep before getting back in bed myself. Insights: Being first time parents and having no idea what we’re doing we opted to pay monthly for insights. I love being able to see how long he is sleeping for, how often we’re tending to him, and his sleep quality. The night seems like a total blur come morning so the summary is ideal for us. All and all Nanit is an excellent product and we’re so happy we picked it over other competitors. We definitely plan to continue using it through the years to keep and eye on him during the night.",The peace of mind first time parents need!

From mounting it on the wall, which looks great with any nursery decor, to the app it was all a step by step process that took 15-30 minutes max to complete. There are a ton of great features.  The camera zoom, having the app run in the background on your phone is great so you don't have to leave the app open for it to be in use,  and the built-in sounds machine. The best thing about this monitor, in our opinion, is that when either of us travels for work we can still check in on our loved little baby. The alerts are great!  You get to set everything! Notifications, and the sensitivity at which it notifies you, and crib position/area that is being monitored. The screenshot feature is an added bonus.  Love taking pictures of my precious sleeping baby...yes, I'm that mom. If you're on the fence about this monitor take the leap. Also, for moms who are monitoring multiple babies/rooms - you can add cameras and assign them to the kids so you know which camera is which all from the convenience of your phone.

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2018,Charles Schlatter,"I was nervous about not having a separate parent monitor (the Nanit links to your smart phone!), but it really isn't a big deal at all. I always have my phone close by and there is a setting available so you can hear the sound and run other apps, or have your screen asleep. I've even put my ringer on vibrate/silent and the monitor sounds still come through. The app is easy to navigate and I like that I can look back and see how past nights have been (helpful for well child check ups at the doctor and/or tips for babysitters). Nanit Insights sends you a weekly email summarizing your babies sleep patterns for that week and give you tips to improve.  Both parents (plus more, grandparents/babysitters etc.) can download the app and ""link"" to your monitor (with your permission of course) a benefit I hadn't thought of. I also like that the Nanit has temperature AND humidity. Most monitors have room temp, however the monitor we were using before the Nanit was not accurate and could not be trusted. Humidity is something I hadn't thought of until our first child was sick (usual winter cough/cold stuff) I put a humidifier in her room but had no idea what the relative humidity was. The installation instructions are very helpful and clear. I appreciated the fact that it came with a paper tape measure (it even had a spot for your foot to hold the tape measure on the floor and a pre-marked arrow for where your monitor should be installed). I also really love that the Nanit comes with cord covers. We have been using this monitor for a little over a week now. I haven't had any issues with connection being lost or cutting in and out. (our baby's room is on a separate floor than our master). One down side that I have noticed is that sometimes the monitor counts multiple ""visits"" when it should only be one. My guess is that this happens when I am in her room (trying to soothe her back to sleep) and don't move for a few minutes and then move. The monitor sometimes counts that as 2 (or more, if I'm in there a while) visits. Not a huge deal. You are able to go back (in the morning) and edit the number of visits (this will make the Nanit Insights summary more accurate to your baby). Overall, the Nanit plus is a great monitor!",Such a great monitor!
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2019,MR M Y WAN,"I needed a baby monitor that works over WiFi, and this is the best one out there. Because I live in a dense high-rise flat with steel-reinforced concrete walls, most RF and WiFi signals don't penetrate very well. Even though the flat isn't large, the signal between devices (such as conventional wireless baby monitors) can't reach 2-3 rooms away. I'm lucky that my flat is wired to have dedicated WiFi access points in every room, so my WiFi coverage is almost flawless. The Nanit camera is connected to the WiFi in my baby's room, and I can connect to it via my phone anywhere in the flat. The best part about it is the stability of the connection, and the speed to which it connects and starts streaming video once I open the app. Because it doesn't steam over the internet (I don't use their insights or additional subscription features) the stream over my home WiFi is very steady and doesn't drop out. On my own phone, when I open up the app the stream loads up within 1-2 seconds at most (usually 1s) when on home WiFi. It is obviously a little slower when connecting via 4G. This also means there is almost no lag between physical movement and it showing up on screen. On WiFi I've timed the lag to under 1 second. Again slightly slower over 4G. It will still work over your home WiFi, even if your internet connection is down. (I confirmed this by unplugging my modem from my router but keeping my WiFi network up). I've tried other wireless baby monitors such as summer infant - it's obviously the simplest and fastest way to monitor your baby, but it didn't work for me since my concrete walls blocked the signal if I was just a little bit away from my baby's room (I.e. in the kitchen or my own bedroom etc). I have a Nest cam in my baby's room too, it's good for 24/7 coverage and being able to review how my baby slept over the night and what the babysitter did etc. However it's not good for dedicated baby monitoring as there is some delay in the stream (understandable since the feed needs to go up to the Nest cloud servers and back down to my phone). This also means it won't work when the internet is down. Finally the nest app itself isn't really designed to be open  and running 24/7 - it will time out after a while and this is pretty bad in the middle of the night when you want to hear your baby but the app has shut off. Arlo cameras are useless. I had one for a while but it takes AGES for the app to connect to the camera - upwards of 10s from opening the app to seeing the livestream. This is on my Arlo Q plus camera connected via ethernet even. My experience with them is so bad I would never try their Arlo baby product. I've also had some generic china-made WiFi cameras. They actually work well enough but I'm wary of their security and possibility of backdoors. Nanit has two factor authentication- but actually only for the camera owner ane not thebadditional accounts that can be invited to view the same camera (such as your spouse). ATM there is no evidence to suggest you can't trust a Nanit camera in your home. The background audio in the Nanit app works exactly as advertised - enable it first in the app and then close the app or even have the phone display go to sleep - you will still hear your baby's room. I've had this running overnight and it definitely doesn't fail or crash or stop streaming inadvertently. I have my phone logged into my own Nanit ccount, invited my wife to create her own account and login on her phone that way. I have also fashioned a dedicated monitor screen using an old phone that is logged in as a guest account and then locked to the Nanit app with guided access on iOS. This way I can see my baby on my phone at home and when I'm out, my wife can do the same on her phone. And I have an old phone I leave for the babysitter to use around the house. Overall I'm really happy with this purchase - I researched for months on which baby monitor to get, given my specific requirements. It was a little bit of a leap of faith given Nanit is a relatively small company without a long track record yet. However I'm 100% satisfied and really hope they do well. The only downsides are that you need really good WiFi in your home to ensure it is reliable for you. (This Nanit Plus is the latest version which added two-way audio which the first generation didn't have, and improved WiFi hardware after users complained about the first gen - I wouldn't risk getting the 1st gen device now). It is also REALLY expensive compared to other baby monitors out there, whether they are WiFi or not. I haven't tried the subscription features yet and they seem quite pricey - but you get a month to trial them. All of the features I've talked about above are already included though. TLDR - Expensive baby monitor that requires really good WiFi in your home to be reliable - but if it does work for you it is excellent.",The best option if you need a WiFi baby monitor

However, we experienced constant disconnections from the camera to the point that it made it unusable. Later learned they suggest your router be no more than 20 feet away from the camera which is just impractical. Then talked to customer service again and was told it wasn’t us, we needed ANOTHER new camera. At this point I was still within the 1 year original warranty and asked to be refunded my money for a camera we had used all together for maybe 1-2 weeks but they’ve refused.

To qualify, we have an eero mesh system with extremely fast internet. This unit is plagued with constant buffering and disconnections. The night vision is garbage and don’t even try to use it with an Alexa device because that function rarely works. They actually advise that you “use an old IPad” for a dedicated monitoring device because Alexa show has problems. The “data” it collects is rarely accurate. My two cents, get a dedicated monitor or WiFi camera and call it a day. The data does nothing for you because it’s not accurate.",Skip this one for you and your wife’s sanity

Overall we’re very happy with the camera and app. We do pay for the cloud service, which does a decent job at tracking the sleep. If we have any criticism, it would be focused on the notifications and sometimes faulty tracking stats. We would also love to see average “go to bed” and “wake up times”. The sleeping tips are spot on and align with what many reputable sleep consultants provide, but it would be nice to have access to the info prior to hitting a milestone.",We use it EVERYDAY/NIGHT!!!

But, what really drew me to this product is the ability to breakdown and review his sleep patterns. I am sure everyone knows that with infants you are so sleep deprived that you can't notice patterns as easily as you could pre-baby. This helped solve that problem for us.

I can have the sound on while using my phone, so if im working in the garage or doing dishes and listening to music I  can hear lil baby. Pretty simple to use and figure out and offers tons of options and noise clips, what she slept like all sorts of stuff.

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Apr 2019,AmazonUser,"This is a near top-of-the-line Smart Baby Monitor which uses a smartphone as a receiver rather than a dedicated piece of equipment. This design is so much better than traditional monitors, since you don't need to lug around an extra device all day - just your smartphone or smart watch! You also get notifications and can view the camera remotely! That means you can stay in touch with your baby even when you're not the one caring for them. It also includes a 1-month trial to Nanit Insights which tracks sleep and displays trends. I haven't used my trial yet, but it looks very full-featured. For perspective, 5 years ago I was pretty impressed to have a baby monitor that had a very small and very poor quality screen that displayed a low resolution video feed that was super jittery and required dedicated hardware with a very limited range of broadcast. Fast forward to today and now I have a live-streaming baby “monitor” which broadcasts a near-HD image to my iPhone, literally anywhere in the world! I no longer have to lug around a dedicated monitor and to make it even more versatile I even get alerts on my Apple Watch when baby moves or makes noise! More features I love: -significantly less expensive than Nanit Plus Floor Stand version -optional portable mount for traveling -cable/wires are neatly tucked inside tubes for safety -2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Wi-Fi (switches automatically) -temperature and humidity sensors -can share with multiple caregivers",Excellent smartphone monitor! Very clear video & great alerts.

Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,0,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 May 2020,Mathias,"We went for the Nanit Plus with MultiStand and Breathing Grear (which is the most expensive package) and found that while it's overall an okay baby monitor, there are some issues to highlight in case you were hoping to get functionality from ""Insights"": - Nanit Server seems instable - so Nanit wouldn't record videos or provide ""Insights"" - The Nanit Multi-stand deactivates insights, so no ""Insights"" in the first couple of months while the baby is not in the crib (there is Floor Stand but it's overpriced and even not available at this time) - ""Insights"" is a subscription and will start with the included year immediately after activation (even though as outlined above, it won't work as long as the Nanit is on the Multi-Stand) The hardware itself is okay but I wish the picture quality would be a bit better since it's mounted pretty far away from the baby. The temperature indicator is incorrect as the Nanit runs warm -  the room can be on 72 degrees but the Nanit would still report 80 degrees. The Swaddles are okay but I wish they would have the design of the ""Love to Dream"" Swaddles but that's just a preference.","Okay Baby Monitor but ""Insights"" don't work reliably"
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 May 2020,CW,"I like this baby monitor. It was easy to install and I like that we can have remote access to it, we use our phones or an iPad to keep an eye on baby. The picture quality is good but frequently lags or freezes/doesn’t update, which is frustrating (this is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5).  For such a high end product, I wasn’t expecting so many technical issues and video quality issues. The sound is good although I wish it filtered out white noise and isolated only baby crying. We have a small apartment so I usually don’t keep the sound on. I also bought the breathing band to go with the monitor which provides me with even more peace of mind. I like the sleep stats and insights too. It’s nice to see how baby is progressing and I’ve found some of the tips helpful.",Good Baby Monitor
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2020,Christina Mulhearn,"I wanted to wait to review this monitor until I had enough time with it to give it a true review. I bought this monitor for my 3rd child who is now 9 months old. I am a working mom who has to travel at least once a month. I knew I wanted a WiFi enabled monitor for when I am traveling but I wanted a monitor that had all of the features of a traditional monitor. I agonized over this purchase! I looked at hundreds of cameras before making this decision. Out of all the monitors I looked at this was the most expensive and let me tell you, it does not disappoint!! In my research the one thing I found lacking in all the other cameras was the ability to listen to my baby all the time while on my phone even if it is locked. This monitor does that! When I’m awake and the baby is sleeping I don’t turn on the sound. I rely on the push notifications for both motion and sound. It works flawlessly. If I hear my baby cry at the same second I am getting a push notification telling me “sound detected”. Now that my baby is mobile I get a notification each time he is moving. Sometimes I can even prevent a nap being cut short because he can’t find his binky. A normal monitor wouldn’t allow for that. I love being able to watch him when he’s in his crib no matter where in the world I am. I also activated the Insights subscription and used it heavily from around 3-6 months. It gives you a recap of the entire night with video clips and gives you tips on how to make your baby sleep longer. It was in reviewing those video clips that I realized I needed those binkies with the animal attached so he could easily find his binky at night. It gave me the confidence to allow him to cry a little to settle himself. At night I set the monitor to background noise so I can constantly listen to him. My phone can be locked and charging and I can still hear his white noise piping through. I can play on my phone and still have the noise in the background. I haven’t had any connectivity issues. If nanit senses a technical issue they quickly alert you in the app. I’m also able to share the app with babysitters and family and restrict their access and easily remove them. I can’t say enough good things about the monitor. I am so glad I purchased it and will recommend to all my expectant friends.",Finally - a WiFi monitor that also acts as a traditional baby monitor! A dream come true.
Nanit Plus - Smart Baby Monitor and Wall Mount: Camera with HD Video & Audio - Sleep Tracking - Night Vision - Temperature & Humidity Sensors and Two-Way Audio,0,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,Nate W.,"This camera is driving me and my husband insane. Not only that, but we have emailed Nanit before and they have not replied. It never connects and our internet is fine. Our Bluetooth is fine and this camera never works properly. If it does work, then in the middle of the night it’ll go to standby mode and not record his sleeping patterns. I thought this was a good product but now I can see that it’s just a huge waste of money. I have many friends that are going to be having babies soon and I will be sure not to recommend this product to them not only because of the price for a faulty product, but also for the poor customer service. Back to researching for new baby monitors. It’s not a reliable product. You can’t trust it to alert you or for it to even be recording properly. New parents beware.",Unreliable

Picture quality is great (audio as well) , it's easy to install, and the app makes sense and is simple to use. I can talk to my little guy through the camera, Night vision is really good and zoom-in and out actually works without messing up the picture quality. My wife is not usually big into smart home devices, but she cannot get enough of the daily insights feature which we both look at each morning.
