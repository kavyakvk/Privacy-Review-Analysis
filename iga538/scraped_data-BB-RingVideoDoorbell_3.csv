Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Oct 2020,BigMac,I really enjoyed the ring doorbell except my mind at ease the best purchase I made all year,Loving it
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Kiki,This is my first video camera.   It was super ez to connect.   Took 5 minutes.   The picture quality is AWSOME.   I connected the chime pro to it and it's loud.    I don't have alot of delays like some stated.    It's pretty much accurate and on point.   I was able to link it to my Alexa device.    I had problems with people stealing packages so hopefully this will deter them from doing so because I made my camera visible.,Great Camera
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Sep 2020,MSHeavyDuty,Love the Ring Doorbell! This is not our first...actually our third. We loved the one that we put on my mother's house when we moved in to care for her (has Alzheimers). It came in so handy many times. Today showed me just how valuable having the Ring Doorbell at our home that we are remodeling. Contractor was at our house but we weren't. I answered the Ring and talked to the Census interviewer via the Ring! He had no problem understanging me when I answered his questions. My husband and I have now decided we no longer have to do a whole house wired security camera system. I highly recommend the Ring Video Doorbell.,Love It!
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 May 2020,Antron30,Great product it connects to all three of my echo dots and my echo show 8 and when the doorbell is press the live feed shows up on the echo show and along with a voice alert saying someone is at your front door with a door bell chime so u dont have to purchase the chime from ring if you have any echo dots or echo show,Ring doorbell 3
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Jun 2020,DavidAllan,"This is our 2nd Ring video doorbell.  This newer model has some nice features, especially the easy to remove to charge battery.   The ""screw"" that holds the case closed to give access to the quick change battery is a real pain to use so I keep it closed with a small piece of tape.",Works great.
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 May 2020,Serenitysis,"My Ring doorbell works, it just doesn’t alert me until the person is walking away.  That makes talking to them pretty impossible.  I am disappointed about this.",Ring Doorbell
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Oct 2020,MooseD,Bought this camera for peace of mind. Installation was not difficult. Took a bit more time to adjust the settings. When facing a busy street I found that the camera was activating every time a vehicle passed by or someone was walking by on the sidewalk. Pulled back the zone so now it only activates when someone gets close to the porch. Did have to add a WiFi extender to get better coverage as I was missing alerts with spotty WiFi coverage during certain times of the day. Video quality is good. Also purchased the Chime Pro to get alerts inside my house. Connects through WiFi to all my Ring cameras. Recommend purchasing a backup battery to have ready to replace existing one since it takes so long to recharge.,Easy wireless setup.
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Nov 2019,JHSr,"An excellent product indeed! It works as described and carried more features than I thought. During this season, while at the gym, it was great to be notified of motion on the porch. The video on my phone of a Mario building set for my grandchild was delivered and left on a chair on our front porch. My wife was away too but close enough to return home immediately and get the package before someone driving by or walking by was tempted to take it. The app features also link with other devices and let you know when something is happening in your neighborhood. Glad we have it.",Great Device to Monitor Porch
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,21 Nov 2020,ZYZzyz,Very easy to install. As far as setting it up on Amazon Alexa as well as fire TV there is a small learning curve. May need to have it set up by the most technical person in the house. Once it’s set up it works very well and can be integrated with iOS and Android mobile devices.  All in all it provides exactly as much real-time and historic monitoring of events within its view as you want in 1080p video/sound. The one thing I do not yet have experience with is the service as I am still on the first free month.,Does what it says on the box.
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 Jun 2020,Barney,"Ring works well. Main issue is battery recharge requirements. 

Even though I have a second battery to use when the charge of the first runs out you have to replace the used battery too frequently.
I’m going to look into getting a power box to go directly to the Ring and a house power socket.",4.5
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 May 2020,Packerman77,"My story with video doorbells is a long journey simply because of the doorbell chime I have installed in my house.  The builder put a Nicor 18888 chime system in which is not compatible with much.  I upgraded my chime to the Nicor PrimeChime Plus, but again that is only compatible with a few video doorbells and the Ring 3 is not one of them.  So be sure you know what chime system you have before purchasing any video doorbell.",Wish I could have loved this!!
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,4,19 Nov 2020,Strosfan23,"So far, so good!  I get an alert every time someone drives by, and when a package is delivered, so it is good for peace of mind.

I would highly recommend getting a second battery,  because when you have to recharge it, it usually takes several hours to fully charge the battery.  

I am also now planning to get the chime, so everyone inside hears when someone actually rings the doorbell.  

Overall, I am very satisfied with the Ring Pro 3, but would love to have the option for internal storage instead of having to pay monthly to keep any videos for later viewing.",Good doorbell for an okay price!
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,22 Nov 2020,maldonotto,This is my second Ring doorbell as I had the original Ring 1. My first unit was not hard wired and it had a rechargeable battery but it wasn't removable. I went with this style because of the ease of being able to recharge the battery without having to remove the whole unit. I'm glad I went with this style. An added bonus is you get to pick from 2 different colors as both covers come with the unit.,Ring 3 Doorbell
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Shauna,"This is a great way to keep an eye on your property surroundings. I love the Ring doorbell.

It’s clear and does a great, almost TOO good job of picking up motion. My only gripes with it is sometimes it doesn’t pick up every event close but will pick up almost every car even w the sensitivity turned down. I dont want to turn off the zone because the door is perpendicular to the street so my Ring faces the neighbor’s and I definitely want to pick up the street as much as possible. The other gripe is the video will just black out while recording so i will get the person (say UPS guy) coming to drop something off, he will be putting the package down then the video blacks out or freezes and the next part it shows is the driver back in the truck. It just makes me nervous that something important in the future will be missed.

Since purchasing it, unannounced visitors are no longer an issue and we know exactly which animal is making themselves at home in the evenings.  Set up was fairly easy and installation was pretty simple.  The directions were quite clear. 

I do have a couple of issues.  We researched it before we got it and it is not completely clear that full functionality is not available if you do not purchase the payment plan.  

The other issue is that all videos captured, we do not need.  We review and delete but we are on a busy street so there are videos captured every few minutes.  There is not an option to delete all.  You have to select each and every video to delete it.  

Other than that, we love it!!",Watch out intruders!

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,2,23 Aug 2020,Gjones8013,"I bought Ring Video Doorbell 3 and electrical transformer to hardwire device to house electric figuring that a hardwired device negate issues around charging the battery on any frequency (since I travel often and live in a busy street).

After talking with Ring, I found out the Ring Video Doorbell 3 uses the internal battery regardless of whether the device is hardwired or not, the hardwire only slow trickle charges the battery. If your device has more activity than the charge rate of the battery, the battery will still die and the unit will be unusable. VERY BAD DESIGN on the part of Ring.",Hardwired device is useless

Having your wifi access point on the other side of your house may not work well. 

I rearranged a little and got great coverage for the doorbell and its worked perfectly since day one. They keep adding nice features like more details in the notifications - when UPS drops a box on my porch, the notification I get includes a photo from the doorbell.

I decided to try Ring, it was a easy setup, but, it has a internal battery that has to be charged before using the Ring. I'm on a high traffic street so my battery lasted maybe a month, I had to take it out and recharge it for seven hours. I bought a second battery so it's easier, now I don't have seven hours with no camera. I can't just keep my live feed going all day like I did with the Zmodo, bummer. After about five or ten minutes it shuts down.",Could be better

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 - Satin Nickel,1,3,23 Jul 2020,DeadRinger,"So far my Ring is working mostly as expected.  It doesn't always detect when someone is at the door, and it has occasionally misidentified a person for motion and visa versa. Also, despite troubleshooting, and speaking with both Ring and my mobile provider, I still do not receive notifications to my Galaxy s10+- partly defeating the purpose for the device. Notifications works with my mom's iphone11, so hopefully once I get a new device, notifications will no longer be an issue. Also, found it difficult to screw the battery cover in completely. I also had difficulty adding a user, my mom never receives the invitation email. Overall 3/5.","Camera works occasionally, can't receive notificat"

MAJOR problem is you get only 1 month free videos then you must PAY to keep seeing the videos or transfer the videos or send them to the police.  for a purchase of over $200 one would think that as long as it works the owner should be able to keep the system working without having to pay more for the doorbell just to see who is on the porch!",Ring door bell may not be worth the hype
