"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Nov 2019,Siege,Love the Nest Hub Max! We already have multiple Google products and I knew as soon as this was released we were going to buy it. Only thing I have to say bad about it this far is we don't use it as a camera because it angles up towards the ceiling. The camera is able to move during video calls so that's not a problem. The problem is using it as a security camera it stays stationary and can't focus on where activity is. If there was a way to set the camera to where you want it to view as a security camera this thing would be perfect.,Works great in my home

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 May 2020,Topher8691,I am a little older so the larger screen is really nice.  I don't make calls or anything fancy but I do view my various security cameras.  The one thing I really like about this is the sound!  It sounds very nice compared to my original Hub.  One thing I don't like (and it might just be me) is how difficult it is to set this up for multiple people and accounts.  I still can't quite get it so others can not view my calendar and I don't see theirs.  I am sure it is something I am doing incorrectly but it still seems much more difficult than it should be.,"Large screen, Nice sound"

You can not ask to see specific videos on YouTube or free search YouTube either only generic searches and you get to pick from what it pulls up. Also no typing keyboard to search either.

My kid got caught walking threw the livingroom in her panties ( she's 5) . So now we keep the camera off all the time unless we leave or are out on a date and want to check in at home.

You actually get a month free and you can subscribe if you like to review and store your history. One down fall is that I thought it was compatible with ring but it's not. I was hoping I would be able to see who's at my door on the hub but I found out that it works with Alexa. Maybe that will change in the future. I still love Google.,Great Google Hub Max

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Nov 2019,StretchyPants,"This is a beautiful device.  The sound is leaps and bounds better than the smaller nest hub.  It was really easy to set up and integrate into all of my apps.  The slide show was simple to set up as well, and wow, the display makes all my photos look fantastic.  The face recognition is a little creepy, but what the heck, I really don't care if big brother watches me cook(oh the hub max is in my kitchen).

The sensor that activates the device is really good as it wakes up immediately.  I also like that I can set up and name multiple timers(like one timer I named pizza, the other chicken wings, etc..)  and the you can say ok google turn off pizza timer and voila:)  did I mention the sound and display is great?  Oh, and everything is really fast. 

I have a ring, can't wait till the ring can be viewed with my hub max.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,3,13 Nov 2019,Quasymodo,"The hardware for this device is excellent. 

The software setup, however, is a nightmare. The device is actually a dumb slave to multiple apps that have to be on an individual's phone and working just-so. Simple actions like changing the network settings are like pushing wet ropes. I have spent over 20 hours trying to get the settings to work remotely for my (senior) relatives. 

The lack of documentation (except in fragmented Q&A) makes it harder to interpret what these apps need to work correctly, and the lack of phone support means there is nowhere to turn for help. 

If you are GenZ / Millennial, it will be easy for you to set up, why not just use your phone?",Nice hardware but don't buy for seniors

The screen is easier to see from across the kitchen and the speakers really fill up a room. You can adjust the equalizer of the speaker from the Google Home app. Also, the addition of the camera (which you can physically switch off) makes calls via Duo (on Apple or Android) a lot of fun to use and very useful. I love FaceTime but holding the phone can be cumbersome if you are cooking or doing something else. The camera will follow you around on screen as you are in a call. Pretty cool in my book. You can cast videos and TV shows to the screen and watch YouTube, too. I love it all around.",DEF WORTH THE $$$ GOOGLE HUB WITH A NEST CAM

If you want to watch Nest cam stream you must turn it on first with your phone THEN request to steam video. You can‚Äôt turn the cam on with a command. That‚Äôs dumb.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 May 2020,crunchtime,"The Nest Hub Max is a nice way to play music from leading providers. The voice commands make this very convenient.

To make video calls, you must first set up a Duo account, then you have to allow it (and Google) to make a voice print that uniquely identifies you to the world.

The  device uses AI (artificial intelligence) to adjust the video frame if you step further away from the device while on a call.

The recipe feature allows you to find recipes that are published on the Web. Although the Google Assistant will read you the directions one step at a time, I prefer to use it in silent mode. Unfortunately, the interface does not have a ""page down"", ""scroll"" or ""next step"" feature when all the steps are not visible at once.
The workaround, is to have the voice start reading again until it needs to go to the next screen. However, what I find even more limiting is that is does not support recipes that I have created.

While the Google Assistant uses a built in browser for retrieving recipes and answers to other questions, the device is incapable of retrieving specific web pages when asked.",great for music and video calls

What‚Äôs crazy is the screen will show you exactly what you said, but it still can‚Äôt figure out what you want from it. I feel like these speakers need to do more. Show my calendar. To do list. Movie showtimes. Visualizations to music. Etc.","Better than most smart speakers, but.."

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Nov 2019,BenThereDunThat,"Having owned three Google Home Minis, I was excited when the original Hub came out. It added the visual aspect to the minis that was sorely lacking.

I bought the original Hub thinking it would be perfect for the kitchen, big enough, but not too big. Unfortunately I found it wasn't quite big enough for even our 14-foot square kitchen. Both the screen and the speaker were undersized.

Enter the Nest Hub Max. It solves the problems of its predecessor. The screen is big and beautiful. The speakers are loud and clear.

But the Max isn't just a screen. It adds a Nest camera that allows you to make video calls or just check in on the house when you're gone. It's fully integrated into the Nest app, so you get alerts for motion, noise and familiar faces.","Just like the original Hub, only bigger and better"

The facial recognition is amazing... it automatically recognizes you when you enter into the room and notifys you of your Calander events (which has already saved me twice!!!) and tells you your route to work and if there are any accidents or slowdowns on the way.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 Sep 2020,Shardu,"Pros/Cons

Pros:
Once it's set up correctly... 
-Easy to use to make internet phone calls
-great for keeping in another room to see who is at the door or on nest cameras 
-Can set your own background
-it can allow for auto dimming so it isn't very bright when sleeping
-Works well when you want to search google for something

Cons:
-Price is too high
-When I ask google on my phone to call someone. It will transfer to this device every time even if I'm on another floor and over 300 feet away sometimes...
-Searches aren't always as effective versus when I do them on my phone with google
-You can't mount it flat to the wall if you wanted, since the stand can't be removed. 

WANTS FOR THIS PRODUCT!!!
-Lower price
-Setting to reduce range of assistant working from your phone
-Allow the stand to be removable so it can be mounted flat on the wall. Make the home look cleaner.
-Reduce the protection plan's price from BestBuy.",Works great with the larger version!
"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Jan 2020,antoniowolf2,"The hub has an integrated far-field microphone for a smart speaker-like experience that can be activated with the ‚ÄúHey Google‚Äù wake phrase and features video-optimized routines, which can be used to control other smart home devices with a simple dashboard. It features an integrated camera and a 10-inch screen. I guess you could safely put the device in your bedroom because of Google‚Äôs claim that it is a privacy-focused device and no one can watch you. I being the non-believer put it in the kitchen. But you can use the item for video chats which is quite nice. It appears to work through your Android or iPhone, as well as your server. The camera has around 127 degrees of field-of-view, so the whole family can be in the shot when chatting, but there is no zoom capability. The system also enjoys simple hand movement to turn the unit on and off, pause chatting or media playback, or muted microphone. You can assign IDs to family members and the camera recognizes them as they enter and leave the room. I think this is facial recognition. This also relates to the built-in calendar - each family member has their own. In addition to all of those features, the Hub Max camera can also be used as a security camera to monitor your home when you are away. Offering free live monitoring, with an option for up to 30-day continuous recording in the cloud for an additional monthly subscription fee. However, the Hub Max doesn‚Äôt support night vision. Anyone not feeling comfortable with having that camera run 24/7 can disable it with a hardware switch that also physically disconnects the built-in microphones. The emphasis here appears to be privacy, but certainly not a good function. Keep the microphone lose the camera.",amazing product
"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 Nov 2019,JaySanchez,"Never had a smart display before and only ever owned one Google Home (original air freshener one). I bought this because I was interested in owning one and it came with a camera and was larger compared to the regular Nest Hub. So far I can say that I love it. The screen isn't distracting and I am completely fine with the Hub being placed in my room (Don't have a clock in my bedroom so the dim screen works perfectly as a clock and alarm when needed). 
Also I know most people wouldn't be comfortable with a camera in their living space but for myself atleast the advantages outweigh the mentioned. I can use the camera to check up on my dog and cat (who love to sleep in my room while me and my girlfriend are gone) and also I can duo call whenever my girlfriend is home and have a wonderful face call. 
Now the only reason I haven't given this a 5 is the price. At $230 this was my only downside. If this was $200 I would definitely give it a 5 because that seems more reasonable in my head. Nonetheless great screen, great sound, fun to have around.",Could live without it but still love having it
"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 Nov 2017,Launie75,Bought this for my mother in law to use video calls since hard for her to hold her phone at times. I would say it was worth the money but for some older people a little bit more difficult to navigate and understand. Camera moves within a certain range when walking around. We need to buy the stand though to make it easier to use it in multiple rooms w/open view that can turn or tilt it without having to move it yourself for better coverage of that area. We had looked at other options and this one seems to be more compatible for different apps/devices that other options out there.,Tons of features and compatability

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Nov 2019,BeartunesMA,"The way this screen is designed it sits atop the speaker and its footprint isn't too big.  The color rendering and light sensing is much better on the Google products over the Lenovo ones.  The sound quality is excellent and processor speed is also very good.  Compared to the 7"" home hub, at night this ones screen and digit size are much brighter, so if light in your bedroom is a concern you may want the 7"" unless a operating system update lets us change the font size.  I have not used the camera yet but there is a physical switch to shut it and the mics off or you can swipe to turn just camera off.  There is not a physical shutter to hide the lens though.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 Feb 2020,RoyP,"We purchased this since we cut cable but rather, stream our entertainment. Our household also already has several google home products in several rooms, and the addition of this one for the kitchen is great for watching videos while cooking and cleaning. 
Disney plus, Hulu, ESPN, and NBA league pass does cast to this device from your phone, there is no built in streaming app besides youtube. There's a bit of a work around for netflix but we haven't tried it since the other streaming services are good enough.
I would give this 5 stars for our needs but the wifi has a tendency to sporadically cut out, even though our other wifi devices has wifi connectivity while being in the same room as the google nest hub. I understand that there may be interference coming from the various appliances in the kitchen, but our other wifi devices don't have this problem while being in the same area.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,4,13 Feb 2020,DaughterDauz,"I bought this for my parents to make it easier for my mom to play music and fun for cooking etc.  Pictures are great.

Cons:  If you don't have a cell phone or app accounts (like my parents) the set up was a real pain!  Although my mother loves the idea of being more technology based if you don't already know your music and artists its a bit advance.  You will have an even harder time calling up songs if you have no idea who to ask for anymore.  SO for anyone with speech challenges (from a stroke or just aging like both my parents are) this may NOT be the product for you.  Its not age friendly.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Aug 2020,DeanC,"So I was unsure if this would be worth the extra investment over the smaller Hub.

After a months use this does have many advantages over the smaller system. The sound is vastly improved which is appreciated by my teenage kids and then the camera came in really handy when we went away on vacation and it doubled as a security cam.

I have also used the max hub to use Duo with my family back in England and it work great!, it also tracks you to some extent when you walk around the room, helps make the conversation feel more natural as you can go about your business without being stuck to one spot.

"Nest Hub Max 10"" Smart Display with Google Assistant - Chalk",1,5,13 Mar 2020,Nanastreak,"We placed this in the kitchen and man, does it get used by everyone in the family. Every day.

My kids ask it what a fa*t sounds like daily while scrolling through pictures of our family from Google photos when it recognizes any of our faces.

My wife and I watch YouTube TV while cooking or when the kids take over the living room.

Video calling home with Google Duo is a neat plus, Without being able to physically move the Nest cam somehow follows people around the room as they walk and chat.

I didn't realize it had a higher quality Nest cam (IQ?) built in when I bought it but that definitely would have sealed the deal if buyer's remorse started creeping in.

Using facial recognition It will greet whoever it sees in the morning and tailor it's experience to you (if you open up your google privacy settings).

It's only real fail is it's almost exclusive reliance on unfamiliar swipe gestures for screen navigation that take a bit to memorize but once you get used to them it's a non issue. Although tablet like, it doesn't provide any familiar tablet navigation options to fall back on but you can always talk to it.

Considering the small one? It's a great alarm clock and picture frame but is rarely used in comparison. The additional features on the 10"" make all the difference.

For my own use, I doubt I'd get this - there are similar products with the same or similar photo sharing capabilities that cost less, and I expect more out of speakers than this can provide. The price is a bit high for my use case, and I'm not a fan of having more internet connected cameras in my house.

I had high hopes that Google would address this but unfortunately, this larger model has the same issue (deduct 1 star) our only solution was to put a Google Home Mini in the same room so Google could hear us when the Max couldn't, about half the time we have noticed.

- The ability to use in the kitchen for recipes is great. 
- Easily connects with Roomba, Arlo, Wemo, Nooie, Sensi, etc.
- Transfers searches from Max to your phone automatically
- Ideal for routines such as bedtime or good morning updates

I had to remove all devices from the Nest Hub and start from scratch putting them all back into my Echo. Took two days. Lights, switches, garage door opener, plugs. What a pain. I will give a thumbs up to the Nest Hub Max. It does YouTube and YouTube TV perfectly. Also, the Nest Hub has a wider and more comprehensive knowledge for answering questions. That is something Echo could really learn from. It looks good, but the sound is not as good at the Echo Show. Overall, I give it 3 stars.
