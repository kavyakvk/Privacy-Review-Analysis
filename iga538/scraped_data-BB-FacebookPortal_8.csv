"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Mar 2020,Obie,Bought 2 Mini’s for my sons so we could video chat with the granchildren (I have a 10” Portal). I use the Superframe for Facebook picture slideshows and Alexa for home control. Works great. It is amazing how the camera follows the speaker in a video chat and the camera has a very wide field of view so everyone can spread out during a video chat and not have to crowd together to be seen.

"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,4,23 Apr 2020,putinina,"It is a facebook platform so other applications are not applicable. Also, as with all these types of services, it doesn't enhance the signal strength and quality of each end user.

As with all other systems, if the end users' signal is poor, the frustrations of lost services still hold.",Good device for communication

"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Jan 2020,Portly,So I got this for my mother for Christmas. I wanted something she could video chat with us on easily. The voice activation works well and it is nice that it doubles as a digital picture frame for your facebook pictures. It was really easy to set up and is pretty easy to operate for someone that is not that tech savvy.,easy to use
"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,4,23 Sep 2020,yeeeha,"People say they can use tablets or phones for the same purpose, but I'd say this is very useful for long distance relationship people (couples or families). I bought this for my long distance partner, and it had made it a lot easier for us to video chat (which is just having us sitting in the frame and do our own things most of the time). 

First of all, it does not occupy a lot of space so it can be put on the desk like a picture frame. Secondly, the processor would not overheat when video calling for a long time. Also, the microphone is way better than the phone or tablets, so there wouldn't he as much ""huh?"" in our conversation. The speaker is pretty high quality as well. Most of the chat features (AR/backgrounds) are low quality and dumb as expected, but there are a few that are pretty good. For example, you can use Spotify to simultaneously play music and you wouldn't hear feedback noise. I also like how the lock screen can show the picture slideshows.

A few things to improve though. Since the smart camera only focus on motion or face, it is hard to tilt it around if you have some other things you want to show. Also, it is not a mobile device but has to be constantly plugged into power. One last thing I find it inconvenient is you have to use your phone to do certain things such as sharing a picture or loading into photo frames. I expect these issues to be fixed soon in the future generations if the product is to continue, so waiting for a bit to buy is not a bad idea. It serves its purpose though, and for a good price too.","More useful than I thought, but can be better"
"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 Apr 2020,Lindam116,I purchased 3 of these for my family across the USA.  It has been a great way for all of us to stay connected.  My elderly parents were able to connect with ease even though they are not tech savvy.  The simplicity is great.  The picture and audio are excellent.  We love the way the camera follows the subject with movement.  I highly recommend purchasing during this time of social distancing.,Wonder way to stay connected
"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 May 2020,Dave51026,Love this device. When you make a call the camera will follow you around the room.

"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,5,23 May 2020,novamel,"I considered this among the echo show and Googles equivalent 8"" display.  Our family has 5 echos in our home and love using alexa which is why this appealed to us as well.  The only limitation is that you can't ""drop in"" on this device.  I just wanted an EASY to use video caller for my parents to use to call my kids.  I got 1 for each home and love it!  The Portal is user friendly, especially for the old and the young.  Almost everyone we would chat with has facebook or/and messenger already so the Portal was an easy choice.  We have tons of pic already on facebook so the digital frame it turns into when not in use automatically rotates them.  Unless you use Amazon for photo storage and everyone you want to talk to has a show also OR you only use google products, the Portal is a winner.    My little ones love the other features as well.",Better Video Chat device then the rest!

"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,1,23 May 2020,J3nBest,I thought this would be fantastic for us to use to be able to video chat with the family and use much like the virtual assistant Alexa or Google play. Sadly this was not the case. All the apps I had on my previous virtual assistant were not available on this device. I decided to return it and get one with the same capabilities as an Alexa or google device to meet our needs.,Not for me

But man after a week, my whole family hated this thing, the digital picture frame function worked alright but holy xxx, built-in Alexa? Did FB got a dumb down version of Alexa or something?

"Facebook - Portal Mini Smart Video Calling 8"" Display with Alexa - Black",1,4,23 Dec 2019,Danv,"The Portal is a great solution to keep in touch with the tech-challenged friends and family members like grandparents or other Luddites in your circle. While it requires a FaceBook account, it does not require BOTH people to have one. My wife does not do social media, but I need to keep in touch since she is medically housebound. The solution is to call myself on the Portal. While this also makes my phone and laptop ring while I wait for her to answer, it's NBD. 
Trying to make this a hub of sorts, FB has baked in Alexa support (it did conflict with the Echo dot in the room, so that will move). You can link Spotify or other streaming music, and there's a rudimentary browser so you can check email and other simple tasks. There is no battery, however, so the AC power--which has a long jack leg that acts as an easel--would make this awkward to use as a tablet. Video quality is decent on average connection speeds, although the camera is a little confused by lack of motion and tends to zoom and pan awkwardly when there's no focal point in the frame. (My wife is laying down, for example, and unless she gestures, the camera often pans away from her looking for motion in the room.)
I can see this as an ideal way to contact grandparents, check in with a child while you're away, etc. But I wouldn't use this for all my friend chatting, because Facebook and privacy. It's also not a high-function replacement for other hub products, Alexa notwithstanding. For the narrow purpose I have--keeping in touch with a loved one who has no cell phone or internet presence--it's an economical, simple solution. But you do sort of have Zuck and Alexa posing as ""elf on the shelf"" unless you massage privacy settings carefully.",Staying in touch is the goal...

I think the large screen TV Portal might be a better option for ""fixed location"" I didn't like the fact that it did not have a battery option so I could take it to other rooms or outside without plugging in.
