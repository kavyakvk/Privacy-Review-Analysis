"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Jun-17,Loki,"Update Jan 2018: I'm giving up on these. I had two of them (this and a Ring 2) and they both miserably fail to do their job properly. Frequent disconnects from the network (when I know the network is fine), several minute delay of relaying a ring to the chime and phones, not announcing that batteries are about to go (so they don't work for days until someone knocks and I know the doorbell is no longer online because of the battery), and I can't use them at all to detect motion due to its inferior motion detection system, abysmal interface and total lack of options for mounting and software knobs to achieve a somewhat sane surveillance mode, so it's just an expensive doorbell, nothing else. Doesn't even work half of the time. Two different models! I have to say that customer service, once I escalated the original issue, was superb in that they tried replacing the original one and then were nice enough to send me a Ring 2 without charge. Sadly, the product is not on par with this. I can't wait for the Blink version to come out to try that, but for now I'll go back to my simple, dumb 20 bucks doorbell set. This one never failed me, once: SadoTech Model CX Wireless Doorbell with 1 Receiver Plugin and 2 Remote Buttons Operating at over 500-feet Range with Over 50 Chimes, No Batteries Required for Receiver, (White), Fixed Code C Series June 2017: When I first installed the door bell it worked somewhat great, with all the motion detection bells and whistles turned on. I also have a Chime so I can hear if someone rings the doorbell without having to rely on my phone all the time, and added the 30 bucks a year subscription to save motion/ring events in the cloud. After a few months the nightmare of constant noise/notifications from motion alerts started. Nothing had changed. Neither the position of the device, the settings, or frequency of traffic. I emailed support, which was an utterly disappointing experience. They first tried to get me to change the settings to make it less chatty. When I questioned that, they tried to explain how the motion detection works and that the range control doesn't actually control the range but size of heat signatures picked up by the motion sensor. Say what? Fine. Don't care, just tell me how to fix it. They recommended pointing it down a bit more (by buying one of their wedge kits), which I did. No change. Change settings again, no change. I recommended to add a still image behind the range settings screen at some point so I don't have to keep printing out screenshots of the range settings view and a live view screen to overlay them (which apparently, since the range doesn't do what it says on the tin, is utterly useless anyway) - ignored (this is of course reserved for the more premium model). Multiple back and forth emails later and I still can't use motion detection (which now also seems to eat up all the battery every 2-3 weeks - because for whatever reason motion detection and silent reporting still happens even if it's ""turned off""). They continuously fail to address my concern that nothing has changed on my end and it has to be a camera/doorbell issue. When I cancelled my subscription and asked if I can get a partial refund, they stopped responding altogether. I'm about to ditch this thing, go back to my cheap wireless doorbell and add a SmartThings integrated camera to watch over the front porch. This product is utterly useless for this purpose, and I don't need a brick as a doorbell that needs to be charged every three weeks. For a device that costs 200 bucks (I include the cost for the video storage subscription here) I expect more - it should work, I shouldn't have to learn or understand the inner workings of the motion detection mechanism, the UX should be intuitive, I expect decent battery life, proper and working functionality, and customer service should be stellar. None of that applies, unfortunately. Update from June 2017: After I could not find any setting to quiet down the motion notifications, customer service kindly sent a replacement and I returned the original. Unfortunately the same issues are still happening. I just can't seem to find any setting that's not going to make the doorbell go after every car going by even with the motion detection turned off. I have it set to the least sensitive settings, purchased a wedge kit to point it downward to avoid the street, and changed motion zones to all conceivable options, all to no avail. All points to software faults at this point (and perhaps systemic hardware design issues as well). The device is therefore useless for me for the following points: * I can not turn off the motion detection completely, even if I turn it off on the app it still triggers. It's ridiculous that turning it off doesn't work or is just per app suppression of notifications! * My partner's phone app which I have shared the door bell with also has the motion detection turned off but still gets the notifications. * The constant reacting to motion drains the battery - I don't have a regular doorbell outlet and am not willing to invest in custom wiring to feed it with power. That's the whole reason I've bought this device so I can be independent of a power supply! I am extremely unhappy with this.","Not ready for prime time: Too many motion events, terrible battery life, no resolution for problems reported."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,20-May-16,JL,"UNRELIABLE! After installing the new Ring Pro doorbell, it was working for about 2 weeks. Then it just stopped working. The problem is that it stopped working after Ring pushed an automatic update to the doorbell (BTW there is no option to control this). So the doorbell doesn't work.Takes hours to reach the customer service. They tell me that there is some ""trending problem"", and promise it'll be fixed that evening. After 3 days, NOTHING, still broken! They don't even push an email to existing customers apologizing, or notifying of the issue as a courtesy. It's been 3 days with a completely broken doorbell. Nest, alarm systems, etc. always work; this Ring does not. You don't realize how much of a problem a broken doorbell presents until... it's broken! Kids, friends, deliveries, etc. Remember, you have to pay someone to install, AND re-install your old doorbell. This went into a stucco painted wall, so putting back the original doorbell is expensive. Don't waste your time and $$$.",UNRELIABLE!!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Sep-16,Lisa427,"I have only been using the Ring for a couple of weeks now but so far it seems worth the cost.  I don't mind the $30 per year cloud storage fee as I'd much rather not have to house the hours of video data this thing records each day in being at the front door.  Installation wasn't difficult once we determined we had the right configs.  Things you should know: 1) we tested ring out of the box after a full charge (the ring button will fully circle with blue light when comeplete) and it worked like a dream.  Good picture, although fish eyed, even in the dark.  That surprised me. 2) we then installed the ring hard wired to our existing doorbell. The doorbell worked, but the Ring video and motion/button notification no longer did. 3) we checked the long list of compatible doorbells that you can find on the Ring website.  While the advertising and box says it works with virtually every doorbell... It doesn't.  We have a Nutone bell. Fairly common.  Doesn't work with ring. I was determined to get this thing working. 4) went to Best Buy and purchased the Ring chime.  It's a plug in ring chime that allows you to install the Ring without hardwiring to your existing doorbell.  So we have the Ring doorbell screwed in to the same place on the doorframe, but the wires are capped off and not connected to Ring. Plugged in and synced up the chime to wifi and it worked.  It's very loud.  You can also hear the Ring chime outside pretty loud so with that plus the Ring chime on every phone, iPad, etc in your house... Maybe not necessary to have the Chime unless you have a 4000+ sq ft house or don't have phones, tablets or computers with Ring app on them near you.  But the plug in Chime was only $30.  To me less hassle and cost than buying and installing a compatible doorbell transformer. 5) Ring began working like a champ.  Then it grew increasingly unpredictable.  We played with the motion settings, decreased it so that cars going by wouldn't alert us of motion at the door, etc.  Butterflies set it off; they say it's heat sensored; not sure butterflies are warm inside, but I digress.  It still works when it needs to ""most"" of the time. 6) As a doorbell, it's flawless.  If someone pushes the button, the video begins.  Talking to the visitor is clear and easy to accomplish.  This is the best feature of the doorbell. 7) motion is hit or miss.  It works, maybe not always, but enough to give me peace of mind on top of my other home security without video capabilities.  Sure I get video at 4am of nothing, so if you are a scared woman living alone this may freak you out more than it helps, but for people with latchkey kids or teens that you want to keep an eye on in terms of verifying they're home or that unwelcome visitors aren't at your home, this is excellent. For people who get deliveries while at work or out of town, or folks who can't get up to answer the door, excellent. To keep intruders at bay... Eh, there are better surveillance systems out there for that. 8) the live view feature does not work if you set up using the not-hard-wired method.  So if doing what I did and using the Ring chime, you will not be able to view live feed from your doorbell.  You'll need the stick up cam.  Didn't know this until after I did all of the above to get this thing functioning.  But, we ended up buying a Ring stick up cam after all to get a better view of the opposite side of our home since the view from Ring is blocked... and we love it. Use it daily. It's motion detection is actually a bit more sensitive but that's okay.  We drilled a small hole in our garage door wall to hard wire electricity to the stick uo cam as it works hard every day and loses battery life in less than 2 months for us. Don't depend on the battery. It will drive you nuts.  Or get the solar charger panel. All in all, I'm happy we made this purchase.  I wonder is the newer version really worth it for ""better"" video quality.  This one doesn't nearly give out 720p so I'm guessing the new version saying 1080p is more like 720. The newer version had some bad reviews in terms of functionality and quality of the doorbell itself so I went with the longer-tested, older version and am quite pleased.  So far so good and worth $200 IMO.  We are still playing with doorbell types and have yet to find one that works after trying two different mechanical transformers.  Customer service was less than helpful and referred us back to the list of tested doorchimes.  If you have one that is not on the compatibility list, chances are it will not work hard wired and you will need the Ring chime.  And again, know that the live feed will not work.  Also concerning charging, it of course depends upon your usage but with a few notifications per day, we notice the battery has drained down about 8% over the last few weeks.  I suspect it will need to be unscrewed and put on the charger within the next 5 months or so at this rate.  If you are hardwiring, it will charge itself.  If you are using the Ring chime and not hardwiring, you will need to charge it using the included USB charger, so expect having to remove it from the front porch every 5-7 months or thereabouts if using this method.  Also don't be afraid to keep playing with the settings... we have managed to get it pretty close to perfect over the last few weeks.  It takes some trial & error.  It still misses some movement, and still picks up nothing... but it's better to have than not, IMO.","It works, but some things you should know first..."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Aug-18,Kindle Customer,"I had my ring for little over 2 years and often had issues with the device. Several times,we have had to remove and reset the device. Most recently (in thelast 2 weeks or so) I started getting blank recorded videos (completely black).  I opened a support ticket and I was told they're aware of the issue and I was asked to charge the unit in the house outlet and also perform a reset.  Which I did, but still continue to have same issue.  After going through those two steps provided by the ring support team, the frequency of these blank videos went up.  Finally they told me I need to replace the unit.  here is their exact email...""I’d be more than happy to replace your Doorbell, but I can see that it isn’t under standard 1 year manufacturer warranty""  and my follow up question to them was...am i expected to replace the unit every 2 years and I was told ""The lifetime of the Ring products is more than three years."" Clearly, they have work to do to get the product up to speed. It’s too expensive to have to replace every 2 years. I really liked the unit while it was working, but am just little frustrated by their support and customer service.",Ring Customer support
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Mar-17,LaLunaTrevor,"I wish I would have spent the extra money for the newer model. My main issue is that the motion will pick up cars driving by on the street 20 yards away, but hardly ever get people walking on the sidewalk just feet from my door, and sometimes I will even get up to the second step of my doorstep only a couple feet from the thing and do a dance and it literally wont get it till I am within a foot of the doorbell. These issues are intermittent and that's the annoying thing. At one point I had it dialed in to not get the cars on the parking lot, but then it would only ever get people if they were literally knocking on the door already, and I don't mean the delay, I mean you could stand there for as long as you want, but till you are right up near the door it wont sense you. Then I dialed it out and eliminated the whole middle section, and that helped with the cars. but because the leftover motion zone was so limited, it would only capture people once they were already past my door. (I live in a townhome, and there is a main walk about 7 feet from my front door). The motion response time, and even the doorbell ring time is so delayed that I will almost always get just the back of people as they go away, even watching the videos after. I know part of it is that my situation isn't perfect for this, being that it only takes a couple seconds to be out of vew of my door and then knocking on it, but still I wish that at least the time from motion to recording was faster, cause then I could at least watch the after videos to see what happened. Like mentioned before, the main thing that bugs me, is I have the motion settings set to only about 10 feet, but they wont get the sidewalk 7 feet away, and only get the road 20-30 yards away every time. My other issue is that this thing is massive. I suppose that may be helpful as a deterrent, but still its a bit of an eyesore up on my porch. This is still a pretty good product, and I feel safer having it on my door, but I wish I would have just spent the extra money fro the upgraded model.",spend the extra money for the new model.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Jan-17,Amazon Customer,Installed this a week ago.  Beyond frustrated with it.  The motion detection just doesn't work.  Drives us crazy with too many false alerts (at least 10 a day) or just complete failures (misses mailman entirely every day and won't pick me up at all no matter how much I jump around in front of it).  When it does happen to work it takes at least 2 min to engage and alert us.  By then the person is gone.  Don't blame our wifi.  We have best hi speed offered by ATT and the router is 5 feet away.  Final note:  the design is visually flawed.  It doesn't look like a doorbell so no one uses it.  looks more like a video camera than a doorbell so everyone sees it but knocks on the door anyway instead of pushing it.  We really wanted this to work as we need this level of security at the entry but this just won't do the job.  P.S.  minor issue but now I will have to repair 4 large holes I had to drill into the stucco to mount it.  If you really want to buy this to try it out I highly recommend a temporary attachment of some kind for at least the first few days before committing to a more permanent mount it might save you the hassle of a repair when you inevitably return it.,Too many flaws going to return it
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Dec-15,JP,"Arrived on time and well packaged.  Instructions were clear and the App was easy to install on my iphone.  Easy to install, and looked great.  The video would pixel and could not clearly show a person if there was light behind the target;  but it was marginally passable.  The audio was just awful.  You could not understand anyone at the door, and they could not understand you.  The audio kept breaking up.  I insured that we were linked on my Netgear router and not my Almond expander.  No change.  I contacted customer support and they basically advised me to reboot the Ring -- that is go thru the setup sequence again.  Did that and no change.  I thought I would work on it later, and then discovered it would not alert me that there was someone standing at the door -- the motion sensor feature did not work well.  Really disappointed.",Did not ring a bell with me.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Apr-18,seactygrl,"I bought this back in the fall of 2016. It worked great! I didn’t like that I had to pay a fee per year, but I paid the $30/year.  I had it hardwired to the house, but would have to charge the Ring during our cold winters (-20). That was fine. Then for some reason my live view stopped working. It was hard wired and it said I had 0% battery.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with there troubleshooting team. I factory reset it once, I did the normal reset five times and the answer was—- I have to buy their upgraded protection service for $100 per year. Not happy. Not happy at all. I might as well buy a new Eing every other year for the price they want me to pay for a warranty. How about a product that works???",Didn’t work after 1 1/2 years. Told me to upgrade.

The video and audio quality are good, and the interfaces easy to use. The online record is easy to access via the phone or web. We can see who came. We have a recording of one oddball coming to the door that I'm happy to have to provide police in case something bad happens. We've been able to confirm that some commitments people have made were actually met. However, it often fails to detect motion, even when someone has passed right in front of it. There are times when we'll come and go right past it, and it will capture nothing. We're probably averaging about a 75% success rate currently. Yes, yes, we've tried changing the settings and re-testing - between 5 and 10 times. At some point, it just gets old. The more devices I buy, the more time I spend taking care of them, and the less time I have for anything else. After a while I think maybe I exist to serve them, and not the other way around.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Mar-19,liyipui123,"Here’s what happened in my house yesterday. Some thief stole my Ring Doorbell and did a factory reset, then put it under their account and deleted all the historical videos from there, obviously including their footprint caught by Ring. The whole process is so easy that it doesn’t require any permission from my end. The only notification I got was an email saying, “Your Ring Device Has Changed Ownership”, after the device has been transferred to their account and I already lost access to it. I’ve had Ring Doorbell and Ring stickup camera for over a year with their Protect Plus Plan which stated, “Your Ring videos are stored in the cloud for up to 60 days (in the USA).” However, Ring Support Team told me the videos are gone and they couldn’t recover it. They do offer free replacement on stolen device, which I appreciated, but now I’m seriously concerned with the functionality of this product. 1.  As a security product, why Ring allows factory reset and change of ownership without account holder’s permission? If there’s a permission requirement sent to me (like most security system do nowadays), then I will have opportunity to deny it before they can delete the videos. 2. Since I paid the Protect Plus Plan under my account, I would assume the videos stored in the cloud are associated to my account not with the device. Even if they can delete the video locally stored on the device, why they can delete those stored in the cloud, which supposedly been protected under my account? The logic behind security products like Ring is that you pay for emergency situations like this. If the system only works when nothing happened but failed when thief coming, I don’t think anybody should waste their money.",ALERT! Anybody can steal your doorbell and walk away!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jun-18,leor,"I was really excited to order the Ring doorbell after reading about it on the internet. Upon receiving the Ring my husband installed it on our front door. We set the motion sensor to between 5-10 feet. Within minutes we began to receive notifications of motion outside our door. When we checked to see the motion that was detected it ended up simply being a car driving down our block, about 25 feet away from where the Ring device was mounted. Not a problem, you say? Well, firstly it can get pretty annoying when each time a car drives by you are alerted about motion outside your door. The bigger issue was that on dozens of occasions motion taking place immediately outside our door failed to be detected at all. A few times when I left the house in the morning or returned in the evening my activity did not set off the motion sensor. The same happened with my husband and children when they exited or entered our house. It was really ironic that this device which was supposed to be a security measure of sorts did not get triggered on dozens of occasions when we were literally opening the front door of our home, but detected our neighbor across the street mowing his lawn. The only positive comments I can make are about the ease of installation and the customer service representatives. We had the device set and mounted within a few minutes. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. When I called the toll free number to try to troubleshoot the issues I was having, I received very courteous and efficient service. However none of the tips and tools I was offered helped fix the problems we continued to have. Within a week of having the device I returned it.",Complete disappointment!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Dec-17,Doug Colt,"I am really at a loss to express how disappointing this product was. To start off, I am extremely tech-savvy and my home is wired with a good 40+ z-wave, Insteon, Hue, and Zigbee devices.  I also have extensive experience in electrical engineering. Right off the bat, the first Ring doorbell I received would not charge via hardwire.  This was a brand-new installation with a new transformer, new resistor, and all voltages confirmed with a volt meter.  I spent a good 45 minutes waiting on the phone with Ring tech support to get the inevitable conclusion that this was a defective unit.  But instead of just swapping it out right there on the phone, they first wanted me to send back the mounting plate, wait for a new one to be shipped, try the new mounting plate, call back if there was a problem, and THEN they would ship out a new unit.  That was very disappointing customer service from the beginning. Luckily, Amazon came to the rescue and shipped out a brand new unit overnight to replace the defective Ring unit. One would think this would solve the problem but alas, no.  TWO DEFECTIVE UNITS IN A ROW that would not charge via hard wire.  Thinking that there was some freak problem with the transformer, I borrowed a friend's Ring doorbell.  Boom--charged right away.  So yes, I ended up with two bum units in a row.  That should never happen. Setting aside the double hardware failure, a few other major gripes: 1)  The Android software for this is absolutely awful.  It is incredibly slow, buggy, and crashes frequently.  And good luck trying to use the ""Live View"" feature.  It takes at least 30 seconds to connect to the doorbell and again, crashes the app the majority of the time. The frustration level is just off the charts and I cannot believe the app ever made it out of beta. 2) The Ring does not play well with two or more devices.  I have an iPad permanently mounted in my living room for all types of home automation, including the Ring app.  The Ring app is always open in the background obviously.  Apparently if you have one Ring app opened somewhere and you then try to open it on another device (such as my phone when I'm out of the house)--crash.  How is this possible? 3) This is just personal, but the actual doorbell sound on this thing is really jarring and there's no way to change it to anything else.  That should be a basic feature. 4)  The interface is slow, slow, slow. This looked like such a wonderful product on the surface but was an utter disappointment.  I'll be returning the second defective unit.",Astoundingly disappointing on multiple levels
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Jul-18,Bartly,"UPDATE 8-20-2019: This Ring doorbell sucks! The device has an RSSI of 38 which is supposed to be great. I had a package delivered today and the delivery driver walked all the way up to the front door which is about 20 ft in plain view of the Ring doorbell. He set the package on the ground, took a picture of the package, rang the Ring doorbell and walked back to his van. HE NEVER SHOWED UP ON CAMERA, THE RING DOORBELL DID NOT START RECORDING UNTIL HE WAS GONE! This thing is useless. I've had the ring doorbell since Jan 2017 and it's now July 2018, so about a year and a half. I have it hard wire to the doorbell power so it doesn't need batteries. I've had two packages delivered today at different times of the day and I also had someone out to my house to take pictures of a problem area. The problem area is clearly visible to the Ring Doorbell camera but the camera didn't even activate to record the movement so i didn't get a notification at all. When my first package was delivered on my doorstep, directly in front of the Ring Doorbell, I didn't get a notification nor did it activate the camera to record. When the second package was delivered, I got a notification but by the time Ring was finally able to connect (I got a message that it was having trouble connecting, I tried again and it did finally connect.) I could see the additional packages on the doorstep but by the time the camera activated to record, the delivery person had already dropped off the package and left. It will record if someone rings the bell and stands there long enough for the camera to start recording but that really defeats the purpose of why I purchased this product. I want to make sure I get a recording if someone is stealing packages not just dropping them off. The video is also very choppy and grainy. It's a wifi doorbell and I was concerned with the range to my router might be a concern, so I called the manufacturer and explained the issue. They said if could be a problem and told me I might need a wifi extender. Well, it turns out that they happen to sell those also. So I bought the Ring Chime Pro and wifi Extender on May 31 2017 hoping that would solve the problem. So, I've had the Ring Doorbell operating through the Ring wifi Extender for over a year now as well. It's still awful quality and doesn't capture anyone coming to my door about 90% of the time. It's a lot of money for something that doesn't function as described. The description says you get instant alerts when visitors press the bell or trigger the sensor. The alerts have not once been instant for me. It says Crystal clear HD video. I get grainy and choppy on all of my devices at best. 1 star is much more than this product deserves.",DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Jun-19,Scotty,"Inaccessible, drop outs and latency in a video doorbell is unacceptable. I have reliable 100 Mbps internet plan thru Spectrum with a new TP link wireless access point within 10 feet of the video doorbell. The wireless access point is literally on the other side of the door. At random times you can not access the doorbell even when on the local home network.  The RSSI values swing from 43 to 69.  I believe that the design of the doorbell is as follows and is flawed.  When the doorbell is pressed the video is streamed to Ring server initially before the phone app can access the video stream. Once it is streaming the phone app is accessing the video steam from Ring server.  I can only assume the latency or can’t connect to doorbell is connect issue to video stream on Ring server since I know my local network (1000 Mbps hubs and new wireless access points as well 100 Mbps internet) is not the issue.  I originally thought the POE Wired $500 Ring Elite was way to go but people who bought that version are having same issue.  I had a hard time paying $500 for a video doorbell even if it had no latency.  If there was some other solution similar to Ring I would be doing it.  Currently looking at adding door dome camera with speaker and microphone to my Amcrest surveillance system.  Not a nice integrated solution to Ring but at least I can get video and audio. In this scenario the Ring is a $99 door chime.",Needs new design.  Connection and latency issues plague this device.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Oct-17,Thomas,"This thing is wonderful in theory. However, I've tested this thoroughly and it's amazing, when it works. Very inconsistent. I've ran around 600-800 tests on this, starting from ringing the bell and the motion sensor. Here's what I've found: - When the doorbell is rung too many times in a day, your device will be knocked off wifi. Keeping this connected to wifi appears to be a chore, and mine is only 25 feet away. There is also no warning that your device has been knocked off the network either. So you can go a whole month or two without ever knowing this thing is offline. - Walking sensor is utter rubbish. I turned this on the highest settings and it misses humans coming to the door more than 75% of the time. When it does pick something up, it's usually too late because it take a whole 30 seconds for the app to load and bring the picture up. Why is this important, the average criminal is going to wait 10-15 seconds to hear if they see or hear movement on the inside of the house before they move to the back yard. So by the time you get your app open at the 32 second mark, the criminal will either already have your package or be in your back yard. Don't let the videos they post on their own channel fool you, this thing is a grade A piece of rubbish. I'm going to try something else and hope I find something much better.",Rubbish
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Sep-19,Drewe,"I've had this doorbell for about two months now and it's been doing pretty good but there are some issues that are worth writing about. First off, the motion detection feature sends me motion notifications way too often because 95% of the time it picks up cars passing by. There are some ways to adjust the motion detection area but it hasn't helped me a bit, if not made it worse. There is a feature where it will ask you questions like 'How many feet away are cars from the doorbell?"" or ""Are there any steps leading up to the door?"" in order to fix the detection area but that hasn't helped. There is also a feature where you can manually move the detection area but along with the questions, it hasn't fixed anything. Second, when the doorbell records when people come up to the door it often records when they are leaving the door and not coming up to it. Which makes no sense because you can not see their face or what they did at the door. I also tried to see if moving the detection zone would do anything but that didn't work. The only time I see the person's face is if they ring the doorbell and if they don't leave so quickly. Now, I do like a good amount of stuff about the product that make up a little bit for the things I did not like. Setting up the doorbell didn't take to long and it came with everything you needed to install it. The paper instructions overall were pretty clear, but I prefer watching a video about installing it. The camera quality of the Ring is good and exceeded my expectation and the area the camera can see is pretty wide. When you purchase Ring you will be prompted to download the Ring app which is possibly one of my most favourite things about the Ring Doorbell. The app is really user-friendly and it has a lot of features I really enjoy. Through the app, you are able to talk to people who approach your door which I find as a very useful feature. For example, you can see if people around your neighborhood have published recordings and if there were any recently reported crime incidents. Overall, The product had some pros and cons but mostly pros which is why I give it 3 stars out of 5.","Pretty Good, but has some issues.."

We've had it for less than a year and twice now it's stopped working for no reason. Of course we don't notice right away so by the time we notice it we've gone days without it or a doorbell all together, which is not okay! The first time we had to unscrew it from the base and reinstall it....now it's offline even though our internet is working fine. FYI, if it's offline you not only lose video you don't have a working doorbell at all! Would not buy again! If we can't get a fix to this happening every few weeks we will be returning! Just got off the phone with Ring...even though the product is defective you can not return it for a refund....they want you to get on with tech support to troubleshoot, it's fixed for a few weeks and messed up again. What a waste of money, go with a different brand if you're looking for a video doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Sep-19,Joseph R Earley,"The Ring is not ready for production and should have never been sold to the public. I think the biggest issue is because it doesn’t record 24/7. Instead it only records when it detects motion.  Add that to the fact that it has no onboard storage - so it has to store everything online. Too bad it sucks at detecting motion. It only detects after someone is walking away from my door.  Basically, I have hundreds of videos of cars driving by and the back of the mailman as he’s walking back to his mail truck. I haven’t seen a single face yet. People come up to my door, leave a package, and then take a picture of it on my stoop - and then walk away. The only thing recorded is the back of the delivery guy as he walks away from my door. PLUS. It’s grainy as hell. Video quality is not like the ads. It garbage.  Pixels on top of pixels. and like others have said - their support is no help. They all say the same thing: “it’s my network”. But, no, it’s not. I have an amazing network. I’ve done multiple speed tests and it’s blazing fast. But - Because they suggested it - I bought a WiFi extender next out it next to the Ring. That didn’t change a thing.  Still garbage. And - now - on top of all of this: after one year it’s WiFi stopped working. No matter what I do, I can’t get it to connect to any network. Not just mine, I’ve tried multiple networks and it just won’t connect. So, now I have a camera that starts recording way too late, only records the back of people as they leave my doorway, has crappy pixelated quality video, that has no functions at all now because it won’t connect to the network. I have other cameras in my house - I spent no more than $40 for any of them - and they always work - record all day long - and have HD quality.  Why are we buying the Ring????? I hate that I spent so much money on this and now I have to go buy one that works. I think I’m going to go buy the google nest camera. I hear that one works great.",Wasted my money on this mess
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jul-19,J.N.,"Update: After writing this review I was contacted by ring directly and their customer service department offered to help me troubleshoot my doorbell issues. They worked with me for several weeks to sort out the issue... turns out I didn’t have quite the right set up for my doorbell location. They worked with me consistently until the issue was resolved and it was probably the best customer service I have received from any company ever. So that is a huge plus. My improved setup seems to be working much better now, so maybe my suggestion would be to do some research on your house and the various options to see what works best for you to get optimal results. Overall I’m satisfied. Hopefully it’s presence just deters the bad guys... Well... I wish this worked. But it doesn’t. It picks up every single garbage truck or car on the street despite me adjusting the settings over and over again, however 3 people walked into my house on 3 separate occasions and it never even picked up a hint of it. Didn’t pick up the entrance and didn’t pick up the exits. We were on vacation and I had a few of my family members come in to check on the place, long story short I became EXTREMELY upset with them while I was gone because according to my ring, they never showed up. I know the damn thing was working because I got video footage of every f****** car that drove by every single day, but yeah no one entering or existing the house showed up. I know they came because at the end of the trip all of the mail they were collecting was on the counter and the plants were sufficiently watered. I only now feel compelled to write this because someone just came running up to the door screaming and pounding on the door before taking off. Silly neighborhood kids... whatever, but, did the ring record any of it? Of course not, but 3 minutes later I got a very nice video of a car. Do not buy this piece of crap. The only reason I bought this was because the neighborhood has a porch pirate problem... i figured if nothing else the darn thing would deter them, but rest assured, someone could enter the house, murder us all and it wouldn’t pick up any evidence. Do not buy this unless you want 75 video alerts a day of cars. Going to rip it off the house and put it in the street for one of the cars to run over. Won’t get that footage, but at least I’ll be rid of the stupid thing.",Useless piece of garbage
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Dec-17,BC,"We have bought several Ring products thru here and other places and have them installed at several properties, and have also bought several as Christmas gift. In addition, we have recommended this product to our colleagues, neighbors, and family from Los Angeles to New York City and Canada, so we were shocked and very disappointed in the latest dealing with their Customer Support when facing set up problems with one of our ring cameras for our Orlando home. We are on the road about 90% of the time, but have a family member living on our home in Orlando and taking care of it, so after setting up the ring video camera - we get a call after the thanksgiving holidays that it's not working, so we told our cousin - no worries, ring customer service is great; well they were. Called ring and was told that because we were on the road, we had to delete my account for orlando ring and have our cousin set up new device, so while more time consuming than I had hoped in fixing a live camera view problem - we did it. One problem, the agent forgot to tell us that the video annual plan we bought would not transfer to new account, so after completing his request - a week later, our cousin was now not being able to access video and being told that she had to pay for annual plan. Not happy with having to waste more time on this simple technical issue, but things happen so I again called ring - and was not told by new agent that the other agent told us the wrong thing - when i deleted the account and had our cousin set up a new device as the owner, we deleted the annual video plan we had payed for. Who is on first, What is on Second? So we are now told to reverse what we were told to do in order to get our annual plan back (which we have already paid for), and then when we ask for a supervisor - the supervisor by the name of Kevin C in Phoenix keeps us on hold for over 20 minutes, and tells the agent that he has no time to talk to us. Conclusion: This used to be a great product, but this experience is making us consider returning the Christmas ring products we had bought, and that maybe Ring has grown too fast and not trained their customer support supervisors/agents adequately.",Long Time Fans and Buyers of Ring Doorbell Disappointed

I've adjusted the range/sensitivity multiple times, but it still has far too many false motion triggers, so you end up ignoring it. That's certainly not what you want from a product like this. It often misses recording people as they walk toward the door, but records them as they walk away. But that's not much help in identifying who they are. The recorded audio makes a whistling sort of sound. It's annoying, like fingernails on a chalkboard. I bought this doorbell camera because I have the Ring security system, which is quite good. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the doorbell camera.",A disappointment.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Dec-19,El Dorado,"I installed my doorbell and it has over exposure and extreme white background.  My doorbell is located under a porch that is approx. 10ft by 4ft.  It picks up black dots moving but can't adjust to see what is moving.  I called tech support 12/4 and he said there isn't a current software update to help with the matter but to just keep moving it on the wedge until I get a clearer view. I chatted 12/5 and she had me give her a code to access my camera then had me take off and reset.  It didn't reconnect so I had to completely remove it from account / reset and reactivate.  Then she wanted another code to access my video history.  I don't save videos but I have her another access code again to see live view.  She then wanted to me to add her as a shared user.  I was confused because anything on my app she should be able to do on her end plus already see my live video; even after reminding her I deleted my history. 12/5 called over the phone after spending an hour with tech and he explained there was nothing he could if she already did all the trouble shooting.  Asked why a competition YI was able to quickly adjust to exposure light and their doorbell couldn't. My regret is falling for this Amazon promo pushed product.  Unfortunately I didn't install my doorbell until after the 30day refund and am stuck this with very old technology. I really hope Amazon see this and drops them and moves on to something more 2019-ish like YI; IMO.  If I could use curse words, there would be a lot in this review.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jun-15,Pokin,"Update 6/6/2017 Someone pried the button off my doorbell and I had to interact with Ring customer service for the first time.  I'm upgrading them back to 5 stars because I was so impressed with my interaction (unlike Skybell).  I went on chat to see about buying a replacement button.  Zach told me they didn't offer replacement buttons, but would be happy to replace the whole unit for me.  A few minutes later, I had an order confirmation and a new unit on the way.  I'm impressed by how easy it was to contact them, and how responsive they were.  On top of that, I'm pretty sure a break-in to my neighbour's house was averted when a suspicious person came to look through her windows last night and she confront him through her Ring. Update 6/1/2016 Finally got live view on my own Ring now.  Other members of my household got it a few weeks earlier than I did so they don't seem to roll it out by household but rather by individual account. Update 3/31/206 Although my Ring has the latest firmware update (1.6.76), I still don't seem to have live view on my app.  According to the Ring support site this feature is being steadily rolled out and users will receive an email when their device has been enabled.  My neighbour's Ring has already been activated so I added a screenshot of what your Ring should look like with live view as an option.  Note : According to the support page on Live View, you will only have this feature on the regular Ring if you are connected to doorbell wiring for power. Update 3/23/2016 You might want to wait to get the new Ring Pro depending on your needs.  They just announced that they are accepting preorders for availability within the next couple of months (not available to preorder on Amazon yet.)  The new Pro version requires wired doorbell power while this current version allows battery.  The Pro version is 1080P instead of 720P and supposedly has better options around motion detection and night vision.  I'm curious to see if the Pro version will resolve some of the issues I've seen (and some of the criticisms other reviewers have) of the delay between a motion alert or doorbell ring and getting the alert on your phone. In my previous update 3/19/2016 I erroneously stated that only Ring Pro will have live view.  As Joe pointed out in the comments, Live View should be available as a firmware update for existing Ring devices.  My device did not yet update so I cannot test this feature, but once mine does I will check it out and update this review again! ------- I bought the Skybell first because I hadn’t heard of Ring.  Due to a manufacturing issue where I started seeing the video feed of SOMEONE ELSE’S front door instead of mine, I got a Ring instead.  I'm actually glad it happened because I prefer the Ring so much more to Skybell, despite some of the limitations. Having had a chance to install both on my door, here are my impressions: ***Installation*** Skybell comes with the bell, a mounting plate, and some instructions.  Screws were standard and installation was relatively straightforward.  Getting the doorbell to connect to our network was a PAIN.  It wasn’t able to connect via a 5G network plus it didn’t have strong enough signal strength so we had to get a second router for and set up a whole separate network for Skybell. Ring’s package impressed the heck out of me.  You get a little tool pouch with all the tools you need to set up the Ring, including a screw driver, drill bit, self level and more.  If you are screwing into stucco (as I was), I don’t recommend you use the included drill bit.  The hole it drilled was a little large and I had to silicone caulk the hole afterwards to give the screws enough grip.  Ring connected to our network pretty seamlessly and didn’t need to have a separate network nor require the 2nd router. ***Size*** Ring is MUCH larger than Skybell.  I wish it was thinner but I understand there’s a lot to cram in.  The Ring does stick out quite a bit visually on my wall, but worth it for what I get.  See attached photo to see the size difference. Skybell: 2.15cm / 0.8in thick, 7.1cm / 2.8in diameter Ring : 0.87in thick, 4.98 tall by  x 2.43 inches wide ***Battery / Power to the device*** Skybell is fairly low powered, so there is no battery attached to it.  It runs off the power from your doorbell so it cannot be mounted anywhere you do not have direct power. Ring is battery powered.  I charged it to about 60% via a USB cord first before I plugged it into the wall.  You can get some trickle power from the doorbell, but depending on the weather and use, you may find you drain the battery faster than it charges.  An hour after the bell has been plugged and with one test video call in I was at 57% battery.  Three days later it charged to 77%.  This might get annoying, but it does mean Ring can be mounted anywhere, not just where you have direct power. ***Mobile App*** Skybell only lets you have one user at a time.  If you want more than one person to have access to the video stream you have to share accounts.  I do like that you can see your doorbell on demand.  I like being able to check in on my door.  I understand that Ring is working on this but it’s not yet available. Ring lets you have multiple users.  The first installed user just has to send email invites to the other users.  Ring shows you recent activity, but you need to pay a $3 a month subscription to see your videos on cloud.  I wish that wasn’t the case but $3 isn’t that bad.  I imagine I will upgrade for the cloud storage long term. In terms of use of app, the Ring interface was relatively straightforward to use and understand.  I like being able to set the active zones for tracking motion so that you don't get too many false alarms. ***Video on demand** Skybell : yes, but I saw another person's front door too. Ring : not yet, coming soon ***Motion detection:*** Skybell : Yes Ring: Yes ***Video quality*** I couldn’t find the specs on the Skybell.  Ring seemed to have slightly higher video quality in the day and slightly higher audio quality but this may be subjective. Please note : If you are expecting the quality that you get on your web cam or Facetime on an iPhone the quality will NOT be comparable. This is still early technology so the voice quality and video quality will be a bit crude.  I suspect the design team had to make some trade-offs between video quality and ability to power the unit via battery / trickle charge from the doorbell electrical wire.  That said, I am able to identify the voices and recognize people in the camera so that for me is sufficient though of course I hope that future generations will continue to improve in this respect.  Ring's cloud recording page gives you a pretty accurate idea of what your videos would look like. ***Lag / Delay between door bell ring and phone notification*** Seems to be about the same on both.  There is a bit of a delay, but for me that’s acceptable compared to the alternative of just missing the door altogether. ***Customer Service*** Haven't had to interact with Ring's customer service, but Skybell's was so horrid I'm still upset about the interaction.  Skybell wanted me to ship my defective Skybell to them at my expense when it was broadcasting someone else's video stream instead of mine right from the start.  I get that it's expensive for them, but it's NOT a way to win a customer. UPDATE : I actually did have to interact with Ring customer service and they impressed me greatly.  My doorbell button was probably tampered with and they issued an exchange, no questions asked within minutes of contact. Overall, between Skybell and Ring, Ring wins for me hands down.",Ring vs Skybell comparison = Ring wins

I was not a happy camper.  This is an update as of March 2019..  Alexis from Ring contacted me about my review and offered to personally help and troubleshoot.  Two phone calls with her and lots of attention from her side later.......the long and short of it is that after her working with me for almost a month, sending back the original device and configuring with a new one, I now have an operating system that is not perfect by the standards of my wireless network, but far superior to what it was.  I am going from 2 stars to 4 stars based on that.  5 stars would be my expectations for the hardware, and it can't get there, but 5 stars certainly gets there for Ring support.  Thank you Alexis for your help, and your personal follow up!! Original review: I bought this doorbell to go with their Floodlight Cam, which I ordered elsewhere.  I wanted to replace my existing motion sensitive floodlight and figured I'd do the doorbell at the same time with the benefit of video thrown in  The good news?  Both of them work.  The bad news?  Not as advertised.  The wireless reception on both of these devices just plain sucks.  I'm an IT person.  I have a high end wi-fi router that blasts 2.4 ghz (with both of these can use) all the way to the other end of my house , and we use everything from Google Home to laptops, to Ipads with it, but this doorbell (and the floodlight) which are both less than 50 feet from the router both complain about poor signal, so the video is ""jerky"" and delayed when someone comes to the door or the driveway.  Nothing at all like the advertisements on TV for real time movement.  I even broke down and ordered a wi-fi repeater on Amazon and plugged it in less than 20 feet from the floodlight and only 4 ft. from the doorbell, and it is still terrible.  The quality of the picture on both the floodlight and this doorbell is fine, but movement is terrible, the Ring app tells me I have wi-fi interference, (I don't)  and all I get from their troubleshooting is to buy a signal booster, which I did and which I don't need anyway.  I give it two stars because the floodlight works fine, but I didn't buy this to have an expensive floodlight and doorbell.  Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't do it again.","Works, but not as advertised- Updated Review March 2019"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Dec-19,Smartypants_Monica,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Debated a very long time on what type to go with and ultimately chose Ring over Nest BUT only because we are Alexa house. Started with the Ring Alarm panel and door sensors. Worked great and bought the Ring door bell...works terrible. During my 30 day free trial here are my challenges: 1. ANSWERING THE RING ALERT: My locked iPhone detects the doorbell, I select the alert, my phone prompts me for my password and the Ring app opens automatically and I answer HOWEVER when the same occurs on my hub's Samsung, he unlocks his phone, the app DOES NOT open automatically, he gets to the app, opens it and by the time he's done all that the he's missed the person. 2. MISSING THE RING ALERT: a. During the trial period or with a paid Ring subscription: No problem, you just playback the clip of the Ring and see who it was. b. AFTER the trial period, if you don't have a paid subscription: You can no longer look at the clip...(you have to buy their subscription) c.  What you can do after trial end IF you miss the doorbell and you didn't pay for the subscription you CAN look at the camera's live feed...IF they are still standing there. 3. MOTION DETECTING SENSOR: a. During trial or with paid subscription: I got messages alerting me ""Motion detected at your front door"" open the app, play the clip and only hear the door closing and missed the person coming in or out (yes I tried all the recommended senor adjustments with no ease or luck) b. After trial with no subscription,  you get the alerts and again cannot access any clips (money money money) 4. PRICE AND FEATURES: For what it costs, it has too many challenges, has expensive extras that you most likely need (attachment that allows you to hear the ring in the house without having to carry your phone, extenders to boost signal), and the fact that it loses most of the features you want in the video doorbell without a paid subscription... It is NOT worth it. Becuase I don't like to complain without offering solutions, here is what worked for me... What did I buy INSTEAD OF RING?: Frustrated and still in need of a temp solution I bought a Wyze pan camera for 36ish bucks and a mini SD card based on reviews (and it's Alexa compatible) to try it and I LOVE it. Now it's NOT a doorbell but heck I don't answer my doorbell anyways (my giant mastiff provides free alerts to the entire neighborhood when some tries to get close to the front of the house and he looks mean, see attached video) I just want to replay the coming and going activities or watch live feed if I see fit so this Wyze device is perfect!!!  It detects motion and/or sound and sends alerts, it motion tracks, motion tags, pan tracks, offers continuous recording that can play back days of time in addition to sending you motion clips based on motion or person detection settings, you can watch the live feed with sound (what you hear is based on distance) AND it has two way selections to listen and talk through it decently, you can create shortcuts to do quick activities (such as one click to pause notifications per your schedule exp: I stayed home sick and I have it set to normally send alerts during work hours so I press my pause shortcut so my hub's doesn't get alerts while I move around the house AND without having to temporarily adust my weekday settings), you can add multiple cameras easily, play back entire periods YOU select in time lapse speed, you can take pics of what you are seeing, take videos live or from the playback (use to black mail your kids when you catch them singing or picking a nose), the app is easy to use, you can buy inexpensive accessories to mount it on an outlet or mount it to a wall, even hang it upside down bcz you can flip the view,  and the best.... NO PAID SUBSCRIPTION required. Long story long, Ring was underwhelming and expensive. Save your dollars. Hope this helped.",Save your money and the headache

Spoty functionality.  Sometimes it would notify me right away, sometimes minutes later.  Vidio was hit or miss to.  Its  set up was relatively easy and at the kitchen table it appeared to working but not as I would expect.  Door bell would ring,  notifications would arrive at the phone but not right away.  There was a bit of a lag.  Ten feet away on the other side of the wall and mounted at the door it didn't get any better. Also bought the range  extender with chime too just in case there was connection issues.  This was located in line of sight to the router and 6 feet away from the door bell on the other side of the wall.  It would not sync right no matter what.  The wifi address would pop up on my phone and it saw the router but would ask to be moved closer and closer to the router until it was inches from it and still would not connect.  The other ring devices saw the router as I would see it on my Phone.  The range extender saw the first and last characters in the routers connection name but made up other characters for the middle.

It will not ring an alexa chime,  or work as an intercom tot he front door. So there's no actual use for alexa.  To top it off you can't activate it with a PC, only android, and then all you can do on a Win 10 PC is look at old events. So I can be sitting at my computer with the ring window open, and if someone comes and rings the bell I won't see it (just hear my normal doorbell), and then at some point later on I can look at poor video of someone standing there long after it happened. So unless I carry my phone around the house with me it's pretty useless. and I have to say I feel really suckered in by Amazon saying it worked with Alexa. Which it does not.

These are very expensive for what you get. They need to come down to below $100 for any component (doorbell, security light camera, stand alone... ) before they are really worth it. There are many positives about this. I have the G2 doorbell Pro. - It does a great job of capturing video of anything that triggers it. - the video actually starts a few seconds before the motion sensors trigger. so it is constantly recording and overwriting the last several seconds of video until it is triggered - this means you will capture video of things that trigger the motion sensor - the down side, do not believe that you will be able to interact with people at the door - they will have most likely left before you even receive a motion alert - I have on many occasions gone to live view when alerted, only to see no one there. But when the recording becomes available several minutes later, you see the entire action from just before the alert for a full minute of video of the area. - the good news is, the unit will start recording again if there is additional movement after the recording stops, so unlike the G1 they cannot trip and wait for the recording to stop. - If the person is legit, delivery or whatever, they will do what they are there to do, drop off a package or ring the doorbell (which is another trigger) - if they are up to no good (stealing packages), they will be captured on video but you will most likely not see who or what until after they are gone. Certainly information that can be shared with police and neighbors. - I have seen many postings on the Ring neighborhood network, good for the detectives and for neighborhood watch. 12/26 Update Changed from 1 star to 5 star Ring support reached out and helped me troubleshoot my doorbell. They then sent me a replacement Doorbell Ring Pro. This did require me to replace my doorbell transformer and it is a bit smaller so it would not fit on my corner mount. But it came with 2 angled mounts. And they offered to send me another if the included one did not angle it enough but was not needed. I installed the replacement and could immediately tell the difference. Setting the motion zones is easy and offers much more flexibility for where you want motion to be detected. It also has the ability to setup more than one motion zone. The best thing about this version, when someone/something triggers the motion, it actually starts recording the person/object way out at the motion edge you defined. No more only seeing someone leave your property in the recording. This doorbell is great. It does require more Internet bandwidth, but the difference is amazing. Thanks Rings Support for helping resolve my issues. I do wish it were a bit less expensive. but I am sure that will be the case all in good time. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Original I like the idea, however this comes up short. I set the sensitivity to pick up motion in the driveway, long before they would get to my front door. This works sometimes, but mostly triggers as they are leaving my doorstep. As many others have posted, you get a good recording of people walking away. I have had flies and crickets trigger the motion sensor, but more frequently the wind is causing enough motion of bushes or trees to set it off. But when delivery drivers pull up, park and walk up, it fails to pick them up. It does capture them if they ring the doorbell. Some other things to be aware of: - You get a 30 day free recording, after 30 days, you must sign up and pay $3/month or $30/year if you prepay for the year, to save and access video recordings from a single device. - If you have more than one device, the fee is $10/month or $100/prepaid year, more economical with 4 or more devices - I have not figure out how to access this from a DVR and have the recordings saved locally. - Overpriced, the doorbell is a little pricey, but nothing compared to the floodlight security cameras. Odds are, you would have a single doorbell, but you might want multiple floodlight cameras on other areas of your property.  At a whopping $249 each, they are way overpriced. A security camera system costs less and you do get to control the recordings on a DVR.",02/19 Update - What you should know - Motion sensor trigger is hit & miss - Price needs to come down

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Aug-17,Glenn,"**** UPDATE: I originally stated in my review below that I would not purchase the ring pro and spend more money on one of their products. In the interest of honesty, I have to say, I realized that ring is the best product of its kind and went and purchased the ring pro. Shortly after this purchase a representative at ring saw my review and contacted me. She was great! Within minutes I had a credit in the form of a PayPal payment for the full retail price of my ring pro, and was told I could keep my original ring! I now join the throngs of customers that rave about ring customer support! I am a totally satisfied customer, and the ring pro is amazing, but that is a review I'll post on the ring pro side. Thank you Ring! Let me start by saying I love the doorbell, and for the most part it functions as it should albeit not ringing a few times and getting phone calls from food delivery places telling me they're standing at the front door. The battery.... Ohhhh the battery. Lasts a couple months one time, then a month another time. Always charging. Called ring and they were not receptive of upgrading me to a pro doorbell. I told them I was now going to run wires to hardwire (which I didn't want to do originally) and told them, had I known I was going to run wires I would have bought the pro version. Again, they were not willing to return and upgrade. There is a reason they came out with ring doorbell 2 with a detachable battery. Even then I'm sure you'll be constantly charging. At least include 2 batteries to swap out instead of it being out of commission while charging. Anyway, that's my story. Maybe I'll try a different brand because I am not giving them more of my money to upgrade to a pro at full retail price.",Battery is not as advertised.... ** updated**
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Oct-18,DirtyBulker,"I was very excited when I received my Ring door bell, but that went away fast when I started having problem after problem. Here is the list: - The unit does not record unless you have a paid cloud account with Ring. Other companies offer free cloud storage (or at least they store your recordings for free the first 24 hours). - My unit is advertised to record in 720P, but it has inferior quality compared to an IP camera that I have with the same resolution. - The device stops recording after 20-30 seconds for battery-operated devices even if physically installed as hardwired (60 seconds option is only for hardwired devices without a battery option). - When you try to answer an event on the app, it takes a while to open and by the time it loads, the person at your door is gone. - When you star an event it saves it, but when I check a few days later is gone, these happened every single time. - Connection to Wi-Fi is not stable, even when my router is less than 10 feet away and I have the Ring device on a designated network with around 64 Mbps download speed and 12 Mbps upload. - After 2 weeks it stopped ringing the chime (which is mechanical and it works fine if I use a regular doorbell push button) - After 3 weeks itworks stopped charging (even though I have 22V coming from the transformer and at the wires connected to the mounting plate/charger) That's when I decided that enough is enough and returned it. - I reached out to customer service a couple of times but they tried to blame my Wi-Fi, my phone or my wiring and couldn't offer any help. I would like to add that I am an IT professional with Network and Low Voltage experience and I did extensive troubleshooting to no avail, including: - Restarted Wi-Fi router and monitored connection speeds and bandwidth, which checked okay. - Restarted phone (Samsung S8) uninstalled and reinstall app. - Removed and re-added Ring device a couple of times - Changed transformer. Originally, I had a 16V transformer and upgrade it to 24V, just in case that 16V was not enough juice. - Ran new wiring from Ring device to transformer AND from transformer to Chime. All voltage readings checked okay at every endpoint, and all continuity tests passed. - Replaced the Chime Bottom Line: My main complaint is about the short length of the recordings, which in addition to the lagging on picking up movement, makes a very poor system to detect and record events at your property. All a burglar needs to do is to cover their face for 30 seconds). The company has advertised for a while a new feature (the user ability to control the length of the recordings) but they have not delivered yet. Maybe I got a faulty device, but after reading so many customer reviews about issues with the motion detector feature and other flaws, I will stay away from these kind of devices until the technology has improved. I read about other brands having the same issues as well.",Flawed and useless
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Feb-19,Diggity Dan,"I bought the Ring when it was on sale for Black Friday. First I had trouble setting up the device through the app. The app kept freezing up during the setup. Contacted Ring support on Twitter and didn't get a reply. Deleted the app and reinstalled. Finally the app worked. This does not come with an inside ringer so that is an extra $30 if you want that. But if your existing doorbell wires are powered, then it will ring that doorbell when you push the button on the Ring. The field of view on the original Ring is good. It's a very wide FOV so it can see a person even if the doorbell is away from the door. It has good sensitivity to movement so anyone coming up to the door will alert you. Here is the problem with the Ring. You MUST pay for the monthly subscription in order to record anything. If you do not pay for the subscription after the first 30 days, then it is just a video doorbell. It will not record anything. So you pay $99 for a doorbell button and then have to pay a subscription forever in order to use it as advertised. If you have an Amazon Fire HD tablet, forget about using it with the Ring. Ring is supposed to be partnered with Amazon and is supported on their devices. Well, it's NOT supported on a Fire tablet. There's not an app from Ring available for it. There's some other people who have made apps that you can buy for like $7, but nothing from Ring. If you want to pay the subscription to Ring forever, then get the Ring. If you want to skip the subscription, then go for something like the Arlo Cameras that offer free Cloud video storage and keep your existing doorbell button. Edit: You can connect the Fire HD to the Ring through the Amazon settings. The problem is it takes too long to open it up and see who is there and you can not talk to the person at the door. I found a way to load Google Play store on the Fire HD and then load the Ring app that way.","Good for 30 days, then pay for recordings"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Nov-17,AmazonCust,"Overall packaging and install went great. Product is cool idea, however, on the product video, they showed the ability to set motion zones on a screenshot of the live stream and this was the main feature that sold me on the product, especially after reading early reviews that state the motion sensor was overactive. I could only access the ""zones"" view and couldn't get the motion activity to stop activating for every single car that passed by. (I know I can turn notifications off, but I'd prefer to have my notifications on and for it to work correctly). I have it set to activate for motion activity for somewhere around 10' from the Ring unit, however, it's activating for every single passing vehicle at around 20-30' from my Ring unit. Because I couldn't figure out how to custom define the area via a screenshot, I tried to contact Ring customer support via their chat dialogue on their site and this is where a frustrating experience got even worse. I entered the chat dialogue and was told to enter my text. Then I sat there awaiting a response on an active chat window for over 5 minutes(closer to 10) without any response or notification that I was in a chat queue. After getting frustrated at waiting for any response or signs of life from their chat, and already being frustrated about the product, I was told to either upgrade to the Ring Pro or basically too bad. I feel like I was bait and switched at this point and even more agitated that they were so non-chalant in their response, especially when I tried to point out that the product video on the listing was inaccurate and about the non-response/non-notification that I wasn't actually on with an agent in chat...that I was just in a queue. They could care less about retaining my business and I could care less about being a Ring evangelist. I couldn't wait to talk to my friends and family and share this awesome device with them...nope. Instead, I'll do the opposite.",Cool product - mislead on features and Ring customer service didn't care
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Jun-17,Tyhand1,"When it works, it works well. However, the unit seems to drop off line frequently. We've got high speed internet of a good, reliable quality and this device seems to be the only one that routinely drops off line. It is hard wired into power and only about 15 feet from the router. Would be really nice if the phone app had a way to plot online/offline time so you could see how often and how long the device was ""lost"". Currently working with Ring support who is responsive and helpful. If they can figure out what's going on, I'll update this post. UPDATE - Got this escalated to Level 2 and they punched a hole in the firewall to try to help the unit stay online. I also removed the device from my Apple iPhone as the master. It seemed to have more troubles than the wife's Android phone. But, now Ring can't seem to get the account straightened out. I constantly get messages that my account is not valid. Worked with Ring to try to resolve this, but it still isn't very consistent. The product doesn't seem all that stable or reliable but the support team has been helpful. For this reason, they get a second star, but I wouldn't purchase another one. UPDATE 11/28/2017 - I must be one of the unlucky few. This thing doesn't work very well at all for us. Support has tried to help, but it doesn't seem to help. I get a lot of video of people's backsides as they walk away from the door. Sometimes it just freezes during video playback/capture. The most improvement we got was when I installed the Ring App on a computer that never leaves the house. This seems to mostly keep the doorbell connected to the network. When the App was installed on our two roving phones, it would disconnect pretty regularly. UPDATE 12/32/2017 - It got ""cold"" in the south (down into the teens and 20's) and this thing started reporting a low battery. It's hardwired into power!! Must be some kind of problem with the rechargeable battery pack or something. Brought it inside to charge manually and will see what happens next.

Here is where the problems started, someone at Ring decided to charge my credit card to get all my devices on the ""Same renewal schedule"" without my permission, I did not want them on the same schedule but Ring took it upon themselves to charge my credit card to pro rate all 3 devices, told them to refund the money they took without my permission and put the devices back on the schedule they were on.....talk about stupid customer service....cant do it 4 people cant do it well you took money you were not authorized to take, refunded my money put me on a trial cut one of my devices short on the year by 2 months wont fix that... So my doorbell lens had a scratch (yea the one that is outside in the wind and cold and rain and snow) Sent me a refurbished (did not know it was refurbished when I agreed to get another one, was told it was new) it gives me blank videos, wont register motion, battery drains in one day, they will not send me a new one all I get is lets troubleshoot....how do you troubleshoot blank videos Ring says well it might be where its placed..WTF my other one work wonderful same place I used the old mount plate...customer service well maybe its what you have it attached to OK now I know they are stupid as bricks again how times do I have to tell you the one I sent back worked perfect, not to mention the customer service rep stated to me that I had 1300 motion alerts for the doorbell UH NO she said I can see the cars OK I NEVER GAVE PERMISSION TO LOOK AT MY VIDEOS.....Think about another company PLEASE they really don't care, everything I mentioned about is still not fixed.",They will look at your videos without your permissions.

Update 10/05/17: Customer service's promise was never honored, the labeled box for returning this item never arrived. These products have no warranty, as seen in the other reviews, once you buy this unit you're on your own, no return policy, they would only offer to replace your new device with a used one... This device only worked for a few weeks, just enough to clear the short amazon.com money back deadline and then it stops working. This product has been a scam in our experience, buyers be cautious. Update 9/19/17: Customer service has been outstanding, we had to cancel our subscription and returned the device because we were exhausted from continuously reconnecting it, restarting, and buying more components to make it work. I would point out that customer service was very polite, local english speaking, and very supportive. We give this company 2 stars on the product but 5 stars for customer support, Gabriel from customer service was very supportive and we plan on buying these products in the future when it becomes more reliable. Update 9/18/2017: it's been about two months from the date of purchase and this device has already died... it worked on and off when it was hardwired to the doorbell's 16V line, it only staied connected continuously for about two weeks and we had to keep reconnecting to the router that is only 12 feet away... We're done with it. We're cancelling our subscription and returning everything we bought for this thing. We had purchased the Ring Chime decice hoping that it would work better with that speaker, but no luck. the other day it got stuck emitting a hight pitch noise and had enought time to record it on video, will post it as soon as we figure out how to upload videos to the reviews. We are just too tired of hoping for this unit to work reliably. The presentation is great, it also comes with its own tools for installation, but the functionality is disappointing; it has potential but doesn't work very well quite yet. The volume on the phone app is so low no one can hear it... there are no settings for tones, you are stuck with the factory sound. The notifications only work half of the time and all it does is send a visual note that looks like a text, no sound, sometimes it barely vibrates for a microsecond, but that's it. It doesn't provide enough sound or vibration to notice that someone has pushed the bell button. The video quality is great, the video recording service is very good, the field of view of the camera is perfect, the liveview option is hard to find in the app (as there are two fields with the same title) but it does work great once you find out how to access it. Long story short, it is a good idea but we never know when someone is ringing the doorbell... we learn about it after the fact when we happen to look at our phones.","Stopped working after two months, not reliable"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-19,salesguy,"I charge the device and go through the set up procedure and I find that the lag time is horrendous. When someone approaches the front door they can walk up and leave an item.....or take the item and all I see is the  persons back as they leave. I have tried various settings and combinations of settings with the same dismal outcome. Next if you do happen to have someone actually ring the doorbell and you are able to open the app in time to speak to the person at the door, the volume is so low the person has lean down to within a foot of the doorbell to hear my voice. I have also noticed that people are onto the look and sound of the Ring doorbell and they have a tendency to knock on the door rather than ring the doorbell. This was not the case when I had the old school doorbell button. Finally, in order to view a saved file you must subscribe to their service which is $3 a month or $30 a year. If you do not subscribe you can only view the live feed so essentially this is a $99 door bell with no recording capability. In my opinion I think I would be better off with a hard wired 8 camera system and an independent recording device. For the record, my phone is a Note 8 and my Internet is Spectrum Cable with their 100 meg service which is only about 5 meg upload. FIOS is not available in my area.

Not until I downloaded the app did it say there was only a 30 day free trial period, when I had to pay $4.00 a month to receive what was advertised. Also, the camera quality is so poor, I doubt it would be very useful for facial recognition. Contrast lighting from the sun, along with shade on the porch, makes it difficult see much at all on a sunny day. If you have a weak Wi-Fi signal outside, it may not work at all.

Purchased before Christmas based on good price and good reviews on Amazon. Just opened it this week and what a disappointment.  It is a disappointment in and of itself, but when I compare it to the ease of use and reliable performance of Arlo devices, and it falls even more miserably short. The microphone  would never activate allowing two-way communication. The motion detection was unreliable. Alerts for motion detection we're also unreliable.  I knew there might be a problem when I went to the App Store to download the Ring app and saw the bad reviews. Not sure where all of the high ratings come from on the Amazon site.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Aug-19,Kitsap Consumer,"I was very hopeful and it seemed like a good idea, but this doorbell (Gen 1)  just has not performed from the day it was installed. I have the Ring hardwired and connected to a brand new interior doorbell that was installed at the same time by an electrician. Unless you press the Ring button firmly the light will spin but the contact does not engage the interior doorbell. My available wireless is also at the low end of the bandwidth for the Ring so by the time my phone or tablet alerts me it can be more than a minute. In many situations it is the motion sensor that is activated and alerts me. This doorbell including motion detection is so slow that I seldom know that a package has been delivered until the couriers or USPS are in their vehicles and driving down the road. Many a day I have found a package has been delivered but the delivery person has been crouched as they place the package and then if they are moving fast even the motion detection may not be activated as they leave and I get no record of the delivery (I use I a wide band of coverage and high sensitivity). The only person who gets regularly captured on the Ring is me as I enter and leave the door, so I know the motion detector does work. Delivery people are moving fast and they seem to be able to evade the motion detector which gives me little hope that a thief would also be recorded. I have had this Ring jam up about every 6 months, particularly when there is an update. This is a real pain as you have to unscrew it from the wall to reset it and if you are on vacation the Ring becomes useless. I have contacted customer service multiple times they tell me that I have to upgrade my internet DSL service or router, move the Ring closer to the access point or buy the newer Ring. Upgrading the DSL will double my monthly internet access so I opted to add an internet access point extender to the front porch (did not help), upgraded my router (helped a bit) and added a second access point (helped a bit more). Rather than spend a couple of hundred dollars to upgrade the Ring, I spent $25 on a Wyze security camera from Amazon. What a difference. Every time someone gets near the front door I get a quick motion notification that someone is at the door. Now I get all sorts of notifications of someone or an animal (usually deer) near the front and this motion is often not reflected by the Ring. The Wyze does not charge a monthly fee to access the recordings and they have software that allows more control that what is on the Ring including live view. The community security reports on Ring are also useless as I live on an Island and the zone of coverage excludes part of the island but includes part of the mainland which has the majority of the criminal activity. I've been gone for 3 weeks and it is clear to me in running the Ring in parallel with the Wyze camera, that the Ring is just not a good security device in my situation. While I was gone, my Wyze camera repeatedly recorded up to 5 times a night that the Ring light was coming on erratically but the Ring was not recording anything - the Wyze camera was clearly much more sensitive at recording any motion. I am going to drop my Ring subscription and rely on the Wyze camera for security recordings. The fees I was formerly paying to Ring will be used to buy additional Wyze cameras. I would not recommend that anyone buy a Ring doorbell unless they are already paying for very fast internet service, and even then, an inexpensive camera like the Wyze may be a better option to monitor your front and other doors.",After 4 years I give up. Ring Doorbell just does not work as a security device.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Jun-18,RP,"This item is very cleverly advertised but delivers less than many $20 solutions. Delivery company's (UPS, FEDX etc) no longer ring the DOORBELL since they know it's a camera. Motion alerts come in even if you dial in only your front porch zones.

I design and engineer systems, I thought this would be a simple and easy resolution, I was wrong! Biggest complaint, I run a Galaxy 8, all updates are current, and a motion alarm comes in and I can't view it! I have to close the app, re-open, and by that time it becomes utterly useless.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Sep-18,DIYdee,"I have had my Ring Video Doorbell since the beginning of June and to this day have not got it to work as advertised. I contacted support numerous times, each time they had a different excuse as to why it wasn't working correctly, and each time provided a ""fix"" which did not work. I also had the device exchanged through Amazon, and the problems still persisted. The app which provides the settings for the doorbell has settings to adjust the areas of motion which are detected, frequency of alerts etc. Still I get only two results... it detects EVERYTHING (even motion which is not there) regardless of settings resulting in false alerts from sunrise to sunset OR it detects only motion within five feet or less of the doorbell. Either way completely defeats the purpose of having purchased it to begin with. There is also the issue of the first few seconds of video being completely whited out, which half the time results in the videos being completely useless. Mind you the video starts recording with a delay as well. I should also mention that even with it being minimally functional, the battery life is nowhere near as long as advertised and it takes almost an entire day to fully charge it. Overall I would not recommend this device to anyone as it is nothing more than an overpriced doorbell that needs to be charged every two months. I am sure they could come out with a firmware update to address many of the issues, however, they instead came out with a new doorbell with these fixes and priced it at twice the cost. If I could have rated it with zero stars I would have because that is what the device deserves. AUGUST 2019 UPDATE - Never did get the device working as advertised and that's with buying every accessory under the sun! I initially contacted Ring support at least 15 times and they ran me in circles until I couldn't return it. The best I've gotten it to work is now, where it only detects motion within six feet and defeats the purpose of having it. I can't extend the range ANY because if I do I get nonstop motion alerts. Ring support said it's due to traffic 90+ feet away when it's only supposed to have a range of 30 feet. I recently got a new router and needed to take the doorbell down to hit the Setup button they stupidly place on the back. But the $0.99 screwdriver made for the device snapped off. Finally got them to send a replacement screwdriver, after trying to get me to buy a whole new doorbell, and I got the screwdriver today. First time I tried to unscrew a screw it twisted the screwdriver into a corkscrew and the tip broke off inside the screw. Ring support said I'll have to ""remove it with force"" but because it's no longer under warranty, they will give me a code to buy another useless doorbell at a discount to replace it. DO NOT BUY IT! If I could give it negative stars I would. It doesn't work as advertised, it's made with cheap materials and Ring customer support is one of the worst I've dealt with.",JUNK! Just an overpriced doorbell

If you're using it from battery power, prepare to have it randomly die and not warn you when it's near low power. Prepare for it to last much much much shorter than their stated battery life. I was lucky to get two weeks before it would die without warning. 2. The motion sensitivity is obtuse to configure and ultimately useless. When I needed it most, to record a package theft, it simply didn't record. I have a recording from before the theft and afterwards, but nothing showing the actual theft. 3. It only records for 30 seconds. If the thief loiters for 30 seconds, then approaches and steals, guess what, that won't be recorded. 4. There is no way to actually cancel a paid plan from the iOS app. You can signup for it there, but you need to login to their web app to cancel. It didn't even occur to me that they would have a web app, because the entire experience was through the iOS app. It took me a month to realize this, because they have no public documentation of how to cancel their plans.",A nightmare of a product.

Even hardwired into house performance under 40 degrees F is spotty if at all.  If you live in a cold climate avoid, product is utterly useless until Spring.  Ring needs to address the issue that the internal battery design even when on house charge is faulty in cold weather. Highly disappointed Update 11/28: was contacted by Ring support last week after they saw this negative review. I explained the issue I was having and that it continued to be an issue. It was suggested that I upgrade to the Pro model of the doorbell which doesn’t have an internal battery. I suggested an exchange as i wasnt about to spend another $200+ to replace a falsely advertised Doorbell 2 I had purchased to begin with.  I simply received another generic email from tech support asking how things were going, no response to my exchange idea.  If I could give Ring 0 stars I would for a falsely advertised(operating temperatures), worthless product. Update 1/07/18: Still not working...tech support continues to tell me to lower the motion sense which I have to almost 5ft. Still nothing works. Temperatures are below 20 degrees at this time, still within the working specs as Ring claims, but the unit doesn’t work.

The one plus is that it is very easy to install.  I had my old doorbell off and this one screwed in and running in about 15 minutes.  Everything started off great!  I was receiving a notification when someone was at my door and the doorbell would ring my mechanical chime when pushed.  Then reality set in..  After owning this product for 4 days (not exaggerating), the product seemed to go 180 degrees from where it started.  Now when someone comes to my door and pushes the doorbell, it doesn't ring!  YAY!! It's not like that's what this product is designed to do??  Not only does it not ring my home chime anymore, I don't receive notifications that the doorbell button was even pushed.  The only notifications I receive are when my neighbors drive down the street (not why I bought this product, although I know some people buy it for this).  I have done troubleshoot after troubleshoot and it simply doesn't work.  I was overcome with joy to put my boring old doorbell back on the wall and hear it work when the button is pushed.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Aug-18,Brad,"I have only had this for about a week, but it has been a terrible experience thus far. 1) The app cannot setup the doorbell on my Pixel XL running Android Pie. I can connect to it's ad hoc network all day long, but the app never successfully talks to the doorbell.  Looking through their support they had some possible settings that would cause this, but they were specific to Samsung phones and did not apply to mine. I have had no problem setting up many other devices that use the same system of creating an ad hoc network without issue. This is the only one which has not worked. 2) Even though my access point (Ubiquiti AC Pro) is less than 20 feet from the doorbell and only through one outside wall, it still has terrible reception. My old S4, which I had to use to setup it up because of point 1,  has better reception than it. Heck I still pull wifi on my phone at my road which is quite a far distance away compared to the doorbell, which if I am standing next to I can literally see the access point through the front door. 3) It takes FOREVER to connect to the live feed making it useless for actually viewing once motion is detected. 4) It has no ability to work locally you have to go through their cloud service even if you are on the same wifi network as the device. 5) I understand charging for a cloud service to record and I knew going in that was how these work, but it is pretty ridiculous to not have an option to store to an NVR or at least have some sort of output stream. Again, I knew this going in, but I did want to voice that makes the product not nearly as nice. I have $20 POE cameras that offer better features and frankly work a hell of a lot better even though they have a poorly translated buggy web app to manage them. If I hadn't dumbly recycled the packaging that came with it, I would 100% return this. Completely a waste of money thus far. Since I did recycle the packaging I am going to attempt to keep using it, but I can't see how it will improve.",Thus far super unimpressed
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Nov-17,FussyPister,"I ordered this during Black Friday week and got it at a discounted price.  I used it to replace a competitive video doorbell from a security company.  The biggest weakness of the security company doorbell was the lack of a Wi-Fi chime and the cost to upload video clips per month.  Therefore, I also picked up the Ring Chime to help provide some additional coverage space for the notification. The product was easy to unpack.  I like the fact that screws, a screw driver, and a USB cable were provided for recharging.  I do recommend a pair of wire-strippers for wired doorbells - the leads on my doorbell were very short and were not long enough to wrap around the screw posts.  If you are replacing a wired doorbell, the AC voltage provided by your doorbell transformer seems to ""trickle charge"" the built-in battery.  I couldn't find any specifications on how long the internal battery will last - which makes me wonder if a doorbell replacement will be necessary even with hardwired power at some point in the future. For those of you with wired doorbells, I do recommend initially charging the doorbell first to 100% before you install it. The trickle charge is just that - don’t expect the wired doorbell transformer to charge it to 100% for you. It might - it’ll just take a long time. Setup is incredibly simple and requires a smartphone.  It seriously took longer to wire and install than it did to program the doorbell module.  The built-in videos within the Ring app were easy to follow and did not require much prior research to get started. The Ring Chime was also incredibly simple to configure and get connected to the doorbell.  For those of you on the fence wondering if the chime is worth it - it absolutely is for larger homes. Our mechanical chime is not loud enough to hear throughout our home, and digital wired chimes cost more than Ring’s adapter.  There are a number of built-in chimes you can choose from.  I didn't see any method of adding your own, or Ring having the ability to download some from their website. The install was not a perfect experience on my part though, but was pretty darn close.  Here are the two things that I ran into that might help some of you. First, my mailbox was located near where the doorbell has been typically placed.  It was a Wi-Fi shield even though my router is a room away behind the door along the same outer wall.  While the Ring app stated that my Wi-Fi was ""OK"", it was choppy enough that I had issues connecting to the doorbell and getting good picture quality.  I moved my mailbox and the signal dramatically improved - video quality and connection are instantaneous now.  Don’t accept OK for your Wi-Fi connection.  It needs to be “Good” or better for a pleasant experience. Second, my FiOS router had the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi channel set to a static channel assignment.  Ring did not like this for some reason even though I have a solid, symmetrical 100Mb connection (up and down) and this was after the mailbox experience ;-).  I could not get notifications on my device or to the Ring Chime module.  I had to set the channel assignment to auto, and got everything working perfectly. All in all, it was well worth the money.  However, I ended up returning it.  In my housing plan, EVERYONE has a wireless router with 2.4ghz turned on. There was way too much congestion to have the Ring keep a good solid signal  Given no 5ghz WiFi is supported with this specific model, I returned it and exchanged it for a Ring Doorbell Pro model. For those of you not in crowded neighborhoods, this may work well for you. However, technophiles should go with the ‘Pro’ model.",Great for budget conscious and novice users | I returned mine and upgraded it.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Dec-16,dbareis,"Not reliable enough to call a security device, too many things require you to remove and re-add devices and if it can't send video fast enough them you can't even speak to the person at the doorbell or even get a picture, basically the software is garbage and don't fall back to lower quality video or even photos. More specific feedback I have provide to Ring: * There is no indication that a doorbell or device is alive (contactable) and no last seen date/time. It should be grey if offline. * It should tell me information about offline events (last network and power loss etc). * Too little detail in error messages and includes incorrect information (saying it cannot connect when it can but isn't happy with upload speed) * Too little diagnostic information, should me much more self checking and error handling, this can only help Ring's reputation and customer satisfaction and downtime. * No timestamp on recorded video, should be an option. * Current Firmware levels are secret / undocumented, as is any associated change history. Should be in health page as well as indication as to whether this is the current (at least generally available firmware, don't points for a button that allows me to request getting on a pilot release after checking what has been fixed). * It forces the video to landscape, it should be my option to rotate, either this or it would be better to have a force landscape option for when not viewing video. * I'd prefer an option to control how long the controls are visible on screen, its way to short now, but I'd rather they stayed up or down until I changed my mind and closed them. * I should be able to see all the statistical stuff (voltage, last seen etc).you capture in the app and online. * I should be linking users/zones in exactly the way I link chimes, I had to send 3 or 4 sets of invites. * The PRO needs a rechargeable battery to survive power outages.  This should be charged during the day to avoid causing hum in mechanical chimes at night after the infra red LEDs come on and to better handle different power supplies. * When I use ""Live View"" or the software wants to show me video: * * It frequently fails with the incorrect message ""cannot connect"", this takes ages. It was showing me garbage on the screen rather than diagnostic or progress information of some type * It sometimes eventually gets to showing me a black video but I have audio * None of the above is acceptable for a security product or doorbell for that matter: * * The video / audio view should immediately open so that under all circumstances (where a motion or doorbell alert occurred proving network exists) I can at least talk to whoever is there. * The doorbell could be doing its own speedtest and/or other determination to work out its current capabilities and: * * If it can't support 1080p then it should either reduce the framerate or fall back to 720p * If it can't support 720p then it should either reduce the framerate further or fall back below 720p * If video not possible it should be capturing and transmitting images at whatever framerate it can support. * It should be showing progress + diagnostic information while this is happening.  This diagnostic information needs to go into ""health"" page. * Alerts: * * Both motion and ring should have sleep period options so I can decide that at a certain time of night to ignore motion and/or ring, so I can sleep uninterrupted. * Motion alerts: * * Seem to be completely turned off/on by the setting in the Ring App, so turning it off on phone turns it off for the ring website and I assume for all other users, I should be turning them off for my phone only and they should go to website and any users that want it. * I should be able to set my own ringtone for motion with at LEAST the option of matching this to that chosen for Ring Chimes but preferably any Android notification tone (including ""silent""). * It would be nice to be able to pause alerts when you know there will be activity (for a period of configurable times, 10 minutes, 1 hour etc) * The physical Ring Chime: * * I should be able to set any ringtone that is available in whatever format that it supports * I should be able to match this with the application if I wish (that should probably be the default). * Renaming and re-adding Ring PRO chimes: * * Should never be required or requested * Sound not be required after power outage. Data should be restored from phone/cloud when device reconnects. * If required should not remove: * * Zone information * Alert Settings * User invites / shares * Anything really * Pressing the reset button on the PRO should not be requested (its hard to do) or if so it should be possible from the app and in any case in most cases is only used due to insufficient diagnostic information being captured and displayed. * Motion & Ring History * * Some history on the web site should be available for free (for example a week or 2 days, whatever). * I should be able to add notes to history activities * If video wasn't captured or other issues detected, it should say this and not require me to go into each in turn only to find it it was a failure. * I should be able to choose from a calendar, can't even imagine scrolling through 6 months of data.... * Ring Web Site / FAQ * * Any page discussing the standard or PRO (or in future other) doorbells should clear show which products the page applies (and doesn't apply). * I got a lot of good information from support staff (like the ""softer reset option""), while its great they can provide it to me that information should be in the FAQ * * Physical installation. * * Most decent devices have have slots and not holes where you'd be able to rotate and level the device even with drill holes misaligned, the PRO doesn't do this (it has small holes) * The drill bit that came in the box was dead in 10 seconds (a couple of mils deep) I used my own bit after that but the bit moves when drilling (I think my bricks are harder than most)",Could have been Good

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Feb-20,Gqsmooth1981,"I really don’t know what to say! I’ve tried two of these things and none of them work 100% of the times. Sometimes, motion gets triggered and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s as if the Ring DB has its own mind and days when it’s great and days when it’s having PMS. The included photo is a screenshot that I took from a live view. It’s relatively clear but it’s not consistent. Keep in mind I also have the Ring Chime Pro(w/wifi extension) and it still doesn’t want to work 95% of the times. Everything is really delayed and it’s better than having no video doorbell but for the price you’re paying it should be giving you decent video quality. Mind you, I have an Orbi mesh router that gives me about 100mbps up and down speeds so I didn’t really need the Chime Pro but I got it anyways to see if there’s a difference. I do experience a little faster upload times when I try and access the Ring in “Live View.” When I was solely relying on the Orbi router it would take about 10-20 seconds before a connection is established. With the Chime Pro, that connection time is about 5-10 seconds, which isn’t a major difference but it is noticeable. Could I live without it? Probably, but I rather not because when I am home I don’t want to carry my iPhone with me all the time and without the Chime Pro I can’t hear someone ringing the doorbell unless I’m standing by my phone, computer, or door. My main Orbi mesh router is place in the basement and my satellite is in the master bedroom so it is covering the whole townhouse. My connection is strong but the delay is annoying and the Chime Pro got rid of that to an extent. The motion detection really is inconsistent and when it was setup right out of the box it would pick up on tree branches being blown by the wind. That’s some craziness but it was relatively annoying after it notifies you 2-3 times a day and being “false alarms.” I had the original Chime and the delay between the Ring and the Chime unit was horrible. I can’t figure it out because with the Orbi Mesh router it says I’m getting 100/100+ even when outside. I like the concept of having a ring video doorbell but they really need to work on the quirks and delays as I don’t think Nest has this problem. I have a Nest smart learning thermostat and it works 100% and I am very happy with it. I wished I could say the same about the Ring video doorbell. Again, it’s better than not having anything but it’s on the borderline of keeping or returning. Good thing that I didn’t screw the Ring to my wooden door frame because if I were to the point that I’m giving up there will be 4 holes and nothing to cover it up. I used Gorilla tape, two sided, and it holds up to 30lbs and it’s been stuck to the doorframe since I got it initially. I’m just afraid that if I return the Ring doorbell I’m going to have an extremely hard time taking it off without taking some paint off. That’s also one of the main reasons I have kept the Ring Video doorbell because I don’t want to have to look at paint that came off because I essentially super glued the Ring to my doorframe rather than drilling holes in it. I don’t think it was wise to do either and I wished I went with the Ring Video doorbell for the peephole but my wife didn’t like the idea. It’s really a novelty item and that’s about it because no one really like these doorbells and none of them have been perfect. I wished that Ring would get their act together and make a doorbell that just worked. I think I’m going to return this doorbell because frankly, it sucks! I even bought the Chime Pro thinking maybe it would improve my connection speeds but it doesn’t. It might be because I have a lot of devices connected to my Orbi Router but again I get 100/100+ speeds and that’s more than you should need. I have a lot of devices connected to my Orbi but I’ve never had a problem. I have the RBK 50 and I’m only paying Verizon for 30/30 but because of my Orbi router I constantly get 100/100+/- mbps and that’s more than what you need to operate this thing yet the delay is horrible and it doesn’t pick up on motion well enough. By the time the app notifies me there’s motion detected outside of the house the person is already leaving. It doesn’t pick up motion even when I set the motion zones to pick up motion to my front sidewalk. I have tried everything short of throwing it in the garbage. I think I’ll be returning it and trying the Nest Hello. The only reason I haven’t done so yet is because I used 2 sided outside gorilla tape and mounted it on my door frame and I’m afraid that when I try and take it off it’s going to peel off the paint and cause it to look extremely bad. I may try getting a wedge for this doorbell and “maybe” it’ll make a difference.",Novelty Item!

At first, the Ring was pretty cool. Easy set up. Much wider field of view. Easy connection to the Echo Show.  HD video is better quality than my old Zmodo... or should I say could be better but for the giant white-out of anything past the porch roofline during the day. It's like a no white balance video camera from 1996. What a disappointment, especially since my Zmodo could see clearly across the street, day or night. This Ring can't see past the porch. Also, my Zmodo would record motion and doorbell call videos to my phone and that didn't cost anything. I got every video and could keep them as long as I wanted or they would delete themselves automatically after a month. Ring only records to their own servers and when that ""trial"" period ends, you better plan on paying a subscription for the rest of your life. With the Zmodo, I got every visit to my front door even a few seconds before they even drove up. With the Ring, you get the notice but by the time the app gets around to ""activating device"" and displaying,  the visitor has already moved on. At half the price, my Zmodo never took as long to connect to see who was at the front door. So, basically,  unless you're house is constructed so it has no shade to the street or all shade to the street, plan on being disappointed with the Ring video quality. Also, know that the Ring is a subscription fee forever device. You can answer the doorbell by video or just look outside without a subscription but it's basically just a live-video-monitor situation. Once you hang up, none of that video is saved without a subscription. I'm not endorsing the Zmodo either. That thing never rang the door chime in the house and just made it have an anoying constant low hum. So, at least the Ring works the chime right I'm batting a thousand on disappoint with video doorbells. Will just have to suck it up for a year or so and just hope someday to get one that's easy to set up with a decent white-balanced video that records for free and rings the old door chime in the house and works with the Echo Show... for under $100...

Lo cierto es que soporte técnico no me da soluciones y el timbre no funciona como debería. Estoy muy decepcionado del producto ya que no funciona como se indica en las especificaciones y ring pareciera hacerse la vista gorda en brindarme una solución.,el producto no se carga con la corriente electrica
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Apr-20,Mudslide Slim,"The unit arrived nicely packaged with most everything needed for installation. I would advise any buyer to let the unit fully charge (5+ hours) before doing anything. I did not and ran into connectivity problems. The instructions really don’t make that clear. In fact, the instructions and explanations on the various features and settings are a weak point. Seems like you have to jump around a lot to find what you need and then go hands-on to understand it all. The upside is that after set-up, it is simple to use. Use the charging time to read up on it. Once charged, it took about ½ an hour to do everything, including installation.  I hard-wired the RIng to the old doorbell wiring so we not only retained the analog doorbell, but the power charges the Ring internal battery. It worked flawlessly from the get-go and was easily added to my iPhone, MacBook and my wife’s iPhone. Our existing security camera system provides better imaging, but the Ring’s instant alert and intercom system make for a perfect add-on. The night vision was surprisingly good and the wide-angle lens lets you completely see who is standing at your door. The intercom sound is just okay and you may have to ask your “visitor” to speak closer to the ring doorbell. The neighborhood incident alerts are a great feature and recorded events are easy to review. After spending a day or two playing with it, you will have a good comfort level with how it works and appreciate the value it provides. I could easily see where some folks may have issues due to wi-fi connectivity, ambient lighting, excess outside motion, power, etc. In fairness to Ring, these factors can affect similar products. They do offer from some suggested work-arounds. I rarely say this, but so far this product has actually exceeded my expectations.",Quality product

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Jan-16,KC,"Finally ordered and installed the Ring Doorbell.  Installed it as a hard wire over our existing doorbell hard wired placement.  Very easy to install although had some slight adjustments to make on the back plating to ensure that it was ""straight"" to snap in the cover.  After I was able to adjust everything, locking the cover in place with the screws was easy.  Suggest installing the app before physically installing the unit as there are a couple of videos on the app that will give you some guidance on how to do the physical installation.  I assigned the app to provide notifications to multiple people in the house and everything works great.  Motion detection was a little tricky as I needed to adjust for detection distance.  Only small issues we've had were some slight delays in notifications when ringing the doorbell on occasion which was probably due to internet or server congestion.  The infrared detection is very reliable as we also have a security camera on the Ring Doorbell also and I feel that the motion detection is a little better on Ring than my camera!  After about 2 weeks, we are very pleased about the Ring Doorbell performance.  Highly recommend as an addition to your ""smart home"".",Very Nice Add to your Smart Home
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Sep-18,Peter,"Update 2: My Ring has continued to work great. Ring support was awesome. 100% recommended now. (And FWIW, I think just the full hard reset process made the biggest difference. Hold orange button 20 sec and then set up again. Minor hassle to have it fully functional.) Update: Ring has been working to get this worked out for me. Updated performance is TBD, but I raised my rating for now mainly based on their support. They've really been outstanding. So far, after a hard reset, it already appears better. They are also sending me a signal booster. Will report back with another update. Original: We've had this for about a year now and have mixed feelings about it. Bottom line up front is that about 80% of the time, it won't connect to see motion live and 95% of the time it won't connect to answer the doorbell. The good news is you do get video of the events, so you can at least see who you missed, but that's not really the point of the Ring doorbell, is it? My wife's phone has an even worse track record than mine. So it is a terrible video doorbell, but decent security video cam. Good: * Installation was a breeze * Integration with Smartthings and Alexa was simple * Daytime recordings are decent, although night video is not very clear. * Motion sensing is good Bad: * Not really usable for answering the doorbell remotely. You get notified, but the vast majority of the time it comes back with ""having trouble connecting at this time"". You can only see after the video has uploaded. * Can't see video due to motion events either. Only after it has finished uploading it. * Has a known bug where it constantly tries to connect and disconnect from bluetooth, e.g. in car, when trying to view  video. Update: Still horrible. Considering just ditching it and getting nest hello.",Ring support made me a happy customer. Can fully recommend now.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Dec-18,Ama Fan,"OK.  I was already having LOTS of false alarms with the Ring Doorbell.  I live in an urban area fairly close to a street and have been getting motion alarms every time a school bus or a larger truck drives by my home.  This was happening no matter how I adjusted the motion sensitivity.  This results in boy calling wolf situation - I ignored the alarms for the most part because the vast majority were false. Conversely, the doorbell does not work well when there actually is a visitor at my home.  Generally visitors aren't picked up until they are walking away from my porch - not much help when you are trying to identify a visitor or a thief. You can see from the pics that my walk up to the house is not directly in front of the door, but the gate and walk are easily visible.  Sometime visitors aren't captured at all.  The ring doorbell captured the meter reader coming into my yard because my brother was on the front porch at the time, however it did record him leaving the yard at all. I was still willing to work with the Ring and was just about to install a wedge to adjust the angle of the device in an effort to decrease the number of false alarms when my 30 day trial of the subscription ended.  I have now found out that I can't view my videos AT ALL except right when the motion is happening.  This morning I got a motion alert - I opened the Ring app to see someone's back walking away from my home.  I thought I knew who it was so I closed the video.  2 seconds later I tried to re-open it to double check and guess what?  I can't do that unless I want to pay a minimum of $30 annually for a subscription.  2 seconds later.  I can understand paying for a subscription to save videos over a period of time - like maybe more than a week or a month.  But 2 seconds later?  That's unreasonable.  Granted $30 annually is not a lot to pay but I'm not going to give them another cent of my money.  The doorbell was barely acceptable at $99 with the free subscription and it certainly is not worth any more than that.","If you're not willing to pay for the subscription, Don't bother."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Feb-20,TruthBTold,"I purchased the Ring doorbell in 2018 and then the camera for my back garage shortly after that.  What a piece of crap.  The Ring might catch someone walking away from my door, but didn't catch them approaching my door.  The same for the garage cam.  It will catch the tail end of a vehicle pulling away but didn't catch it approaching and pulling into my drive.  I emailed and said I'd like to speak with the owner/creator of the product after customer service failed miserably at helping even after I'd called 12 times.  Someone (supposedly the owner) sends me an email, saying that they are on a plane and unable to communicate via phone.  I said ""Well, I'll await hearing from you once you're all settled in your destination."" He came back with some bogus response about how he'd be too busy to call because he had meetings galore.  #A PHONY! #A BIGGER PHONY! #THEWORLDSWORSTPHONY.  I am now in the process of seeking a good system as this one is awful.  For anyone thinking about getting a Ring product, I'd strongly advise against it.  It's crap and the customer service is even worst.  If you think that this product will protect you and your home, think again.  Head to BestBuy.com and search their inventory of security devices.  I will be spreading the word to EVERYONE so that they won't waste their time and money on this crappy device.  The owner/creators don't value what you have to say - well, actually they're too ""big"" in their heads to even return your call to hear what you have to say.

I had mixed emotions when I ordered due to the polarizing reviews, but (so far) I haven't experienced any of the issues posted by the negative reviews. I have the lowest internet speed available, and my images are very clear and have only been delayed once. I also bought the chime, and you can set it to any volume as well as going off only for rings or motion. I did keep the default settings to 5' rather than extending the zone. If you increase the zone, it will pick up traffic driving by. Overall, I'm very pleased and think it's worth the money.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Jun-18,OP,"1. The images and videos from the camera pointing outside are pix-elated. Camera was replaced one, then customer support assisted in the problem with the next camera, initially blaming the internet connection, but that was not the reason when I moved the router next to the camera inches away. The conclusion was pretty much the camera outside by the front door on a covered porch CAN NOT produce a decent quality image of the person ringing the bell because of the ambient light. - So, if the ambient light is a problem with the video quality, then what? Use the camera inside? It does not make sense. - 2.  The fact you have to pay a monthly subscription to have access to the videos, it is outrageous. Why the camera does not have an internal SD card where the owner can check ""offline"" the videos? How much can this add to the price of the camera? The vendor try to drag you on a monthly subscription service to check YOUR videos?  Does not make sense either. ----- UPDATE: I wish the rate will have a negative amount of stars. I will give it a minus two (2). After a while I noticed the time between somebody ring the bell and get the notification on the phone LOCALLY is noticeable long. Very. Again, last technology updated router: checked. 3 feet away from the router: check.  65Mbps ISP: checked. And to make it worse I am on the phone waiting for someone to give some information about how to proceed because now my door bell ring does not even ring. So I have to put the old analog switch again. ----- UPDATE again, my sons bike was stolen in front of the camera and nothing happened. I just filed a police report regarding my son stolen bike from the porch in front of this $%#$% camera.  Since now the ring camera  is keeping disconnecting from my Wi-Fi all the time, pretty much no notifications are being made over the phone. This is just an expensive bell switch. The only reason I have not remove this and gently fixed with a hammer is because now I need to pay someone to put the original bell switch the way it was. - I truly regret the day I had bough this. Big, BIG waste of time and money now. My honest advice? Get some type of camera that actually works, high resolution, local storage so your videos in your loafers wont hit the internet when another hacking event happen for having your private information in the cloud. - (minus) Five stars now. DO not waste your time and money on this brand.","PIxelated videos bcs ambient light,no  local storage to view videos offline, SLOOOW.  Keep disconnecting frm WiFi,Not worth it."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Jul-19,Fred Y,"Ok I installed my Ring Doorbell 5 days ago. I am not completely satisfied with it so far. I am having intermittent problems with the Motion Sensor. Sometimes it picks out a person delivering a package and sometimes it doesn't. Yesterday we had UPS,Amazon Delivery and the Postman. My Ring Doorbell only picked up the Postman making a delivery. None of the delivery people rung the doorbell so the motion Sensor so far is not dependable. I called Ring Customer Service today and was on the phone with them for quite awhile. She said my Wifi is reading a -69 on my Ring Doorbell and it has been as high as -75. She said a good reading would be -50. I told her that we are not having any problems with any of our other devices including streaming on our Firestick. I don't question our Cisco WIfi. Furthermore the Wifi is no more then 25 ft away from the Ring Doorbell. She wanted me to call my Internet Service Provider to ask them if they can set up 4 ports to match my Ring Doorbell. I told her that I own my own Motorola Modem and Cisco Wifi Router. Infinity (Comcast) says they can't go into my Router being I own my own equipment. Right now I am waiting on Ring Customer Service to get back to me.  We have a friend who lives in another state who is having the same problem where their Ring Doorbell is not showing on video all deliveries to her home. I am guessing I am not the only one with this problem. Hopefully Ring can get this problem straightened out. What good is having this Ring Doorbell if you can't depend on it to work every time I have to ask? ADD ON: Its been about a month now and I have had nothing but problems with this unit. I even purchased a more expensive top of the line Wi-Fi Router from Amazon to replace the one I had. It brought the RSSI reading down to -54 from what I had previously. Didn't really make much of a difference at all. 90% or more of video's that are recording are of Cars and Trucks setting this Ring Doorbell off  and I have tweaked the sensors down to their lowest setting. Makes no difference better then 30' away it still sets off this Ring door bell. My wife or daughter leave in the morning. Sometimes the delay is so great I barely see them walking out the door. Now the sound is even sounding choppy. I don't know what more to do. Customer service has been back and forth by email. Seems like the person emailing me works during the middle of the night possibly. The last 2 messages I sent in the last week have not been answered now today I see I am now 2 days past the deadline to send this item back to Amazon if I cared to. Bad enough I had to open the area up where our original hard wired door bell was mounted and use a Oscillating Multi-Tool with cutting blade to cut a molding around our door assembly that contains the center door with 2 sidelights in order to fit the Ring Door bell. It is going to look terrible if I was to go back to a standard doorbell again. Not a happy camper at all. I should of did more research on this item. What they show in the advertisements on TV doesn't come close to how this unit really operates. I wouldn't recommend this Ring Doorbell to anyone.",Ring Video Doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Jul-19,J. Gale,"First, installation was a breeze, so I had high hopes.  However, it did two things wrong which were fatal flaws:  (1) It constantly alerted me to motion when no one was there, and (2) it DIDN'T tell me when someone was there, even if they rang the doorbell, which did sound in the house. First:  The motion sensor would constantly go off whenever a car drove down the street, in spite of many times adjusting the settings in the app.  I tried calling the customer service people, and while nice, couldn't get it perfect.  They recommend I purchase, for $20 a tilting device that would angle it down to avoid the false positives.  OK, I bit.  However I would get packages delivered to my door, and not only would I not get motion  notices, If I checked the log of recorded events it would not show the delivery.  The last straw was when the UPS delivered the Tilting mechanism to help this problem, (which I bought from another retailer) and rang my doorbell.  The doorbell never recorded the delivery!  I should have read the APP reviews before I bought the unit.  The app reviews are much lower than the product reviews, and since you view the info from you app, that is critical.  At least Amazon returns are easy.",Didn't do what it needed to do.  Did what I didn't want it to do.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Jun-19,J Tyler,"The Ring doorbell I purchased was easy to install and get working. The app interface is not very intuitive and can be a little confusing to navigate even for the tech-savvy.  However, my disappointment is in the performance of the device. It is slow to detect motion and is inconsistent in what it detects and alerts. From what I have read, the former could be caused by a weak WiFi signal. Based on the fact that my WiFi router is less than 30 feet away, the doorbell itself has poor reception capabilities and that is why Ring sells signal boosters. I have a 1500 square foot home and the signal from my WiFi can be picked up by my cell phone on the street in front of my home, a good 60 feet away from the doorbell which sits between the router and the street where I can pick up the signal. Night vision capability is nonexistent. All I can see is a light spot on the wall next to the doorbell. My assessment is the doorbell itself has a built-in weakness with WiFi reception to force owners to purchase signal boosters. I don't have any experience, anecdotal or actual with other competitive devices, but so far I am not impressed with the performance. I am impressed with some of the features, particularly integration with Alexa. I can simply say Alexa, show me the front door and it appears on my TV set. I am fortunate to have a TV set that will automatically switch HDMI input when the activity is detected on the Alexa-enabled Fire TV device. Bottom line is that it is better than nothing.",A little disappointed
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Apr-20,Amanda M,"I was able to install the ring device at my front door without any help from my husband.  I downloaded the app on my phone and it notifies me if anyone or anything comes near the door.  The outdoor cat has realized he can trigger it if he gets on the handrail of the porch so I can let him in.  It's kinda funny.  We live in a very rural neighborhood and unfortunately we've been robbed of many things.  Gas was stolen from my husband's truck.  Someone stole our Christmas laser light show.  We knew who it was but had no proof.  Now, we can have the proof if anything else goes missing.  I get an email that lets me know when it's time to recharge the device and it's so simple to do.  If you recharge with a plug in cord it's less than 4 hours to recharge to a full 100%.  I usually have to recharge it every 3 weeks or so and that's good because we have quite a bit of traffic in & out of the house.  We like it that way though.  My husband is working 12 hour shifts now and he doesn't have to worry about me while he's gone.  I fell one time outside and he couldn't contact me for half a day.  This way he sees me when I go out and when I return.  It gives us both peace of mind that when we're gone from home we can see if anyone comes to our home and if need be, we can even talk to them through the ring device while gone.  We opted for the $30.00 per year back up and it saves videos for 90 days and we also have the option of downloading videos if we choose.  My husband told me this week that he wants another device to set up in front of his shop due to some small recent thefts.  You may not like the ring device but it works for us and we're an older couple so for our own personal safety, theft or accidents it's a big relief to have it working.",Works great for me.

This is a very cool product. We have 0 delay when the button is pushed on the Ring doorbell like some people are saying.

We are old and slow so my wife had to call Customer Support four times on the day I installed it. All four times they answered their phone by the 5th ring. Very friendly and helpful people which is rare now days. Both of our cell phones get 'rung' when the doorbell is pushed. Even while the wife was at work the motion sensor notified someone was at the door, it was me.

On its best day I could go to the door and deal with a visitor before the Ring video would even show up.  Device will not work with a computer only with iphone and app from app store.  A 30 day service to store videos was included with the device.  Ring would constantly push ads to get Ring Pro for another $100 further slowing down the performance.  Then the 30 day limit was approaching and Ring started pushing ads to start paying them a monthly fee before my trial expired, then it expired and so did the device.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Apr-16,Julie,"BEST PRODUCT EVERY INVENTED!  This is a VIDEO doorbell that set off by MOTION  and people RINGING your doorbell with intergraded cameras and 2 way audio that is sent immediately to your smartphone (Android or Apple).  So even if you are shopping or at work you can talk to the people over your smart phone and they have no idea if you are in the house or away! I have to tell you about this product because it has been a tremendous help in identifying the person who has been steeling our packages, and has been a blessing for proof that our UPS guy has left my stolen packages on the front patio of our condo, so he doesn't get blammed. Since I order everything possible from Amazon Smiles, I get packages every day. I was searching for a doorbell that would ring on all 3 floors of my condo through wifi when I found this product!  I have Nest Drop Cams in my house to watch my dogs and record if anyone breaks in, hurts my animals or steels anything.  The RING DOORBELL is my #1 defense against people wandering onto my patio and taking my plants and packages, and doing any harm if they were to break in.  Thanks to the RING DOORBELL, I have been able to show the police the videos, and catch the people who are the perpetrators! This is how simple it works... I do not have a wired doorbell, (which you can wire it to), or you can use the battery that comes with it.  I have my RING set to MOTION as well as when someone rings the bell.  I had to drill into concrete for the base.  It was easy because RING gives you the correct size drill bit, along with everything needed for installation.  All you need is a drill.  It literally took me all of 15 minutes to instal the amazing gadget!  The best part is that anyone that would want to steel it, they really have no choice to be caught on video, and it does have a special screw that you would need to remove it from the base.  I do believe that RING offers you a free replacement if it is stolen! I easily set the RING doorbell to notify my husband and I when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell.  There are no problems with adding more than one user in case one of us is busy.  (You can also add-on other cameras around your house.) We get a distinct chime ring on our iPhones instantly and tap the RING App and we can see and have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door!  Sometimes I answer the door from my third floor office, without having to run down to the front door.  With packages that need signatures, this is a huge help since the US postal service never gives me enough time to get down stairs to sign for packages; they are always in a hurry and leave before I can get to the door! It is amazing when someone is on your property, wait until you get their face on camera, and then say, ""Can I help you?""  We have had people taping flyers on our door, solicitors, and as soon as I say, Can I help you they either try to sell something and I can say, ""No thank you"", or they RUN!  if you pay the $30/ year, which is a lot less than the Drop Cams $9/month, you can go back and review all the videos.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jun-18,AnnLD,"I’ve been wanting a video doorbell for the longest time, primarily for the ability to interact with the person at the door when I’m not at home. I don’t have hard wiring for a doorbell, so when I saw that you can buy a Ring chime that serves as the actual bell (separately from your phone), I decided it was time to take the plunge. I actually didn’t know the gadget also works as a motion sensor. That *should* come in handy - I can see who’s about to ring my doorbell and decide if I want to answer before the bell even rings. It doesn't work that well, though (details below). Setup was super easy. Charge the bell, pair it with the Wi-Fi, put a few screws in the bracket, slip the bell housing into place on the bracket, and done. (Setup for the Ring chime was also very simple, and they paired very easily.) The doorbell function works well. You have a choice of chime noises and other settings. This app doesn't work well on my office Wi-Fi, but that's an issue with the VPN and not Ring. I do get a notification that the doorbell is ringing, but I can't quickly load the video feed to see who's there and respond. In all other settings, this works fine. I had to play with the motion field settings so I don’t get notified every time a car drives by. I still get a couple of notifications that don’t seem to be caused by anything in particular - and sometimes when a car drives by. I also notice that the video function doesn’t seem always kick in immediately, so a quick delivery, for example, may not be recorded until the person is walking *away* from my door. Sometimes, deliveries aren't detected at all. I do see cars when they pull up in my driveway, which is good. I recently was out of town for a few days, and the Ring didn't detect my petsitter's comings and goings at all. Still, the best feature as far as I’m concerned is that I don’t have to be in my house to respond to the person ringing the doorbell. I can be in my back yard (where I wouldn’t normally hear the bell), I can be walking my dog a few blocks away, I can be a thousand miles away, and I can still answer my doorbell and tell the person I can’t come to the door right now (or maybe “be right there…” or “I’m not joining your church!”). The video function definitely works best if you’re on a Wi-Fi network, but I do immediately get the notification that someone is at the door, even if I can’t tune the video in quickly.","Easy setup, doorbell feature works well, motion detector not so much"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-May-19,DubbleOrNuthin,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This was one of the most disappointing ring products ever purchased. No it's not the wifi signal that customer service tries to tell you being the problem cause it ring doorbell is literally in a room next to the doorbell with Xfinity's gigabit service and yet unbelievably all ring products don't even support 5 ghz signal they can only accept 2.4 ghz (which can mean a slower streaming experience) however processing power must be taken into account. I have all 3 Ring products, the Ring Floodlight, the Ring stick up cam (solar power) and of course the disappointing Ring Doorbell. Of all three, the Floodlight is the best, it captures motion with almost no delay and excellent night vision and sound. The Ring stick up cam comes in second with less options for motion zone controls and some delay in motion detection of about 5-10 seconds which still is hardly acceptable but tolerable. Last the Doorbell, the bottleneck. There is so much delay that items can be stolen easily within seconds. At times I could walk up to the door and it doesn't notify me until 15 seconds later and this is on a super high speed network with 50 mbps download and 40 mbps upload and it could be faster if it were capable of being compatible with 5ghz at 500 mbps to 1ghz download BUT then I guess they should have thought about that limit and stress a micro processor instead. I'm just down cause I like the chime and the inconspicuous look that anyone would be better off buying simply only the floodlights in front instead of this doorbell. I should have just done that. ***update*** Ring tech support reached out right away and provided an ear full of my experience then provided a Chime Pro just to see if it improved. I received the Ring Chime Pro in a few days and the results were that it's NOT the weak internet signal but that is was a weak RSSI signal. Due to the product's inability to transmit a strong static signal through a wall/walls it results in a ""weak signal"" however even though the Ring Doorbell still lacks that part, the improved RSSI from 70 down to 60 makes a good difference by not losing signal. I feel as though many of the products still need to be refined in hardware, firmware, and software, it still gives me peace of mind knowing what's happening outside my door so thank you tech support for your persistence in effort to accommodate.",Doorbell rant

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Nov-18,kidd3791,Absolutely the complete opposite of what I wanted and expected. Motion detection is annoying. A lot of false alarms even after adjusting the area to just the stoop. I get alerts that I can’t view which is the whole purpose of the product. I can only view after it has been uploaded and saved. I get a blurry screen with a blue circle. If you look at attached pics I tested the WiFi connection outside next to the doorbell. I get over 80 mbps down and 10 up. Is that not good enough? The mounting/security screws are a joke for a device $100+. Plastic backing plate with small j hooks. You can easily rip this off if you are over 7 yrs old. I expected a better mount to secure an expensive piece of hardware. Video quality is poor unless the person is sitting still.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Dec-19,Robert J. Kierski,"Right after buying this, I posted a review that was very negative.  My first impressions of the product were rather bad.  But I have since learned a bit about the Ring Doorbell, how to configure the device and the app, and my opinion has changed significantly. I am disappointed that I had figure out all of these issues on my own.  The documentation on Ring.com was out dated and not helpful. I first installed the ""Ring Always Home"" app on my phone.  I later found there is ""Rapid Ring"" and ""Neighbors"".  I find the ""Rapid Ring"" app more useful if i just want to check out the live feed, or answer the doorbell.  The ""Ring Always Home"" app is still useful for seeing the motion event timeline or changing the motion detection settings. Pros: The doorbell came quickly (thanks to amazon prime), it was easy to install, and easy to setup. Cons: The night vision is easily defeated by a street light, house light, or yard light that is in the field of view.  If you have a strong light source in the field of view, the doorbell camera thinks there is enough light to not use the night vision. The viewing angle is way to wide and the image quality is very poor.  Unless a person puts their face right up to the camera, it's hard to recognize them, even if you know them. It wasn't easy to figure out how to turn off the constant motion notifications on my  phone while still allowing the motion events to be recorded. Previous Comment:  I don't know how I discovered this, certainly not from any of the documentation or instructions from RING, but I was able to turn off Motion Notifications in the APP Notifications Android settings.  On Android, I went to ""Settings"" (the little gear icon in the pull down menu), ""Notifications"",  I selected ""See all"" which revealed ""Ring"".  I selected the ""Ring"" app.  That brought up a window with ""Show notifications"", ""App icon badges"" and ""Motion Notification"".  I then turned off ""Motion Notification"".  With that setting off, I no longer get beeps, but I'm still able to see Motion Events in the camera timeline window. UPDATE (12-11-2019):  I discovered a major design flaw in the Ring Doorbell.  I'm pretty sure it applies to the Doorbell 2 as well.  The camera is off and the unit is essentially blind until the motion sensor detects motion.  The doorbell camera runs on the battery even when it's hardwired.  In order to conserve battery power/life, the camera is off until the motion sensor determines there is something interesting to see.  It takes about 2 seconds for the camera to turn on and adjust gain, white balance, etc.  As a result, you may miss the action in a motion event.  Many other devices are constantly on and buffering data.  With those devices, it's possible to capture the few seconds before and after the motion event.  Because the Ring Doorbell camera is off, you can only capture video after the motion event. Did you see where I said that the camera only draws power from the battery?  The Ring troubleshooting page talks about the fact that the battery should allow for 1000 activations.  That is under ideal conditions.  If the temperature is too warm or too cold, the battery will last significantly less -- only about 40% (or 400 activations).  In extreme cold or hot weather (above 80F, or below 0F) the battery efficiency is even worse, may not even work, and can be permanently damaged if you try to use it. Why should you care about the battery?  Without the battery, you just have a doorbell -- no camera.  If you mistakenly allow the battery to completely drain, you may have to go through the setup again.  Even with a high speed charger, it takes about 4 hours to charge the battery.  With a low speed charger, it could take up to 10 hours.  During that time, you should post a sign saying ""Please come back later"".  While you're charging the battery, the doorbell has to be removed from the mounting plate and connected to a micro-USB cable... So, it doesn't even function as a doorbell. UPDATE (12-12-2019):  I read some of the Ring Community pages related to the battery and battery life.  One of the pages claimed that your house doorbell AC transformer is trickle charging the battery.  So, it would seem that if you want to use the Ring Doorbell without having to remove it and connect it to a USB charger, you can mess with the sensitivity settings so that the camera isn't activated as much.  It would also seem that you may be able to recharge the Ring Doorbell without removing it (recharging it in-place), simply by putting the motion detection to sleep.  I don't know how efficient the AC Transformer recharging is, or if it's faster than a USB charger.  But if you don't have physical access (you're away from home) to your Ring Doorbell, it would seem to be a reasonable solution. Speaking of messing with settings to conserve battery life... I found a setting that seems to be on by default where the Ring Doorbell wakes up (activates) periodically without motion events just to show you what's going on in front of the camera.  So that boring time lapse video you see between motion events counts against your camera activation count. UPDATE (12-22-2019):  I spoke with a couple of people about my experience with the Ring doorbell and having to connect it to a USB cable to charge it.  They suggested that my doorbell transformer may not be the recommended voltage or amperage.  I checked.  Sure enough, my doorbell transformer is 16V and 10VA.  Ring recommends 24V and 30VA.  I purchased a 24V, 40VA transformer from Amazon and installed it.  I now hear a buz in the audio.  I will have to see if the battery starts to charge. UPDATE (12-28-2019):  Within a day of replacing the doorbell transformer, I could see that the Ring Doorbell was in-fact charging.  On 12-22, the battery was at 58%.  Today, the battery is at 98%.  I've increased the motion sensitivity and increased the notification frequency... both to max.  As the result, I'm seeing many more motion events, but the battery is staying charged.  I've updated my rating to 4 stars.  I feel that there should have been something more obvious telling me that I needed to upgrade my doorbell transformer.  With the upgraded transformer, I hear a buz in the audio.  That maybe noise on the power line, but I would have expected the Ring to filter that out.  Also, there is a big delay between a button press and when Alexa, or my phone notifies me that the button was pressed.",READ THE END of this review.  It will help!!!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-May-19,Punxphil,"For six months, doorbell worked perfectly then started acting up.  At first, it wouldn't take a charge via hardwired set up and then lost connection altogether despite repeated charging via USB charger.  I contacted Ring for warranty support and was forced into a never-ending, troubleshooting do loop.  It got really tedious when Ring asked me to wire it one way and then reconnect with the wires reversed.  On top of that, they wanted me to document my troubleshoot escapades with pictures.  As an Amazon company, I thought Ring was reputable, but I quickly learned it's not the case.  I then began to read the reviews (I know...I should have done this first), and found others had similar problems and stories.  I'm hugely disappointed with Ring, but this storm cloud does have a silver lining:  This is my first Ring purchase.  Therefore, I'm minimally invested in the Ring ecosystem.  I was looking to buy other security/smart home products and now know that I need to look elsewhere.  Bottom line:  Don't hit the buy now button! Update:  15 Jun 19 After posting this review on Amazon, I was contacted by Danielle, a Ring Neighborhood Advocate.  She contacted me via e-mail and requested an opportunity to speak by phone.  I agreed and found her extremely nice and truly interested in solving my problem.  I explained the situation, and Danielle was very quick to offer several solutions.  In the end, she really turned things around.  In terms of the doorbell itself, I'm on the fence; however, I really appreciate Danielle and how she saved the day.  For that reason, I'm upgrading my rating from 1-Star to 4-Stars.",Neighborhood Advocate Saves the Day

Ring's advice: shove something behind the top so it tilts down. Thanks... Often times, when somebody is actually at the house, I can't even open the app to speak to them or see who it is. This is pure garbage... Waste of money. I'll probably just deactivate notifications and just use it as a fancy looking doorbell. Best $200 I ever spent...",This is pure garbage..
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Dec-18,KMS,"I research EVERYTHING before buying, but apparently I didn't research this enough. Most of the time when I try to connect to either answer a ring or just to view, it doesn't connect. ""Activating"" ""Connecting"" ""Trying to Connect"" ""Unable to connect"" So what else is new? Here are the three scenarios I have experienced: 1) Sometimes it actually does connect very quickly, by accident I presume. 2) Other times it takes 30-60 seconds, or longer, to connect. Anyone who has pushed the button has left by then. 3) The other times it never connects and I either just have to try again (and again) or force-stop the app and try again. I really do have better things to do with my life. I called their 'customer support', and I use that term loosely. All they would tell me is that it's my fault... the internet, the router, the signal, the weather... whatever. The device is hardwired to my existing wiring (not running on battery) and my router is less than 15' away. EVERYTHING else in the house runs flawlessly on the WiFi. All except this thing. But is it working even if I can't connect to it and view it, or answer the door? (Which sort of negates having it if I can't connect to it when I need to.) On the occasions when the app opens, if I look at the history I can see that it has recorded events. However, it usually starts recording AFTER the person is already very close to the door. (Yes, I know how to set the zone sensitivity.) And then I can watch them walking away from the door. By the way, I don't recognize most people from just their backside. And when it does record movement, it records for only 20 seconds, even if movement is still taking place. If there's a slow moving person, I MAY see them come to the door, but not whatever they might have done on my porch or on my property after the first 20 seconds. Again, mostly worthless. For example, recently a delivery vehicle came to my house, and I did see that in the recording, but only AFTER they parked, not driving up. But after 20 seconds it stopped recording, so I never saw the driver get out of the vehicle, never saw him/her walk to the house, and never saw them return to the vehicle and drive away. The next recording was of another car driving by (already halfway past the house) and the delivery vehicle was no longer there. The device never saw or recorded it leaving So, if you're Ok with being unable to see or connect to the device most of the time, this is definitely the device for you. And if want to buy mine, please let me know. I have no real use for it other than to look at it and realize that I made a mistake buying it. UPDATE: If you enjoy paying for things EVERY MONTH, then this is the product for you. Without their 'subscription plan' (monthly FEE) the only thing you'll see if try to view the camera, is a live view (if it works at all). Who was the person that knocked or rang the bell 2 minutes ago? You'll never know. You have to PAY AND PAY AND PAY to see that. I'm disgusted with this POS.",2 stars is being generous (and I've since changed my mind)
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Feb-19,Ken,"I purchased this in October of 2018 and I didn't have a strong enough signal for it to work. So I bought a WIFI extender. Still not strong enough signal. So I bought a better one from same company (netgear). Put it midway between the router and doorbell(about 35'. Total distance about 70') Still no good. I contacted NETGEAR who were great and told me how to use BOTH extenders. Put the better one at 35' and the less expensive one 25' from that right near the doorbell. It worked!...until a few days ago. Contacted RING who tell me that even though it has been working for 4 months that ""it's not recommended to use 2 extenders"". Even though the Mbps signal is 6 times the strength RING recommends as the minimum signal strength of 2Mbps. (I have 25 Mbps download and 12 upload) The RING app says the signal the doorbell is getting is ""Better than most"" and ""only indicating minor interference"". My only option they told me was to run a 100' Ethernet cable and get a 2nd router in the room near the doorbell....which would be impossible for me to do without tearing up floors and walls! I asked why would it work for 4 months no problem? Why does the doorbell say it's getting a good signal and why when I connect my phone directly to the WIFI signal the doorbell is getting from the 2nd extender does it show a signal 6 times stronger than the doorbell needs to operate? Can't return it because you only get 30 days. I'd like to know where it says that you can't use multiple extenders in the information either here on Amazon or on the RING website? It started working again so for right now it's good. But a hit or miss video surveillance system really doesn't give me the peace of mind I had in mind. I think it's a cop-out to suggest that what worked for 4 months is now the issue as to why the doorbell is working on and off. It was great when it was working.",may not work on WIFI extenders

I did not get a chance to look into it until 2 months later. The device is getting optimal connection to the router (RSSI – 33). I opened a support ticket with help@ring.com, here what I have done so far based on my conversation with support. 1. Removed the device from the app and reinstalled it ( did this 4 times already) 2. Moved the router approx. 2 feet from the device 3. Disconnected from the home router and connected the doorbell to my phone hotspot 4. Shared the device with ring support so they can look at the device activities, etc…. (they showed no activity on their end although the app is getting notification 20+ times a day) 5. Did a factory reset on the device then reinstalled the device Now, support is telling me that I have to open multiple ports on the router. If the router is the issue, step#3 above should have resolved the issue. For a device that supposed to be simple and easy to install (It says so right on the box), this install is turning into a second job for me. One week of back and forth communication is too much time invested in a video doorbell. I asked support to send a replacement device. Sometimes you just have to admit that the device is defective out of the box. (it happens all the time- hence the warranty)  Ring support is still insisting that the problem is somewhere else and not the device.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Aug-18,RainmanP,"UPDATE 11/28/2019 I finally figured out that part of my spotty experience - black video, no video, unable to view Live video was due to weak wifi.  The signal at the doorbell seemed strong enough for other devices but the Ring needed a little more.  Now that is all working better; I can always get live view or view videos. It still misses MANY motion activations that it should get, like someone walking right up to it, like the mail carrier or other delivery, etc.  And it takes so long to activate, people are usually there and gone before video starts.  Online and on TV I see a lot of videos of porch pirates approaching, grabbing packages, and walking away.  All I get is the UPS guy's back when he is almost back to his truck. I finally set the motion to pretty much minimum, ie, that the street is 5-15 feet away when it is actually closer to 30.  It no longer activates for every vehicle that drives by, but it still does it 2-3 times per day.  Setting the sensitivity so close probably affects its ability to detect people approaching.  Still, you would think it would detect the mail carrier 2 feet away, DIRECTLY  in front of it for several seconds every day. I would love to try either an updated version or higher version, but none seem to get any better reviews overall.  Even among more expensive, supposedly better brands, the reviews only seem to run about average.  I figure I might as well stick with this one. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Others have reported similar experience to mine so I will be brief. PROS: Setup was pretty simple.  I appreciate the fact that the doorbell lets you know when it needs to be charged. CONS: Motion detection sensitivity is a joke.  As far as I have been able to tell you have a choice of sensing every vehicle that drives down the street or just big trucks or fast cars.  A lot of days it does not even detect the mail carrier who has to walk right up to it.  I would say more often than not, it fails to detect my wife or me entering the house, and anyone entering the house or leaving despite the fact that you practically brush it with your shoulder. The motion detector setting in the app is a bit of a joke, too.  You use a little slide scale that is difficult to get to move, and you only have a graphic suggestion of distance so you don't really know what the setting is. Motion detection is way too slow to respond.  Even when it does respond to someone like a UPS person, you get a video of them walking away. Live View is hit or miss.  Occasionally I have actually seen the live image, but for a few days now it has shown nothing, ie, nothing happens when you tap the Live View play icon.  It might start working again tomorrow.  Who knows? I did not have an opportunity to install mine until a couple of months after I purchased it.  Within a couple of weeks I realized it was pretty useless, but it was obviously too late to return to Amazon. The simple doorbell I had before was at least good at it's job.",Better now but still Underwhelmed
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Mar-18,Danny B,I love the Ring doorbell but the speaker really is too low and the person ringing the doorbell cannot hear me. This causes frustration and well it plain sucks that I paid for a product that does not do what it advertises. I would not recommend this product. On top of all that they charge you $30 a year to keep the cloud service up not bad but it's worthless since you can't even communicate with the people at the door. 4/8/2018 - Update: I got a new Ring doorbell from Ring. The problem persists and there is absolutely nothing that can be done. So far I’m out $220 and absolutely nothing to show for it. I do however have a great little camera on the front door that I can watch from anywhere. My official recommendation is to stay away from this product at all costs. I’m sure that the August doorbell may be better than this product or even one of the cheapest ones on Amazon will work a thousand times better. 6/2/2018 - Update: so after a little over a month of troubleshooting the product with Ring we have come up with an answer to the low speaker problem. The app is not completely compatible with iOS. It works perfectly with Android but not a good fit with iOS. If you are not willing to get a new Android phone to replace your iPhone then steer clear of this product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,Great Camera But Don’t Count on the Speaker!

Installed it quickly and easily.  The motion and doorbell feed worked fine.  However, the live feed did not work at all.  AGAIN!  I followed all of the troubleshooting tips in the app:  wifi speed check (MUCH greater than the 1 MBPS required up and down) and checked the signal strength of the router to the doorbell (RSSI-47, which according to them is ""greater than most"").  Still, did not work.  So...I called Ring.  Again.  I was told to take the doorbell over next to the router (because all doorbells are directly next to the routers they connect to) and check it.  It magically worked, but only within a few feet of the router; outside of around 5 feet it wouldn't perform the live feed function.  My doorbell when installed is less than 15 feet from the router, with one wall in between; I can literally stand at the door and see my router with no issue.  Not to mention, I have other security cameras using this same router mounted over 50 feet away that work flawlessly with no extenders anywhere.  The Ring ""customer care"" guy (I use that term loosely also, they really don't care about the customer) told me I needed to buy their wifi extender...for the 15 foot distance between the router and doorbell.  Needless to say, I've had enough of Ring already.  I'm returning the replacement they sent to me back to Ring, and returning the original back to Amazon.  I highly recommend going with something else unless you want to constantly deal with problems and poor customer care.  Read more of the reviews here and do a basic internet search and you'll see a lot of the same; I wish I had done more homework myself and avoided the trouble.  My other cameras are Blink and work great, with no cloud cost requirement!  I've dropped by rating from 2-stars to 1-star and will never bother with Ring again! Dec. 11, 2018:  Had it in service for less than two weeks before the screen went black, live view quit working, and overall it quit working as it should.  Did some research and this is quite a common problem with these things.  Contacted Ring for support, they’re sending a new one in 5-7 business days; I got this one in two days from Amazon.  Not impressed-thought this would last longer than this and they would have a very well known issue resolved by now.  Concept is good and video was good when it did work.  Not sure it’s worth $100 then $3 per month for the cloud storage.  Will update when the new one gets here and it has been in service for enough time to tell if anything changes.",Quit quickly-common issue apparently.

I also purchased the same item from Ring.com and it arrived late also, it could be the color (Venetian). 2-battery) The battery is supposed to last between six months to one year, note I've had my Ring for less than one week and it's down to 76% using only zone 6.  At this rate I'll have to recharge the battery before my two months are up.  3-coverage) Zone 6 is supposed to cover five feet, however yesterday 12/8/17 it was covering the full range of 30 feet; picking up the trash, green waste, and recycle trucks which is annoying. 4-extender)  The Chime Pro is supposed to extend your Wi-Fi coverage, however I receive messages that the signal is weak; I’m not sure how this can be when I also have a MicoCell.  5-installation) You must install your Chime before your Doorbell to lessen any installation problems.  The one thing I like is you don't have to ring the doorbell to know someone or something is at your door.

I had done a lot of research and felt a wired doorbell would work great in our situation. After installation we noticed terrible connectivity issues and poor video quality. I worked with support and decided to purchase the Ring Chime Pro - it's wireless extender and chime. It still didn't work. Because my wireless network works great and even after we added the Chime Pro it was still not working.I worked with Ring support to replace the current model and upgrade to the Ring 2 (the upgraded 1080p one). I thought this one might work better - I even paid the difference of 20 dollars for the upgraded model. The Ring 2 Doorbell arrived, after installation the video at night was terrible and had lines streaming all over when it was on in the evening. After calling support - they said it was a hardware issue and sent another replacement. The Ring 2 replacement arrived - the video looks great, but often cannot connect and show live view. I have done the work in making sure it has a good wifi signal, it's wired, firmware is upgraded etc... just a really bad run.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Dec-18,Shariece,"I was excited to purchase the Ring video doorbell, what a huge disappointment this has been. For starters, it claims that rechargeable batter can last up to a year. That seems like a long stretch. I’ve had to charge it 4 times already in less than 5 months. Sadly, the battery life is the least of it’s problems. When I try to watch live view I always get the “activating device” loading screen and eventually error connecting to Ring doorbell. I have to deal with all these false motions all day and the very rare time I actually hear something and need to check I can’t connect. The video also doesn’t start recording until whoever was on the porch is walking away or it doesn’t record long enough so video cuts off before the person leaves. What good is a video doorbell that doesn’t record people causing the motion, and that won’t connect. At this point, the Ring doorbell is causing me more grief than anything. There’s nothing about it that would make me want to recommend it to anybody. None of it’s beneficial features work properly. Having a Ring doorbell ring is as good as having absolutely nothing",Useless “video” doorbell

First one was replaced. Now I want to return the replacement and get a refund. It simply does not work well. I am not a technophobe. I have a wireless house covered with security cameras (Arlo) that I have no problems with. Either I keep getting bad Rings or they’re just not ready for prime time. Update. 2/28/19. The folks at Ring contacted me after reading my review and, after a few questions (basically determining whether or not I was a total incompetent) decided to replace my Ring Doorbell with a Ring Doorbell 2. After some initial setup issues (still a little quirky and buggy), I was able to install the new unit. It’s trial came while I was away on business for 11 days, a true test. Verdict? I like the 2 a lot better. Battery life is longer, and the new battery design means you don’t have to remove the entire unit to charge it; just take the battery out. The manufacturer was kind enough to supply me with a spare battery, as battery life had been one of my issues with the previous unit. The battery life is outstanding, but, for continuous coverage I recommend getting a second battery. I’m very pleased with the 2, and also very pleased with the response from customer service.",Get the Ring Doorbell 2...read my review and you’ll understand.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Nov-19,culturejamming,"Overall this is not a great surveillance solution and dedicated cameras, ideally hardwired ones, are your best bet. Installation was easy. Basically screw the mounting plate in, follow the straightforward instructions supplied in the box, and you're up and running. You should charge the camera for a recommended 5-10 hours when you first receive it so that may delay the install into the next day if you're taking delivery after work during evening hours. The cons... -Video lag is as bad as everyone says. Most of my motion alerts are when people are right up on the camera. I have a long, flat front yard. The motion capture begins when someone is about 10-15 feet away or sometimes less distance. If you're expecting to capture people approaching your home from a distance, forget about it. -Video quality is way crappier than I expected. It looks like the quality of dashcams from 5-10 years ago. You would not be able to make out fine details such as a license plate or even facial features unless someone is right up on the camera looking into it. -Motion capture is finicky. It will be different for everyone. Our house faces a busy road that is probably 80-100 feet from where the camera is located. I wanted to extend the motion zone out to the end of our driveway so I could capture anyone who pulls on to our property, but it ends up picking up large trucks passing on the road as a result. I tuned it back to prevent endless alerts which means it doesn't activate until people are right in front of the door instead. There is no sweet spot. -Night vision is not great as daytime quality already isn't great. The fancy, crisp, high def examples are not what you will get with the regular 720p Ring. Night vision is only decent for motion alerts which, as I've explained, aren't too reliable. I am installing 4 Flir cameras on a detached garage which I already know have way better video quality, as my friend has the same system installed. I really only got the Ring for motion alerts because I can't get them from the Flir system (long story - I can but it's complicated and not worth the trouble). The Ring doesn't even really succeed at that so it's sort of a waste but I'll be keeping it anyway. This product would have been awesome with clearer quality and more reliable motion capture. As it stands, it's a glorified doorbell that allows me to see delivery guys standing in front of my front door once they've already gotten there. This delivers about 25% of what I expected.",Meh

Hagel,"This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. That said... Likes:  As I said, it works as advertised.  No complaints. I don’t feel ripped off. I did the work and I knew what I was buying.  I had just moved into a new home, was receiving a lot of deliveries, and this was the perfect piece of mind.  Maybe I’d be happier with version 2 of the doorbell?  I don’t know. It looks good, and works as advertised. Love the app! Overall I’m happy with it, but it could be so much better.  I’m just not sure if there is anything better on the market at the moment. Dislikes:  WiFi signal is pretty weak for a device they KNOW is going to be used outside, while the router is inside. Mine is no more that 20ft away with no walls (other than the exterior wall) between it and its right on the edge of acceptable.  To contrast, my Roku that is 3 rooms away, through several walls and a greater distance has plenty of signal strength. I don’t like the image produced.  Not the quality, but the crazy wasted space of the fisheye.  Way too much boarder. As others have pointed out, the motion detection can drive you crazy.  I wish that was a little better implemented. For example, the garbage trucks set it off 100% of the time, yet someone walking to the door isn’t recorded until after they push the button?  They base the motion off the video, but it would work better if it had a dedicated motion detector similar to a yard light.  Almost every delivery that is dropped off starts with a shot of the driver walking away. If someone were to actually steel a package, I’d get a great pic of the back of their t-shirt as the walk away. Finally, the monthly bill is ridiculously expensive. It may seem inexpensive, but it’s not really.  It’s monthly or annually, and about 1/3rd of the purchase price.  Add a second device and that cost doubles, and without the monthly fee, it’s basically a REALLY expensive doorbell and webcam.  You’d think they would at least give you 24 hrs of storage or something.",As advertised

By the time the app pulls up, it connects and the video is visible, the truck is halfway back out of the driveway.  Absolutely useless for what it is supposed to be able to do.  I think maybe you might be able to catch an angry neighbor at the door if they wait long enough to bitch you out for you dog digging up his yard.

Update: My issue is my door is set in an archway and any daylight outside the archway becomes a wall of light and I can't see past the archway. When I first view my camera I can see all the way across the street, but then the camera self adjusts and whites out everything past the archway. UPDATED UPDATE! So in my situation, I had to purchase the next higher level of doorbell (RING 2) due to my archway and the camera ""overexposing"" the image at the entrance of my front door (bright white light). I only had to pay the difference and a reduced amount at that. They were super helpful in resolving my issue. The image quality is awesome now and I can see clear across the street. Very pleased with the end results! They sent me out the new doorbell and a shipping label so I could send the original one back.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Mar-20,Dave B.,"First of all, the motion detection is absolutely unusable.  Just turn it off right out of the box, and pretend it was never an option in the first place.  You'll be much happier, and save yourself a lot of frustration.  Even on the lowest sensitivity, and no matter how you adjust the detection field, motion detection will go off incessantly, until you finally disable it.  Sun came out?  Motion alert!  Wind blew some grass blades?  Motion alert!  Car drove down the street?  Motion alert!  Did a person approach the door, then turn around and leave?  Motion sensor captured the last glimpse of their shoe as they turned the corner to leave!  Turn it off now, or turn it off in anger a few days from now. The video is also pretty terrible.  Normal (not bright) conditions outdoors make everything washed out and barely visible, and the only time you can really see something is if it's in a shadow.  You might think that it just needs a smoked glass filter over the camera, but then the only thing you can see is the bright areas, and shaded spots are then too dark to be visible.  It's pretty terrible. I kept it strictly for the live view, the mobile notifications for the doorbell ringing, and the intercom capabilities.  I'm not ashamed to say that I mostly use these features to say rude things to solicitors without having to go to the door.",Possibly the worst product I haven't sent back
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Jan-18,Kathy,"We really wanted to love our Ring doorbell. We really did. It was miserable to install. First off, it wouldn't work with the chime we had, so we bought a new chime. Guess what? It didn't work with the new chime either. It seems that they want you to spend another $50 to buy their chime. So we did. We bought the one with the wifi extender on it. Glad we did. Apparently our wifi had a hard time passing through the front wall of the house. The one good thing about the install was their customer service. The rep from Ring stayed on the phone with my husband for over an hour before he suggested we go to Home Depot and buy their chime. We did, and it works perfectly. Another issue is the motion alerts. Every time we go out our front door we get a motion alert. Not good. So I turned off the sound for those alerts. I still get them in the app (silent) and have to delete them. I'm still trying to figure out how to turn them off altogether, but that's another story. I loved the video when someone rang the doorbell. I didn't realize (when I bought the Ring) that I would have to pay $30 a year to Ring to get the videos. So we did pay. Our old doorbell was mounted low and we had to use the same install spot because we have stucco, so our Ring is lower than it should be for good video. If you have an Apple watch, it will tell you that someone is at your door, but the app won't open on my phone. Thus, I'm too late to talk to whoever is at the door once I manually open the Ring app. I know, it seems like a lot of complaining, but I didn't realize my watch would conflict with the phone app, or that I would have to buy their chime, or that I would have to pay $30 a year for video.

My first issue is the new 'person' detection is lagging. It takes a good 10 seconds before it notifies you of a human. I've checked the speed and connection of the doorbell and I have a very high speed router, but it is frustrating when I can't pull up who is outside on my phone fast enough. Just today a census worker stopped by and it is raining and cold, I couldn't pull up to see who was at the door so I opened the old fashioned way...blind.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Jan-19,GrumpyShopper,"I initially wrote a negative review because I couldn't get it to work and I couldn't get in touch with technical support.  They saw my review and reached out to me.  The problem was that my network has spaces in the name and the Ring doesn't like that in the initial setup. Support suggested starting the setup using a hotspot on my phone, then switching back to my home network.  This worked.  The doorbell is now mounted and being powered by my original doorbell wiring.  Now that I've used it awhile, here is an update. One really nice thing is that the package comes with everything you need to mount the doorbell, except a power drill.  The drill bit, screws, anchors and even a level are in the package. The night vision works quite well.  I'm including a photo.  In fact, the image is better than the day mode. The resolution is barely adequate and I'd recommend getting a higher resolution.  I've seen them side by side and the 1080 version is worth the investment, in my opinion. The Ring is completely reliable at detecting motion.  I had to set the sensitivity to medium because it was picking up cars on the street, more than 50 feet away.  Now it only detects motion that is closer. There are a couple of issues.  There is a several second delay between the time it detects motion and when it starts recording. If UPS just drops a package, I only have video of him walking away, as pictured.  He'd already dropped the package and was leaving before the recording started.  If he stands on the porch and scans the package there, I will get video of the front of him.  Note also, that with the scene being back lit, all the detail from the man is too dark to see.  Nearly everyone's porch will be back lit and I see no adjustment to compensate for this.  I'd rather have the background washed out and the foreground visible.  When someone stands very close to the Ring, their face is visible but pixelated.  This is another reason to purchase a higher definition model. I looked at reviews of several competitor's products and these seem to be common issues with all of them.  From what I've read, it seems like the Ring is the one that has the least delay. In short, yes, I'd recommend this product.  I don't think you can do better for $99.95. Personally, I've got a friend that wants this 720 resolution one and I'm passing it on and buying a higher resolution video doorbell.",Works with the help of tech support
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Nov-19,GinaSoCal,"EDIT: I increased this from a 1-star review to a 5-star based on customer service. Soon after my initial review Ring Customer Service reached out to me, and to be honest I wasn't very polite initially. I was filled with frustration and buyers remorse, but their personnel immediately identified that the quality of video, and the constant false alerts were an issue on their part, apologized and offered me an upgraded swap out of product. I was reluctant at first, but decided to take them up and received the Ring Video Doorbell 2. They instructed me to add the included wedge and it's been like a new product. Great quality video, and no longer false alerts that are set off with a whisper. I broke even on the cost/upgrade because I had to have an electrician come out twice, but that's because I wanted mine hardwired. So for this product, I'd say if you have a lot of traffic that the camera can capture, you may want to pass, and head straight to the Ring Video Doorbell 2. Also, if you have any issues, I'd immediately reach out to the customer service team and see what they can do to help. INITIAL REVIEW: I so wanted to love this product. I went back and forth between this and the Nest, before making the decision to move forward on the Ring, finally being sold on the easy install. It wasn’t an easy install, but that’s okay, I told myself because I paid an electrician to hook it up correctly to my doorbell. The first day installed, I immediately caught a video of someone in my courtyard (from the back only) and I thought, “Wow! This is great!” (Not the woman, the video), but sadly it didn't catch her entering, just leaving. That was the last time it seemed to work for the purpose intended. Instead for the past three weeks, I have great, albeit weird fish-eye lens views of myself coming and going on a daily basis. Great diet motivator I must say, but that’s about it. Oh once it caught the gardener. But again only the back of him, so using the camera for identifying purposes is a moot point. I get somewhere near 35 alerts a day, all with nothing but a delayed reaction to a car passing by, or maybe a slight breeze blowing a branch. I should also point out that I'm paying 3 bucks a month to record all these nonsense alerts, but that's because I'm an optimist and I keep hoping maybe something (besides myself) will finally show up on one of these alerts. I’ve had four packages, and a neighbor come by to drop something off, and it’s like they are invisible. Maybe they’re all Ninja’s. I’ve adjusted the settings to make them super sensitive (to catch people) and also tried dialed it down so that I don’t get alerted by a mere breeze, and neither have made a difference. So I’ve now paid for a fancy looking doorbell, and a chime that sounds every four minutes on my phone. I'm hoping by the mere sight of the defunct doorbell it will deter thieves and ne’er-do-well’s.  But for giving me a heads up to people entering my living space or simple piece of mind, I think my cat does a better job.",UPDATED REVIEW - Great Customer Service - iffy product

[begin edit, 27-Feb-2019] After Ring reached out to me, years later, I decided to not only tear mine down again, but tear down another belonging to a coworker, this unit dead from weather exposure, in order to prepare for the call and defend my statements. In the interest of intellectual honesty and completeness, I must note that, while what I say below is factual _for my unit_, the second unit I tore down does, in fact, contain 3x PIR on Kapton tape above the camera.  Those are entirely non-existent in my original sample.  The plastic casing is there for them, they just simply don't exist.  QA defect?  Perhaps so.  But in 50% [n=2 ;-) ] of samples there are three PIR...  I stand behind the observation of my unit lacking motion detection circuitry, and the remainder of the experience as well; but that portion of the review (which I discounted anyway) needs to be viewed as a possible assembly/QA defect rather than indicative of the generation itself). /end edit] I would go beyond questioning the claims they make regarding their motion detection technology, being someone that has implemented those technologies many times in the CCTV world.  But leaving off the claims I think are hogwash - even then... it's bad.  Worse.  Awful. False alarms abound.  A courier can make it to my doorstep, scan the package, place it, ring the doorbell, and make it to the end of my 40' driveway before recording even starts.  Relying upon motion detection is futile as the logs start well after the person has walked away.  But grass waving in the breeze at 20'?  Gets that every time. 30-45+ seconds is typical for a doorbell press to register on the remote device when it's on the same network segment.  Remote?  A minute-plus is not uncommon. Few hang-out at the door for a minute plus. My plethora of actual CCTV cameras on a real DVR catch the events unfolding, so I can precisely identify the time. So now I rely on the CCTV cameras to tell me if someone's there.  Motion _at_ the door?  I'm pushing alerts for that with a Maxbotix Ultrasonic sensor on a Particle Photon microcontroller (about six seconds average to get my push notification through, with a 20 second worst-case) ""Oh it's your WiFi""...  [Multiple] Enterprise-grade access points with zero handoff latency mesh networking.  50mbit/sec synchronous redundant connection to the backbone.  Low two-digit packet RTTs.  -42 to -54dBm signal strength to the device.  I do this stuff for a living. My Photon with sensors is 25' further away, still outside, going over the same path with the same obstructions. If I've had to supplement the video and the motion - what's left?  The SIP VOIP communications.  That's why it gets two stars - if someone REALLY wants to talk to you and is willing to tolerate the initial latency and call setup times - it does work.  It's an almost usable  Intercom. Am I returning it?  Indecisive.  Go to the trouble to set up Asterisk and find or build a handsfree weather-tight  intercom and return the Ring?  Keep it for just that purpose and continue supplementing all the things it's supposed to be but isn't?  Meh.  I've got another week to decide... Would I recommend it?  Authoritatively 'No'...  Probably not even to someone I didn't like unless I were willing to change my name and phone number... Is there a better turnkey product today?  I'm unsure.  I would probably have given it four stars if they'd lose the camera, lose the product literature making wild claims, and lose the pseudo-motion-detection (which would be lost with the camera regardless). Maybe there's something better already.  If you find it - let me know - otherwise I'll end-up building it ultimately...",I'll keep looking for an acceptable exterior SIP Intercom solution.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Mar-20,Angela Togni,"I’ve done research for a few weeks after my package was stolen off my front porch by my neighbor and I decided to go with this Ring doorbell and have been happy with it so far. I tested it out and as soon as I stepped in front of the doorbell I received a notification on my phone. I was connected to the wifi on my phone though so I thought maybe that’s the reason why it was so quick but I was wrong. Even while I’m at work where I have no wifi and have to use my data, I received the notification and saw the delivery guy right in front of my door delivering the package. Once I clicked on the notification and unlocked my phone, it immediately connected to the camera. I did not talk to them as I was at work but I would have been able to. The audio and picture quality is great, even at night. I haven’t subscribed to anything yet as I am still looking into that but all my videos have been stored so far and I can go back and watch them over again. My recorded videos have been between 10-30+ seconds. After having the doorbell for over one week so far I have noticed that sometimes there is a delay in me being notified when someone is at the door. It’s still recording from when someone walks towards the doorbell but I’m being notified late. Not sure why this is but as long as I’m notified that someone was there, I’m okay with that. HOWEVER, just this morning when I left to go to work, I did not receive any notification. Was not notified hours later either so I am not sure what happened. No video was recorded either. I felt so much more comfortable knowing that I am able to see who is at my door any time of the day but after today, I am a little worried .. Maybe it has something to do with low or high temperature but it was 50 degrees which I am pretty sure it has been in the past too. The camera itself felt cold when I touched it .. Kind of disappointed though. The live view is always connecting and recording once I access it so at least that’s working fine. Would have given this doorbell 5 stars if I had posted this review prior to today. Not trying to let one little disappointing experience ruin my opinion about this item because overall I really like it, but being notified and seeing who is in front of the camera at all times is the whole point of it. Not that I live in an apartment community with a lot of crime or anything but I definitely do not enjoy unexpected visitors in front of my door or my package being stolen by a neighbor who appears to not respect other people and their belongings. UPDATE: Just reached out to customer support who said the reason for me not being notified is that my camera is facing a road and the camera picks up that more often rather than anyone being close up so they said they will mail me a Wedge kit for FREE to put the camera at an angle to pick up motion right in front of my door. Amazing customer service. Just not sure why it worked flawlessly before. I’ll see once I get home if I get notified and I will try to update this review after installing the wedge and see if it improved.",This review was typed over the course of a week and a half ..
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-20,df,"When a device just over a year old failed, I purchased a new one. After charging the battery to 100% I installed it and all was well. The next morning the battery indicator was at 71% and because the device is wired I though that it was defective after measuring the source voltage (I'm an engineer of electronics and I have the proper equipment). I returned and asked for a replacement. After fully charging battery and installation, the same thing happened hours later but this time the regulator was able to maintain the battery at 91% of charge. I called tech support and the tech told me that it was perfectly fine for the battery to settle at a range of voltages. The first unit always made 100%. To me this is an ill advised cost reduction redesign that saved a few pennies by using a crappy voltage reference and then made things worse by not using the same reference for the Charge counter. I could give them the design for a 1.2V +/- 6% CMOS integrated reference for free (no trims) if they asked me. That's a cost reduction project done wrong.",Device power regulator sucks
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Jul-18,coconutmonkey,"We have had the Ring doorbell for almost a year now and we are thinking of getting something else.  Seems that ever since Amazon bought out Ring, we have had nothing but problems with our doorbell.  Installation was easy, we hardwired it directly to our existing doorbell. Here are the pros: Video for the most part is clear Voice is loud for person at door, a little more difficult to hear on phone for person answering Doorbell is nice in appearance and has a nice chime when rung Easy to install App is adequate/easy to use Here are the cons: Motion area is a joke at best.  When you have it set out far, every car that drives on our street triggers the motion, but it won't record a person walking up to the door until they are already standing there for a few minutes!  When you set the range to less, you still get cars (but coming from only one side of the road, not both), but someone walking to your door is not recorded until they are standing right at your door! Seems like video/motion has a severe delay.  Example:  Every time someone comes to the door, say UPS/FedEx, they walk up to the door, scan and drop the package, turn and walk back to the truck.  The video will start recording when they are leaning down to place package on step and then walking away!  If someone were actually stealing my package, all I would get is their back as they walked away!!!!  Defeats the purpose of the video!  (and since we pay to have the cloud storage, this is upsetting) When someone rings the doorbell, it takes a minute for the screen to load (this could be in part due to our internet), but even if I am in the house, right by the router, it takes such a delay to show and the person who rang the bell has been standing there for like a minute before you can even see who it is or acknowledge them.  Yes, a minute isn't a big deal. . .takes that and longer for someone to actually walk to the door and answer it. But just count to 60 and it is long enough.  The video and playback should not take that long!!! If you live in cold climates, don't expect it to work when it is subzero.  We had about a week during winter where there was a cold snap and our Ring app kept saying our battery was low (even though it is hardwired to our existing doorbell) and would not work. Overall, I am not happy with this product.  There is no reason someone walking up the pathway (which is relatively straight) shouldn't trigger the motion as they are walking up and not when they are at the door. . . but will trigger motion when a car (which is like 10 feet away) drives by!","Ever since Amazon bought out Ring, we have had problems.

About 6 months ago the audio stopped working on the doorbell and on my phone. I can see video but can't communicate. Ring tech support is telling me check my internet connection? I really wanted this product to work - great concept, poor execution. UPDATE: 4/27 - After posting this review, Ring support has contacted me in regards to getting back up and running. I had previously done a hard reset on the doorbell without it working. I tried again and now the Ring doorbell is working properly. I've updated my review to 3/5 stars. I will update in a few months to see if problem persists. UPDATE: 5/22 - Lost audio again. All my Ring.com recordings that I pay $3 / month for have no audio.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-20,Antonio Fuentes,I do not know where even to start. TOTALLY OUTDATED PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!!! Compare to the competition it is not worth this limited 720p version for the price. FURTHERMORE THE OUTRAGEOUS IDEA THAT I PAID ABOUT 100$ for this product this past December and other on the market in 4K GO FOR LESS makes me very displeased. ESPECIALLY SINCE RINGS BAITS YOU WITH 30 day access to 24hr recorded interactions. Only to take that from you so you cannot see after someone has left your front door. Aka only a lige view for free. They give you no cloud storage for feee unless you pay a reoccurring or flat fee up front for the year.  MARKETING TACTIC FOR PASSIVE INCOME. ALSO COMPARED TO COMPETITION LIKE TEND SECURE WHICH I USE INDOORS FOR THE PAST 3 years. I PAID 70$ for it on sale at walmart. And they give me access to 7days worth of cloud storage and automatically writes over. That is a great investment and secure cloud storage may i add. I paid one time and have lifetime protection and access to that with the ability to download for a fraction of the price. ALSO IT COMES 1080p .. very disapointing especially when now i checked they are giving out free RING SOLAR SIGNS WITH PURCHASE WHICH IN ALL ACTUALITY IA JUST ANOTHER THING THAT STOPS MORE INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR THEM ON STOLEN DEVICES but it is better for the environment being solar. Intruders will be deterred by camera they do homework. Idk if amazon or RING IS THE SCAM HERE BUT BOTH SHOULD RECTIFY IMMEDIATELY I MEAN THE RING 2 and PRO HAVE DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY SHOULD BE WAY LESS WITH A MONTH SUBSCRIPTION. Or amazon just overcharges and marks up. Idk but this is bad .. pick yourself a better home security brand and shopping platform.,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!

McDonald,"I bought the ring to monitor the front of the house.  The installation was easy and hence I upgraded to two stars instead of one.  After installing, I proceeded to do the connectivity to the internet and phone.  The program was full of bugs.  Adjusting the area of motion activation still does not work right after several days of messing with it.  Also, if you are trying to adjust it from off site, forget it.  After you save the new settings. you have to push the door bell to get it to work.  Good luck doing it from out of town.  The motion sensor once triggered takes over five minutes to re-set and record another 30 second clip.  So...burglers...if you want to rip off some packages, just toss something at the front door to trigger the motion activation, then you have plenty of time to rip off the packages that Amazon has left.  Not good.  As a professional photographer, I can tell you that the picture quality in definitely low quality.  First, the image distortion is truly the fisheye night mare of all times.  The dynamic range of the picture is very low end.  I have a very shallow porch which seems to properly exposed.  The yard is totally blown out highlights with no detail at all.  The real kicker after all of this mess is that in addition to paying $150 for a very low end camera and buggy software, you now have to pay a monthly fee for it to work.  Even the 30 second snippets.  What a rip off.",Very expensive and very cheap
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Jan-20,Jesse Swarbrick,"UPDATE: So Max at Ring reached out to me about my issues concerning this review below. He was incredibly helpful. He guided me through some setup issues I had and it seemed to help the overall connection of the device. I also upgraded my internet and router which helped with signal strength. However, the Ring 1 is simply not the best alternative for a door bell camera due to quality and lag issues. He upgraded me to the Ring 2 for $50.00 (1/4 of retail price), and have been loving it ever since I got it. The quality is 1080P, and it works as advertised. I would recommend the RING 2 over the RING 1 due to the quality improvements, but having a strong WiFi signal is truly the key to get this device to work properly. I appreciate the customer service and help Max and Ring provided to ensure that their existing customers are happy and satisfied. I am updating my review to 5 stars due to the customer service and the noticeable improvements with the Ring 2. Original Post: I've had this device for coming up on 2 years. It has underwhelmed me since I bought it, and I'm deeply upset with myself for not returning it earlier while I was able too. The router is about 25-30 feet away, only passing thru one wall. The motion picks up EVERYTHING, even when the setting is updated to not pickup street traffic. The device also is pixelated AF! It lags, I wouldn't be able to see in the slightest who robbed my mail or car if the situation arrived. I then purchased the ""ring chime pro"" with hopes to extend the range, in turn making the camera quality better. It did absolutely nothing but bug my dog with the door bell function on the ring chime pro. In conclusion, this model is trash and I plan to unsubscribe and throw it directly into the recycle bin.",Update: Customer Service is amazing!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Feb-20,bigbearsfan,"My wife really wanted one of these.  I ordered this as it was on sale in December.  The install is super easy. So is the setup.  If you are mounting this to siding, go ahead and order the mounting wedge. You're going to need it. Without the wedge or some sort of mounting block to level the doorbell, the Ring will be aimed too far upward and you're going to get too many false positives with the motion detection. There is one deep flaw with this doorbell.  Think twice about getting this version of the Ring if you have a covered porch. On this original version of the Ring, you can't adjust contrast. So, everything beyond your covered porch is going to be washed out. You won't be able to see what's happening on the sidewalk and beyond.  I've seen reviews of the Ring Pro that say you can adjust contrast on that version. If you just have to have one of these, spend the extra and get the Pro version for your covered porch. If your porch isn't covered, my guess is you'll be ok with this version of the Ring. Overall,  I don't think most people really need this and I wouldn't have one were it not for my wife.  But if you really want one, splurge for the Pro version. I think you will like it better.",Just ok.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Sep-16,Cal,"I absolutely love this doorbell. Our single chime we have in our home is on the main floor and we would be home and not hear the doorbell when we were in the basement or upstairs. Camera* For us it works great. The camera is good quality you can see a car driving all the way down our street and see what is going on across the street at the neighbors house. Our front door and porch is fairly wide open, after we got ours my father wanted one so I helped him install his at his house. When we turned on the video the image looked terrible, he has a long deep hall kind of a front door, so the image is all distorted by the ""light at the end of the tunnel."" I have heard several people complain about that so think about what your front door is like before buying, or be willing to place the doorbell in a creative location. Talking through the camera* I have successfully had conversations with my front door guest with me hundreds of miles away. It is wonderful, I can clearly see who is at my door and be able to say hey im at the store I'll be there in five, I think the door is unlocked go ahead and go in or whatever. It is a great feature. Recording* The recording is amazing, and it is only $30/ year for the service. I do quite a bit of transactions of craigslist where I have people come to my home, well now I have a video of them just incase they steal, harm or threaten me in anyway. It is very easy to email a video clip to a friend or the police you never know what you might need. App* The app is easy to use, but I have noticed just a few times that the app fails from time to time right when somebody rings, so I don't get a notification or realize, but I have extra chimes now, which are easy to use so I still know somebody is there. The live view feature is wonderful, when your traveling you can check on the house easily. You can just check to see if you have a package or whatever, very convenient. Motion detection* We get several notifications of cars driving by because engines put off quite a bit of heat and this product isn't just simple motion its a moving heat signature, very cool, but it picks up cars often. You can adjust the motion distance, but cars are so hot that 1 of 4 cars that drives by is picked up on the camera. If somebody doesn't want to be filmed, they try to just knock on your front door, but surprise they are being filmed anyways, not just filmed but audio is recorded too! Same with somebody dropping off a flyer. Installation* Don't be intimated by this at all! You download the app and there are several videos of step by step what exactly to do, anybody could install this, trust me, trust yourself you can do it! I was reading alot and watching all the videos when I was installing so the first time took me about 40 minutes. The second time I installed one it took me about 10 minutes.","Always be home, smart features, highly customizable, highly recommended"

I have 4 floodlight camera's, 3 video doorbells, 1 Stick-up Cam and they all perform flawlessly!!!!  I'm even surprised they can pick up our wifi consider where a couple of them are (across a 3,500 sq. ft. home, through walls, garage and to the sides of the house) but there hasn't been ONE glitch!  After using these cameras, I purchase the video doorbells......same stellar review.  Just now I put up a ""Stick-up Cam"" outside my Pops front porch (he's 94) so I can see him coming and going from his studio on the opposite side of the house.  PERFECT. I can check in on him coming and going from his walks and even watch him watering his plants.  Additionally I have RING products up at our cabin which is 300 miles away and I can check out what's going on up there as well.  I'm SOLD.  We have a fancy, security/camera system at our home.  It takes up a ton of room in my office with all the monitor/HD receiver, etc. but those hardwired cameras are not near as good as RING! Then you have to scroll through the recording to find an incident which is time consuming and a pain in the butt!  I've decided we're ditching the ""security system"" and switching to just RING!  Right now I can monitor the entire exterior of my home, no matter where I am, hit an alarm if I need to and even ""make a comment"" if need be. Next I'll be purchasing a few ""Stick-up Cams"" for the inside of the house for added security and to watch the dog of course! I can store videos and monitor security on ALL devices for a year at $100.00.  Well worth the money.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Aug-19,Texas KnowHow,"THis review is for the Bronze $99 Ring product. Once you getting it working, it is a great addition to home security. I wanted to hard wire it as to alleviate taking off the base every few months and recharging. The directions stated that any wire could be attached to either terminal. The first try was a not go, so I swapped the wires and viola, the doorbell wires started powering the unit. So, if it does not work as far as charging the first wiring, then try swapping the wires on the unit and see if that does the trick. Another installation issue had to do with wifi connection. The signal was too weak. I simply re-positioned the modem closer and it worked. If fact, it helped with ALL of the wifi connections in the house, so it was a good thing in the end. The sensitivity of the motion detection is great and somewhat over reactive as it picks up every car that drives past our house on the street. There is an adjustment in the app, yet if I were to bring the zones in more I would sacrifice the side detection that I want on the driveway, so I manage. The night detection could be improved. It is grainy due to my overlighting of the front house. The live feed is awesome and the audio interaction between the person at the door talking to one another via my phone and the Ring doorbell works great! I really like that feature. I tell a lot of people to ""GET OFF MY LAWN!"" and they love it. I opted for the $30 annual RING subscription with one month free so that all my videos are stored on their cloud. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. I would like them to tweek the coverage areas to be more versatile and bring the cloud storage fees down to maybe $12 a year instead.","Once you getting it working, it is a great addition to home security"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Mar-16,Carolyn D.,"After two days with support at Ring it is clear that this product is a dud.  I was really excited to receive this, and bought the Chime to go with it. Well, if the sole purpose of this product is to let you know who is at your door or gate and to let you communicate with that person it is a total failure.  And if I have to answer one more question from tech support about where my router is positioned (in my tiny house) in respect to the doorbell as if that was the obvious answer to all the problems with this product and not a problem with the product itself...my head might just explode.  First, the quality of the video is horrendous (see picture).  It reminds me of old video tape after 10 generations of duplication. Second, night vision...what night vision? I have a camera in my yard that switches to night vision when it gets dark (way way cheaper than this paperweight) so I know what it's suppose to look like.  The video switches to black and white and very clear.  I'd left the still uninstalled doorbell in the living room last night and it got activated by something...maybe my dog.  So I looked at my phone and my iPad to see how the night vision was working.  Uh...total blackness, except for a speck of reflective light so I knew it was on and working.  So I thought maybe it needed a little light to work so I went down and turned on a couple of lights.  Nope..no night vision...just the low light affect of a room in a red ambient glow.  I stepped up to the camera to see if my face would b discernible in this non night vision low light but my face was but a blob.  Would show you a screengrab of that from the saved video but tech support had me uninstall the app from my device and then couldn't get connected again so can't access account.  So aside from horrible quality picture, and no night vision as it claims to have, the doorbell camera end of it would not receive audio when I answered the ring.  I tried talking to the ""visitor"" using both my android phone and my iPad and he could not hear me, although I could hear him.  And to cap it all off, while testing the device as my friend was about to install it outside, it would freeze up and we had to wait a few minutes before being able to ring doorbell again.  Don't think my visitors would appreciate that much...or package delivery.  Tech support didn't really have any answers.  We checked the upload speed when the devices froze presumably trying to upload or access videos, which he said was fine.  Everything else internet wise and speed wa fine too.  This is not cutting edge technology.  It's pretty basic nowadays so no excuse for it to be so low quality and so ineffective.  So yeah...I will be returning this which has taken up way to much time that I can never get back.  An expensive paperweight for sure.",Super dud!!!!!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Dec-19,Greggy,"I bought the ring about 2 years ago. It was easy to install but did not prove all that useful. I found that the time it took to get my phone out to check the person at the door too long. There is a $3 per month charge for storage which I did not expect. Lastly it failed in 2 years. I have a background in electronics so  I checked it out and determined that there was a failure in the circuit board.  That was very disappointing because no way I could fix it. I checked what else is available and decided on BLINK. It is significantly less expensive, runs on batteries (no need to wire but you could), storage is free, 1080p, more flexible and notifies very quickly. It works with Alexa but have not used that feature yet. To be fair the ring I have is an older model but he new models cost twice what a BLINK cost without any real advantages. BLINK is not the only alternative that is better than the ring but so far I am happy with it. I will give it some time before I do a review on it.",There are much better choices

Bright,"I love the concept of the Ring doorbell because I wanted a camera to watch my property and at first glance the Ring is the perfect product. But it has major drawbacks. First, I get a lot of packages delivered. The ring is great at catching a delivery person as they are walking away from my porch. So... they drive up. Park. Exit their vehicle. Walk up my driveway. Set a package down at the door. Turn around and THEN Ring is like “oh. Hey! Motion!” Uhh... that’s terrible Ring. Terrible! And then since my house was not wired for a doorbell (another reason I went with a wireless option) I thought ‘awesome! This bell is wireless too.’ Except it doesn’t hold a charge long. So I have to take it down every month, let it charge, and rehang it. And because I’m a clutz I’ve dropped the thing more times than it was designed for. The chassis broke and now it doesn’t screw onto the baseplate well. To me this is a major design flaw. I even thought about running the charge cord to it so it can sustain charging without my having to remove the device and reinstall it every time. But the cable is in the way because the charge port is on the back of the device. Again, this is poorly designed. I will say that the Ring Neighborhood App is a bright spot. It is very entertaining to see what others in the area consider “suspicious.” So far the win has been the lady walking her dog. Maybe it had fleas?",It is just ok

UPDATE: Purchased the Ring doorbell 2, and that made a huge difference. The motion detection is spot on. Way better picture quality too as it’s recording in 1080. Highly recommend. UPDATE: The Support team contacted due to the review I initially left to make sure I was happy with the product and to go over any issues I may still have. Awesome of them to do this.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Feb-20,The handsome cook,We installed this Ring doorbell 2 months ago and works well.  I had to request a wedge from ring because the video was way too bright. Our brick siding is dark and the camera over adjusted so people were too bright to recognize. With the wedge the camera is now pointed to the sidewalk so the video is a little better I called Tech Support and they diagnosed problem remotely and sent the wedges for free.  My 2 complaints are the brightness of the video and that it picks up large trucks too easily even though I’ve adjusted the coverage area.  Pretty easy to install although I had to do a little carpentry to create a larger base as my old doorbell was very thin on a narrow base. $30 for a year of data storage is priced right. Hopefully the next generation will produce a better resolution video - frankly my phone produces much clearer video - so it gets only 4 stars.,Very nice video doorbell but way too bright
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Aug-20,Mr.Bill,"Many people seem to have an issue with the doorbell button. If you push it dead center, it works,  Off the side a bit, it does not seem to register. Maybe the button should be smaller, or the embossing around it removed. Maybe this is not so much a ring issue as I had this issue on my last two normal hard wired doorbell buttons too. I don't recall hearing of this problem in older generations, so maybe as a nation we've just become too weak to push the button hard enough? Or, is it just not possible to make a button sensitive enough to work when pushed softly or off center anymore? My door faces the street which is 30' away and slightly down hill, about a 5' elevation. I have set the sensitivity to the bare minimum, which shows in the app as the end of my 5' porch. Still cars driving by set it off. I also purchased an optional wedge kit and pointed the camera both comically down and up, which helped some, but not enough. Trucks trigger it, and on bright days the light reflecting off cars also sets it off.  I need to keep the proximity alert of someone approaching my door disabled, or it just goes off all day long.  I thought the People Only mode feature they released might be the answer, but no, cars, even the suns reflection from cars 30’ away well outside the minimum range I set still set it off. I have detection as restrictive as it can be. There is no lower setting left to try. Neither FedEx or UPS can seem to push the button hard enough to make it ring when a package needs a signature and leave. That proximity alert would be a nice backup to get them coming to the door if only I could leave it on... Food delivery during the pandemic has become a problem too. Too many cold pizza and Chinese food found on the porch long after delivery. Once so long a squirrel got into one meal and made a real mess. I can see in the video the delivery people make an effort to push the doorbell, but obviously off center or not pushing hard enough.  I've resorted to using cash, but Dash, GrubHub and some places won't take that, so I had to change restaurants that are not as good. Still, they often wait, sometimes they get the bell to work on the second or third try, but most usually resort to knocking. The frequent delivery people now just ignore the Ring bell and knock. I like the camera to verify an expected or overdue package wasn't pirated, or to see how long my food was sitting out. But there's lots of video snips from cars driving by I need to get skip through, so it's not pleasant. I thought I'd leave the camera video up on an Echo to hopefully catch when people come up. But the power from the doorbell transformer is not enough to leave the camera on for extended periods. It acts more like a trickle charger, even though I have a large transformer that will support 3 bells/speakers. After 10-20 minutes the camera shuts off with a warning about the battery is going dead. Then I can't see the camera for a day while the battery charges. During the winter it takes a few days for the battery to charge back to full strength. When the video is not streamed for long periods, the battery still holds up. Even after nearly 3 years of summer heat waves and freezing winters here in eastern PA. I see the charge level dips a bit now and then where it used to be steadily 'full', so it may need a replacement in the next year. 3-4 years is expected, so no all good there. The app is good, I like it. The backyard camera works as expected, no issues there. The Ring alarm system works well, no false alarms from equipment, the monitoring station calls a minute or so when I set it off by accident. I like every other Ring product, if they could just fix the motion detection on the doorbell I’d be super happy. Reading reviews on the newer models does not make me optimistic that the issues have been addressed. After seeing reviews about this for three years, it seems like it may never be fixed. I'd try another brand, but I'm already heavily invested into a Ring home alarm and other cameras in the yard. I don't want yet another paid subscription to deal with. I guess when I move, I'll hope to find a house with a front door that does not face the street if they can't figure this out before then or try other brands within the 30 day return window Amazon has.","Way too sensitive on what goes on 30' away, button not sensitive enough"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,22-May-19,Retired 5th Grade Teacher,"This doorbell was hardwired and installed at Christmas. It gives me many false positives and also doesn’t pick up motion when someone moves quickly, like Amazon delivery persons.  Ring support was great!  They helped me with the adjustments.  I had to get wedge kits, but I think I’ll still pick up false motion because I get a lot of passing sunlight/clouds that cause the heat sensor to go off. It doesn’t happen at night or evenings. I may need the upgraded Ring that doesn’t use heat sensors.  It does give clear pictures!  I’m sorry I didn’t get the Ring 2 now, but I do like the security. (This is an updated review after I talked to support, Danielle,  at RING) Update:  it’s been almost a year. We’ve added the additional part that RING sent us, but had to remove it because it then angled the camera too much to the side. We hardly use it. I’ve turned off the sound because it goes off constantly. I do use it to check the History of motion sometimes. It could be just the way my front porch picks up shadows, but I think I’ll need to pay someone to just replace it being that I’m a senior citizen and I can’t do it.",Still giving false motion Not happy!

I then purchased this model for my daughter’s house, but Ring coil not locate her WiFi signal.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Aug-17,H. R. Morton,"Update: After several problems with my three original Ring Video Doorbells. Ring customer service replaced them with two Ring Video Doorbell 2's and a Ring Spotlight Cam (Wired). After two weeks of use I can say there is a lot of improvement. The Spotlight Cam is great. I have no problems with it what so ever. However, there was a couple of issues with the Ring Doorbell 2. I was able to resolve them. For some reason my Google WiFi would lose connection to the doorbells just like with the original doorbells, only this time the doorbells showed connected in the ring app. Google WiFi just showed ""No Data"" for the doorbells. I tried the chime pro again, which was awful the connections speeds were bad for both and just wasn't a good solution. What I finally did to make it work was pull my old 2.4 GHz WiFi router out of the closet. I set up the router as an AP by turning off DHCP, and connecting the router from a switch connected to one of my Google WiFi Hubs and a LAN port on the router (Not the WAN). I gave the network a different SSID and password and connected my doorbells to this AP (Ring products do not have to be on the same SSID or the same WiFi, the app takes care of that). Since I done this there are no connection issues at all with the doorbells. I tried this same setup with the original Ring doorbells, but it still had issues. So I finally have doorbells that work. Update: I was once again contacted by a Ring neighborhood advocate. We are currently working to resolve my issues. They have taken steps in the right direction, but we are not there yet. I’ve been promised a resolution by the end of next week regarding the issues with my Doorbell’s. I’ve had the ring doorbell installed since late April, and have issues all the time. I’ve have 3 Ring Doorbells and a stick up cam installed. I have had nothing but trouble with all of them. They lose connection to the network constantly even though the router (mesh) is only a few feet away from the doorbell. Live view barely ever works. I have missed several rings where the data isn’t being sent to my devices. Recordings are black so if someone was at my door trying to get in I would have no record of it. If it wasn’t past my 30 days I’d return this Setup go with regular doorbells and cameras.",Doorbell 2 & Spotlight Cam is better
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Jan-19,Emily,"I read reviews on here about the Ring and really didn’t know if I wanted it because a lot of people complained about it. So I’m now giving my two cents for those of you who might be experiencing the same thing. PROS: it’s inexpensive for peace of mind at home and away. People complained that you have to pay to save your videos but it’s only $3 a month which is an extremely small amount of money considering what you would pay for other security subscriptions. The sound is pretty good on it, I can hear things on the street in front of my house. Most of my pros are what you might expect - it does it’s job and offers me peace of mind when I’m at work. I see packages delivered, who comes to my door, and sometimes I’ll watch the live feed just to see what my street is up to. CONS: sometimes I’ll hear something outside my house or get a motion alert and I’ll hurry up and open the Ring app to view it but it takes forever bringing up the video feed. After months of use, it’s still one of my least favorite things. It’s also got a movement delay even though the sensitivity is all the way up. We will catch the mailman walking away from the porch but not to it. Finally, I hate having to take it down to charge it but that’s what happens when you buy the earlier version because you want to save money. All in all: I couldn’t live without my Ring. It was $99 well spent and I don’t regret it. I also want to add that I had to get two plastic pieces for mine that are sold separately, to mount mine at an angle. Just be prepared that it might need to be mounted at an angle at your house too. Also, don’t try to put it inside of a storm door thinking that will keep it from being stolen - it reads heat signature which it can’t detect from behind glass. It’ll have to be mounted outside outside. I’ve been told that if a thief does steal it, you just need to provide a police report to Ring and they’ll replace it free of charge.",I was skeptical
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jul-17,tomb523,"I've had my ring 1 week now while I worked from home so I could do a solid evaluation.  Bottom line, inconsistent motion detection.  Just for example, I had two packages delivered today, both left within a foot of the doorbell and neither delivery men were detected, yet when the garbage truck drove by on the street (30 feet away and out side my ""detection zone') it recorded that!  It doesn't detect the mailman - most of the time, nor neighbors cars as they drive by - most of the time (my range is set to about 15'), but it did detect a gecko climbing on the brick next to the door bell. In short, its simply unreliable, especially for the cost.  Great concept, poorly executed! Edit:  Within a day after posting this review, Ring contacted me asking if I would give them an opportunity to make my purchase right.  I agreed and a call was set up for the next day I was home in order to troubleshoot.  I was assigned a neighborhood advocate or something like that and over the phone we attempted a few fixes.  By the end of this, she had expedited an order for me that included a Ring 2 doorbell, a wifi extender chime and a wedge kit. It was a week later that I had the chance to install the new device and begin testing it.  At first, disappointment did not abate as response was very slow.  I tried several configurations with and without the wifi extender (my router is very close to my front door) and I also used the 5 degree down wedge to reduce alerts from cars on the road.  Of greatest disappointment was there was no two way communication between my phone and the doorbell.  I was gone again the following week and while I did get alerts, there was rarely anything there.  On Tuesday, my landscaper arrived to do some work and it picked up the motion, but still no sound.  Then the very next day there was suddenly sound.  Wasn't sure it was two way, but at least i could hear and it recorded sound from the doorbell. I returned home on Thursday night and tested the sound and there was two way communication.  I had left with the wifi extender not in the mix, but on Friday I decided to try again with the extender.  I was able easily to reconfigure the setup and to my delight I still had two way communication.  I have tested it throughout the weekend and it seems to be working fine.  I even had a delivery Friday that was picked up by the doorbell.  With the Ring 2, the video quality is much better than the Ring. I will say that Ring did make a strong effort to correct the issue.  I have upgraded my rating from two stars to 4, primarily due to their customer service effort.  The doorbell is working now although I'm not sure why two way communication suddenly began to work - perhaps a firmware update?  I can't say I have total confidence in the device, but will continue to monitor and when I do, I will update this review.",Edited & Improved: Motion detection is inconsistent (thus unreliable).

My attempts to get adequate technical support have proven a failure as the people on their tech sites have, to date, only been able to walk me through the simple setup procedure - they are not technical orientated. That said I would say that this is a non-real time system and its dependency on the provided cell phone software and the internet dependency makes this unit a poor choice as a reliable doorbell system.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Dec-18,Ben Jammin,"There are many pros compared to cons with this device. Many of the pros for this device are from the simple use in insulation, to the ability to see in darkness in the clarity. I bought this device for a very good friend of mine who has helped our family for the past few years. they needed something that was almost like a security device, but something that had the convenience of a normal doorbell. This product worked as all. With easy-to-use app, and the availability of having a motion detector upon it oh, this was the perfect unit. Many of the pros consist of quality of picture, the ability to intensify the sensitivity of the motion detector, the distance you can actually see in the daylight and at night time, in the easy lie manageable assembly of the products to your wall. the battery life on the device last for a while, but depending on the sensitivity that you put on the device in your settings will determine how long the battery charge stays. We would have the device on a very sensitive setting so the battery would not last as long as what we would expect. but it was simple to find out when the battery need to be charged through the app. when the battery would get down to 20 in below percent, we would bring it inside and charge it on our lightning charger. It was very easy and convenient to have the app let us know the level of the battery. It was nice that has a motion sensor on it and to be able to capture the photos of anything or anyone that passed by licking her bro. The picture quality was very good, even when he zoomed in to a far distance. We were able to see across the street, almost being able to make out license plates at over 75+ yards. I would recommend this product to anyone that either owns a home or even rents.  It's quick, easy, and is easy to take with you if you move.",Security and sensibility all in one
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Nov-18,veronica santos,"I purchased this doorbell because I don’t live in the best of areas and from our front door there’s no way you can see who is at the door without opening the door to see. I decided to get this for a more security feeling. The box came really nice almost like an iPhone, it had easy instructions on installation and came with all the tools. It was a little tricky to install we had to drill pretty big holes into the bricks of the house but I guess that’s what we gotta do to put it up. So the camera quality isn’t the best but it’s not the worst. It’s almsot like when you’re watching a 440 quality YouTube video and it’s all pixalated and hard to see that’s what the camera reminds me off but it gets the job done. A few of the cons for me is that the battery doesn’t last that long I have to charge the doorbell at least once a week maybe two max I thought I read online somewhere that the battery is supposed to last six months. I live in front of a busy street I’ve tried multiple times to adjust the zones for the doorbell not to detect cars I’ve literally set it to like five feet even though I would like to see if someone is in the yard as well it still catches almsot every. Single. Car. My phone is constantly going off and I check back the video it was just a car. That may be the reason for the battery being drained. My other con with the doorbell is that it stops recording even if there is still motion at the front door. The videos that are recorded are about 20/30 seconds long and even if someone is in the front yard or standing by the front door it’ll stop recording and that frustrates me so much because one day if something sketchy does happen I won’t have video proof because the doorbell only records for like 20 seconds.  I do like the app I like how I can see crimes that happened in my area and people share videos of suspicious activity around their house which is really neat. The app has a lot of features and sometimes the camera takes a long time to load when I want to look outside but it’s just an average doorbell. It does what it says it’s going to do and I’m still going to keep it and use it.","Pretty good, a few kinks"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Sep-17,Patrick,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. For 1080p the quality is not great but could capture decent detail up close. My biggest gripe with this device is that it will pick up a moving car at 80' away (outside of its detection zone) but does not always recognize when someone is right in front of the camera. You say, ""Why don't you adjust the motion sensor settings?"" I have. If you lower them to not detect a car at that range you subsequently lower the detection to 0 for human detection less than 5' from the camera as well. The worst part about the Ring system is that after 30 seconds of recording a motion detection, if the user doesn't answer the call, the video is automatically shut off (even if you pay the semi-mandatory subscription fee). I believe Ring is trying to save storage/server space and cut corners. I have been told by Ring support and the CEO (probably an intern) that this bug will be fixed and updated and that it's purpose is to save the battery life of my camera. However, you can recharge the battery at your convenience and in my case hardwire it to an existing doorbell wire... (Sorry Ring that just doesn't add up). I've attached a video of a delivery driver rolling up and getting out to put my package on the front porch but the camera shuts the video down because I didn't answer the notification. Had this been someone in a car rolling up to steal said package, well if they walked slow enough to front door the package would be gone with no evidence, let alone if they were walking on the street the camera wouldn't have detected their car nor would it detect them walking up to the porch..

So I installed with a fully charged battery when I got it, but via hard wiring too, and a few weeks later it stopped working. DEAD. Lots of research to find out that it works off of the battery, and hard wiring is only to charge the battery! It had died because it was 20 degrees out, and lithium can't take cold temperatures. At all.  So in that freezing windy weather, I had to get out the special screwdriver, get up underneath, remove/charge/reinstall battery and not drop that tiny little screw. UNREAL for an old lady like me! Today, a month later, that fully recharged battery went dead again (it's 56 degrees today). If I had known, I'd have gotten the hard-wire-only type and saved $100! Also, no matter how much I adjust it, motion recordings are constant for things unseen (ghost farts?), but it ignores people half the time. If someone comes to the door and it notifies me, the upload to the phone takes about one minute, and by then they leave. It does record package delivery events, which is the only advantage so far. It also acts as an expensive scarecrow, but if criminals knew how unreliable it is, they'd forge ahead. If you have doorbell wires, just get the cheaper one.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Jun-19,Edward J. Spriggs,"Pro: It's a wireless doorbell, powered by a rechargeable battery. If you need that, it is effective. (If your doorbell wiring is connected, you can hook it into that, and not have to charge it, but if your doorbell wiring is connected... why are you buying a doorbell?) Pro: I got the Venetian bronze one, and it looks pretty slick. Pro: It was easy to install (every tool is included, except that you use your own drill). Con: The app (without which it is useless) apparently tries to make customers scared enough of their neighborhood to spend more money on security products. I expected that, because it's 2019, and ""distort reality to make sales"" is just how apps work now, but this was really on another level. There's no verification of people's reports of crimes, so there ends up being a notification on my phone every time a racist sees a black person, a teenager feels like a prank, etc. I turned this off. Con: The function where the unit detects motion offers extremely coarse-grained control with a bizarre user interface, and I was unable to find any settings where it was useful. Not only do I get notifications for passing cars even after adjusting it to prevent this, but motion wakes it up so slowly that many times I seem to be getting notifications for nothing at all. There is no way to store video clips from detected motion except their $3/mo cloud service, so in addition to all that, I'm paying for the privilege of having my comings and goings at my own house documented on someone else's computer. I turned this off, too. (Special note in case any Ring developers read this review: just show me a picture taken by the device, and have me paint a mask on it to separate the porch/not-porch parts.) Con: The claimed battery life is VERY optimistic. Possible con: You pretty much have to get a Chime to go with it... If I have my phone with me, my guests can already call me to get my attention. I anticipated this and also bought a Chime, and so for me personally it's fine, but it's something to bear in mind.",Kind of a mixed bag

The next time the tech support was poor, and time consuming...an hour to tell me that I needed to remove the app and download it after the doorbell was charged. The tech took forever to look up how to answer the need. Turned out it was actually the Ring computer system that was the problem, not the doorbell. Fixed that issue by hardwiring it in. I suggest that you not use battery unless absolutely necessary. Has to be charged frequently, and I even replaced the battery just in case the one it came with had been ""on the shelf"" too long.  It is very sensitive to motion, which is good...almost too sensitive, not matter how I set the sensitivity and the area being scanned. I added a wedge attachment so I could see more due to how it had to be installed. It is very slow to load when I get an alarm for motion, or the doorbell rings. Whoever is at the door, usually walks away before I can answer remotely. Now for the good features...it does let me know if anyone or any cat is walking through my yard at night. I need to add another motion detection light to the front of the house because the night vision (B&W) isn't very clear until the 'intruder' triggers my motion light. I like the feature where people share what's happening in their area, and the reports that come from the city about issues identified by police and/or fire depts.

Zampino,"I've enjoyed using the features this doorbell provides above a traditional doorbell. However, there were some challenges installing it, and some challenges remain for me. Even this model is MUCH wider than a traditional doorbell, so it does NOT fit on the door frame where our existing doorbell was. I've had to leave the original doorbell in place to avoid having to patch the holes. There is brick adjacent to our door frame, into which I had to drill holes to mount this Ring doorbell. The masonary bit included with the installation kit is TERRIBLE. It took me 4 hours to complete drilling the holes, and I needed to go out and get another masonary bit to finish. Due to the difficulty of drilling through the brick, I've not yet hard-wired power to the Ring doorbell. It's a bit of a pain to have to recharge the battery periodically, but it is nice to have the battery option in my case. Similarly, the difficulty of drilling through the brick has prevented me from wiring the Ring doorbell to the existing chime, so we are currently depending solely on device notifications.","Good product, potential installation challenges"

It arrives in stylish packaging (typical by today's standards, thanks Apple). The instructions are very easy to follow and they supply a multi-function tool to attach the doorbell to your exterior. It works fairly well, however mine is a bit of a lemon that still has not been resolved by Ring. I attached my doorbell hardwired, meaning I attached the preexisting wires to my new doorbell. All functioned well for a couple days and then I noticed that the button on the doorbell was no longer illuminated. I called support to find out why, and the customer service rep either didn't know how the doorbell functioned or just couldn't explain it well, but stated that my button would not be lit. Even though I stated that I had hardwired my doorbell. I asked why would they design a doorbell that doesn't light up? It was a confusing back and forth. Note:  If you hardwire the doorbell, the button stays lit. If you only use the built-in battery the button does not illuminate to save charge and you have to recharge the battery manually. Hardwiring will trickle charge your battery since the electricity is low voltage. If you hardwire and the button is not lit, there is a problem because the hardwire is not charging the battery.  I called back the next day, speaking to a different associate and they realized that there was a problem because my doorbell was hardwired and NOT lit. So they updated the firmware. It worked. The button lit up and my app said ""power source: Hardwired."" A couple days later NO LIGHT and my app said ""power source: Battery."" The unit had, for some reason switched to battery source only.  Four associates later, it still is not working. One associate sent me a new backplate thinking that would solve the problem. It worked for about 5 days. Another associate suggested that I attach my doorbell to a piece of wood to act as a flat surface since my doorbell is mounted on (flat) concrete block. I did as instructed and cut a plate from exterior grade 3/4"" thick FLAT board, mounted it to the concrete block feeding the wires through a cutout and attached the doorbell to that. Had to call again to have them help with resetting the doorbell to recognize the hardwire. That lasted 24 hours and then the doorbell went back to battery as it's sole power source. I called again and now they are sending another part to mount the doorbell to. They think that the front part of the unit is not flat against the back plate. If so, it is because this unit is faulty, not fault in my mounting. This has been a so frustrating. Although the customer service reps are very nice. They are, in the end not very helpful. They each send a followup email stating that if I need assistance again,  email them. However it has always turned out that the doorbell stops working properly on their days off, so I call again to speak with someone else.  I work in the construction industry and some electricians I was recently working with said they had also had problems with RING and they recommend NEST doorbell by Google.",Perpetual Problem
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,28-May-16,Glen C.,"It was supposed to just replace my old bell button and work with my existing doorbell. Sure, there were setup videos, and even a snarky statement during wifi setup that ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" but nonetheless it wasn't super clear what setup to use with my mechanical doorbell and what they suggested still doesn't work. My mechanical doorbell buzzed non-stop trying to go ""the mechanical route"" so I went the with diode setup. Things seemed okay initially (it stopped the buzzing), but the transformer eventually fried and, over time, the battery of the ring doorbell as well. This resulted in some embarrassing / frustrating misses of a service call, a food delivery, and having our babysitter standing there for 10 minutes while we started to fret our appointment having no idea ever that the doorbell just wasn't working. Ok, color me an early adopter to smart home setup, I guess that's par for the course with a ""smart"" wifi based device, but given the following facts I don't think it's worth the risk to give Ring your $$. - Ring relies on your wifi, if there are issues with connectivity, it doesn't work - Ring relies on their cloud service for seeing activity of missed calls, you have to pay $$ to see activity you miss by subscribing to their cloud service after 30 days of ""free"" usage - Ring (at least my generation) didn't let you spontaneously view the camera or listen to the outside, this was later ""fixed"" with app updates - There is a pretty substantial time lag between events and when you are notified - The bell itself rings loudly giving the impression that something is happening, this is also audible by your neighbors, ok fine, but when you don't hear anything in the house, and your guest thinks they're being heard they will patiently wait and wonder before calling you. We purchased the chime extender because we couldn't rely on the door-bell, and while it's cool that it notifies you when there is motion, it's not the best wifi device and frequently loses connection. One sucky tidbit there is that the chime doesn't come with the advertised international adapters it says it does..we wen't through several returns before we realized that ring is basically not giving those away with the device. In short, when someone is at the door, you pretty much want to know instantly, and if there is activity going on outside you want the option to use the camera you purchased without waiting for it to trigger motion or call you, and if stuff did happen, they basically hold your footage hostage in a monthly cost model. Ring has taught me that the smart home market is basically flooded with not-so-great products. Just because they were new to market or offer wifi doesn't mean it's a great idea. In my case I basically spent a lot of money to break something already pretty reliably and be consistently annoyed by it's lack of quality and service.","Have you ever had a doorbell not work?

Ok...but first....the good: -The packaging was excellent, and the device came with EVERYTHING you need to install the Ring. -Installation was so easy, and there was even very good installation instructions, as well as videos in the app. -Very easy to set up the Ring with the Ring App.  Couldn't have been any easier! The bad: -You get a video only of the subject leaving.  I tested the device for motion, and I even simulated stealing and Amazon package from my front door.

I had one when I lived with my ex boyfriend and we both loved it. I think I loved and used it more. So when we split up and I moved out, I bought myself one. I really love it. I feel more in control of the situation that awaits outside my door. If it weren’t for this. I’d be worried to open my door. I don’t even have a peephole. This is perfect! I made sure to add a sticker letting my neighbors knows they are being recorded to freak them out and deter them from possible criminal activity, at least anywhere near my front door! They might think I’m wired but they should be stupid enough to try anything at least while my camera is still on the wall. I do wish the camera was more concrete. Permanent. Not so easy to remove.... shame on you ‘ring’ for making this camera easy to remove. I have to remove it and charge it? It’s easy for me, why shouldn’t it be easy for a criminal. If I were going to rob someone or any kind of criminal behavior at someone’s residence, I would remove this camera first. It’s easy to do. I wish you would make it permanent.

Overall I am happy I made the purchase because it is nice to be able to check in on my home when I am away. The picture is clear, and the battery lasts several weeks. I plan to hardwire it in but for now the battery works well. Night vision is clear, and the motion detector works for the most part. Now the cons.... I have VERY fast internet, and the latest iphone, but for some reason the video takes FOREVER TO LOAD! Whats frustrating is I will get a notification that someone is at the door, and it takes 2 to 3 minutes to load the video. Which doesn't sound like long, but when someone is at the door while i'm away, its infuriating not being able to see whos there and speak with them. I purchased this primarily for home security, and it doesn't work if the video takes too long to come up. Basically someone has enough time to break into your home before this stupid thing loads the video. Also the motion detection needs to be improved. Several times its recorded a car driving down the street, but not somebody walking up to my front door. Again SUPER FRUSTRATING. Great idea, still a nice tool, but some serious upgrades are needed.",Remarkably average.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Nov-19,LSetty86,"We were so excited to finally purchase this doorbell and for the most part have liked it. A MAJOR fact that we overlooked, however, is that we didn’t realize the doorbell (even when connected to the existing house wiring) won’t actually ring INSIDE the house. So the only way to “hear” the doorbell is if you are sitting next to your phone 24/7 waiting for the alarm to ring on it. You can also purchase for an alarming $30 a small “chime” that connects to the Ring doorbell via WiFi which plugs into an outlet. This was frustrating to learn since we weren’t prepared to spend even more on accessories to make this actually functional for a home. That being said, I do like the video quality on this bad boy and love being able to talk to whomever is at the door. I would only recommend this product if you’re also able to afford the chimes to put throughout your home otherwise it’s fairly useless as a doorbell and more useful as a camera. Update: After having this for a few weeks, I decided to adjust my 3 stars to two stars. I didn’t realize as well as having to purchase extra equipment in order to hear the doorbell throughout the house you also have to purchase a monthly subscription if you want to use the camera function- it will live stream but if you want to play back any motion you’re out of luck unless you want to pay $10/month for this. So if I happen to be away from my phone and there is motion detected (say a burglar trying to get in to my door) and I don’t happen to see it occurring at that very precise moment.... I canny rewind to see a face or anything of the sort. It kind of defeats the purpose of buying this for extra security. I wouldn’t buy this if I had known all of the extra costs associated with actually having a functioning system. You get a “free” trial for the 24/7 monitoring option but mine recently expired, I guess, so I discovered this little hiccup.",not Worth it.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Feb-18,007 Rancher,"I loved the idea, and how it worked for the first few days.  After that, and guidance from technical support that doesnt solve the issues, it is not much more than a pretty doorbell.  My issues are the following: 90% of the time I get a notification stating there is motion at my door it will not allow me to see what is going on.  After going into the app and clicking on the link for that motion detected, no video is displayed.  I have played with the sensor range and have not found a good position.  If I put it all the way out it picks up the cars on the street.  If I bring it in any less that the 30ft range, it doesnt pick motion up until someone actually rings the doorbell.  Finally when it does pick up a video it starts recording too early and ends too soon.  The UPS man will drive into my circular gravel drive and it will start recording before you can see the truck (just hear tires on gravel.)  The video stops recording before he gets out of the truck with the package.  This is extremely frustrating because part of the reason I got this was to catch my mailman on video pulling into the drive and literally throwing my packages on my porch without getting out of the truck.  Doesnt work that way if the video stops as soon as the vehicle stops moving.  Great concept, and it appears to work for many people, just not me.",I loved the idea
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jun-20,James,"Wanted to add some extra security to my home and looked at all sorts of security systems. Finally settled on just buying a ring doorbell and it was a great choice. It was super easy to setup, looks great on my home, and has great video quality even at 720p. The motion detection can be a little bit confusing to setup alerts for at first but I would recommend making sure the motion detection range is as far out as possible without being in the road and then set the alerts to people only. Then the doorbell will still record all motion events for you to watch at anytime but will only send alerts about people to your phone. There is some confusion I’ve seen that people say you have to pay a monthly fee to see motion alerts. It is not true. There is an option to pay to be able to save motion alert videos. But they are available for you to look through everyday for free. Live feed works great and sound quality is good. I have used it to say hi to my girlfriend when she gets home and I am still at work. Great product for a really good price. IMPORTANT UPDATE: It turns out that I was wrong about having to pay to see video. The ring device comes with a free trial of a paid subscription. Once the trial is over you can only look at live feed video from your doorbell. I will say I still think it’s affordable as I bought a year plan and it covers my doorbell if it’s stolen. Still I’m lowering my rating from 5 to 4 stars because I think it should be disclaimed somewhere very boldly that this device needs a paid subscription to be used fully. You can almost call it a micro transaction or a kind of gotcha. But if you don’t mind paying a couple dollars a month for security like me, then this doorbell is still for you.",Amazing and affordable

Yes, I’m a little paranoid so I don’t like the idea of having recording devices all over my house. Especially ones connected by wifi and therefore inherently vulnerable to hacking. However I caved and we bought one on cyber Monday. I admit...I Love it. lol My doorway is turned to the side from the street and has an approximately 6 foot ramp to the door. We placed the doorbell positioned to “look” down the ramp from the sidewall of our enclave. This thing detects motion from the street (approx 12 feet away) on its most sensitive setting. We have no problem with delay because it’s a long walk to the door, it catches everything. The cons...it needs to be charged eventually (if not hardwired), but there is no way to stop it from recording. That bothers me. I should be able to “disable” it during charging. We purchased a silicone skin to protect it during heavy rain and it has an added bonus of making it look like a cheap knock off doorbell. Lol!

Our unit was installed where there was no previous doorbell so we need to use the battery function but I thought I had read somewhere they claim the battery can last up to almost a year. Hardly gets used in the 7 months we've had it other than me testing it here and there I believe it's been used 3 times so there's no reason for the battery to get exhausted so soon. The other issue with it is the volume the people ringing the bell cannot hear us very good from either one of the phones we have connected to it. We also have a tough time hearing them as well.

We decided to try Ring out and I am really pleased we did. Let me start by saying we did not have an existing wired doorbell and decided to go with the battery option. Installation was very easy, it took about twenty minutes after charging to download app, install the device and connect to alexa. We have three large breed dogs that play in the yard, and it is nice to be able to watch them until they are ready to come in for their safety. I enjoy the live view option so we can do this. The battery drains faster with using live, however, we feel it is well worth it as it is easy to charge. Just unscrew, bring in and connect the USB cable to a plug. With visitors. I enjoy that I can grab my phone no matter where I am, see who is there and even speak to them! The night vision is nice, as we do have visitors in the evening and the dogs play at night as well. I was impressed due to having one thought of what night vision would look like on it. If you live in an area that gets cold, be aware that the battery drains a bit faster during very cold days. Also, the app sometimes takes some work with push notifications. I have restarted my phone a few times to get it to push notifications. The bell is nice and loud with push notifications. I have even found my phone when lost in the house using the doorbell. We did pay 30 dollars for an annual cloud backup and decided we may go with monitoring at a later date. I will definitely update if there is anything to add. For now, I believe overall this is a very good device to have and will probably be upgrading to a newer Ring later this year.",Sense of Security and Fun!

The app is a little slow to open, but overall it and the Doorbell do what they says they will. I also ran into an issue this past winter where it ran out of power and I never got a notification about it.  Ring never did have a great answer for why that was.  We got this one as a Black Friday discount; I'd say definitely shop around and see what else is also out there before deciding on Ring.  I don't think you'll go wrong with Ring, but I wonder if other competitors have better products. UPDATE 11/06/2019:  A Ring representative reached out to me after my initial review and helped troubleshoot the issue.  He was kind enough to send out a set of the angled wedges on the hypothesis that the direct angle facing the street was resulting in 'false alarms'. The Ring-brand wedges were kind of tough to work with; I broke the heads off of three of the screws trying to install a couple of them, resulting in only being able to get one fully installed.  This was with my drill-driver at low torque; I can appreciate the slimness of the screws so that you're not drilling huge holes in things, but they're really not made for strength. In getting everything set-up, I noticed again that my Ring had low battery, and again I wasn't alerted via the app or email about this, as I've got enabled in the settings.  This is particularly frustrating, as the unit's supposed to last on the order of months without needing charging, but without manually checking every so often I don't feel like I'll get a reliable notice that it's time to charge it up. However, all of that aside, it does appear that we're getting less false alarms with the wedge installed.  It's not a huge angle, either, but apparently just enough that we're not getting notices that someone's at our front door when it's just a car driving by.  We're about 15-20 feet from the road, with a single step in front of our small porch, and I've got the settings in the app as restrictive as I can make them. Also, installing the Rapid Ring app has helped with receiving notices.  It's a lot faster to alert me than the full-sized app (which I've also still got installed for full functionality); it brings up the Live View a little slower than I'd expect, I'm using a OnePlus 3, which isn't the newest phone on the block but shouldn't lag terribly.  If I needed to talk to someone on the other end of the doorbell, tho, it'd only take a few seconds to bring that up so it's not the world's biggest issue. Overall, I'm adding a star to my review because of Ring's customer service and the improved situation described above.  It's not perfect, but certainly better than it was.","UPDATE 11/06/2019: Improved with help, but still on the fence......."

So I spent a while trying to get it to connect to my WiFi until I decided it probably needed charging. Then it worked. I liked the little toolkit it came with (the level is great), but the drill bit is very cheap and dull, it worked on the two holes I could put in the mortar, but took me 2 days to drill into the brick!

I'm sure we'll see other interesting things on our Ring videos, hopefully all good. I wired the Ring to our conventional doorbell circuit and the battery has maintained a 100% charge, even with frequent use of the live view feature.  Other reviews have mentioned the surprising coverage area of the lens.  As can be seen in the photos, Ring captures our entire porch, most of the front yard and the three houses across the street, day and night. My only concern was how to mount it beside the door, as the wood trim wasn't flat and not quite wide enough.  I mounted the base on the wood trim, extending onto the vinyl siding. Then I carefully filled the gaps behind the base with a bead of adhesive caulk to make for a more solid, attractive installation, (pictured).  If you do that, just be careful not to slop any caulk over the edge of the base and onto the front surface where it mates with the Ring housing and electric contacts have to be made.  We’re happy with the functionality of our Ring, so plan on paying the $30 yearly subscription to save and store the videos. Ring provides quite a bit of security at a reasonable price and was dirt simple to install and set up.",Happy with our Ring

Perry,"We absolutely love this ring doorbell. The quality of the images is outstanding. We put this in where existing wired doorbell was, I suggest doing that otherwise you will have to remove the doorbell every month or so And charge it up overnight. I didn’t realize that would be an issue but fortunately if you have an existing doorbell that is wired you have power that you can connect to the Ring and it keeps it charged all the time. We also signed up for the cloud service so we have a couple days worth of video saved at all times in case we need it and charge it up overnight.

Eventually the picture quality went out. When I reached out to their technical service they told me sorry it’s out of warranty here is a coupon go buy a new one. I explained that I wasn’t going to purchase their product again because from the start it wasn’t great. Finally they sent me a different doorbell and it works for a month or so then I changed the WIFI password and now I can’t get it set up. They send me an email telling me to delete the device and set it up again. I try that it doesn’t work. When I did that it deleted all the videos and one of them I needed to keep. I reach out to customer service and they tell me sorry you delete the device you cannot look at the videos. Then I ask why am I paying monthly for you to store the videos if you can’t look them up. Anyways long story short their customer service is terrible. I will never recommend Ring to anyone.,Worst Customer Service Ever
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Jul-18,Me,"I think this is a good product. Since Amazon owns ring doorbell it very likely there will be changes especially since Amazon has come out with their own camera and cloud storage service that is really in a direct competition with the ring doorbell/camera. The Lifecycle of this product is probably just a few years. Even if the unit hold up that long it likely to be overtaken by better cloud service or newer design features. In the meanwhile, at $99 it the least expensive way I found to get in the camera/doorbell experience. Once you have it you will likely never want to give it up.  Why Amazon is selling this unit at a $ 99.00. One thing to note is be sure you activate the camera before you mount and test out your mount location. It is likely the location of your existing doorbell may not be the best location.  If you do not mind the unit sticking out some you can buy an adapter that puts about a 40% angle, however this was still not enough to make a difference in my application. I ended up moving my doorbell location to consider getting the entire area of my front entry area, (see pictures). Also, think about trees or shrubs that may move with a wind blowing as this will set off motion and you want to minimize this as much as possible.  On the battery models you don’t need to hook up to power. In my opinion that the life of this battery units will be worse if you do hook up to doorbell power. The unit does not use the power directly, just to do a trickle charge on the existing battery. Voltage and amperage is key and even being off a little will cause battery failures, if you do want to hook to power you can buy a transformer made just for rings for around $20.00. Of course, if you’re like me you down want wires to show meaning you must drill through walls etc., thus my decision to go with a battery model. No issue with motion detection or just picking up the end of the event as some have reported. I run current high-speed cable modem and router. The software is good and likely has been improved and updated over time. Motion adjustment software is better then the NEST outdoor camera system for my home.  I still have some bushes in the peripheral view of the camera that would move with the wind at times and give false motion. The software allowed me to cut this area of motion and any false alarms. The fee for cloud storage is $3 month which is lower the NEST at $5 per month on each unit. This is the only camera/doorbell that was compatible with WINK, which is the home automation hub I have standardized my home. Using this doorbell through an automation HUB opens a whole new level of function for the doorbell/camera in terms of, lights, heating, cooling, locking and programable actions that can be customized. I am also a ALEXA fan and it’s nice to be able bring up the doorbell camera on the Alexa screen.",Good Product. Check video before mounting!

I went on Amazon and bought one of the angle mounts (more money wasted), tho not because the mount isn't worth it. Hooked it all up, just to be so very disappointed. The video quality is horrible, and no it's not too far from my router. It doesn't record when packages are dropped off, but it does when the wind blows.

Even with all the motion sensor alerts turned off, this doorbell requires you remove it from the mount to recharge it almost every two weeks.  This is really annoying. Second, I had a package stolen from my front porch because I had charged the doorbell and was confident I would get the alert on my phone when the delivery person arrived with a package today.  But apparently, the app, logged me out and did not notify me of that so no doorbell notice came to my phone when the delivery person rang it.  Because I didn't know it was there, the package sat out front for too long and someone stole it.  I purchased this doorbell specifically so I would get immediate notice when I had a delivery because I live in a city where package theft is very common.  It gave a false sense of assurance that this product did not meet. I would never recommend someone buy a Ring Doorbell.  You'd be better served with just a remote doorbell that takes watch batteries and sounds a receiver that plugs into your houses outlet in whatever room you want.

I like it so much I bought a couple more as gifts.  Two minor drawbacks, though: 1: Even though I hooked it up to my previous doorbell wiring so I could use direct power and not have to charge the battery, it will not receive power from the house wiring.  I switched the wires (although the directions say it doesn't matter which wire is which) and it still won't operate from house power.  Additionally, hard wiring this unit deactivates your regular house doorbell.  I had an electrician come out for another project and had him look at it and he couldn't figure it out either. 2:  The first time I removed one of the two retaining screws which hold the battery in place, the entire sleeve came out of the unit.  One screw still holds the battery securely but the sleeve must not have been secured correctly from the factory.

We live in a rural area and it's nice to know that whether I'm home or not, my home is better protected. Clear picture, easy setup. Batteries last decently (I would suggest getting back ups if you watch them a lot or if you live in a busy area). Batteries take about 5-6 hours to charge but once they're charged, they last forever. We've had them running for almost two weeks and they still have almost full batteries. Do still get some false alarms from time to time (wind blowing the trees causing a lot of motion/animals in the neighborhood set it off, etc.) While these are awesome and weather resistant, weather can and will still affect it (to some degree). Rain can sometimes be an issue (water droplets on the screen which will need to be wiped/cleaned off) and at night, we had an issue sometimes with our camera fogging over. Simple fix: Go get de-fogger for glasses (like reading glasses). Follow the instructions and you shouldn't have an issue with fog on the camera anymore. We did that and haven't had an issue since. Super fast shipping and a pretty decent price for the peace of mind that we now have adding this to our camera collection.

They lag when answering a doorbell.. that's if it even notifies me. It catches motion maybe 25% of the time. Mainly catches any motion that's not important.

An entire day of contractors coming and going in front of.... wait for it... not just one but two rings.... not a single recording.

Also missed the two other vehicles that were in the driveway within 10 feet of the camera leaving.  I have followed all directions, adjusted all the settings multiple times and nothing works.

The drill bit supplied by Ring is a ""weird"" size; 15/64"" is not a common concrete/masonary (sp?) bit.  Ring probably did this to match the plastic anchor, I'm just saying most hardware stores, (Lowe's, Home Depot, Harbor Freight) etc. don't carry an assortment of these bits in n/64"" sizes in the store.  I found the bit that was included in the Ring kit was not cutting into our brick after about the first 1/8"".  I purchased a Bosch 7/32"" Concrete Carbide drill bit.  (as I had seen someone post on Youtube.com.)  Part Number HCBG05T.  It's 1/64"" smaller than the Ring supplied bit I received.  The Bosch bit did pretty good but after the second hole was drilled it started losing its bite bad so I bought a second Bosch bit to finish the four holes.  I then followed the drilling up with the Ring supplied bit so the plastic anchors would fit properly.  Actually I forgot to do that with two of the holes and the anchors fit fine.

When it works. It needs a little more work to keep its connection to the WiFi network. It does not try to reconnect automatically when it fails and there is no way to reset it through the app without unmounting it each time, hitting the orange setup button and re-entering all your WiFi credentials over again! It was very easy to install and setup otherwise. Get a great wide viewport with sound. Motion and rings can be saved and reviewed after. Be aware though that this requires another cloud subscription of around $30 per year. They do not have an option to just save the video to your local WiFi network free of charge and without the cloud storage you can only answer calls in the moment and usually you only catch the back of the person walking away!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Sep-20,Corey,"Where do I begin.  I got this Ring video doorbell after we had some drunk / high stranger come to our front door around midnight one night.  Out of the box, the doorbell worked okay.  It took about a day and a half for the doorbell to sync up with my phone, even while it was on the same WiFi.  Ring has a WiFi download / upload speed tester on their app, and so I ran that test to see if my WiFi was the problem, which it was not (according to Ring's own app).  Finally, magically, the doorbell synced up with my phone and we were able to see live video footage as well as any recorded footage.  So I attached the Ring to the front of the house, near the door, and started getting bombarded with notifications.  I set the perimeter to the shortest possible distance so the thing would stop notifying me of every single car that drove by, yet it still notified me of everything.  It alerts you so much, that you actually stop caring to bother checking on if there is actually a threat at your front door or not. Here's the worst part.  After a one-month free trial of Ring's subscription service, you lose access to any pre-recorded videos and then you only have access to the live video footage as it occurs.  I'm also convinced that in order to get you to subscribe, Ring also completely dumbs down the connection between your phone and doorbell camera.  The thing literally became a $100 paperweight after the free trial of the subscription.  We would get notified someone was at our door, we would click the notification to jump right into the app, and the app would take FOREVER to connect to the doorbell, EVEN if we were in our home, on the same WiFi as the doorbell.  It got so ridiculous that my wife and I ran a test.  I went out the back of the house, walked around to the front, up to the Ring doorbell.  It took 15 seconds for the doorbell to notify my wife, I was at the door.  She then tried to connect to the doorbell's camera through her phone and it took 45 SECONDS of a spinning circle and ""connecting to camera"" until she was able to see me.  An entire minute had passed before she could see what was going on outside of the house.  This doesn't sound like much time, but I guarantee you it is plenty of time to react if you see there is a burglar at your door.  While we had access to the free-trial subscription, we were able to connect to our door within seconds from anywhere, even while out shopping. I understand that the subscription service is very inexpensive at $2 or $3 a month, but I was so annoyed at how manipulative this entire product and its service was, that I returned it.  I will not be bait and switched into paying a subscription fee.",So much to say

Motion selection area isn't very changeable.  And it takes a solid several seconds to pop to our phones so we can't see what happened if someone comes and goes without paying a monthly fee to look at old data.  Only if they stay there or took a while to break the door.  Our door is under an awning, so the ring aperture can't pick up what's going on beyond the landing due to the exposure - the camera doesn't pick up anything but bright wash-out whiteness behind the porch landing.  Almost useless unfortunately.  The motion device must be picking up street stuff anyway despite the camera device unable to see and the motion set to the lowest setting.  But we've already drilled holes in the door so it's staying.  Unless you can hard wire,, it has to be charged often due to the continual motion pickup.  Very disappointing but it's a new age so everybody has to have one to feel safe despite porch pirates still making off without us never seeing them due to the lag and bad camera.","Bad light sensing, too much motion detection"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Feb-16,ChrisR,"Update:  After having great customer support the first time we had an issue, we had another issue.  The Ring.com response was ""get a wifi extender"".  Given (a) it had worked fine in the same spot for 8 months, and (b) we already had one, it was a bad response from Ring. Perhaps their success has gone to their heads, but very disappointed in their response recently and do not recommend ring. Initial review: All in all, I am happy with the Ring doorbell.  It doesn't look bad, was pretty easy to install and is pretty functional.  Hopefully software upgrades can fix some of the cons.  The biggest con was that both the speaker and microphone stopped working after about 6 months.  However, Ring sent a replacement quickly and it is working again. All in all it works well and is functional.  When you need technical support it seems good, the person I spoke with was knowledgable, friendly, and was a native English speaker. Pros: 1. Pretty easy to install the hardware. 2. Easy to install the software and connect to your wifi network. Cons: 1. In my install it was a bit difficult to get the bell to snap into the mounting bracket.  I had to push it somewhat hard, but it did go in. 2. The biggest con is that you can't store the video locally and have to pay an annual fee to do so. 3. It would be nice if it did about 3-5 seconds of video prior to the motion detection starting.  This would be probably only possible on the hard wired version, but if it could keep a few seconds worth of pre-trigger frames buffered, it would be most useful so that you'd see the person coming into the frame.",No longer recommended.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Apr-19,Cassandra Ann,"The Ring Doorbell will let you see who’s at your door, even when you’re not at home. It works with your WiFi and smart phone to give you wireless video and two way communication with someone at your door. To successfully install and use a Ring Doorbell, you will need an Internet connected WiFi router, and a smartphone or similar portable IOS or Android device. Additionally you can connect a Ring Doorbell to your existing household doorbell wiring to both power the unit and activate your doorbell chimes. The Ring Doorbell Packaging The packaging was easy to open and all the parts were nicely tucked in their own compartments within a plastic tray inside the box. The packaging also had a clever flap on the outside that covered small windows that show potential buyers what is inside the box without forcing them to open it first. It seems like this flap is held closed by a light magnetic closure hidden within the paper of the packaging. The only thing that isn’t revealed without opening the box is the Ring Doorbell itself. The package contains the Ring doorbell, a short micro USB charging cable, a wall mount plate, a small screw driver, a drill bit, a small bubble level, some wall anchors and screws, a diode (for use with non-mechanical door chimes), and a small installation and setup guide. Depending on your mounting preference, you may need to provide your own drill, and I also found a small pair of needle nose pliers to be handy. Physically Installing the Ring Doorbell The physical install is pretty straightforward. Attach the Ring mounting plate to the wall, snap the Ring doorbell into place and secure with the two special screws already inserted into the bottom of the Ring doorbell. If you want to connect to your existing doorbell wiring, you’ll need to remove the existing doorbell button and attach the wires from that to the Ring mounting plate. If you don’t have a mechanical chime, you might also need to use the included diode when attaching the wires. One alternative to avoid drilling holes in an exterior wall would be to use industrial strength double sided tape, or some other strong adhesive. You just need to be certain the mounting plate is securely attached to the wall so it doesn’t risk damaging the Ring doorbell if it comes unstuck. Smart Phone App The product install documentation will direct you to install the Ring app first. There are apps available for both iPhone and Android. There are a few simple steps to set up the Ring doorbell, though I ran into two roadblocks with my installation. First, my Ring doorbell was shipped to me with the battery completely drained. It was necessary for me to charge it for about 20 minutes to get enough power to start the setup process. Second, I kept running into a problem near the end of the App setup process. It would stall as the Ring Doorbell was connecting to my WiFi and I’d be presented with a screen with four choices asking me what the Ring Doorbell was doing. Three choices for the Ring Doorbell LEDs flashing in one of three specific patterns, or “nothing”. In each case, I’d see the LEDs generate the pattern indicating they were connecting to my WiFi, then…nothing. Pressing the “nothing” selection in the Ring app just kept brining me back to the start of the WiFi connection process. This happened four or five times, and just as I was dialing the Ring support phone number, the process completed and the Ring app proceeded to the “setup complete” screen. I couldn’t find the recently added feature that lets Ring Doorbell owners start a “live view” of the video feed from the doorbell. Ring’s help documentation clearly states where this should be available in the app, but I didn’t see it. It was necessary for me to contact Ring support and have them enable the feature for me to see it. I don’t know if this is normal, or perhaps related to going from battery operated mode to being wired to the house doorbell circuit, but I never found any documentation to indicate I’d need support help to enable the “live view” mode. Once the Ring doorbell setup is complete, using the app is simple. Depending on your settings, the app will alert you when anyone pushes the doorbell button, or motion is detected, or both. It’s up to you if you want to answer or not; the Ring service will record video in either case. Interestingly, the service will also record any interaction you have with the visitor at your door. This way you can review exactly what you may have said to that pushy sales person. The app also shows you battery status, lists recent activity, lets you set up your motion detection settings, etc. You’ll also need the app to invite/manage others in your household to use the Ring doorbell service. Web User Interface In addition to the smart device apps, there is a web interface. The web interface offers users similar features as the app with a few small differences. Live View doesn’t seem to be available via the web interface. There are similar filters for different types of events. These include when the doorbell button is pushed and answered, button is pushed and unanswered, motion is detected or events that have been tagged as a favorite. When there aren’t any recorded videos, the interface for the filters goes grey to indicate there is nothing to filter, and unfortunately there is no mouse over description available to indicate what each filter does. Users can select events to delete with check boxes or use a “select all” link at the top of the events list. Unfortunately the “select all” feature is global, even while a filter is active. I accidentally deleted all my videos when I thought I was selecting all the filtered items using the select all and trash buttons. There’s no way to recover videos from the trash, so once a video is deleted, it’s gone for good. The web interface, like the phone app, allows you to download and share videos as well. There are share links for Facebook, Twitter, email, the Ring Media Team or Community Support. You can also generate a “public link” (URL) to let others view your Ring videos directly on the Ring service. Anyone you share the link with will be able to view that specific video. Overall Impressions I’ve used the Ring doorbell for a couple of weeks at this point, and over all I really like it. It’s not perfect, but based on the relatively low cost to get a video doorbell, it’s pretty good. It isn’t so far away from my WiFi router that I’ve noticed any problems with video issues or other failures. You can generally forget catching most delivery people. While that’s great in marketing materials, and might be possible sometimes, it isn’t really possible under normal conditions. By the time you receive notification that there’s been movement, or perhaps a delivery person pushed the doorbell button, most of them are already halfway back to their vehicle. At least you can see that something was delivered and have evidence if it was mishandled. I’ve noticed that at some times of the day the doorbell doesn’t do a good job of catching motion at my front door. Based on what I know about how the Ring motion sensor works, I assume this has something to do with the relationship between body temperature and ambient temperature. In any case, it probably captures 90% of all the motion right at my door and it has always alerted promptly when someone pressed the doorbell button. I have yet to experience it generating any false alerts. For the most part, I’m very impressed with how easy everything was to setup and use. Other than the minor problems I had with WiFi setup, it was easy to install. I was impressed by the feeling of a quality device I got when I opened the Ring package and started going through the parts. Providing most of the necessary tools is also a big plus in my book. I’ve mentioned a couple of minor issues, but they can probably be fixed by updates from the Ring development team. I do wish there were some scheduling features to let me define how the Ring doorbell functions at different times of the day, or when I’m away vs at home. Again, those are things that can be added later. I’d happily recommend the Ring doorbell to my friends or anyone looking for a way to see who’s knocking without leaving the comfort of your couch",Exciting concept with a few minor flaws

It’s up and running great!!!! Update: A Ring representative personally contacted me and apologized for the situation. He trouble shot with me and still not able to get it running. He stated that the device should have a much longer live and saw that I was just a few weeks past my warranty. He spoke for the company and stated they wanted to make this right! They’re mailing me a new replacement device as we speak and it’s expected tomorrow! I’m so happy to see the company is standing behind their products!!! Will update again after receiving it! But definitely raises my stars at this point! I liked having it when it would connect. It had great picture quality and was very useful. I’m extremely disappointed though. Yesterday, it began chimming every 30 seconds like someone was ringing the doorbell but no one was touching it. I took it off and pressed the reset button for 30 seconds like I was told. Now it won’t turn back on at all or connect. Called the help desk to be told nothing can be done about it. It’s a month passed the one year warranty and WILL NOT be replaced or fixed.  After almost 20 mins on the phone with the help desk, I’ve been offered a discount on a future purchase. What incentive do I have to repurchase a product that already has proven to not have a long live cycle or a company that backs it up when it stops working at no fault of ours? Disappointing!!!

There's always an issue with it. The first one broke after a few months and refused to connect to my Wi-Fi, giving me only the typical, useless error messages like ""something went wrong"" or similar. It was replaced by ring. Then the chime refused to connect to wifi and wouldn't reset using the pinhole on the side, it was also replaced by ring. Now the replacement doorbell they sent constantly disconnects from wifi. I've missed multiple rings and motion events. And unless you're home, you can't do anything about it. So my expensive security camera/doorbell might as well be a rock hanging off my wall. The device is only a few feet from my high powered router and the app always says the connection strength is good. No problem there. I contacted ring last week about the issue and they still haven't replied. I set the motion range to 5ft in front of the unit, yet it still alerts me every time a garbage truck or car drives by, a good 25ft from the doorbell. Yet... A human can walk up to my door and mosey around for a bit and go completely undetected. If it does sense their motion, they've been there so long they've already turned around and I get a video of their backside walking away. Sometimes the alerts are delayed by minutes. No rhyme or reason to that. My phone will receive the alert but my girlfriends won't until 3 minutes later, for instance. Should have just bought an outdoor wifi security camera and left the regular doorbell. At least then I would be able to answer the door when someone rings... Update: Ring customer service has been very helpful in resolving my issues. The doorbell is working great.",Working good now
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,6-May-19,Jay,"I actually started out with the Ring home alarm system first and then got the Ring device after the fact. It works great. Maybe too great. I live off a main street and even at the lowest sensitivity, I would still pick up passing cars all the time. It got bad enough to the point that I had to turn motion of all together! Fortunately, the customer support at Ring sent me a free wedge, which basically angles the device down some so that it picks up less traffic. Now only the people are captured, which I'm fine with. I turn off notifications still but I can go back if necessary to see something. I have my device hard wired, but I will day that I don't think I would have purchased it to run on battery. This model doesn't have a removable battery and the battery runs down pretty quick. This means you will have to dismount and charge the device every time, which kind of defeats the purpose of having distant security. I had to remove one star for this obvious limitation. Please noe that even with it hard wired, it is still better powered. The doorbell power line merely trickle charges the device, so it is very possible to run down the battery even while having it hard wired, so just beware of that it you intend to purchase this model. The Ring 2 has a removable doorbell. Also, the device is almost useless without Ring protect. You cannot record any video without the cloud subscription. I think this is kind of lame on Ring's part, but fortunately, it's not expensive and provides an extended warranty for you devices and has an unlimited amount of devices for only $100 a year or $10 per month. If you only want one device, it's $30 per device, per year. That's the worst deal in my opinion. Overall, great product, not perfect, but great and I'm happy with it.",Ring is the new sheriff in home security

Installation is straightforward and easy. App for iOS is well made. Sensor image  contrast is lacking and the bitrate of the awful 720 makes it feel like I’m watching a video recorded on a 2008 flip phone. The zone detection settings are basic )seemingly hard for the doorbell to screw up but it still fails pretty bad. Objects such as cars outside of the user set zone still register as movement while pedestrian movement within the user set zone isn’t registered immediately, if at all. Anecdotally I had a package delivery occur where the driver stops the truck in the field of view, walks 40 feet to my porch, rings door bell, sets package down and goes back to truck. The doorbell didn’t register movement. It only started recording after he pressed the button and walked away. If you’re considering this as a “kill two birds with one stone” setup for “I want a doorbell that watches for shady stuff going on in my yard and driveway” you’ll be let down. Just buy an actually security camera for that. This will likely miss that dude that smashed your car window and took your laptop because it didn’t happen within 6 feet of the doorbell. The day after I wrote the original review, I had a package theft that the doorbell missed most of the action. Observe in the video as the camera is sensitive enough to trigger an alert for a passing car in the street. Watch the timestamp change to the very next consecutive motion event. Observe as the camera only starts recording as the thief closes the car door and drives off. I'm tempted to knock the rating down, but I'll leave it 3 stars for now to not appear dramatic. But this could change again. Later edit. Yeah, this is lucky to get even two stars. Two stars go to the software dev team for the app. The hardware is garbage and shouldn’t be on the market in 2019.

Gunn,"Bought this to help with solicitors and other unwelcome visitors. So far, it seems the motion sensing is completely confused. Although set only to detect to the edges of my property, the motion detection alerts for every single car that drives by, but twice this week, people have come to the door to leave packages (one was opened by an incorrect recipient and I really wanted to see which of my neighbors brought it back) and there was zero alert or video recording. How can this be considered an effective device if it tells me every car that passes, yet allows people to come to my door and leave items without triggering the motion detection? Close to worthless. UPDATE 8/29/18: I contacted Ring customer service regarding this constant issue. The hold time to speak to a representative was literally the only disappointing part of the experience. My rep easily accessed the videos that demonstrated these issues and he came up with a potential solution immediately. They sent out an angle kit which helps the camera focus more on the porch and walkway than the street and the results were excellent. While we still get ocassional notifications for cars passing, they have been greatly reduced, and the camera now detects all movement on the walkway and front porch. Last night it even caught a sneaky cat slinking past the porch. We were so pleased we went ahead and purchased a Ring wireless spotlight camera and solar panel for the back area of our home.

I have held off writing a review so I could be sure of the performance before I wrote.  After a year and a half, I can highly recommend the Ring Video Doorbell as well as the Ring Service.  It is well worth the piece of mind it brings to me and my family. Installation of the doorbell was straightforward and everything worked as advertised.  After about a year into ownership, the device forgot how to be a doorbell, though.  I spent a couple of minutes on the phone with Ring Technical support to find out that an update pushed to the doorbell caused it to forget it was a doorbell.  It was corrected in a couple of days and everything works as advertised.  Ring video service is good as well.  Inexpensive and the videos are helpful.  Some of the videos we see are downright hilarious. The video doorbell is excellent quality and has stood up to the elements it is exposed to and continues to work.  It is more expensive than some of the other products on the market, but I have zero regrets purchasing this product.  It has worked well and customer support is outstanding. Highly recommended if you are in the market for a video doorbell.",Great Video Doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Nov-15,crash2311,"I recently purchased this item hoping that it was a fix for all of our front door security needs.  The reality is that it works quite well as a doorbell but the motion sensor and battery life leave much to be desired.  This thing is a snap to install.  I had it up and running inside of 10 minutes and that includes drilling the masonry for the mount.  My wireless router is about 10 ft away from the doorbell and we seem to get enough bandwidth for a very clear picture day or night.  When someone rings the doorbell the wide angle lens gives us an excellent view and the voice communication works quite well.  The app is easy to use (except for motion detection protocols) and I have now answered my door from out of state (very cool). The downside of this device is the motion sensor and how frequently false alarms are logged.  Even if I toggle off motion detection alerts all together the device still senses the motion and records it to the cloud.  I live 40 ft from a busy city street and even when set to the lowest detection threshold the device still logs between 10 and 20 false detections per day.  I normally wouldn't mind but I am using the rechargeable battery to power the Ring and these alerts are taking battery life from 10 months (as stated by the manufacturer) to 1.5  months (estimated since I haven't completed the cycle).  I have had this device hooked up for 2 weeks and the battery is down to 55%. You would figure that with all of the false alerts that the motion detector would trigger rather easily when an actual person approaches your door, but this is not the case.  My largest issue is the delay between someone coming to your door and the Ring triggering the alert to your phone and recording the incident to the cloud.  When there is actually a person i.e. the mailman I get video of his keister as they are leaving the premises.  This makes this device completely unusable as a security device (unless the police have posterior recognition software). That said I really like the concept and their customer service is fantastic.  Although they couldn't solve the delays now they are working diligently to improve the software and make a better device.  The staff was prompt in returning all correspondence and courteous while working with me to solve these issues.  They even offered to cover return shipping should I wish to return the device.  I decided to keep it so I will update this review as the software is updated and see if the device survives a Colorado winter.",Need a strong wi-fi signal or pixel city

I live alone & it is comforting to be able to see what is going on before I open the door & also know when I out on my back deck that someone is at the front door. I only had the doorbell for a week when I was at work & a woman rang my bell because my father had been at my house & my one dog accidently got outside the fence & after he left was sitting on my stoop. I was able to confirm with the woman via the video feed while I was at work that it was my dog & she put her into back yard for m. The only problem I have is my door is maybe six feet from the sidewalk & I live right near a high school so it goes off all the time for 'motion'. You can adjust for how far the motion sensor goes out but I can't make it small enough to not be triggered by kids on the sidewalk or even larger vehicles driving by. I have had some difficulty with a neighbor & am grateful when I can see it is him at the door & I just don't answer but can also keep an eye on him leaving my property.,"peace of mind, since I live alone."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Jun-16,Dave Westlake,"I purchased this for my father who spends a lot of time in his home office and often doesn't hear people at the door.  It was his father's day gift.  He wasn't exactly sure what it was until I installed it for him and showed him.  He loves it!  He usually has his cell phone near by and the fact this uses his cell is convenient for him. I opened the box and made sure it had all of the tools and parts needed to install.  The unit arrived with the battery at 45% charge.  I downloaded the app for his phone and used it to connect the doorbell to his home network.  It took me about 4 minutes to get it paired.  The Ring app walked me through it which made it nice and easy. Once the unit was connected to his home wifi network, I found a place to install it.  The front of his house is rock which worried me at first.  But there were instructions for mounting on rock.  In the app, you choose how, were and on what surface you are going to install the unit and it brings up the right videos to walk you through the process.  I chose to mount it near the old doorbell to use the wires for a hard wired system.  I attached the level and put the back plate where it was going to go.  I marked the holes with a pencil then drilled the holes using the included drill bit.  Including the drill bit was a nice touch.  Many products tell me what size bit to use but I have never seen one included.  After I drilled the 4 holes, I inserted the plastic pieces.  I removed the level and put the back plate against the wall and inserted the screws. After the back plate was installed I simply put the doorbell on the back plate and slide it down on the hooks.  I tightened the two screws on the bottom to lock it in place.  That was it. We mounted it about 4 feet off the ground which worried me at first that it wouldn't catch people's faces.  After testing it I realized that was a good height.  My face is perfectly visible on the phone screen.  We did not experience any delay when talking to people at the front door from the basement.  It was loud and clear on both ends. I definitely recommend this item to anybody who doesn't always hear people at the door and could use their phone with this product.

I'm only notified when a garbage truck drives past our home or a school bus. The audio is always messed up when I look at the live view also. And even though we have this hardwired into our original doorbell, we still need to take it down to charge it because we live in an area that it gets cold outside.

Getting right to the point that make this nearly worthless. Product claims that the battery is good for 6 months to a year. Probably true if it is never used. I found it would not last more than 3 to 4 days before needing to be dismantled and recharged. I called the chat line and was told that the motion detection had been activated too much... 200 times in 10 days. Or 20 times per day. To extend the battery life to last 3 to 6 months (not 6 to 12 months), it should not be used (motion detection) more than 2 or 3 times a day! We are a family of 7 including 3 school age children and others with jobs. Are we supposed to sneak out the back in order to preserve the doorbell battery! Even tried to schedule turning off motion detection during times when we knew we would be leaving and returning. Still no joy. So it seems to me that if I shut off all the functionality I thought I was paying for I will be left with... A doorbell... The same thing I started with $100 ago.

You don't get any video except live view, and in order to know someone is there, they have to ring the doorbell. So if you are looking for a porch thief, this is not the product for you. You'll never know they were there. As a doorbell, it does work and I have it hooked up to two receivers, one on the second floor and one in the basement. Set up was real easy. BUT, it doesn't tell you when it's hungry. So it could go dead and you'd never know it unless you opened the app and checked it's health. Now, with the subscription, it's actually a really neat thing. I adjusted the motion detection so it doesn't catch the cars in the road and reviewing the video is easy. You can ""star"" clips that are noteworthy and probably find a way to download them.

The visitor at the door has to wait few seconds (approx 60 seconds) before to ring again. - The motion alert is missing some events. It looks like there is an idle time between the motion captures. If two motions happen within 5 minutes or so, it will capture only the first one and eventually missing the following motions. - Using it for monitoring will prevent you to get alerts. I setup my old tablet in the kitchen to show me the front door Ring Doorbell. After doing this, I couldn’t get any ring or motion alerts on all the connected devices including the chimes/phone/tablet. So you either stream the video and eventually miss all the alerts or close the app to get them. - Wasn’t able to get a good WiFi signal in just few feet away from the second floor, I have purchased a $60 WiFi extender that I installed near the door to get it to work. - the alerts are delivered only through push notifications (No email or Message support) and the online account activity is not immediately updated when there is an event. - You may have to wait few minutes to see a recorded motion online, depending on both your mobile and Ring internet connection speed . It would be practical to get a video preview such as 3 pictures taken during the motions, while the video is uploading. This may help detect false alarm rapidly. - There is a $3 monthly subscription required for video replay features. - It’s good for starters but I’ll be definitely looking for better and subscription free products in the market unless we get a major updates.",It looks like there is an idle time between the motion captures

This was my first video doorbell so I decided to go with an earlier generation cheaper option to start with. The install for the doorbell was super straight forward and easy to hook up using my original doorbell wiring. I did have to charge the doorbell initially after opening before I could start using it. The app is nice and is a really good UI but I really wish there was more customization to the motion detection. I could not find a good spot for detecting motion, it was either too little or too much.  The video quality I knew wasn't going to be amazing but it really ended up being not as good as I would have expected. There was always a loud noise that I could never get rid of, it constantly sounded like there was wind blowing on the mic, even on a quiet day. I loved the fact that I could use this with my existing doorbell because I have a tube mechanical bell. Unfortunately two different devices I received malfunctioned to where it would constantly ring my doorbell for no reason. This was sporadic and at time would be repetitive. I worked with support until I received a replacement and it ended up happening with that one as well.

When customer service could fix the problem by resetting the device, I was told it is a know problem and that I should wait for a fix. When I asked how exactly it will fix itself when it can't connect to the internet I was informed it just would. After many weeks of waiting for a magical fix I called in again to complain. This time I was hung up on. Long story short I had to escalate the problem to the BBB and a local new organization ignorer for the head of customer support to contact me to fix the problem.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Oct-19,Ardren DeBerry,"The Ring doorbell does come with everything you'll need for installation. However, the drill bit included did not cut it for my brick wall.  I had to purchase another brick drill bit, which helped. I couldn't figure out how to keep the tip from slipping on the brick though (call the professionals lol).  I had to charge it for five hours before installing it. There is a significant delay in recording , and sometimes it doesn't sense motion at all. I mostly get motion leaving, not coming. Also, I'm not a fan of the fish eye lens view from the camera. Although its showing 100% wifi connectivity, the video quality is not that great (day or night). Overall, I would purchase it again because I do like the two way speaker. I'd rather see a little something, than a lot of nothing ~",Bit Of A Delay
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Dec-16,FL,"I got this during a 35% off Black Friday sale, I probably wouldn't have bought it at $200. After all its a doorbell with camera. It is very well constructed and is a quality product.It comes with all fitting materials. This has been a very useful household edition, in particular before Christmas with frequent package deliveries. It has prevented us from getting any deliveries stolen from outside our front door. Many of the package delivery companies push the door bell as a matter of course now so you always know when something arrives. I'm sure the bad guys are aware of ring.com doorbells, and they would act as a deterrent too. The motion sensors are a bit flaky at times, falsing quite a bit, and I have played with the sensitivity settings quite a bit to reduce this, and  still sense people arriving at the front door. Quite amusingly, my wife emailed me and told me there was a package outside the front door that I hadn't noticed because I'd left my phone at home. She was in the UK at the time, and I live in the United States!! I use it in wireless mode (internal battery), the ring designers should really relocate the USB charging port to the bottom of the device, so that it could be recharged quickly using a portable USB battery pack, this would remove the need to take the doorbell off during recharge periods. Also, I wish that Ring.com would create and equivalent product that would piggy back onto the doorbell that could be used as a mailbox alarm as well with a different tone, so you know when your mail has arrived too. I hope their product designers are reading reviews, there is a second level market just waiting to be had! All in all an ingenious product!","Quality product, does its job!"

The doorbell's wifi was detected, but the connection failed every time. Setting it up with an iphone worked right away, and then the doorbell was also visible to the android phone. Installing it on the wall was super smooth. They literally have everything in the box. The doorbell itself works great. Motion detection and night vision work without any problems and configuration is easy. I got notified on my phone that someone is at the door when I was outside on 3G and could talk to the person without any problems. The audio quality is not great, but it works pretty good. The alexa integration also works nicely. The delay from receiving a notification on alexa until the connection is actually established on the echo show is a little long; in most cases it would be faster to just go to the door. Other than that, great product, in particular, if you don't have any wires for a normal doorbell system at the door.","Fun product, but installation can be tricky"

It was a bit difficult for me to install due to the stucco and metal box around my existing doorbell.  I wanted to use the doorbell wires so I wouldn't have to be recharging the battery.  The rough stucco made it difficult to get an even backing for the camera.  I had to use a wooden piece to make a level surface for the camera.  It works very well and I had a question on how to get my wife's phone connected and the customer support was excellent in walking me through it.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Dec-17,Jeff Jones,"It looks nice and trendy, has simple installation instructions and kind of works, but needs a lot more work to get it right.  I say two stars and not one simply because of the innovative ideas.  Hopefully, they fix all of their problems in the next version of the device. Now, to all of the serious issues with our Ring doorbell which no call to tech support is going to solve: 1) You can set and save how far the motion detector works and even set the zones/sectors it will detect.  However, if I reduce it to the bare minimum, it still picks up traffic on the street which is about 50 ft away.  I had to turn off the motion sensor to keep my sanity because the thing goes off every 10 minutes whenever we have heavy traffic.  Huge problem since the motion detector is one of the main features of the device. 2) This doorbell has to authenticate with the server which sometimes takes seconds before it actually starts taking video. This is a problem on the back end and we have no control over how long authentication takes, no matter how fast our internet connection is. So, we get video of nothing most of the time.  Doesn't matter, probably was just a car driving by... see number 1. 3) The doorbell is large, so if your wall is not perfectly flat, then you'll have the screws that mount to the wall showing.  Yeah, I can fix that with extra time and money, but they should have thought of that when designing such a large fixture.  All they needed to do was add a shroud that fits around the doorbell to hide the gap or a flexible spongy backside on the mount (think yoga mat), 4) The Ring software for some reason won't save my house location even though it says it's been saved.  Every time I open up the app, I get an annoying location of ""Lompoc, CA"".  I don't live anywhere near there! 5) Our house is stucco on the outside, so we had to drill large holes to fit anchors and mount the device.  Wouldn't be that big of a problem if the doorbell actually delivered, but in our case it's not all that.  So, to remove it, I'll have to patch the wall and somehow match the paint in a highly visible area the will detract from curb appeal if I get it wrong  I'm leaving the doorbell there as a trendy fixture.","Trendy, has problems and doesn't work for my use case"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Feb-19,L. Harris,Works Great! Fairly quick to install they even send all the tools needed.  We added the inside chime for those times we were away from the phone or computer.  If you have a slanted wall make sure to add one of the corner blocks or angle blocks to get a better view of the front yard. The video range is pretty good on the basic Ring Doorbell. Video quality is good. We will be adding more Ring products in the near future.  We just pre-ordered the new Ring light and plan on purchasing one of their video cameras soon. Unless you need permanent recordings no need to purchase the monthly subscription. We may add the monthly plan for times we are away at the moment we are on the 30-day free trial.

Pros: -App is really easy to use -You can have multiple people download the app and connected to the ring camera -Camera is surprisingly good quality with how tiny it is. -It doesn't recognize my dog as a motion when he passes by (he's also 15 lbs and small). -You can set motion distances so you don't always get motion notifications when cars drive by. Cons: -If you get a notification and press it to take you to the app it takes a while to load. I've gotten motion notifications and by the time it loads and I look the persons gone (like a delivery guy). Also the sound from the ring camera doesn't extend very far, you have to be within a couple feet to hear it. -If you go in and out of the door a lot you will get a motion notification EVERY time.

Whenever someone passes by or rings the door bell, it notifies me and my husband and send us a video tape of who's at our door. I can view this from my job or even out of town through my cell phone. I can do a live view to see if anything is going on. I can see and talk to that person at the door while at home or away from through my cell phone. It sends immediate notifications soon as it rings or motion ddetected. You can allow up to five or six family members that same access so that they can see whose there before answering the door. However, this is important to know. This company will allow you 30 days to view and review your recording without a payment plan. The plans are cheap $3 dollars a month or $30 a year and free to for live viewing only but to go back and look at the recording you must select a plan. Keep in mind if someone breaks into your home, a live view will not help the police but a recorded reviewed will because it will show the video of that person. A live view will on show real time with recording. My home was broken into through the front door. If I had this product then. I could have gotten the recording. The video shows pretty clear.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,23-May-17,Don Cummings,"Yo know, I do love this doorbell. I mean, it does everything they say it will do---the only funky thing is---they say all you need is at least 1 Mbps of Wifi to get this thing to work. Well, I have 10 Mbps at my door where the doorbell is---and it MOSTLY works---but there are times when it does not kick in. So, I had to buy the chime/Wifi Extender. Well, that really did do the trick. Which is fine. But, WHY is the DOORBELL is COOL looking...yet the chime-wifiExtender looks like a very bad baby monitor from the 1990s?  I mean, COME ON, DESIGN TEAM!  The other thing is...I have someone else sharing the notifications on his phone. His simply does not work as well as mine. I have a feeling that the main person who sets this all up (in my case--me) ends up with better reliability than the secondary person on their phone.  Lastly---the whole thing seems to take too long to reset. I feel like if there is motion or a doorbell ring---and then 30 seconds later, there is a fresh one...then there should be a reaction. But it seems like the doorbell needs a long time to reset.  Overall, though, I LOVE that if the doorbell rings and I see the person at the door trying to sell me something, I don't have to answer!  And, I love being able to talk to whoever is at the door without having to come to the door. I love seeing my packages delivered. I love seeing the live feed.

Everything past the porch is completely washed out with very bright light. This is true whether its day or night. We had to change the settings to only notify us when a person is detected because it was notifying us of motion every few minutes when 90% of the time it was a car driving by on the street about 40 feet away or nothing (we assumed wind). It now works to let us know when someone is on our porch, but doesn't help to protect our driveway as that is completely washed out and not visible at all. Also, recording is often delayed by a few seconds, so if someone were to quickly grab a package from our porch, this camera probably wouldn't catch it.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Jul-16,Retwahine,"6th update - a friend from put of town came.  He had an iPhone.  He was able to set it up immediately.  I gave it to him.  Guess the ring doesn't work with Samsung Galaxy J7 phones, maybe others too.  Don't waste your time trying to get it to work.  It either will or it won't and if it won't,  send it back. 5th update - bought another one.  Not only did it not work at my house but it didn't work at my son's house.  When it didn't work here I gave it to him.  The Ring people had convinced me that it was my wifi.  We now think it may be our phones. We both have Galaxy J4 Star.  Before that J4. 4th update - still doesn't work right and it's 2 years later.  Best I can do is check the app ever so often to see if there's any video.  Still does not ring my phone or alert me to motion at the door although it will video it.  We think it burned out the house doorbell (it was hardwired to the ring). Bought a motion detector.  Between that and the video I have a ""system"". 3rd update - I give up.  It's never going to ring on my phone.  I've spent over three hours on the phone and still cannot get notified of someone ranging my doorbell.  Great picture when they do but have to check archives frequently.  Motion alert too delayed to see who stole the package.  New problem - as I type this review the Ring turns on and sends a picture..  No sound and no one pressed the button.  Too many problems with this doorbell to deal with.  It's not ready for prime time.  Great concept though. 2nd update:  Finally able to talk to Ring.  I saw on the news where the Amazon cloud was down the day I had tried to reach them so tried again.  This time I connected with Ring very easily,  After almost two hours my problem was partially resolved.  Had to bump me up but the new guy was able to tweak my router and get the connection to my phone.  Only problem now is it won't notify me when the doorbell is rung.  We set up my tablet and laptop too and although they all get the picture none get the sound, yet, when the technician added his phone as an additional user his phone would ring when I rang the Ring doorbell.  I tried it using my wifi and using the tower.  So now I have a camera.  If I'm home and in the house, I hear the house doorbell since I am hardwired.  If away from home - just luck if I see the call on my phone when it happens otherwise, nice camera.  Ring's customer service was awesome.  Spent almost three hours with me trying to resolve this issue.  Unfortunately it's not totally resolved.  Great when it works. Update:  I've had the Ring over six months.  Worked great at first but I was never able to get a live feed.  Then it started to ring when no one at door.  Sometimes when someone is at door I would get a black screen.  Finally it quit ringing when someone was at door.  Now it will not connect at all.  Basically it is worthless.  Tried to call customer service.  First they answered but no one picked up when call was transferred.  Now I get a message that there was a ""application error"".  Finding the customer service number was a chore to begin with.  Something fishy going on. NOTE: THIS IS WHEN BOUGHT MY FIRST SAMSUNG GALAXY J4.  NOW THINK IT JUST DOESNT WORK WITH THAT MODEL PHONE. It deliver as promised.  My entry way is obstructed so I don't get a picture until the doorbell is rung.  Usually the delivery person has walked away before it starts filmimg.  However that's my problem and not Rings fault.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased with the device.",great product - for about 4 months.  Update: POS now.  Update: not happy yet.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Apr-19,DocBrown,"This review is for the Ring Video Doorbell, not the Ring2. The basic setup is easy. In minutes the doorbell is up and running. Depending on how you mount it the time involved will vary. Mine replaced an existing doorbell bell button and is connected to the wiring. I did not know what to expect, but much of what is on Ring’s website makes you think the low end product is really amazing. When all is said and done the basic Ring doorbell is better than nothing and would certainly be a deterrent in most instances. Just having the ability to see when a package it delivered or talk to someone at the door is a big benefit. But if you want more get the Ring2. I gave this a “4” because for the price it really does a decent job. One thing that would be really nice is the ability to answer the door from any Amazon Echo. You can get doorbell chimes, but two way talking can only be done with Echo Spot. I experienced two of the same issues as other reviewers, short battery life and recordings not starting until the person is on my porch or already walking away. As I researched these issues I found that there is a lot that is not very clear when first installing. It took quite a bit of tweaking to get things working to make the Ring useful. Charging My comments only apply if you are using existing wiring. One thing the mounting instructions are clear about, the back panel must be completely flat. There can be no bend in it so that the contacts on the back all make clean contact to the mounting plate. The wires should be clean and free of corrosion. The existing wires do not power the Ring. They only charge the battery. The Ring still runs on the battery. Our transformer is the standard 16 volts. It essentially trickle charges. The more video the camera records, the more battery life gets used up. Contrary to the 6 months to 1 year of “normal” usage on a single charge, the battery can get used up very fast. 8-10 recordings over a 24 hr. hour period can use 10% of the battery. It can take several days for the battery to charge from 85% to 100%, though I have yet to see it higher than 98%. In order to have a balance that allowed the charging to have a fighting chance to keep up I had to select “Light” under motion frequency. Recording startup and motion sensing I was annoyed that most times when someone approached the front door the recording would not start until they got there or only as they were walking away. This evidently has to do with the fact that the WiFi signal strength is not enough to connect to the cloud faster to begin the recording. Ring has a web page that talks about RSSI and recording time. RSSI rating is found in Device Health. Mine was around -52 to -57. While the help page says this is better than most, it turned out that it was not enough. After reading Ring’s page about RSSI, I bought a small WiFi extender and put it just on the other side of the wall where the Ring is. This brought my RSSI up to -37 to -39. The Ring is now recording movement an additional 10-15 feet earlier than before. I also had to adjust the overall motion detector distance several times to avoid picking up moving cars on the street (about 25 feet from my door) but still get someone walking up the driveway (about 15 feet). I still get some cars but so far the Ring is working fairly well.","Good value for the price, lots of tweaking to get it working well"

I have a signal value of 22 so it has nothing to do with that. Defective? Yes! My reality is this unit so maybe I will revise this once I get a replacement, but I've had Amazon make a delivery here and all you see is a package appear out of nowhere.

When you do get an alert from the device it has problems connecting to the phone. I have Xfinity and the router is less than 25 feet from the device. Battery time is sufficient when you can get it to work correctly. Another downfall is the device should come with the chime, that should not be separate, it's not a doorbell without it. That's a problem if you dont have your phone on you when someone comes to the door. It can get expensive if you purchase multiple cameras you have to pay for each device for monthly monitoring.

I ordered and received this video Ring doorbell system in December right before Christmas after seeing advertisements about them on Facebook. With how scary the world is today, I have decided since I am the only house on a dead end street, I don’t want to open my door to just anyone anymore. I am really enjoying having this and knowing when someone is at my door even when I am not home; however we could not get this to communicate with my existing doorbell chime, another one we bought and connected or even the RING chime which I ended up returning so it ONLY rings to my cell phone which is why I deducted a star It does send a pleasant chime sound to my phone when there is motion in front of my house or on my porch which is awesome as I am the only house on my street. When someone rings the doorbell, it rings to my phone and I can pull up the video of them on my phone and speak with them, where ever I might be. I watch the mail person and UPS deliver packages while I am at work, I’ve seen the meter reader come read the meter, I’ve run kids off my porch wanting to use my shovel to break ice on a pond across the road from me to fish, all while I’ve been gone from home. It’s an amazing device and I wish we could have also gotten it to connect to door chimes in my home as well but it still works, just to my phone only. I HIGHLY recommend it.  There is one thing, after 30 days, you either have to commit to paying for cloud storage for your videos or you loose them all. It is $3/month or $30/year which is the more cost effective route to go, saves $6, I am all about saving every penny I can!","Fantastic video doorbell, everyone needs this"

I was so not impressed that I returned the original hoping that it was defective.  The replacement is not any better.  And with that replacement, Amazon deleted my original 07/30/19 review (good thing I kept the e-mail). The HD video is supposed to be 720P but looks like VHS quality to me.  The default motion sensitivity gave way too many false positives.  But even then, the video recording doesn't start until they were on the front porch and missed  walking up the sidewalk.  I've tested it several times and it is so poor quality I could never help local law enforcement. Several times I'm notified of activity and the video doesn't even record. In the photo attached, my east facing house (no sun glare in the afternoons) doesn't show the fact that I pulled my red SUV in front the house, 50' from the front porch.

I emailed Ring and all of tried everything they proposed, to no avail. I was prepared to live with this since it was still useful as a doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,22-May-16,Peggy C,"After reading some of the less-than-positive reviews here, I was hesitant to get this, but a trusted neighbor had one for a while and said it works well for them. And now I can say I love our Ring doorbell, too; but it took a while to get it setup and working with our devices. Although the review here says I ordered the white color, I actually ordered the bronze, which matches our house colors perfectly. The camera is very clear (much sharper image than the Honeywell wireless cameras we got with our security system) and having the ability to talk to someone from anywhere is priceless to us (we recently had our landscaper show up unexpectedly and being able to answer his ring and talk to him gave us peace of mind that he wasn't going to anything that we hadn't agreed to). The doorbell itself was relatively easy to install and connect to our Wi-Fi network, although at first it didn't work with our Android (Samsung) phones (we didn't get the notifications when someone came to the door).  It also would not trigger our existing doorbell, which is an old-style mechanical type (strikes a bell when triggered, instead of playing a chime or tone), even though I wired it as shown in the installation instructions.  My husband wanted to send it back, but I convinced him that first we needed to give the support folks at Ring a try.  I'm really glad we did, as Ring customer service was very helpful in assisting with trouble-shooting the problems we encountered. It turned out there was a known issue with some Samsung devices not receiving notifications, but during the time they worked with us, it was resolved for the Samsung 6S.  The second issue with the wired Ring not making our mechanical doorbell sound turned out to be a problem with the Ring device we received, so they shipped us a new unit (and covered the shipping costs for us to return the old one).  The new unit install went quickly and now both our upstairs and downstairs mechanical doorbells both sound.  During this process we learned that the Live View option was available with our device (since it's hardwired to our old doorbell), which allows you to use the camera at any time to check your door area, and the customer service rep requested it be turned on for us.  Within a day, we were using Live View.  My husband loves this feature and keeps showing it to everyone he knows. The only remaining issue we have is now is receiving push notifications on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which is another known Android problem that is being worked on.  The reason I'm giving 5 stars despite this remaining problem is the speed at which the other issues we encountered were resolved, as it gives me confidence that this one will soon be resolved as well.  In the meantime, it's working perfectly with the other Samsung S6 phone and our iPad. This past weekend, I purchased and installed a Ring doorbell for my best friend for her birthday, who receives a lot of packages for her job and can't always make it to the door in time.  Unfortunately, she didn't have an existing wired doorbell to replace, so it's currently being powered by the internal battery.  Given this, she can't get the Live View feature (apparently this would deplete the battery).

When video turned to black and white tech had me do all kinds of things non of which worked.  Thank goodness we were disconnected.  Figured out on my own that the hallway light  above my doorwy being out had put the device into night mode.  You'd think that a lighting question would have been the first question from the Tech's lips.  Also supposed to be able to link the doorbell to other vendor apps but I cant, Ring tech can't, and the other vendor can't.  Video often captures movement in the middle not at the beginning of the action.  Video is not like you see on TV and promotion videos, grainy.  Fine if you change the setting to record in HD, but this really drains the battery.  Also, hard to answer a someone is at your door notice.  No simple on home screen button that you can press to do the job.

I have a great internet connection, but I am generally never alerted and able to pull up a visual before most people have already left. It often doesn't film you when you walk right in front of it and it always takes too long. It only films for a bit while you are standing in front of it moving then it stops recording which is a HUGE problem. There was an argument I needed recorded for legal reasons, and I kept moving so it'd keep filming, but, alas, it failed me like always. There have been people who jumped over the fence it is aimed at, yet the camera didn't film them doing this as it just stops filming after a short time despite movement.

First, the packaging is exceptional.  Very nicely done.  Instructions are good.  When I installed the doorbell and two chime units, it all worked.  It took a bit of trial and error, but eventually it all worked.  I was happy. But it's now having issues: 1.  It's hardwired.  At first, it was ringing our hallway doorbell just as billed.  But for some reason, it quit doing that.  Hallway existing doorbell has been silent for 3 days. I've tested a lot.  The hallway doorbell certainly works, I can remove the Ring and connect the two terminals underneath and the doorbell rings like it used to.  But the Ring has quit actuating the doorbell.  Yes, the diode is installed and oriented properly.  I checked the diode with my VOM, it's working.  Something happened after about 2 days of installation and Ring quit ringing the hallway doorbell. 2.  Motion Alerts falsing.  In fact, every motion alert (between 15 and 25 a day) are all false.  I've reduced the motion alert to 3', but it still falses.  I'll probably turn that ""feature"" off. 3.  My Ring app shows a whole slew of events, but they cannot be deleted.  In fact, they don't exist ""in the cloud"" and that's why they cannot be deleted in my app.  They've escalated my trouble call to the next level.  I think there may be a bug in the app that deletes the events at their cloud site, but under certain circumstances, leaves them on the app. I'm really anxious to having my Ring work properly and am looking on the Internet for help.  When the problems are resolved, I'll update my review.",Early review.  Having issues

The main frustrating point that will likely led to me buying something else is Ring is slow to begin recording. It takes about 5-10 seconds from the time it detects motion to begin recording. Most of the time my recorded clip is recording the delivery man walking away. I can't see his face or what he carried to my door. So if someone were to ever steal a package from my porch, I would likely only have the back of their head in the recording unless they waited a few seconds at the door. Night vision isn't great but I personally don't need it to be. If someone was at my door it would likely be clear enough for me to get a face picture of them. I am impressed with battery life. I've had it over a month and it has about 40% battery. The app is easy to navigate and $3/month storage isn't bad. I do wish it would continuously record so we motions were detected, I could watch the entire event.

I know they will replace the doorbell if it’s been stolen as long as there’s a Police report, but they should include an antitheft bracket for added security. The first Ring that I received has a smudge on the box, it looks like someone is taking their snack and packing this at the same time. I did return this due to the video was blurred and it has been replaced by a used one.

It was easy to set up, with options as to motion detection sensitivity etc.  I used this inside the  house rather then as a door bell, but spoke to tech support first to see if that was OK, which it was.  The motion detection feature is significant in that any time the Ring detects movement, it sends a message to your phone. Also, I added the Ring application to my phone, so I can watch her house for her and be notified of any activity in the house.  The internal rechargeable battery can last up to year on one charge.  Tech support is available 24/7 and very helpful.  You can also pay for them to monitor your Ring, but in my friends case, having the Ring notify me in the case of any activity was sufficient.

This product is good as a deterrent. We purchased two of them due to sketch bags coming to our door but I can't say I'd rely on them for positive identification. If it's bright outside (even without the camera facing the sun), the initial recording moment will be super dark as it adjusts for exposure.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Nov-18,Jessica Nagel,"Let me first say that my house is over 110 years old and didn't come prewired with a doorbell - nor - a peephole.  I guess the families that lived there before me decided they didn't need one or weren't really worried about who they were opening the door for.  It has drove me absolutely bat-sh*t insane since every time someone would knock on the door, if I wasn't expecting them, it was like opening the door blind.  I'm a single woman and live alone in Baltimore and even though I trust my neighbors, I've never been comfortable opening the door ""blind"".  Hardwiring a doorbell and drilling a hole through my door (or special ordering a door with a peephole) all of that seemed like too much work and too much money for very little pay back.  Since I live in the city, I've also toyed with the idea with getting a security camera. Through my research I came across Ring.  Via the Cyber Monday week deals I got the Ring security system for my house (because I want to drop ADT - I just don't feel like I get that much payoff for the price) and I decided to enhance it with the Doorbell.  Not the 2, not the Pro, not any other higher level Rings.  Just the Doorbell. I am loving it so far.  It seriously took me 30 minutes to install.  The longest part was charging the doorbell for use and figuring out where best to mount it for maximum exposure to my front door.  The kit comes complete with CONCRETE screws and wall mounts and CONCRETE drill bit.  Having the kit come with a concrete drill bit was the biggest surprise for me because those are not exactly the cheapest drill bits and even though I already have a set of concrete drill bits it was nice not having to look for it in my toolkit (plus I know that not everyone probably has concrete drill bits in their arsenal).  It was also nice that they have the forethought to provide concrete screws instead of throwing in some random cheap screws.  It also comes with a small screwdriver with a two end bit (phillips and starbit) It came with everything needed to mount the doorbell. It was easy to download and register with the app and it was easy to associate it with Alexa for use with my Echo Spot.  If you turn on the ""live view"" feature of the Doorbell, you can use the ring app and Alexa to ""drop in"" on your front door live.  (You can also use the website to view your front door, however you are not able to drop in live via the website).  The Ring app is a beautiful app.  I have the ""live view"" feature turned on right now but since that means the camera is ""always on"" I'm not sure if I will keep it on as it's supposed to drain the battery faster (I'm conducting an experiment on how fast it actually zaps the battery juice - I'll keep you posted). The camera is pretty sensitive.  I did have the motion detector alerts turned on but I live in the city and every time someone walked by it would alert me on the app and via Alexa and that got annoying real quick, so I turned that off.  Haha. However, even though I have the alerts turned off, it still records the 20s or so of the motion that it detected and it's extremely easy to view *all of them* via the app or website.  It's also nice because via the Live View feature you can actually two-way talk to people, and I can't wait to use that on the people who sit on my steps (""get off my lawn, whippersnappers!"" :-)  actually, I can't wait to freak them the eff out, I think it's going to be hilarious!) If you have a smart home device (Echo or Google Home) then you don't really need to hardwire the Doorbell into your old doorbell wires as your smart home device will ring when someone hits the bell.  However, it does come with the wire needed to install it to your old doorbell wires. Even though it is fish-eyed, the picture is very clear and also has night vision. The coolest part is asking Alexa, ""Alexa, show me the door"" and I get to see who's at the door via my Spot! Overall, the Ring Doorbell was a total win for me and I couldn't be happier.",Fantastic Security Camera/Doorbell

Secondly, the when the bell is wrong, and I attempt to answer it works on and off, some times it works some times it doesn’t, some times I don’t even get the notification till after, it is not a connection problem since I have tested my WiFi speeds multiple times and it has no issues with any other devices in the house, furthermore the bell is no more than 5ft from the router. Last but not least, the back of the ring came with dust and scratches and the two security screws lose in the box, which with fair certainty probably means this product was used, I chose to install because the motion sensor and notifications work which was my main concern due to the next few day me needing to keep an eye at the house, but I’m certainly not 100% satisfied. For the good: Motion sensor notification, and brief recordings of such and of bell rings works with absolutely no issues, it really does give an extra sense of security and it’s ideal for any and all parents.

This thing was bubble wrapped perfectly. The item itself came with every single thing you need.  Even a mini level, it was so cute.  Instructions were easy to follow and it was extremely professional in it's packaging and product.  I was blown away.  I set it up to my wifi through the app.  This is where a problem came in.  Once it was set up and I was testing it in my garage the picture was so blown up and white you could hardly see and my app was not working.  It would spin and freeze up on me which was a major disappointment.  I have a Note 5 so it should be a good enough phone, right?  Well, my son, being an apple junky downloaded the app to his phone and what do you know? The dang thing worked perfectly other than the blown up image.  I was worried I'd have to send it back and debated exchanging it for the pro so I could have a better quality picture. The next day, I decided to hook it up first and test it out from there.  It was a simple set up, removing my old (actually new since last year) doorbell and hooking the wires to the plate.  I attached the doorbell to the plate, and no doorbell.  My son was KIND enough to remind me to turn the power back on. LOL.  Brain fog moment.  I did as he suggested, lol (him laughing the whole time) and tried out my new Ring doorbell.  I immediately got an alert and of course my phone would not view it so my son happily showed him the picture from his phone and the clarity was great!  Not blown up like it was in my garage.  I'm assuming that was due to all the lighting.  We were able to talk to each other which was awesome. I also discovered that I could download the app on my windows 10 computer which I immediately did and perfect clarity.  Well, my hubby said Christmas was coming early for me and I can upgrade to the new note 8 since this doorbell was super important to me.  I'm often running inside the house to check my door when my rude dogs think every person walking buy is a danger and on our property even if their yards away.  Now I can conveniently check my computer first or my phone, which decided to start working after my Christmas gift was revealed, of course. I'll still need that 8 because....well....it's got a better camera, you know.  lol.  I do have difficulty with the app working at times on all devices as it will sometimes take a while to upload.  I found going straight to live view solves that issue 9 times out of 10.  I can still hit the green phone button to utilize the speakers.  Don't forget to hit the red phone button when your done talking or the UPS guy will still hear your conversation which is kind of embarrassing. LOL.  I learned that the hard way. I wish the clarity were a bit better but having said that I do have solid images and it's really pretty good for the price.  Not sure doubling the price for a hair better quality would be worth it or not.  Maybe later down the road I'll get the upgrade.  I would really love the latest and greatest but nearly $500 made me choke on my saliva.  I'm very happy with my purchase, would highly recommend, and I no longer have to get the unwanted exercise of running to my front door every time the dog barks.  I will be paying for the cloud service, after all, we do need it to record or what's the point, right?  But 3$ a month is doable.  Don't think I need the 10$ package. P.S.  If I remember (brain fog) I'll try to update when I get my new phone and let you know if the app works better on it or not!  Love the product!",OUTSTANDING packaging and set up

The minimum plan will cost you $3 per month or $30 per year. There are more expensive plans and another surprise is that if you expect to get your device to be replaced if stolen, you have to subscribe to the $100 per year plan. Well to me, these revelations are unacceptable. Ring should allow you to at least record to your phone as an option or at minimum, allow for up to three free recordings per 30 days, etc. If you do not want to pay a subscription, I recommend looking at other devices or security cameras that allow recording to you phone or the devices own storage. As far as the quality of the doorbell and ease of installation; it is top notch in that aspect. Another disappointment of the device is the app you use to access your Ring device – it is a little confusing to use. One more disappointment is the quality of the video - Even with 720 HD, the image is not as good as the samples given by the manufacturer. If your doorbell is under a covered porch, you will not see well beyond 6 feet or so because it has to adjust to the lighting of the shade at your door.

That all changed recently. At first would have given it four stars all day long. I have had it for well over a year with success. It all changed a month ago when my application would inexplicably log me out so every time someone would be on my porch or has rung my doorbell, I would have to log in to the application as quickly as possible to answer whom ever was pressing the button. I contacted customer support and they told me to delete the application, restart my phone, and reinstall [of course I had already tried that twice]. This did not help. I called customer service again yesterday and I Spoke to someone that sounded like he had never owned a computer or smart phone and was repeating something from a ring technician handbook. Finally after a long mostly one sided conversation [me being the one side] he somewhat admitted to me that ring had updated the program in their servers to no longer function properly with my iPhone OS. I have an iPhone 6+ that is in perfect condition and I know from experience that if I upgrade to the new OS it will for all practical purposes destroy my phone. It will function very slowly, kill battery life, and the new OS looks terrible and is not as intuitive as it was. Ring expects me to basically buy a new $800+ telephone to continue using their product which I already paid for. Not cool. So much for purchasing something and owning it.

It would complete the setup process, but never connect for a ""Connectivity Test"". The doorbell would always show ""Offline"" in the app, despite sending notifications of motion. If I answered a call or connected when there was motion, audio would not work. Because it showed ""Offline"", Live View was never an option. After trying all troubleshooting available in their help documentation, I connected with Ring support via chat. As I was verifying my account, the Ring Doorbell suddenly connected to the WiFi for the first time! That was short lived - 2 hours later, the WiFi dropped again and I went through several reset attempts, but could never get it to show online again. I thought my issue might be low battery related despite the app showing 47%, so I charged it for several hours. After fully charging, performing another factory reset, and walking through setup again - the battery level never changed. It got stuck in a firmware update loop for several hours. At this point, I reached out to Ring support again and they spent 3+ hours having me troubleshoot and test various combinations of resets and setups including turning off Bluetooth on my phone, deleting the app, restarting my phone, and waiting on updates that took over an hour. One representative led me on for well over 30 minutes providing ""percentage updates"" of 33% and 57%. He also stated that these issues were not as common in the newer models when asked (pretty much admitting that they know this product doesn't live up to the same quality checks as their other models).  Then as I'm waiting for the next progress update, he randomly says ""Have a good day!"" and disconnects. I immediately reconnected and was met with a representative that said there were no ways for them to see the progress of an OTA update and that they should never take more than 10 minutes. What!?! All in, I've spent 3 straight weekends trying to set up a device that after 4 collective hours of Ring support has finally been deemed defective. They've offered to send a replacement, but also stated ""There is nothing wrong with the model but this device you had was 1 out a tons that had this issue"". I'm not certain I'm willing to relive their nightmarish support again though if this replacement doesn't work and will probably just return it at that point. If you're looking at buying one of these Ring Doorbells, skip the entry level for the Video Doorbell 2, the Video Doorbell Pro, or the Video Doorbell Elite. It's clear from their support team that the standard version isn't worth their time to support or test anymore.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Mar-16,User of Products and Commmodities,"How sad. It promises to be great but really it's only marginal. Here's the real scoop, something you might not read on other reviews. The doorbell part is good. Fine, Works great, whether battery or on doorbell power. Note that you'll have to buy an overpriced resistor to wire this to your 24 volt transformer powered doorbell supply, but I'll take the hit. The bad news is that the first one was returned because it was too sensitive! Even at the lowest setting and at minimal 5 foot distance, the motion detector was going off every ten minutes. I tried a factory reset, had input from Ring technicians about the problem, and they finally conceded it was bad and I shipped it back (thank you Amazon!). Now the new one comes in, works great for a day or two, and then, even at the lowest setting, senses motion about every 10-15 minutes. Constant alarms that are so bad, I turned it off. Now you might think that it's really motion causing them, but NO. A truck goes by on the road (40 feet away) and it sees it. A breeze blows some leaves, 20 feet away, and it sees it. Often, nothing at all seems to trigger the motion detector, and it's such a continuous nuisance that it's better off turned off! Really ring? Just de-tune it a bit; that's all we ask!  It's well known in security electronics and fire protection that this is one of the main reasons people don't use alarm systems: the nuisance alarms. As a pro and an electrician, I well know that motion detection can be tuned and refined; it's done all the time on outside lighting, but somehow on Ring, this idea has been lost. At it's lowest setting, everything within 10 feet will trigger the motion detection, and it will record terabites of useless video. You'll have to manually delete these, one at a time on your device; be prepare to spend one evening a month erasing nuisance recordings! Now, here's the really offensive part. Ring not only won't let you mass-delete them, but after you've deleted a dozen or so, Ring software engineers have decided to piggyback ads for more Ring stuff on your delete command. So you hit ""delete recording"" and their television style video streams into your face, with two options: ""set up a device"" and ""Login."" But it does not matter if you log in or not, this does not change a thing, Ring still will not let you delete the recordings, instead opting for an advertisement! Head's up, Ring, this won't sell more of your stuff; it will only cause guys like me to write scathing reviews and people won't buy your product! I can't wait until my free  month is up so it won't save ANY RECORDINGS!  (I won't give them another $30.00 so they can prevent me from deleting recordings and stream continual ads into my iphone) Here's the scoop: doorbell good, don't set up to record, ever! Motion sensor absolutely useless... Ring, if you read this you really need to up your game, or Piper is going to smoke your butt and we can't wait for that to happen!","Doorbell good, motion sensor useless and recordings are trick advertisements!"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Dec-17,H. C. Hankin,I LOVE RING....yes I am yelling!  I started with the original Ring almost 2 years ago after seeing an old Shark Tank episode with Dorbot. I am not able to hard wire due to my recessed door frame so I relied on the battery.  When the Ring 2 came out with the ability to swap batteries without removing it I was all in.  I just recently set it up and it's better than expected.  I love being able to check in live.  Even though I don't need a doorbell at my back door I think I am going to set up the original ring just for security.  I had a strange visitor at my home one day when I was home and it was great being able to see before opening the door.  Also with doing screen shots of the video I was able to share it with neighbors on the Nextdoor app.  One who is retired law enforcement said it was the best video quality he has ever seen and couldn't believe it was from my doorbell and that was with the original Ring.  We've all seen the horrible videos from robberies where all you can make out is the person's shape and clothing.  The Ring video is so clear people could identify what kind of car he had in my driveway which is a good 30 feet from my door. The quality on Ring 2 is even better. I've had multiple people ask me about it after my post and many have since purchased at least one. A friend who has 4 homes installed them at all locations even though he has video surveillance because of how easy the app is to use. People at work are always asking about it and can't believe how great it is.  I think I may be one of your best advertisements.  I have purchase a couple as Christmas gifts for family members as well. I have needed to contact support and the reps are wonderful.  The charger connection corroded on my first Ring and I was sent a replacement right away.  Great product and a great company!,Great Product Great  Company Top noch customer service!

Sperling,"I mostly bought this for answering the doorbell, since I often can't quickly get to my door. Somewhat annoyingly, it's usually ~15 seconds from the time my phone notifies me someone is at the door until it connects to the video on the doorbell. It's not the end of the world, but just  a little annoying. The motion sensor is really bad though. My house is set back about 20 feet from the street. I've set the range of the motion detector to minimum, and the settings show it only looking for motion about 5 feet from my door, but I still frequently get notifications when cars drive by my house. As a result, I almost always just ignore the motion detector. My friends got the better version of the ring doorbell, and they said the motion detector was a lot better. Also, it says the video quality is high definition. It's definitely not. The videos are very pixelated. But the better version of the ring seems to have higher quality.",get a better version (good for answering doorbell; bad for motion detection; mediocre forrecordings)

It is built very well, came with everything I needed to install it. It says that in the description but I wanted to mention that in my review because it meant so much to me. As the outside of our home is masonry I did use the INCLUDED masonry drill bit. It worked great and this door bell is mounted solid as a rock on my home. I had just learned about video door bells by actually seeing a different brand. I then went to youtube to learn more about the one I saw and realized it only worked by a rechargeable lithium battery and could not install to my existing doorbell wiring. While I was on you tube I then discovered this Ring doorbell and learned about it. I then looked up reviews and read some articles about the different models available. Yes I like to do my research. For my needs....I didn't need any extra face plates, the clarity of the video described in all the reviews I read stated the difference in clarity from the 720p to the 1080p was marginal. There are a few other minor differences but for us this Ring Doorbell is awesome.  We've used it for about a week. Our daughter came to our home while I was at work. My mother in law told her I had installed this, so she thought she would check it out. I was at work and sure enough I received an alert to my cell phone. There I see my daughter and start conversing with her. I asked her how long was she at the door before she first heard me speak to her? She said about a second or two.  I was so amazed and so pleased. Some evenings I work late and my wife is home alone. Now knowing that she does not have to go to the door to answer it if she is home alone truly makes her and I feel more safe and secure. We highly recommend this product!",Yes!

THEN - our router went to hell. AT&T came out and put in another one. I spent 3 hours trying to set up the Ring. The call to support was ridiculous. They want your phone to be on WiFi. But forget that the Ring makes your phone switch networks to connect to the Ring-xxx network and the calls got dropped. The ""support technician"" called me back and I pointed this out to him. ""Oh. Huh. Right."" I ended up disabling the 5ghz band on my router as a last ditch effort as I had an inkling that the Ring didn't like 5ghz. Or something. Who knows? But literally right before I was going to return the thing, it made it through set-up. The motion activity is nice, but somewhat annoying as it rings when anyone leaves the house. That seems like something that should be accounted for. Who knows? I always try to remember that as far as wireless technology, we are in the age of the Model T but expect things to work better just because we think we are all that.

Still don’t like how the bracket is weird against my stucco but there’s not much I can do about that. I’ve been eyeballing the Ring doorbell for well over a year now and after researching multiple home surveillance systems, lightbulbs, nanny cams, and faux video doorbells I decided to go with the Ring. 1.) I have stucco walls so installation was NOT as easy as the instructions led on to believe. The bracket doesn’t sit flush w/the wall so screwing the bracket to the wall was frustrating. 2.) Nowhere did I see where it says the modem needs to be in close proximity in order for WiFi to work w/Ring. My modem is upstairs and my doorbell is obviously downstairs outside, I have yet to actually connect and see live feed. There is ZERO connection. If I cannot move my modem downstairs so it’s closer to the Ring, it’s going to be returned. 3.) I am worried about theft. They really need to make these so they’re less easy to steal.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Jun-19,Russell Bateman,"Used this for several months now. What's bad is a) it's hard to delete an event without causing it to come up loud (when you tap on the three-dot menu, most of the time, you get the event replay instead of the pop-up menu), so you can't risk cleaning up events unless you're alone where noise doesn't matter, b) local police reports can't be scheduled and the notification can't be muted, so whenever it arrives (you're in a movie theatre, business meeting, church, etc.) you and everyone around you must endure the notification, c) the neighborhood thing is questionable: many people put in completely irrelevant comments or questions (does anyone recognize this person who came to my door?), complaints, notifications (I lost my dog; has anyone seen it?); filtering these is nearly impossible. Basically, the app is written by developers who don't use it in the same environment as customers and there's no way to insulate yourself from thoughtless neighbors.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Dec-15,A Cheap Guy in Phoenix.,"I set mine up on battery power, with Ring and Motion alerts enabled.  I've gone through two devices in less than five months.  It's always something with this thing. The first doorbell always showed 100 percent battery right up until the battery died.  And, it just died.  No soft shutdown where it saved settings before turning off.  Just died.  After charging, I had to set it up all over again.  Just about the time I had realized how long the battery lasts, after using it for three months, it lost all audio functions. I finally got the replacement about a week later.  Unlike like the first one, the ring button didn't work right from the start.  At least the button on the first one lasted about a week.  It occasionally rings, but usually not.  Fortunately, when somebody walks up to the door, the motion detection picks them up at the sidewalk, then, when I finally get an alert twenty or thirty seconds later, they're standing at the door, after having already pushed the button that does nothing, so I can just start talking. That's IF I actually get a video feed with the option to answer the call.  That video feed with the option to answer the call quit happening this week.  All I can do is watch the recorded cloud video after it finally finishes saving to the cloud four or five minutes later.  After five complaints to support in four days about this, Ring finally admitted it was an issue on their end and that they have no idea when it'll be fixed.  So, if you buy a Ring doorbell right now, you won't be able to use it to answer your door.  Hint:  Don't buy one. I could even work around this issue if they would actually implement Live View like they've been promising.  But, they won't.  So, there's still no video on demand either.  Just like my old crazy aunt that used to deny your desert if you wore plaid on Tuesdays, Ring won't implement Live View for battery powered devices just cuz. In five months, I've replaced the device once, gone without audio for a week, and gone without being able to answer calls for at least a week. So, for two hundred bucks, you get a doorbell that only rings for about a week.  Two way audio that you can't use, and the ability to watch cloud videos that were recorded after the fact, in forty one second intervals.  Good luck with that. Since Ring claims Live View does work with hard wired devices, I have to go buy a doorbell transfer and some wire and hard wire the stupid thing in order to get a feature they claim to have, but won't give me, to work around another feature that they claim they have, but doesn't work.  I'm pretty sure once it's hard wired, it'll still be crap, so I'll update my review once I've done that.",Completely unreliable garbage.

The movement and doorbell ring notifications are very responsive (~1 second). The app is also well designed, intuitive and stable as far as I've used it. Installation was very easy and Ring is gracious enough to provide all the tools as well as super simple wifi setup. I had no issues setting it up or wiring it into my existing doorbell power. Complaints: Unit size: other competitors, including the ring Pro, have smaller form factors which would be nice especially if the batter option is not used or required. Construction: I was a bit disappointed at how fragile the doorbell felt, esp for a device that would live solely outside exposed to the elements. I would have preferred an aluminum construction or heavier duty housing. Responsiveness/Connectivity: the only area where I experienced lag was when attempting to connect to the doorbell via Live View; this takes a good 5 seconds to load (using iPhone 7, AirPort Extreme with >70Mbps down network). Both phone and doorbell have full signal strength. Camera: the biggest disappointments was the video quality. The picture shouldn't be 720p and is always pixelated to some degree, even in favorable lighting. My $75 Foscams have much sharper image quality. Other things to note: - I like the range of accessories and support available - Would have liked if the cloud storage for recordings was free (SkyBell has free storage) - I didn't even know Ring Pro was available until after I purchased! Bummer, would have liked the 5GHz and 1080p option, and smaller form factor. - No other ringtone or doorbell sound options? Really? - I like the security screws, but this thing seems so fragile someone is more likely to smash it than steal it. Overall, a solid product that does what it should and delivers on most fronts, though it doesn't slam dunk in some areas like build quality or video quality.

Set up and installation was super easy. I did not have an existing door bell so I was unable to hard wire it into the doorbell. I read from the product description that if this was the case I would need to remove the Ring at some point and recharge it. I didn't think it would only be less than three months before I needed to do that. I've tried lowering the sensitivity so it doesn't pick up on so much activity so I will see next battery recharge how that has helped. I also don't like the fact that you have to pay $3.00 a month for the ability to see your alerts/rings. I don't know if it's my wifi or what but there is a lag time between when I get a notification and when the video pops up. Most times when I get a notification that someone is at my door, the time it takes for the video to pop up, I've already had time to walk to the door and answer it or whoever it was is left waiting or is walking away already. This irritates me as I got the Ring because I do not have an existing door bell or a peep hole to be able to see. Maybe the problem is that I had unrealistic expectations, but either way I'm not overly impressed. I also should point out that I live on a dead end street with only 6 houses and unless you live down there you wouldn't even know the street was there so there's very little activity.

Nowhere in there literature do they admit to this purposeful design. Here are the reasons I hate it. 1. Marketing materials were not honest with me.

It dies extremely fast because it is basically always recording, only you can't go back and view the motion detection unless you pay more for their subscription service too (bummer). It doesn't even work properly as a doorbell because the connectivity is so slow remotely that by the time you get notified and ""answer"" the door, they are gone. When we were trying their free trial of the subscription service, where we could go back and view all past history, we had to turn off notifications because everything would make it go off. Don't buy this if there is anything at all that moves throughout the day. It would literally go off because of shadows from our trees on the sidewalk.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Feb-19,Vincent J. Kopriva,"UPDATED 2/17/19: After my initial encounter with Customer Support described below, a ""Neighbor Advocate"" reached out to me.  She indicated that she had reviewed the video I had previously sent and agreed that this was not the type of experience that they wanted their customers to have with their products, and arranged for me to exchange my unit for an upgraded unit better suited to my application.  The call was pleasant, quick and designed to resolve my concerns.  The new unit was shipped that day and arrived in three days, with notifications along the way.  Installation was easy, and the Advocate was available to answer any questions I had.  The new product works very well and I am pleased with the video quality and other features.  My review for the original product was 2-stars, and I don't know if this was the product or I received a defective unit.  What I do know is that the Ring Neighbor Advocate Team saw that they had an unhappy customer and worked quickly to change that.  For that reason, and the fact that the new unit is working well, I am changing my review to 5-stars. *** Purchased the unit in December 2018 and I have never been able to get video even close to 720P.  The unit responds fairly quickly, live-view works, audio works, and video works  -  kind of.  The quality of the recordings is so pixelated even in full daylight that you can't even recognize faces.  Everything else is OK (bandwidth, wi-fi signal strength, upload speeds, video settings, etc.). I uploaded a video to Customer Support, and he agreed that the video was very poor.  The Customer Support rep was polite, and tried to walk me through the standard steps (check wi-fi strength, reset the unit, etc.) but eventually said that because his records showed the unit was working as it should, there was nothing that he could do - but he did try to up-sell me to their ""Pro"" unit.  If I can't even get advertised 720 performance out of this unit and tech support can't resolve the issue, why would I purchase another Ring Product?  My Blink camera in the same location works just fine, and so I guess I'll just need to wait for the Blink Video doorbell to be released.",UPDATED: Video Quality - Issue Resolved
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jan-16,JohnAroundTheCornerReviews,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I first bought this unit in 2016 and only gave it three stars at that time because I was unable, even with CustServ help, to get it to both 1) ""see"" people walking up onto my porch and 2) NOT see cars driving by 40 feet away. I complained to them about battery life and too many car alerts. I told myself if they ever fixed my complaints, I'd revisit this review. Almost 12 months later, I dusted off the box and TRIED again. I again contacted Ring's Customer Service, and this time, a new agent, Jeffrey, was able to get it working AS I WANTED IT TO. Part of his method was to send me a NEW doorbell (lifetime warranty) and introduce me to new products that they invented. (I wonder if they invented those new products because of my 2016 complaints). Spacers now allow me to adjust the doorbell angle downward by 5°, 10° or 15°. They also created a solar charger. They effectively answered all of my complaints. I am very happy to change my rating to FIVE STARS. The 2018 version of the Ring Wi-Fi enabled Video Doorbell is a vast improvement over their 2016 doorbell, and INFINITELY better than my old (boring) doorbell. I would give Jeffrey TEN stars if I could. LATE 2017 SUMMARY: I finally decided to try again, got out the bell, recharged the battery, but it wouldn't work at all this time, so I e-mailed Customer Support. Jeffrey wrote back then called me and held my hand every step of the way. He diagnosed that I had a bad doorbell, sent me a replacement unit for free, even though it had been almost 12 months since purchase, and we got it working. When I continued to have occasional alerts from passing cars, he sent me some wedges to try, which cured that problem; and when I worried about how often I'd have to charge the battery, he made sure I got a solar charger to try. The unit at 15° detected some cats walking across my porch, so I now have it at 10° and it works great. I have it aimed at a 45° angle with a neighbor-made bracket from last year. At 10° and with my car parked where it is, I don't get any passing car alerts.  It recognizes people when they get to my steps. This doorbell is well worth FIVE STARS. A year ago, I said that if they could fix these problems, and especially make it less likely to ""see"" cars and not require me to charge the battery anywhere near as often; that I'd upgrade my rating. Well, they did. The new unit is better quality, they invented angle spacers to not recognize cars as much, and they came up with a solar charger which (even though my house faces north) is getting enough ambient light to not discharge much during winter. I look forward to summer charging when the morning sun will come in under the porch on my north side door. Thank you, Jeffrey, for AMAZING customer service. IMAGES: 0. Not shown: When Doorbell was mounted at 0° (default position), I occasionally detected a car on the street 40 feet from the door. 1. When I mounted the doorbell at a 15° downward angle, it occasionally gave me motion alerts for cats crossing the porch. Cat's image used without cat's permission. 2. Not shown: Since I remounted it at a 10° downward angle, it has not told me about any cats, nor has it told me of any cars. I believe I have struck a happy medium.","Not a bad unit, but it needs two improvements, especially a programming change for people who live 40 feet from their street"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Aug-20,Gwendolynn Merrick,"I owned two units 5 years ago and loved the product.  I purchased a new unit within the past 6 months and it’s a nightmare.  It detects motion, and when I try to check it, the motion video isn’t available for several minutes or it NEVER shows up.  The past two nights we have received multiple motion detection alerts on our cell phones (waking us in the middle of the night) with no corresponding video.  It’s useless and unnerving when you are trying to use it for security.  It mistakes motions for people and people for motions alllll the time.  If someone rings the doorbell, it’s many minutes before our cell phones “ring”.  It makes you FEEL like you have security and a doorbell when you really don’t.  EVERY single day, at least once, family members walk right through the front door without any notification at all or a notification that is so delayed, we would have all been slain if it were an intruder.  There are so many other issues, but these are the main problems.  I would NOT recommend this product.",Unreliable - Don't Bother
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Dec-16,ExAlaskan,"With almost 13,000 reviews we’re not sure what we can add to describe how great the Ring Video Doorbell is!  However, this is such a great product; we felt the need to share our opinion and experiences so hopefully this review will help others. We installed the standard Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell at our front door.  Installation was simplicity at its finest…simply replaced the existing wired door bell using the mounting items supplied.  The only thing we had to supply was a drill.  Using the “wired option” enables one of the most useful features….Live View.  Live View lets us look at activity on the front porch at anytime from anywhere.  The doorbell has lived up to all of our expectations. There is a treasure trove of information (including videos) on the Ring web site that can answer just about any question you might have about the product, the installation, and operation.  The only downside that others have mentioned is the $30/year fee for the Cloud Recording function that stores up to 6 months of video on the Ring servers.  In our opinion, this is a small price to pay for the additional convince and security of off-site storage of a video that could become very important if you have an incident that the doorbell captures. With all of the documentation available on the Ring web site, and the details provided here on Amazon, we decided to present an extremely abbreviated list of Pros and Cons. PROS •  Simple installation.  Package included everything (except labor and a drill) needed for a first class installation. •  Quick setup.  Had the unit up and operating in less than 10 minutes from the time we downloaded the app until we were looking at the first picture over WiFi. •  Doorbell can also be operated on battery.  Great for those who do not have a location with power for the doorbell.  All you lose on battery is the Live View function, and who knows, maybe a new version of the app will enable this function :-) CONS •  Fee required for Cloud Recording.  Not a show stopper for us but something to consider for those on a budget.  While the fee isn’t excessive, recurring costs can mount over time. This is a quality product that appears to be very durable.  Recommend you consider this product if you want the additional safety, security and convenience of remotely answering your door.  This product was not provided as a sample for this review.  None of these comments are influenced in any way by the seller.",Who's There?
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Oct-18,Dog Owner,"I've had this now for a couple of weeks and am very pleased.  I was a little apprehensive buying this after seeing so many reviews of false positives from passing cars and pedestrians.  But as I read the instructions, I realized that since you had to come up a few steps to get to my porch,  my placement was going to be higher than the 48"" recommended in the documentation.  So I did a little research and bought a wedge kit.  I used two wedges to give my self a good angle and the only false positive I've had was the garbage truck picking up my trash from the curb.  Ironically,  it has missed picking up the mailman a couple of times, but I can't seem to recreate the issue with any other delivery persons or visitors, so I suspect he is an alien in disguise.  (more likely his uniform blends in with the bright backgrond).  I've been very pleased with the unit overall.",you could need a wedge kit
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Apr-18,Ilka Marsh,"We  had been thinking about getting one of these for a while, after the package bomber scare here in Austin.  Then we saw that they are now working with our Echo and that made us act.  Unfortunately, you cannot talk via Alexa, only see the video, but that's still better than what we had before.  Since it works via wifi, there are some inherent limitations, but if you have connection issues, you can usually solve those with an extender.  Also, our phones save the videos when we look at who is at the front door, so it really isn't necessary to spend the extra money on backing them up to the cloud.  We initially signed up to have somebody install it, but it turned out to be very simple to do.  All tools come with it, even a very clever little snap-on level.  We replaced a wired door bell.  Since it was mechanical, nothing special needed to be done and our doorbell still sounds the same.  Digital doorbells need an extra step to connect but, again, everything you need is included.  The installation video is very helpful, too.  We are definitely satisfied with our purchase!",Glad we got it
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Jul-16,Emskware,"This sounded like a good idea at the time, but now I'm sorry I bought it.  Nothing but problems with it.  First, it was not ringing on my cell phone when someone rang the doorbell.  I spent several hours chatting online with a tech, and then on the telephone.  Finally we figured out how to get it to ring on my cell phone.  But the only notification I receive from the motion sensor is a light vibration, which I don't hear unless I'm on top of my cell phone.  Then there's a problem with the motion sensor itself.  I have fiddled with the settings countless times.  It will register motion if a car passes by my house (I only have the sensor set for 10 feet, and the street is more than 40 feet from the camera), but not if a delivery person drops a box in front of my front door.  It will also register motion and when I look at the video, there has been no motion.  I tried troubleshooting online but it shows me videos that bear no resemblance to what I see on my app.  I just hung up from a phone call with a support tech who sounded like I just woke him up.  He couldn't tell me what to do.  He said the troubleshooting videos on my app are for another upgraded version of Ring.  He suggested that I tilt the unit down.  Huh????  The unit is flush against a brick wall.  Then he said, no, tilt the unit, not the bracket.  How do you tilt the unit when it's fastened to the bracket which is flush to the wall?  Unbelievable.  Think again before you buy one of these.",Sorry I Bought This

Our door doesn't have a peep hole or anyway to see who is at the door which has been driving me crazy for 5 years! My husband installed it in about 10 minutes and we had fun testing it out immediately. My only issue is that our doorbell isn't ringing due to a lack of power to the unit which is a bummer. We usually always have our phones with us so that hasn't been a problem. I was surprised how great the camera quality is for the price of this product! The color daytime views and night vision works perfectly with crisp clear images/video. I was shopping at the store when my phone vibrated alerting me someone was at the door, I was then able to tell the mail carrier we would pick up the package at the post office- Amazing! The app works well and connects quickly allowing you to talk to visitors with ease. Having the video stored in the app is so nice too if you ever have an issue with a package being stolen!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Jul-19,T. Kato,"My doorbell is mounted to the side of my door and the camera captures a good (not great) image of my covered front porch.  The covered porch provides a nice shade and the camera picks up people well (in terms of contrast), but the image to the street gets washed out. 720P image quality is more like 480i in my opinion,  I have a good WiFi signal (RFFI -54) so i know that is not the problem. Perhaps the Ring Video Doorbell 2 with the 1080P camera would address many of the shortcomings of this doorbell, but hard to justify at double the price.  While better video quality would be nice, it doesn’t bother me much now that most of the novelty wore off. The doorbell itself was easy to install, I replaced an existing doorbell so I have constant power. The Ring App is great and really what got me to buy this doorbell.  What I especially like is the Neighbors Feed as people post real events that happened at their front door as well as the map.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that so many people had ring doorbells in my community.  I think the subscription fee is reasonable.",Good doorbell. Great App.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Jan-20,keylimejet,"Pros - It was easy to install. The camera picture is clear and it has a good peripheral range. The app seems to work pretty well. Cons - Our front door is about 25 feet from the street. We have the range of the motion detector set to the bare minimum, where it should only pick up motion if someone is on our front porch, but it still goes off every time a truck drives by. Cars don't seem to trigger it as much. There have also been a couple of instances where I know someone came through the front door, and nothing triggered - no alert or record of the entry. Overall, we're happy with this product for the price. We live in a small town, in a quiet neighborhood. There's very little crime. If we lived somewhere busier, or where crime was more of a concern, I would probably invest in a more sophisticated system.","So far, so good"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Dec-17,SinisterSnowgod,"So far I'm pretty dissapointed in my new Ring.  The live feed option just shows a blank screen for starters and takes forever to load.  The support forums basically chalk that up to being poor wifi signal but all my tests from next to the device show in excess of 50mbs download and 20+ up with very low latency.  I'll move my wifi router closer to it when I get around to it to see if that improves the performance but I doubt it given current tests.  Something wifi can't be blamed on is the lag or latency in start up.  My Ring is in an apartment building and is pointing all the way down a long hallway.  I have the sensitivity set to maximum distance for motion detection but it still takes so long for the camera to start up that I can easily walk down the hallway at a normal rate of speed, unlock my door and enter my apartment without the camera picking me up and by the time it is recording I get 20 seconds of empty video.  So far the only thing it's really useful for is the doorbell feature but I already had a doobell so yeah.

However, WiFi connectivity issues (using a $400 nighthawk router on spectrum ultimate that is literally 5ft away from doorbell) and battery run time are huge drawbacks. I have the ring floodlight as well, (basically a $300 floodlight) and the only reason I’m giving the doorbell 2 stars is because I have to admit their customer service does try hard to please their customers. My floodlight failed, and they did send me a replacement pretty quick, (although the replacement was also defective and the issue still hasn’t been resolved) so I commend them for at least making the effort. The battery operated ring falls victim to the same WiFi connectivity issues as the floodlight and the battery simply just doesn’t last. Obviously the newer model, with removable batteries might be the way to go, but I’m apprehensive to try until they get the WiFi bugs worked out. Also, like everyone else has mentioned, the motion detection could use a lot of work, more often than not, the ring starts recording AFTER the person is already walking away.","Short battery life, WiFi connectivity issues, bad motion detection"

However with both my daughter and I there were issues, different ones but issues. She has a complicated password with characters on her WiFi which Ring doesn't work with. After three calls to Ring she had to change her WiFi password. There were also connectivity issues for her that delayed the setup. Hers took almost 2 hours and 3 calls to Ring bit did work. Mine was easier but still took half an hour. The other issues is the delay from someone triggering the device till the video pops up on your phone. Normally by the time it pops up the person is gone. Not a horrible issues but if you wanted to see who was at the door before answering it would be a problem. That's not why I got the unit so for me not a concern.

Then we had someone ride up on a bike and stick something to my doorknob, and the ring didnt even detect him til he was backing away from the door! I have no use for this now. We got the Pro and its significantly better, but beware - the pro needs a lot more power and you might have to get a power kit from them for it to work.

However, the doorbell records cars driving by 30 yards away every time in the top half of the frame. The annual subscription, I'm finding out, is a waste of money because the doorbell doesn't pick up on anything of value. The doorbell itself is not worth the money. It's sluggish in response. The 2-way communication works half of the time.  A pretty poor product that needs to go back to the drawing board.

I bought the item used, and it stated in the description that there was some ""cosmetic damage"" on the exterior of case. When it arrived, the bottom of the unit that holds the two set screws to lock it in place was all scratched up and the screw head slots were so stripped up that I haven't yet been able to get one of them out. I did manage to get the other one to screw out, and was able to force the unit onto the bracket without breaking off any of the plastic tabs, but now I only have one screw to lock it down. Even so, it works well, and I've been able to ""answer the doorbell"" from work and other places, and to see when packages arrive. I turned a salesman away when my wife and I received a doorbell notice while having dinner at a local restaurant. I told him that we had just sat down to dinner and that this wasn't a good time for us. I wasn't lying, as we had literally just sat down for dinner. What I didn't tell him was that we were 15 miles from home at the time. We have only had a couple of false alarms early in the mornings when birds have flown too close to the unit and when our yardman passed too close when mowing the lawn. Other than that, it has worked flawlessly. I have taken the unit off once to charge the battery and link it to our new Wi-Fi router. I had no issues taking it off or snapping it back into place. It has already been worth the price (and most of the frustration).

Wide angle could do a better job of getting floor so we can see what’s sitting on the doormat. The optional tilt mount cost is price gouging. Battery life is good. Easy to connect with Alexa. Wish there was an option so Alexa would show the live video when motion is detected.

The setup was a little difficult, but I eventually got it going properly. I bought this version based on price and the vast number of positive reviews. I really like the look of the unit, installation was simple, night vision was clear as well as daytime streams, the times it caught video from doorbell interactions the sound and image was clear and clean. On the other hand, I originally set the sensor to avoid the street, but it still picked up vehicle movement. I eventually set it to the setting closest to the unit and still, I pick up each and every car that goes by. It won’t however always pick up when someone (Amazon, USPS,et al) goes and drops something off on the porch. Lastly, it throws out more than negligent amounts of glitch recordings where the image is all black. I noticed it does this when the unit glows blue. That said, for me the cons considerably outweighed the pros. Sending it back.",At best: less than mediocre.

I can see every movement without leaving my recliner.  It's great to see who is moving around in the yard or on my porch or patio. I can also see who is at my door before opening it, I think it is great.  The only drawback I have found is after a year you have to sign up for it to catch all movement and it will not let you see a live view without signing up...otherwise it is a great item.  I did sign up for $30 a year for both so I can see all movement outside my home but that is just my preferance.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Mar-19,Karen,"The software is very simple to set up. I did not connect mines to the pre-existing doorbell, instead I installed it a few inches away from the doorbell. This was an upgrade from the security doorbell/camera I had bought 3 years ago. The one thing that I do not like is that the doorbell has to be taken off the wall in order to charge it. This leaves the home un-monitored during the re-charging of the battery. (There is a newer model available for $199 with a removable battery, not sure if you can purchase replacement batteries). So back to the $99 Ringbell...Because I have an electric outlet near the front door, I was able to attach the USB charger to the back of the Ringbell, enabling it to always have electric power. I had to use approx 3 inch screws to hang the Ringbell to the wall, in order to compensate for the charger being inserted to the back of the Ringbell. Otherwise, easy install, can share suspicious neighborhood videos with neighbors, live video feed, wide viewing angle are what makes this a great security addition to any home.",Easy set up and operation
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Mar-18,RLunder,"Works great!  Motion alerts and ringing doorbell alerts work great and camera image is very sharp and clear.  It's a little tricky setting up the motion detection zones and distance sensitivity, and there is a slight recording delay after motion is detected.  This resulted in recordings only showing the backs of someone walking away from my door...especially if they walk fast.  Also, the motion detection range does not seem to have much effect.  I had hoped this would help identify package thieves, but not if it only shows their backs?  I am still tinkering with the Motion Detection settings hoping to find the sweet spot, but I think the 2-3 second delay in starting the recording is the real problem. I finally gave up trying to get the motion detection set up so that it would record people approaching my door, and not their backs as they were leaving.  I called Ring Technical Support, and was pleasantly surprised as to how helpful they were.  I spoke with Patrick who was on the line with me for well over an hour running tests and finally concluded that I needed a Wedge Kit to aim my Ring Doorbell downward to prevent picking up motion from street traffic passing by my house.  He sent me a Wedge Kit and it arrived about 3 days later (no Charge !!) The Wedge Kit consisted of 3 angled mounting plates that adjust the angle upward or downward 5 degrees each.  I installed two Wedges and tested my Ring Doorbell and that appeared to solve the problem of picking up false motion alerts from street traffic, however the next morning I got a few more false alerts.  I installed the third Wedge and that fixed the false motion alerts but still detected motion of anyone spproaching my door within about 10-12 feet. My only complaint is that the Wedge Kit only comes in White and look cheap and clunky, but a quick shot of black paint fixed the color to match my black Ring Doorbell but still looks cheap and stupid. I am still wondering why the Ring Doorbell does not have some sort of software adjustment to frame the exact Motion Detection target area horizontally and vertically to easily exclude all areas where false alerts would be detected.  I have $20 security cameras that have this advanced technology, but the Ring Doorbell costing 5 - 7 times as much requires mechanical wedge spacers to aim the motion detection up and down?? Ring's technical support was terrific and the wedges worked.  But even after painting them black  to mach my Ring Doorbell, they still look  cheap and clunky on an otherwise high-quality product. UPDATE:  About 2 weeks after installing wedges to aim the Ring doorbell camera downward, it started giving me false alerts every few minutes.  This started when the weather warmed up and appears to be triggered by the changing shadows from trees blowing in the wind or simply a cloud crossing in front of the sun??  Also, the motion detector does not record people coming to my door unless they ring the bell.  I have people deliver packages to my door and I never get an alert, but my $20 security camera picks them up immediately...without fail.  Without a more precise and reliable adjustments for the motion detector the Ring doorbell is worthless to me.  The Ring doorbell system may work well as a remote doorbell answering system, but the motion detection is worthless. UPDATE-2:  The Ring Doorbell Camera is worthless...there is a very long delay in detecting motion and recording.  All you get is peoples backs as they leave.  If people ring the bell, it takes so long to get the image up on your phone even when I am home, they have already left.  The TV commercials for Ring are total BS.  It will not alert you fast enough to detect people walking up to your door or to carry on a conversation with them.  All you will see is their backs walking away.  Someone could quickly walk up, take a small package off your porch and walk away.  Ring will probably detect them, but  the video will only show them walking away!","Expensive, and worthless !!"

The Ring ecosystem is bait and switch, pure and simple. After the 30 day trial is over, the Ring is virtually useless.  Any movement or alert still comes through to your phone, but it's live video only.  The delay of several seconds means that whatever person has come, or package was dropped, or prankster/theif has come - has already happened, and you can't see anything but the backside of a person running away, or nothing at all. You're left wondering - ""what caused this alert"".  Also, it will not connect to Alexa or amazon devices. I got this in July and tried for a few weeks/months off and on to get it to connect to an Echo Dot, and a Fire TV box, but nothing. Nothing at all.  Buyer beware, afaik Ring lies about Alexa compatibility and sets up a bait & switch for their paid monitoring subscription service.  Don't buy a Ring.

The upfront cost is very reasonable.  But we did end up purchasing the monthly video usage/storage, so that's just a recurring cost to own.  Also, it's very annoying to have to recharge the battery.  Since we've owned it, I've had to fully charge the doorbell twice.  So twice in 6 months.  We do live in front of a street, so the motion detection will pick up cars.  I've adjusted those settings but I wish it could be even more configurable.  Also, we live in the Chicagoland area and it got super cold in January and February, which probably contributed to the battery life.  Nothing we can do about that.  Overall, I'm happy but I really wish we connected it to the home power vs using it on battery.  Oh, it also takes a long time to fully recharge the battery (... hours).

Ring saw my original review, kept below for transparency, and replied within 24 hours of my posting. They asked me some questions about my doorbell and I answered because I wish them no ill will, the doorbell just didn't work well for me. After some troubleshooting on their end, they've narrowed it down to an oversensitive motion detector. Then they offered to send me the new v2 doorbell for free to fix it. I didn't expect anything from my original post nor even from following up with them. But they stand behind their product enough that they wanted to make everything right, no matter what. That's exceptional. I've changed my review to 5 stars because I can only dream of every product being backed by its maker like that. Serious kudos to Ring. You guys turned a customer who was disappointed but meh into an advocate for life. --- The original: It's a great idea, hampered by being so battery efficient it slowly wakes up then tries to connect to wifi, establishing a signal just in time for you to admire the back of whoever came as they leave. There's a new update that lets you set it to be less efficient and wake faster. This is like the difference between a teenager and a college student: one may wake faster than the other but they're both useless at it.

Cons: But common sense should also tell you that you will not have always-on live video if you rely on the battery and do not have a wired installation. For fast response and good quality video you need a STRONG wifi connection. The recommended NETGEAR N300 Wi-Fi Range Extender, Essentials Edition (EX2700). Works fine and is inexpensive. You will most likely be wanting to add their cloud storage and the charge is per Ring door or camera device. When the Heat Index is over 100 degrees, the Ring seems to have some problems detecting motion . . . since the background is warmer than the person approaching? Plus: While the manual and online help is good, it is a complicated device, BUT the.... Biggest plus is if you have any installation or setup problem, call Ring. They will talk you through it. You will get a US based, English speaking, well trained and friendly technical support person. So, forget your ego and save a lot of time and CALL for assistance. Battery operated on a door that gets a lot of Motion triggers per day still has 40% charge after 3.5 months. Other two Rings are at 95% after 1 month and 80% after 2.5 months. It works great with my iPhones. While all phones share the same Ring devices, each phone and app installation needs its own Ring account. If you have a problem setting up multiple phones...CALL. I have 3 up and operating fine. 2 needed wifi range extenders, not to work, but to work excellently. Alert: Buy sold by Amazon or Ring. Trying to save a few $ buying 3rd party might get you a not really new device. I don't mean just open box, but a unit someone installed and repackaged and returned. I gave it 5 stars even with those cons because they are all things you should have read about before deciding to buy, and most are also just common sense, if you think about it.

The trucks are about 50' away. The timing of people approaching it seems off, where I get recordings some time after they've approached.

I'm so disgusted with this company right now...once my year is up for the cloud storage I paid I am going elsewhere...hoping Skybell or August doorbells are better than this. I've had the Ring doorbell for about six months now and I love it and hate it at the same time. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it takes too long to connect the doorbell to your iPhone/iPad. I too have the fastest WiFi available and it still takes tok long. By the time connection is established, the person at the door is long gone 90% of the time. The notification is also to subtle. It would be better if the iPhone rang like an incoming phone call. But when your guest actually waits for you to answer it is one of the coolest things. I can remotely unlock the door from upstairs when paired with a Smart door lock. Another huge issue is the motion detection. I have it set to maximum sensitivity and I still usually get recordings of people's backside. Worthless if it's someone stealing the package from your front door. Lastly, I hear they are working on introducing live streaming. This is great but when?!?!? This is one of the biggest reasons why I don't recommend getting this doorbell and the sole reason why I haven't purchased the Stick Up Cam. Add this feature and I'm sure sales will increase drastically. If you're thinking of purchasing this product, I'd wait for a bit. But if you really need a video doorbell, it's probably your best option at the moment.",Don't buy this junk..save your money and time!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Feb-19,Val Stevens,"1. The doorbell doesn't seat tight in the wall plate, so if you want the doorbell to ring the indoor wired door chime you pretty much have to duck tape them together. 2. Once duck taped together it makes it even more difficult to recharge the battery.  You basically need to take the doorbell off the wall plate and plug it into a USB overnight to recharge.  At least the charge holds for a fairly long time. 3. Probable the most important thing hear is that you must purchase a cloud based ring protect plan to use.  This is a subscription starting at $30 per year/$3 a month.  If you don't pay this then the doorbell is simple that.. A Door bell. you cant access or see any videos.  Very disappointing to realize I have to continue to pay for this device forever. 4. Possible not related to just the ""Ring"" company, but my hope was when I purchased this item was that as somebody rings the doorbell, that video would immediately show on the ""Alexa Show"" device so I know who is at the door?  Not possibly with this doorbell, haven't figured out if that works with a different doorbell.  You can ask Alexa to show me the front door, but by the time it shows, you need to have already answered the door.",A couple disappointing features.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Aug-17,cccamazon,"I had high hopes for the Ring, but it has turned out to be a disappointment. WiFi: The most annoying thing is that whenever it loses WiFi connection, you have to physically disconnect the ring from your front door, push a reset button on the back, go through the whole set up process on your cell phone, and reconnect the device to your door. Why??? Every other smart home device I own (Nest, indoor cameras, not to mention my computer or cell phone) can momentarily lose WiFi connection and reconnect automatically without me doing anything. If I'm out of town and my Ring loses WiFi connection, it's absolutely useless until I get home. Isn't that the whole point of having the Ring? That I can check it while I'm away? The second-most annoying thing about the Ring is that it will record any passing car even if I set the field of motion to be pretty narrow. At the same time, I'll have visitors come into my home and the Ring doesn't record them approaching the house -- it only starts recording after the door is open and they are walking in, so you can't even see who it was that entered. This means it would be useless in the case of a break-in. So, if you don't have a 100% bullet proof WiFi connection, don't get this. And if your main motivation is to have a security camera (and you live in an urban area) then I wouldn't recommend it because it'll record what you don't want (cars) and not record what you do want (people). If you have really solid WiFi outside your home and you only want this as a doorbell, then it should work fine.","Wifi is a pain, doesn't record when I want it to"

Has a weak connection. It is only at 40. That's not bad, but considering my router (high end router with 8 antennas) is less than 10 feet away it should be much better. Live video is slow to load. When I answer the door from my device the video loads pretty fast but the audio is horrible. Audio is of poor quality and I am continually having to repeat my self. The person at the door only hears part of what I am saying. Overall I would not waste my money on this again. UPDATE: I added a star for one reason only. Customer support. When I wrote the review above I was contacted by customer support and they offered to upgrade me to the latest door bell they had. I was not expecting that. They clearly care about customer satisfaction. But unfortunately I still would not get this door bell. When using my cell phone and someone rings the door bell the video loads so slow by the time I can answer they have already started to walk away. It doesn't happen that way every time. I would say 60/40. On wifi at work it does load quicker. As far as the audio quality goes. Its not good. Very difficult to have a conversation with someone. Mine does not work like it does on the commercials. The wifi could be stronger considering my router is only 10 feet away. I have tried both 2.4 and 5.0 connections.

I purchased the ring and started the set up. It connected right away and worked for about 2 minutes. I attempted the the set up process again and about 100 more times including changing wifi channels and resetting the device. I called Ring.com and proceeded to spend an hour on the phone with them not being able to figure out the issue either. They sent me a new device and spent another few hours trying to set up the new one with the same issues. I even went and replaced my modem and router in hopes that would fix the issue. Spent another hour reading through online troubleshooting which was also no help. Spent another hour on the phone with ring.com when the customer service representative disconnected the call and didn’t bother to call back. Nothing you buy should be this difficult.

There must have been a design flaw in the first model I was sent as it would keep losing connectivity to my network or maybe it was just a bad unit.  After troubleshooting the issues with Ring, customer service replaced my unit with a newer unit.  Ever since I have hooked up the newer version (no contacts on the bottom half of the wall mount) we have not had any issues with alerts and recordings. Syncing the Ring with our home network was quick and painless as the program walks you through the setup. The pairing with the Ring app on our phones was super easy (iPhones and Android).  We all get alerted when someone comes and we can all view what is being recorded with sound in real time.  This is great when packages get dropped off at our house, a little less to worry about someone else walking up and helping themselves these days. Just like in the commercials, you can be just about anywhere and be able to talk to or just listen to what is being recorded in real time with your cell phone. You can log on with a computer but you can only review what has been recorded.  Ring currently offers a free 30 day trial of backup video with a subscription service after the trial.  Everything you need to install this unit is in the box other than a drill (if needed).  Setup instructions are straight forward and easy to understand. So far we really like having a fairly inexpensive security camera for the front of the house. The only complaints I have with the unit, and they are minor, is that most of the time someone approaches the front of our house, ring doesn't pick up right away, more so during the day.  We typically do not get video until they have passed the unit.  We have the range set for approximately 20-25ft from the unit (which is simple to adjust).  It will pick up cars in the street when my neighbors are coming/going, but does not always pick up someone walking up our driveway or on our walkway.  This could just be a heat signature issue because it is heat and movement activated.  The picture is washed out initially during the day, thanks to bright shiny So Cal days  but clears up nicely after a second to adjust.  The picture is good for night time video but don't expect too much detail since the unit uses a bluish-white light.  Other than those minor issues, the unit is a great deal and comes highly recommended!",Great deal on a easy DIY security unit!

That is until Prime day when they went on sale. So I got one and overall I'd say it's just OK. If not for the price, I would have rated it a 3. The motion settings drive me nuts and it seems like no matter how I set it, it still goes off when a car drives by. Sometimes it notifies me right away when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell...and sometimes there is this really long delay.

Looks pretty good, the oiled bronze matches my door hardware. Easy installation, the package contains everything you need and directions are clear. I had a hickup in getting the motion sensor to work, but finally got it to work after resetting the interior button. What i dont like is the motion sensor video delay. Its great at getting the back of someones head, or a car driving away, but never captures the motion of the person as the door is approached, which is kind of the whole point. It captures if the person stands thete long enough. Also, when someone rings the bell and the app is accessed to see who it is, it takes a while for the image to load. By this time the person is ringing again, knocking, or walking away. My internet is pretty fast, so im not sure why it takes so long to load.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Apr-19,Babs075,"I purchased this as a doorbell because my doorbell is installed on vinyl siding. People don’t realize they have to push my original doorbell really hard so It would never ring and I would not know they were there. With Ring I not only hear them I see them! I also can check out my door live from work if I choose. I did not get II or the pro but I probably would get II if I get another for the upgraded camera. This one works just fine for my purposes but my house is set back so far it would allow a clearer view. I used Scotch outdoor double sided tape to install on the aluminum trim and didn’t hard wire it to my door bell because I am renting and didn’t want to drill holes plus the siding wouldn’t have allowed it to sit flush. Setting it up was very easy and I’ve had to play around with the settings because if you have it on motion and alert, depending on what setting you have it goes off a lot. Squirrel  movement, cars going by, etc. I forgot to turn off the alert at bedtime and it went off a couple times that night like 2 something and 4am. When I played it back you could hear an animal ( probably a deer) on the drive. I’ve gotten it worked out now.🤗 Any lags or delay in opening the view have been because of my WiFi which is not great so that needs to be boosted, but for my needs it works great! Placement is tricky if you are using the camera for more then just the door but if your door isn’t offset, it would really cover your whole front. More then I expected from just a doorbell!

This Ring wi-fi enabled doorbell seemed to be the best to fit my needs. A friend installed it for us in about five minutes.

We all tested it out and it worked perfectly with our hundred-year-old doorbell chimes. Usage: the directions in the app are very easy and it gives you a lot of options. We all tried it out and the pictures are clear and the voice reception very good. Great at nighttime also. As for the reception, our router (not a high-end  five year old router) is in the middle of the house on the second floor and we haven't had problems with the video, so I'm not bothering with a signal booster. My only wish is that it was a bit smaller width and lengthwise, and that there were a few more choices of covers (antiqued or whatever)  but that's not a problem, more of an aesthetic issue for me, as I live in a Craftsman-style house.

Things that you should be aware of before buying it....This particular item will not show you a live view, you need to order the pro for that, but still works great on picking up any motion in the area you designate...You may want to order the chime along with this, or you will not be able to hear the doorbell if your phone is on silent...  Lastly although you can recharge the battery, it seems to lose charge very fast.  I fully charged mine yesterday and just 24 hours later, it's already only at 88 percent.  The brochure will tell you the battery will last 6-12 months, so i'm finding that hard to believe.  I'm hoping this is due to everyone in my house wanting to test it throughout the day.  The good thing is that you can check your battery life from your phone or computer, so you are able to recharge it before it goes dead.  In the pictures, I took the night view at 9 pm, with very low light in my area.  However when testing it to see what I wanted to do with the interior of the garage it is very hard to see anything when there is low lighting.

Experienced a problem with the basic Ring related to power consumption. Even though hardwired, the primary source of power appears to be the battery, which is depleted quickly with frequent motion alerts and frequent use of ""live view"". The battery should be able to continually charge, but apparently it wasn't charging fast enough. Experienced ""poor"" signal strength and weak battery. Ring customer support is very responsive by phone and email. Purchased the Ring (basic) video doorbell from an Amazon third-party seller. We had just returned the Skybell after a very brief and unfortunate experience, including a lack of Skybell customer service. Ring seemed like the only other inexpensive option. I’m probably going to be disappointed when the 30 day free trial of video storage expires, but overall, Ring is doing exactly what we wanted. It was very easy to set up and the instructions were accurate. The set up takes place before attaching the unit to the wall. That was a good idea and we were able to test the video and bell before installing it. We hardwired it to an existing doorbell, but there is a built in battery that is said to last about a year, so this is a good option for locations without an existing doorbell. I have the motion range set nearly to the maximum and have received alerts only when someone is on the property, in the driveway, or at the door. It has not been triggered by activity at the next door neighbor’s property, which is actually within video view, but outside of the set motion range. It also hasn’t been triggered by street activity. The motion detection is perfect so far. Some reviews have said that the connection is too slow to see people when they’re approaching, but that’s not been our experience. We are alerted as soon as there is nearby activity and the video seems to be in real time. The sound quality is also good. Not perfect, but more than adequate for a doorbell. Video and audio quality may be related to having high speed internet and a whole house mesh network to cover outside devices. I wish the video storage was free. Even if it was only for a few days of storage. That would be long enough to review video in the event of a problem. I don’t plan to subscribe to video storage. The app is very basic. It would be nice if the chime could be changed. There’s a volume control, but no ability to change the sound. My husband is partially deaf and he doesn’t always hear the chime’s particular tone.

The camera is pretty bad. It’s hard to get a clear picture of the persons face if they’re not standing still, especially at night. That usually only happens when they’re ringing the doorbell and waiting for an answer. The motion detector is useless if you live within 40 feet of a street. It picks up every car that drives buy and kills the battery. If you lower the range it picks up people as they’re walking away. I get a picture of my mailman walking away everyday. Couldn’t tell you what he looks like though. If you lower the sensitivity to the recommended setting it only picks up half the time. I’ve got cars driving by, yet I mowed the entire lawn in front of it and it never went off. My mail magically delivers itself because there’s no video of the mailman dropping it off. If I raise it to the next one then it goes off every 2 minutes and I have to charge it every 3 days. Unfortunately I drilled holes in my brickwork to mount this thing. I eventually ended up mounting an actual camera (not made by ring) in the front yard, lowered all the motion settings on the ring and now use it as a basic doorbell.

Maybe its just me but a multi second lag is not terribly desirable for a door bell.  Same goes for the announcement of movement, there seems to be a relatively long delay.

Do not simply install the ring in the same spot of your existing doorbell as per instruction. My handyman followed that and I cannot fault him for not using his common sense. i suggest you stand in front of the position of the doorbell and estimate if that will be a good angle to capture your audience before installation. we realized in hindsight it should be in a spot free of obstruction (ring now faces the roman pillar directly in front of the door bell instead of a clear view). to uninstall and reinstall in a better spot will cost me more money so i just left it. After downloading the app etc, took a few tries to figure best angles and distance that works. If too far, it captures every moving vehicle from the neighbors' . if too close, it does not video the people walking towards the house. so i just left it a the farther angle which means the video kicks off very often and my ring bell alert sound very often unnecessarily.. it is very useful in many other ways and I wish i had it long ago.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,19-May-18,Edward Barnett,"Installation: Hard to get all four holes lined up just right on a stucco wall. Would be much easier if the Ring back plate had slots rather than small round holes for the screws, so you could cheat the mounting plate to get it level. Also, the top right prong on the mounting plate wouldn't lock into the slot on the Ring doorbell (even before the plate was mounted on the wall), so there's a gap between the mounting plate and doorbell at the top, so the gasket doesn't form a tight seal, so rain can get it, and that's bad. Use: Sometimes the Ring doorbell senses motion right away. Other times I can do a complete waltz in front of the camera and it won't turn on. Also, there's a significant delay between when someone approaches the door and when the Ring doorbell alerts my phone and when the app manages to finally get a video on screen, even when I'm on wifi. I usually get an image on screen just in time to see the back side of the person who is walking away after standing in front of the door for a while. Other times, the Ring doorbell senses and connects very quickly. No rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. Reliability: The Ring doorbell worked fine for 3-4 days, then it disconnected from the network and I couldn't access it at all. The fix required removing the doorbell from the wall and physically pressing the orange reset button on the back. That's OK if the Ring doorbell is at your home, but if you're using it for a vacation or rental property, having to fly to the other location to manually reset the device is a big drawback. Integration: Sometimes the Amazon Echo Show will show a view from the doorbell, and sometimes not. The instructions say that Alexa may not be able to contact the Ring if it's been a while since someone was at the door. This means you generally can't use the Ring to get a view of what's going on outside unless someone actually rings the bell. Bottom Line: A decent device, and probably as good as any smart doorbell on the market today (spring 2018), and at a good price, but functionality and reliability aren't quite there yet. I could recommend Ring to a gadget lover, but not to my mother.","For gadget lovers, not grandmothers. Still quirky."

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Sep-15,M S,"I like the RIng doorbell. Pros:  Easy enough to set up if you know the right end of a screwdriver and know how to use a drill to mount it on an exterior wall. It works with my exsisting doorbell wireing and chime. Setup video is easy to watch and learn from. When someone rings my doorbell, I get an alert within 1-5 seconds which I feel is good. Video quality is good. Sound is ok to good. Sometimes the sound is a bit choppy at first but levels out so the conversation is understandable. Cons: The biggest negative I have is with the motion detection.  I was picking up people walking on the sidewalk (about 30 from my front door) and cars and trucks passing by my house (about 40 feet from my door). I live on a 2 way street that gets quite a bit of traffic. So I had to turn down the sensitivity to only the first 5 feet from my door as well as putting the app on the ""light"" setting. Now with the motion detection set to the lightest settings, I still get ""false"" alerts when a large vehicle passes by such as a school bus or UPS truck. PLEASE work on this. Another negative (which goes with the above) is since I have RING set to the ""lightest"" setings , when someone walks up to my door, it takes a few seconds to start recording so the peoson is already at my door. I should be able to set the motion sensor to alert me & start recording when someone it about 10 feet from my door AND NOT pick up passing vehicles 30-40 feet away. Please work on this. Also, this device needs to allow the user to just be able to turn on the video camera just to watch outside whenever we want. Fix these few things and you will have a GREAT product.

Had a Arlo camera above my front door that worked well but had no doorbell.  Installed this Ring and connected to wifi but wifi signal was ""poor or ok"" at times when viewing the app.  Bought the ""ring chime pro"" thinking this would help being that it has a wifi extender built in.  Signal improved to ""Ok"" but was still at -61 in the app and video was very sketchy.  I have a Xfinity XB3 gateway with 150mbs plan and all other wifi connected devices in my home, indoors or outdoors work perfect with full strength signal.  Seems to be that the ring doorbell has a very weak wifi radio and does not do well for me to give this 5 stars.  I purchased a Netgear EX7000 ac1900 wifi extender and it helped a lot on the signal to the ring doorbell, returned the chime pro and got the regular chime for indoors.  Signal improved to ""good"" with the netgear extender at all times but still convinced that ring products have serious flaws on wifi signal.

It took 5 minutes to set up the app which has a lot of good features. And 5 minutes to screw it on the wall. And boom, you get motion activated video streamed to your phone that easy. No wires, no complicated programming, no blue iris / 3rd party app config, no annoying router complications, no separate HD to store videos. It also looks nice. If you try to go cheaper than this, you are in for a world of complicated mess. I've tried. People seem to complain about the motion sense delay. From my use I'd say it's 1-2 seconds. I don't use this as a front doorbell. I use it as a motion sensing camera for the side gate (where a criminal would actually try to enter). In that case, they have to walk all the way up my driveway while on camera, so 1-2 sec delay isn't as big of a deal. But if you put this in a narrow doorway and want to get a snapshot the instant someone appears before running off, it won't be perfect. Other things won't be great either. They all have delay. People complain ring can be stolen - yeah it's not hard to rip something off a wall. But it has already uploaded that video to the cloud, and ring guarantees the replacement if it is stolen, so... what's the problem? I wonder how long it will take before criminals realize stealing a ring didn't stop the video from being streamed to the cloud.

I’m once again delighted with my purchase and with Ring customer service. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I loved my Ring doorbell for seven months. At that point, it stopped charging and ringing the hardwired doorbell. I tried resetting it multiple times, cleaning contacts, clicking my heels three times, etc. No joy. It still connects to my wifi, but it simply won't work anymore with the house doorbell wiring (which is still working perfectly - I of course checked that). Things go wrong and this would be okay if the Ring people would simply provide a warranty replacement, but I've been trying to get them to help me for a few days now and they have so far refused to help. Their representative doesn't even know how the device works (claimed the hardwiring won't charge the unit, even though their support page confirms it does and it in fact kept it charged for seven months).

Motai,"I was excited to get this after reading positive reviews, but it’s not as good as I expected. Motion sensor doesn’t work nearly half the time. I was told by customer service that this was because my router is far from the doorbell. I rent the 2nd floor of a private home so I can’t move the router closer than it is now. I could be standing in front of the bell, and it’s hit or miss for the motion sensor to send notification. Same for postal service. I’d often find mail in my mailbox even though I got no notification a person being detected. For people detection, it’s worse than motion sensor. It would sat motion detected most of the time even when someone is at the door. When I asked the customer service why that is and how to fix it, the representative told me there is no such thing as “person detected” and that the doorbell doesn’t distinguish people from other motions (e.g cars, etc), unless I connected it to Alexa. Whenever it doesn’t work well, the only solution the customer service seems to offer is to reset it and go through the setup again, which is a pain in the neck. But I hope having it on the front door is enough to deter package thieves (nothing had been taken since we installed it).

It is facing straight down the center of our completely level 30 foot long walk way to our front door. Sometimes it picks up motion at the end of our walk other times it won’t pick up motion until someone is five feet from our door. It never fails to pick up cars in the street 55+ feet away though. One solicitor was able even to get up to the door leave a letter and walk away without ever being detected. But it caught the garbage truck.  When the mail carry delivers packages it sure catches them dropping them off but never catches their faces or them walking up. It is great if someone rings the actual doorbell but if you are trying to catch a package thief, good luck.  Don’t mind that taxi in the roadway though. Video quality is only okay. If the is just in the wrong spot it makes the video vary grainy. TL/DR: would not by this again. Picks up cars in the street but not people approaching the door on a level walkway.

Why? I had an ancient, mechanical doorbell which I could not really hear through my house. I hated that every time UPS left a package I had to guess at the arrival (as they rarely ring the bell...not that I could hear it). Extra security. It arrived well packaged with all the tools I needed for installation. The application had the installation videos and were incredibly easy to follow. I had this puppy configured in minutes. I ran into a snag with installation though. As noted, I had a mechanical doorbell which should have been an easy install (no diode necessary). I tried every configuration-white wire here and red wire there.  Diode-no diode.  Diode this way and that way (got a buzzing with the diode). Nothing got my original bell to work, but the ""Ring"" was receiving power and charging. I called customer service who walked through my installation with me, but I was not at home for my original call. I just thought to speak with them and get some ideas of what to try when I got home. The gentleman I spoke with was patient and helpful. He noted (after we listed my configurations) that it was probably a compatibility issue. I had stated that I did not know that was possible. He went on to tell me that the unit was simply not compatible with all doorbells. Before I could worry about my new problem of not having a bell up in the front of the house my CS rep told me that he had initiated the process of sending me a new chime for free. That's what I call customer service.  Way to go. I called back today with the make and model and though we were unable to figure out why my original home bell was not working I was very satisfied that I got what I needed. The Ring works great.

My house has an  older intercom system that allowed you to speak to the front door from any room in the house. The same system broadcast the front doorbell to each room as well. Once I hooked this doorbell up to the intercom's power line. (I had to build a box, stucco and paint it to match the surround),  and purchased a 2.5 wi fi extender because it doesn't work on my, or any, 5.0 extender, this doorbell would inexplicably trigger in the middle of the night! Once the bell started ringing it wouldn't stop, in every room of the house, until I physically disconnected the outside unit. (try doing that at two in the morning) Strange that it always would start ringing well after midnight and never stopped. The motion activated video showed that no one was pranking me. I thought my house was haunted. After 3-4 efforts to rewire it and attach that little diode thing that it comes with, to various screws, I finally gave up and went to battery power. The battery has to be recharged at least once a month and all the constant removal and reattachment resulted in one of the safety screws becoming completely stripped in the screwed down position. You cant replace these screws with any common screw type. Its a tiny hex head. So now, the doorbell does not fit flush anymore because the stripped screw blocks it from proper flush mounting. I also don't recall ever getting any warnings that it was about to go dead on battery power until I noticed I stopped getting motion alerts to my phone. Once dead and re-charged, you have to go through the whole process of trying to re-sync to your phone. That in itself is a huge pain. So much so that I completely gave up on it about two months ago. I also bought the separate ringer for $30 but it is so quiet that you don't know the bell is ringing unless you are in the room where you plugged in the ringer or you have your phone in your pocket. I don't know about you but I don't carry my cell phone around my house. I would go back to my old intercom system but I would have to rip out the stuccoed box, repair and repaint the wall outside. The whole ownership process has been so exhausting that the Ring doorbell now just sits out there, dead as a door . . .  well . . . you know.

The wifi signal was strong and was hardwired. Ultimately we had to replace this doorbell, and purchased the updated one because the video got too grainy. I removed it from the base plate and noticed the connections started to corrode. Once I disconnected the camera from the hardwire, it would not turn on and would not charge itself. The ring was totally bricked. Would not recommend this model, spend the extra dollars and upgrade, the quality is so much better and records seconds before it gets triggered so you get to watch the motion before it starts to after it finishes.","Base plate corroded, would not work"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Oct-15,mark,"Updated review 3 stars 6/2016: The first few months or so were great. The Ring worked really well for me. It was pretty quick to notify mine and my wife's phones, it also recorded pretty quickly upon motion detection, and the video quality was decent enough. Sound and microphone needed some customized settings that Ring's cuatomer service took care of. By the way, customer service is pretty decent. They try to help and to explain things well. Unfortunately, after the first few months, things just didn't work out so well. I thi k there was an update which screwed things up. Basically, the notifications take upwards of 10 seconds to reach our phones, there is now a very long delay before it recognizes motion even though it is set at its highest sensitivity, the recorded video not only starts very late (like 6 seconds late) but it then records for 1 second then freezes for 13 to 16 seconds while audio continues then continues video then freezes again. Live View is also a new feature that allows a Ring owner to check a live feed without the Ring needing to be activated by motion or by someone pressing the doorbell. It also takes about 20 seconds for it to connect even while on the same wifi. Customer service sent me a new unit which mever solved the problem. I think they are at a lost but don't want to say that. Instead, they keep telling me that my speed or signal may be the problem but I have verified that numerous times with them that is not the case. The speed requirement is at least a quick ping, and 1 Mbs upload. Lol... My ping was 16 ms while download is about 95 Mbs and upload is about 16 Mbs all standing outside with the door closed right next to my Ring. My wifi router is about 10 feet away and in direct sight of the Ring minus the wooden front door. They did do someth4on their end and it fixed the issue greatly to the point that I was content once again, but 3 weeks later things just got bad again. I have a top of the line tp-link router and have confirmed so many times at all times of the day and night that my wifi is not the issue. I also have two wireless cameras in the house much further away from the router that have no issues whatsoever. Original review (5 stars) approximately 12/2016: And this is the one I pick! A few months ago I decided to get a wireless camera for my front door.  I tried a number of IP wireless cameras including D-Link DCS-2132L, D-Link DCS-932L, iZtouch, Vimtag 361HD, Foscam C1, and Samsung SmartCam HD Pro.  I set up the Ring video doorbell alongside some of the aforementioned cameras.  Needless to say, I found the Ring to be most useful for my needs. I must say it now so you know, too.  The Ring video doorbell was not designed to act as a security camera like the others.  Comparing the features and quality of optics, etc. just doesn't make sense all that much.  Sure, the optics could be better, but the Ring gets the job done.  I can clearly identify people at my door. The number one feature that had me pick the Ring video doorbell over my other camera configurations is because it acted somewhat as an intercom between myself or wife and someone at the door.  If someone goes to my door at night when I'm still at work and my wife is home alone with the kids, I can virtually answer the door.  The person at the door has no clue if I'm home or not.  On top of that, they know that I know what they look like and that there is a good chance they are being recorded. We've also had visitors meet at the house earlier than expected... I'll have to continue my review in a little while.",I found the Ring to be most useful for my needs

They allegedly developed an update that senses only humans now for motion notifications, but it’s only available if you’re paying for their cloud services for the life of the device, lame.

I tried needle nose pliers and could not get it out. Called Ring support who offered the same suggestion I had tried, then superglue the screwdriver to the screw and try...I was hesitant to do that so I kept fiddling with it...I got the doorbell off with a little force, and got the entire screw and housing out...Very poorly design product. The doorbell is now configured to my new WiFi, and secured by only 1 screw...I am sure Ring will take care of me with their Customer Support, but its very frustrating to have a product with a known flaw like this. Customer Support mentioned they could send me new, beefier screws, and was very aware of the problem before I even finished describing it. On another note, the night quality of this doorbell is horrible, with the front porch light ON or OFF.

Gregory,"I purchased this a few months ago, and found that, initially, it would not connect to my Xfinity Router.  I exchanged many emails with the Tech Support at Ring, but they were essentially stymied.  I even purchased another Ring Video Doorbell, in case the first one was defective.  I had the same issues with the second one (not connecting).  Finally, after so many attempts using their app to connect, I pressed the button in the middle of the process (which it did not say to do), and this, somehow, allowed the connection to complete. I finally have this attached to my front door.  I have it set to record both motion and doorbells, and it works well.  I am alerted that there has been a motion, and a 30-second video of the event is uploaded from the cloud so I can review it. (I would like it to start recording when someone approaches rather then when they are walking away.) I find that a car in the road often sets off the motion detector, so I will try to reduce the sensitivity radius to more accurately reflect actual valid motions. The video is not particularly good quality, and doesn't match what is shown in the ads.  I don't see a way to increase quality. I ordered an external ringer so I could hear the doorbell in other rooms. All-in-all, I consider this to be a good buy and quite useful.",Works Pretty Well

I even like the produced. But I feel Ring has not done everything they can to advise customers how important the role of the network plays in what you can expect from this producer. If your network is not running at it's best (Bandwidth, Range, Signal Strength), good luck with this or any of their products. And don't mistake, Good Signal Strength as the guild you should use when buying this. No you need all 3. And Ring knows this. But do you think they tell you about that before you buy? Nope. I had this for 3 weeks, and like many, I had slow video, no video just voice, no sound, no video, video turns on after the person has left, no notifications. You name it I had it. Everything looked great but then I ran a ping test from my local network to the Ring doorbell. It was replying so slow, I understood then what was wrong. I went out and bout a $14.00 2.4 range extender and just like that! Everything worked as advertise. I can see more people needed to add a range extender. I think I am normal and my router is not right next to the front door. And if you have metal near your doorbell there is no way around adding a range extender. I am giving this 2 stars because Ring could have done more to help identify the problem. But the idea they want to sell you is ""It just works!"" Yeah as long as your network is working it's best. And most people have never tested the internet standing near there doorbell. And if you don't need that Doorbell charm. Please don't buy the Wifi- Extender ring sells.

I should have read a mix of reviews but another family member has this Ring doorbell so I went ahead and bought it without checking with her regarding her experience with it.  I was telling her my experience & she said it was fine until Amazon took over. The motion detection of this item is horrible. I get notifications when vehicles drive down my street but not someone walking up my driveway, only after they've already left. I don't have stairs so that's not the issue. I even bought a wifi extender but no improvement. This doorbell doesn't even see me drive into my attached garage. After I've already pulled in & the door is going down, I get a notification. The doorbell is no more than 10 ft, if that, from my garage door. It's no more than 15 ft from my router.

I ordered the first Ring Doorbell as part of a Black Friday special deal. The first one I ordered failed to connect to my home wifi, giving the error incorrect pasword even though that password worked on all my other devices. I contacted customer service and they were helpful, offfering to send a replacement to a US address. Unfotunately, I ended up having to pay the cost of shipping back to Ring (which cost almost as much as the doorbell) becuase the prepaid shipping label they sent me only worked in the US. I received my replacement doorbell today. The first complaint was that it arrived with just the device and the backplate, no special tools for the installation or charging, even though they demanded I send the original unit back with all the accompanying components. That's not even the worst part. It does not charge. When I try to use another USB cable to charge it, I get the top of the ring flashing blue, which according to FAQ'S means the capacitor isn’t able to charge, so the doorbell isn’t getting enough power to operate. It's been like this for hours with no change. How is it possible to get two defective units back to back?

Not great, but ok.  The picture is not as clear as we would like it to be unless a person is standing still in front of the bell, but it does give us a much better view than nothing.  Our bigger problem has been with hooking it up to our doorbell.  We have a digital doorbell which started ringing continually once we hooked it up.  We were told our unit was not compatible.  We were told they would email us a list, which they never did.  We looked on line and found a list of compatible doorbell units, picked one and hooked it up.  Again, the doorbell would ring randomly and sometimes for several minutes straight.  We called customer assistance and were told they had no idea why that would happen and they would call us back - over 2 weeks ago.  I don't think they're going to call.  We have now purchased yet another doorbell and have not yet hooked it up.  We were also very disappointed when, at the 30 day mark, we found we can no longer look at motion or rings unless they ""pop-up"" on our phones.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,4-May-18,Eric Miller,"The Ring Doorbell is a terrific example of something I didn't know I needed until I saw it. When I got the doorbell, I took it out of the packaging, started charging it up, and got the rest of the contents out of the box. The instructions from the Ring website were incredibly easy to follow. I'm not a huge home improvements guy, but figured this would be pretty simple. It was easier than I even expected. I took my existing doorbell button off to expose the wires and connected them to the mounting bracket. One problem I encountered is that the doorbell itself is slightly larger than the mounting bracket. I didn't realize this at the time of install and originally placed the bracket too close to the brick beside my mounting spot. This meant after I tried to put the doorbell on the bracket, I had to move it (1/2"" or less, but a nuisance). Once I had everything lined up, I connected the doorbell to my wifi and hung it on the bracket. All in all, not including charging time, this was a 5-10 minute install. The video quality is great and night mode works well. My only complaints: The video is generally over exposed. Our front door is inside a small alcove that is considerably darker than the rest of the yard, and there is no setting to adjust exposure. Because of this, when picking up motion it doesn't really catch anything until the source of the motion is so close that you can miss a person's face. For example, when the mail carrier drops off a package, I generally don't see her face if she approaches the door quickly, sets the package down, and immediately turns, I can barely see who it is. If you need your exposure adjusted, call Ring and they can help to a degree. They genuinely seem to want to help, though the help is limited. Adjustable motion sensitivity is terrific and you'll absolutely need to change yours when you first get it. Until you get it tweaked right, you may get phantom motion alerts for small animals, but in general these are easy to account for. That in mind, when someone rings the doorbell, I can see them very well in very high quality. This has helped us avoid solicitors more than once. A fun game to play with them: if you see the ringer is a solicitor, I like to answer the ring mumbling about Government spies, and how a clipboard isn't a great disguise before asking what branch of the gov they're with. I'd absolutely suggest buying one of these for a door with a small porch or no covering so there is consistent light from street to door. I'd still suggest it for someone in a case like mine but would advise setting your expectations correctly.

I bought two- one for my front door and one for the back. I do not have either hooked up to my existing doorbell because my landlord would not like that. This means I have to use the battery feature. The front doorbell’s Ring battery seems to last 3X longer than my back one does... maybe a faulty Ring? I swear I charge it and within three days it’s dead. Very frustrating. Another disappointing feature is the motion detection. I have changed my motion settings every which way, yet still get notifications ALL day long indicating there is motion at my door when it’s really just a car driving by. Which is odd, because when someone actually is at my door, I don’t get notified until they are right up at the door, sometimes even when they are walking away.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Aug-16,Annie from Queens,"I love my Ring Video Doorbell.  I can't speak for how easy is was to install, because I had my handyman do it, but the software part of it was a breeze.  Already, I've expected packages when I was not at home, but  I was able to talk to the FedEx guy from a distance and arrange when he could deliver my package at a time that I'd be home.  If I didn't have my Ring videobell, my package would have gone back to the FedEx center, and I'd have to jump through hoops to pick it up.  Same with my UPS guy - I spoke to him while I was out to dinner with my sister and asked him to leave the package at the back door.  I like that I can see who is standing on my doorstep without having to open the door or look out the window. Prior to getting my Ring videobell, I have had issues with packages being stolen from off my top step, so the Ring videobell recording whoever approaches my door is a great benefit.  The video recording is part of a service that they charge for.  The first thirty days are free, and then it's $30 a year after that.  Well worth it, in my opinion. Okay, so the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that sometimes there's a lag between the movement in front of the house and the recording.  Not a large lag, but large enough to notice.  Also, the instructions are not really clear about charging the battery.  You need to take the bell off the brace (easy to do) every few months and charge the unit.  Not a problem, but the instructions should be clearer on that.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Feb-17,CRB,"We didnt have a doorbell wired on our house so this was a nice option for me to avoid having to pay an electrician to come wire my house for a bell.  The product works pretty well and is innovative but I have a few issues with it. First is the delay from when it picks up motion to when you receive an alert on your phone is considerable.  Usually the mailman has already came and dropped the mail and is headed back to his mail truck by the time the Ring starts recording so all I see is his back.  Not a big deal if it's just the mailman but if it's a burglar or someone shady, not picking up their face doesnt really help at all.  Also, there is a considerable delay between the Ring recognizing motion, ending the recognition, and then being ready to recognize motion again.  For example, I walked up the the ring (set on 30ft motion detection) and it recognized me and sent an alert when i was 2 feet away.  I then walked away and headed another 20 yards down the street to get out of range, turned around and approached my door again.  The Ring did not recognize me at all and sent no alert.  I sat on the porch for a few minutes talking to Ring Customer Service and then repeated this exercise with them logged in so they could see the issue at hand.  They said I had a faulty unit and sent me a new one.  To their credit, I found their customer service technician to be helpful, thorough, and quick to try and solve my problem. I got the new unit but the issue persists.  Before thinking this is an issue with my internet/wifi, please know that the signal strength always reads as ""Very Good (RSSI-47)"" on the app diagnostics. Second issue is the speed of the app.  When I get an alert that there is motion or someone has rang my doorbell, I swipe into the app right away.  From there it can be anywhere from 5-15 seconds for the app to startup, load the video, buffer the video, and connect.  Sometimes it wont connect at all and just ""times out"".  While I will admit that sometimes I'm at work with a less-than-stellar wifi connection, many times my connection has been good and the delay is still significant.  I've tried keeping the app running on my phone to see if that would speed up the connection time but it really doesnt have much of an effect. Another issue with motion detection that I've had is the range.  Even when I set the range to 5 feet away, I still get notified when a car drives by even though my Ring is every bit of 45-60 feet from the street.  Not the biggest deal but it is annoying and definitely affects battery life. Which brings me to my last issue - battery life.  There is no way you're getting 6-12 months on one charge as stated on their website.  I had my Ring for less than a month when it needed to be recharged but seeing that I didnt initially charge it (nothing in the box/setup said I had to and the battery level read 80%) I figured a full charge would tell the true story.  Well, I charged it about 10 days ago and it's already down to 77%.  That's 23% degradation in 10 days which means I'll get about a month to a month-and-a-half usage out of it before I need to recharge again.  It's easy to recharge but having to do so often is somewhat of a nuisance.  The one unknown factor here is my wife has her phone connected to get alerts when the Ring goes off and I'm not sure if she's activating the video feed for each time she gets an alert and then letting it run.  I imagine that could drain the battery faster but I'd venture a guess she doesnt do that as she never even answers when the bell rings. Overall, I give the Ring 3 stars because it's a nice tech piece to have, fills a void for homeowners who dont have a wired bell, and is somewhat useful security.  The issues above keep me from rating it higher.",... doorbell wired on our house so this was a nice option for me to avoid having to pay an ...
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-May-19,Viola K,Update The product has extremely poor video quality. Useful only to know someone rang the doorbell. Can’t see the face. Can’t really even talk because of horrible latency. This product is not good. I recommend that you avoid. They won’t replace a defective item and just blindly blame your internet or location of your device or because you have a certain router ignoring the 100MBS speed. The product does not work without a ring chime pro to provide a constant internet connection. They will give you one for free after you waste 30 plus minutes in a tech support call that exhausts every other cause but they know there product has problems. Not happy that I have to use up a plug with an ugly chime. Amazon cloud cam does not have this problem I guess because it has 120vac plug.,Needs a ring chime to work. Live view fails. Frustrating.

The bell works fine, though. Update March 12,2016: After using Ring for two and a half month, I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star. Battery life is a major issue. So far, I've been having to charge it about every 4-6 weeks. Second, the third time I needed to charge the battery, the tool that was included to unscrew the unto broke off, so I can't even unscrew it to charge it. Third, still major issue with motion sensor; a lot of false alarms, draining the battery. And there's no option to turn off the motion sensor. Update: 11/2017 I hired a handyman to drill a hole through the walls so the wire can be connected and the unit charged as often as I like without having to unscrew the unit. But there’s another problem I’ve notice over the past year of using it: WiFi connectivity drops very often, even though the router is less than ten feet away from the door.",Not well made

Image was fine and you could see facial details.  As time passed I notice a slow degeneration in focus.  Before the warranty ran out I called in and complained and a representative logged into my unit.  After she reviewed the image she said the router must be the issue.  I placed the unit next to the router and it had the same problem.  She asked if the router was greater than 2' off the floor, I said it was about 18"".  She then told me that was the issue and could not correct the image.  I have 3 Wyze units now and none have the issue, they have great detail and one even looks at the same region.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Jan-19,Key DePonte,"This particular Ring model was super easy to set up for almost all technical skills. For 89.00 it is an average security camera to install. The images seem okay for its purpose, but as for security purposes, I think it loses a lot. If you have a long hallway to your front door say about 5 to 10 feet then this works great. My door, however, sits almost flush to the house so if someone came to steal my mail or steal this ring device, they could possibly do it so quickly that the ring would even turn on in time to catch the video. I can see how someone can literally walk up, put their finger on the lens and screw it off and take off with it without me seeing a single thing or for me to capture the criminal. There are good things though. When I am home I do feel safer that it is there, at least if I am home and someone tries to steal mail or the ring device I would have an opportunity to confront them if I am quick enough. Also as a glorified doorbell where I can see who is at my door when they use the ring function. As a doorbell it is great, as for a security cam I think it is terrible unless you have a few steps to get to your front door.

A limitation of which I was not aware at the time of purchase is that live talk is not available for battery operation; your Ring doorbell needs to be wired to old-fashioned, AC doorbell wiring to enable that feature. Given the short delivery times drivers are allowed for each delivery, that means the driver has gone by the time you respond to a ring alert and start the video (which comes not from your Ring doorbell, but a cloud service).",Good but some important limitations

Also, it would be nice if I could get the iOS app to alert with sound ONLY when someone rings the doorbell, rather than with BOTH motion and doorbell rings: STRIKE 3 I have decided to return my ring doorbell, as it is merely a novelty item and not worth the $100 I spent on it.",Not 720p HD as advertised.

To be fair, it has some positives. Installation was quick and easy, the neighborhood section of the app is actually pretty useful, and it does inform you when someone is at the door or rings the Bell even if you aren't home. However it also inform your anytime someone drives by, when the sun comes up, when you're sprinklers turn on, etc. My wife and I have begun to pretty much ignore the ""motion at your front door"" notifications at this point because they are constant. I've adjusted the sensitivity and range to attempt to combat this, but to no avail. Unfortunately this hyper sensitivity only seems to apply to not-actually-someone-at-the-door events. When someone does come to the door it doesn't trigger until they're standing in front of it and have been for a few seconds, which means if someone were to run up and take something off the porch or try to break in, it may not even record until they're already gone or turned away from the camera. Additionally the wifi adapter built in is weaksauce. I have a fairly small house with a good WiFi router, I can watch 4K content on YouTube on my phone standing by the Ring doorbell, but it can't manage to even transmit voices or video without being choppy, broken, and impossible to understand for either party. So yeah, it serves a function, but not even close to as well as I had thought it would. We will likely return it and purchase something different.",Not all I expected

We had some issues with neighbors stealing my packages so the cameras were helpful in that regard. Last week, I noticed that a gentleman wearing the logo of the local electric company was ringing my doorbell and eyeballing some packages on the front stoop that were left for me. I really wished that I could ask him what he needed, but alas, I could not with my current set up! I read the reviews on Ring, Ring Pro and SkyBell. As I currently do not have a wired doorbell (the house is 96 years old), the Ring seemed to work best with my set up. Since I was not connecting the Ring to any existing wiring, I did have to wait for it to charge fully. Once charged, set up really was extraordinarily easy and I had the whole thing up and running within a few minutes. I live off a fairly busy street and the doorbell does alert me to some traffic motion, but not as often as my Blink cameras. I did also purchase a chime for the inside of the house. I have not been able to get that up and running as of yet, I am working on troubleshooting that with the Ring team - looks like the firmware is incorrect on the chime.",works terrific for us!

EDIT: I am a tad disappointed that this expensive doorbell has a subscription based fee if you want to have saved recordings at all.

Otherwise it's a huge annoyance.  There is a long delay before the device begins recording.  The tool to adjust detection area doesn't look like what's pictured here.  It's an arc that is only adjustable from the apex.  So if you try to reduce the motion area from your door to the street, (depth),  it also reduces the width.  Combine that with the delay and it make the motion detecting of this device awful.  You either get notified of nothing, or everything.  There is also a significant recording delay in the dark.  If anything happens at night, you won't see it unless it's right at your door.  If you just want to see who's ringing your doorbell, this is fine.  Otherwise it's a bust.",Not impressed

Images are clear and the live stream is really nice. What I like is that you can set the motion zones for sensitivity. I even get notified when large trucks go by on the road almost 50 yards away from my door. You get notified on your phone of any motion alerts or rings on the doorbell. Allows me to link in and even talk to the person at the door if I want. My wife and son are home alone all day and I like being able to see who is coming to the door and talk to them, they do not know I am not there. Another neat thing is if you have an Amazon device like an Amazon Show, you can tell it to show you the front door and it will, so you can see who is at the front door before you even answer it! I have an Amazon Spot at my office and I can tell it to show me the front door anytime. It's a great security device. If you pay the monthly fee (only $3) it records and stores the motion alerts for playback later. This is handy if your worried about maybe having to have the videos for the police.

One new capability that I really like is the ability to activate the camera without  anyone pushing the button or motion detection. And it works on a battery operated ring doorbell! I use it on vacation to look out to the front yard to see what the grass looks like or if it snowed in the winter. I've had this unit about two years.

Does its job just fine.  I do find it ridiculous that I had to spend 50 bucks to get an additional plug in item in order to hear the bell ring unless your phone is right with you and on. It is run and accessible from your phone only if you do not get the addition.  When my family is home we do not keep out phones on or with us at all times.

Once I receive the ring doorbell the insulation and set up procedures were fairly easy. But then came the problems. The 1st problem was we were receiving ghost doorbell rings at all hours of the day-and-night.  After a few rounds of troubleshooting with Tech Support and messing with the resistor they sent me a new one to replace the defective item. Unfortunately the new device did the same exact thing. The problems did not stop there. Before purchasing the ring door I made sure it could be installed with direct sunlight, but during the day in direct sunlight my screen goes black and returns after the sun has past.  And the icing on the cake is you have to pay a monthly membership for your device not to work properly.  And for the cost of the ring doorbell  I was able to purchased two motion censoring 1080 Pan tilt zoom cameras with 2-way talk for front and back yard and still didn't pay as much as the ring doorbell.",Disappointment!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Jan-17,Carrie R.,"It was working great until recently. I have spent far too much time talking to customer service about this doorbell.  It really worked great until last month.  Since then I have had multiple emails with customer service, an hour long phone call, and other shorter calls. The doorbell keeps forgetting our network even though I have been assured the latest firmware release was supposed to fix that.  We have to continuously bring it in the house and manually configure the doorbell.  The power went out on Sunday, our Chime Pro was able to re-establish a connection but the Ring Doorbell would not even though it is the device that has a battery, so it certainly should be able to keep the wireless information stored in memory.  Today there was no power or wifi outage, but the doorbell lost connection at some point and would not connect again.  This is the only device we have to set back up in our house every time it loses the wifi signal.  Our blu-ray players, video consoles, phones, security cameras, televisions, computers, etc., etc. can all remember the network and connect back up. It now makes a clicking noise that is new, but I can't figure out what triggers it.  It seems to be motion, but that clicking noise was not audible until today.  The digital ring (made by the doorbell itself) occasionally sounds garbled.  The doorbell always says it is hardwired in, even when I am holding it in my hand, which isn't a big deal except that means I am able to access live view and drain the battery quickly when I should not be able to and customer service confirmed this behavior happened during one of my phone calls. I cannot get customer service to acknowledge that mine might actually possibly be defective as I know two other people that own this doorbell, have the same version of firmware and do not have the problems that I have.  Customer service keeps blaming it on weak signal, but that doesn't explain why these problems didn't exist before.  If anything the signal should be stronger given we now have a Chime Pro.","Great at first, doesn't work anymore after 7 months"

I installed it on my own with ease. I spliced my wiring so that I could adjust it a bit from the original doorbell location while still completely covering the wiring. I did encounter some problems with the Live View feature giving me a black screen or not loading at all. I guess you could say I have a smart house with about 15 devises connected to the 2.4ghz signal ( garage doors, smart receptacles, thermostat, tv ) and 3 to my 5ghz. So when I added Ring it seemed to put a strain on my bandwidth. On a hunch, to fix the problem, I turned on my guest network feature, password protected it and it had the ring doorbell be the only device to connect to it. After it was established I hid it so that I couldn't connect any other devices to it, basically giving Ring it's on AP. Now Live View opens when prompted in about 5 seconds and I haven't had a black screen when I request the feed.",Love My New Doorbell

Doorbell funtion and mic work great. Easy to use app and setup, install (wirelessly, not sure about wiring install). I had issues at first trying to pay for the annual fee for live video and motion detection. I tried multiple times in the first few months. Something with their server was messed up. Now we finally got it fully functioning and the video is little choppy sometimes. We have the zones set up to only detect motion in our front yard, but if a car drives by and the sun hits its windows just right, the glare sets off the motion video, which happens quite a lot in the late afternoon and drains the battery faster. Eta: it only detects me or say the mail carrier approaching the camera with motion detection and then no follow up feed. Many times when I go to take out garbage it films me going, but not returning. I can only hear it on audio. Many times, my dogs are barking before it notifies me that the mail carrier has come to the front door and when I look or when the video catches anything the mail carrier is walking away behind our bush.

You can monitor every movement that goes past your door (specify how many feet in front you want) or every door bell ring you get, or both! I love how I can also just look at live view whenever I want which gives me live feed in real time. All 5 of us are able to access the camera at once, which is very convenient and we feel much safer. Another great feature is the collaborative access to the neighborhood feed. You can see & post tons of other ring door bell videos from around the neighborhood.

One issue we had trouble with was that hidden SSID networks that are password protected did not work for us. Even supplying the right credentials, the doorbell couldn't pick them up. Turn on broadcast SSID and it worked fine. While the doorbell itself had been excellent, and I feel my home and family are much safer while I'm away, I've yet to quite get the motion detection working right. When set too low, people have to be practically right in front of the door to activate the motion detection. Set it high enough to pick up individuals on their way up to the house and we get notifications every time a car drives by on the street in front of our home. We've settled on a middle range, but there are still quite a few ""false alarms."" As such, we had to turn the ""smart alerts"" to its most frequent setting -- otherwise it picks up some false motion and doesn't turn back on in time to pick up the motion of a person walking to the door. Anyway, I do appreciate the speed with which the door chime and iOS app alert you when there is motion. It's almost instant. Many other home applications have quite a delay.

It detects motion before a person even pushes the button on the bell. It has a configurable detection region which is very nice. The video is recorded in the cloud and you have to pay $30 per year for storage. The bell camera is very nice and clear and has a 180 degree field of view. A well designed user app Cons Horribly cheap screws to mount the bell with. For this price range I expected at least average screws Does not always detect motion. I had a package disappear from my front porch and the bell didn't detect it. A couple times I walked by the bell and it did not catch it. Sometimes video gets garbled Areas of improvement Offer live video. You can only see the video when there is motion or a ring Create a 10 second pre-motion or pre-ring video. Sometimes, when the motion is detected, it is too late. Other cameras record a few seconds before the actual motion or ring Offer longer than 40 seconds unanswered videos. The way to fool this bell is to walk by it and then return after 40 seconds Offer local SD card storage for when the video gets garbled due to connection problems Offer 1080p resolution. Currently, it only has 720p Offer a mounting kit that can accommodate angled siding on which the bell may get installed Face recognition for known visitors","Good product, some flaws and some area for improvement.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Jun-18,Nacho Libra,"So far, this is everything I want. I have no wired doorbell, so I'm forced to use the battery option. Very easy to set-up, but if you have vinyl siding and no good place to put this, your installation could get tricky. You could possibly stick shims underneath, maybe....or buy the Ring wedge kit. You can't mount the Ring sideways, your videos would be sideways and it would look stupid anyhow. So I bought a vinyl siding mounting block at Menards, as they have colors other than white in stock. However, my siding is 1/2"" thick so I'll have to get the Dremel out to shave off the entire perimeter of the mounting block, something I'm not in the mood for now. So for the time being, a window shutter isn't far from the door and it had a flat surface large enough for the Ring. Battery life is better than expected, but I have live view disabled. I have motion and doorbell enabled. My Netgear router is at the far end of my condo, but the Ring has plenty of signal strength. I only wish it didn't stick out like a sore thumb. Oh, and as far as the Neighborhoods app, which you don't have to download to use the Ring, unlike another reviewer said when she gave this 1 star....your address remains anonymous. There's not much action in the past 30 days from my Neighbor app because I haven't seen many Ring doorbells installed in the 3 mile radius around my house. Hopefully it will pick up, but I still have the NextDoor site to rely on.",Very easy to set-up

Lewis,"There's enough reviews on the unit itself, so I won't go on about that - it's not perfect but it is one of the best of it's class right now.  What really puts the Ring video doorbell over the top is that they  have a Windows 10 app (most competing products do not have one yet).  Being able to get alerts on any device I'm using at the time (and not JUST my phone) is a true game changer.  This way if I'm working at my desktop or laptop, I can view and respond directly to any alerts w/out switching to my phone.  Also being able to view the video on a big screen instead of just a tiny little phone screen is great.  On top of that, I can now leave live view of the video up on my PC as much as I want and not worry about draining my phone battery.  It's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app so it works great on any size device from a full desktop to a laptop to a tablet or even phone, and potentially any other device that comes along in the future.  Hopefully they'll let it run on the Xbox One soon too!",Windows 10 app makes it a winner
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Jun-18,MamaDi,"You control the Ring with an app on your phone or tablet. When a motion is detected or someone rings your doorbell, a sound emits from your phone accompanied by a pop-up message. When notified of a “motion” if you click the link on your phone to view it, the only way to do so is immediately go to “live” mode on the app. By the time you do that, it may be too late to interact with whoever might be there. We have an elevated porch and had to buy the wedge adapter to point the camera down otherwise every car that drove by set it off. The camera catches the neighborhood stray cat prowling around on our porch at night. When it’s windy, we can get false notifications. We can’t figure out how to deactivate. My husband wanted to surprise me with a gift and had to cover the lens with tape so I couldn’t see what he was bringing in. I was out of town and saw him put tape over it and immediately texted him asking what he was doing...so this is kind of a spy camera 😎 A few times I’ve gotten connection errors and I would like the app to be a bit quicker on response.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-17,M. K. Mcgregor,"Overall, I was impressed as to how the Ring doorbell functions. It does everything that it says it does. The results of detection, video, picture quality, and notifications are good. The detection, someone walks up to the door without pushing the button, is pretty good and adjustable on the range of detection, but can get false positive depending on what and how much moves in front of your house. One thing that is bad right now is the picture adjustments for bright backgrounds. My Ring is in an alcove looking out to a front yard. Since the alcove is covered and darker than the bright outside, anything beyond the threshold of the alcove is just a white mess. Having some auto white balance in record mode would be good and/or manual while in live mode; neither exists and there are no picture tuning settings which is surprising. The recording feature is to their cloud, which I'm not crazy about. There is no alternative. To access those videos, you need to pay a monthly/yearly fee; after the 30 day trial, but at least be credit card is required at startup. That is an issue to me. Every company wants $5/$10/$20/... per month for continued service. I understand the business model or recurring income, but I as a consumer I do not want to pay that for each niche product I buy. So, you do get notifications for free, I think, but not video. Still, overall, the product does work well and its integration with using an existing doorbell power line and activation of internal doorbell is well done and worked perfectly for my existing installation. The installation instructions were pretty good and setup was fairly painless but does require that you understand how to switch networks on your mobile phone to initially connect to the device during out of the box setup and should only be required once for each device. Overall, I like it for what I paid. At the normal ~$200 price, it's a bit much for what you are getting; especially if you consider the extra monthly fee. Also, the box is not big, but it is much bigger than a typical door bell button fixture, so it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb next to the door; even with the color selections.",Product works well but requires wifi close by and has pay for services

I wish I'd known about a Ring long ago.  Because I'm old..I hired a handyman to install and hook it to my phone.  It was simple for him.  Make sure you charge it for 6 hours before installing.  We didn't see that in the instructions so he had to return..which cost me an additional $.  It shows everything,  the videos are clear, a large picture and you can hear what is being said.  It picks up motion in the area so you know if someone or something is in the area.  I would have given 5 stars across the board except for tech support.  The gal there seemed to want to use the low battery as a reason it wasn't working properly but that wasn't the problem at all.  She was NO help at all.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-May-16,s0nicfreak,"Having had some threats and stalker issues, I need security cameras on my house at all times that provide a way to view/store the video remotely. The ring doorbell does that and more. It has replaced both my doorbell and my security camera in one convenient item. I can seem like I'm home even when I'm not, and I can tell unwanted visitors to go away without bothering to go to the door, which makes me safer. The motion sensor which can be set to detect to the end of my property line makes my possessions safer. I use the battery power, because my house does not have doorbell wires, but the charge lasts for months. The $3 a month for cloud recording is miniscule compared to what other security systems charge for remote viewing and storage. Setup and installation were easy, and there were videos to guide me if I needed help. When I lost one of my security screws, customer service quickly sent me out some new ones free of charge. I do sometimes get false positives when a large truck goes by, such as on garbage day, or when a snowplow plows the street, or once when an ambulance came to my neighbor's house. I consider this a convenience though, as it reminds me to get the garbage out or lets me know it's time to move my car so the other side of the street can be plowed. One thing I would note, make sure your router and modem are on some kind of backup power. Otherwise if the power goes out (or someone cuts the power), the Ring will not be able to connect to the internet.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Sep-17,Diverse Interests,"I am giving this one star to prod the manufacturer into improving their customer service. I recently bought a Norton Core router. My family had to pair almost 30 devices to it. Sounds like a lot of work but it actually happened quickly and smoothly. The Ring Doorbell was the only device that was problematic. You have to unscrew it from the mount on the door frame in order to install it as a new device because it requires pushing the button on the back. Parenthetically, you also have to unscrew it to recharge it as the USB port is also on the back. The screws are not standard. The small head is in a star shape. I assume this makes it something of a key situation. The doorbell comes with a special screwdriver, the Ring tool, which serves as the key to remove the screws. It seems I misplaced the tool. I went on the Chat facility on the website. I typed my problem and an agent responded quickly. They needed a list of demographic information to order a replacement tool. I typed the information and found that my Send button had disappeared from the Chat. I was using the Edge browser which by now is standard. I tried again a multitude of ways to engage in a successful chat. I could only clear it and restart by shutting down the Ring website and logging in again. I played around with Chat for a very long time but always lost the Send button leaving an open session for the agent. Finally, I call the company. The customer service person was pleasant and seemed very helpful. However, she was not interested in the Chat problem. She again needed my demographic data. She said she was sending replacement screws as well as the tool as the old ones sometimes get stripped in removing the doorbell from the mount. It took the better part of 2 weeks to get the replacement parts. I went to remove the doorbell but the tool just spun around in the screw head. It appeared to small for the slot. Fortunately, my husband knew were our Tool was. It turned out the replacements Tool and screws I was sent were smaller than those for my doorbell. The screws did not strip and I was finally able to remove the doorbell, reprogram it, and remount it. Bottom line is that a simple change in network was a massive effort way beyond that for any of our other devices.",Support problems on longer term use

According to my husband the Ring was relatively easy to install. The problem we have is with function. When we purchased it, we had no intention of subscribing to the cloud storage feature. We have no need to review all the people who have come to our door during the past week or month. If we are busy or outside, we simply would like to know in real time when someone's at the front door and distinguish between, for example, a neighbor or a package drop off. Without subscribing to the cloud service this is not possible. Here's why: When the app notifies you that someone is ringing the doorbell, it takes at least 15 to 20 seconds to get out your phone, activate the app and allow the image to be routed through the wireless connection. By this time whomever was at the door has left and all you see is an empty front porch. Hence the need for the cloud service to make the device fully functional. UNFORTUNATELY, by the end of our 30-day free cloud service and we figured all of this out our 30-day return window had closed, So we are stuck with an expensive doorbell when we already had a perfectly satisfactory doorbell.",This Product Did Not Live Up to My Expectations

Sanctus-Filius,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The GOOD: - Video doorbell with battery power allows its use on those areas without wired doorbells. - Good communications and quick response on the phone when doorbell is rung - The software warns you when the battery needs to be recharged. The BAD: - Severe lag in detecting motion and recording it. More often than not, a fast moving individual was through the door or out on the sidewalk before the device started recording, leaving a video of a blank entrance (see video). - The motion detection appears to be focused straight ahead. On a house with stairs/stoop, it does not detect motion until the visitor is right through the door.  Any attempt to extend the range only results in tall vehicles (SUVs, trucks, etc) being recorded. - While the battery option is great and provides for freedom of location, the claim of one year between charges is wildly exaggerated if you use the motion detection feature. Between all the trials to try to get the right motion detection and avoid all the passing cars, the bell asked for recharge a month into its first use. - Because the charging port is hidden in the back, recharging the battery requires physically unscrewing and removing the device from its location. - Battery charging takes a minimum of five hours. I think that the motion detection issues have been solved with the new Ring Pro (I dislike the term ""pro"". It implies that it is for professional use, when it's just a better model). Unfortunately, that doesn't do anything for someone who bought the original or who has problems wiring the location. I suppose that the new  Ring Stickup cam with a solar panel could solve the motion detection issue and allow the Ring doorbell to have a much longer battery life but that adds a hefty price tag to your front door. The fact that the pickup cam would require a separate storage plan from Ring does not help matters.

Have it connected to my phone, my wifes phone, iPad, and a spare iphone used for our baby monitor. Its great that if you have an existing doorbell, you can connect the wires giving you the original chime in the house and illuminating the white light around the doorbell on the RING. Great for night time. I know who comes and goes from ringing my doorbell, but I opted not to use the motion sensor since it goes off when my neighbors go in and out of there house. Cant wait til they finally release the on-demand camera for this. There have been times when people knock on my door and I have to look through the peep hole to see who it is. Install is a breeze and connected to my WIFI with no problem. I you have spotty WIFI, I suspect that it would take sometime to ring your phone. The RING notifies my devices in a matter of 1-3 seconds, but mostly 1 sec. UPDATE: Received the RING Chime, and absolutely love it. This is installed in the laundry room where it may be a bit loud. Also there may be times when I forget to bring my phone with me, so this makes up for it. Since I do have 2 doors into my home, I would love to purchase another one. At the current price point of $199, I would stick with the 1 that I have. Paying another $199 for my side door is a bit overkill. UPDATE 2 01/30/2017: Still til this day, I absolutely love my RING doorbell. The LiveView is excellent to have when you want to see who is at the door or if you hear noises. I now use RING as a digital peephole with another spare iPhone that I mounted to my front door. If for any reason my phone is not near me to see who rang my bell, or if my baby sitter is home when the doorbell rings, they can look at the iPhone on the door. One thing about this that I did bring to RING attention is that someone has to swipe on the screen to display video. I have asked for a request to make feature that will enable video automatically on the phone. Aside from that, yesterday I received my RING Solar Security Sign and this is really a nice addition to my home security system.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Sep-17,Jon Coleman,"So first of all, I like the design of this doorbell. The button is obvious as is the camera. This way people who come to the door are aware they are being filmed and know how to ring the doorbell. I saw one product that had a glowing bell icon that you pressed. That's not as obvious as a physical button. I also like that it can be used either hardwired or on battery. It is hardwired on the door (so it actually rings the existing doorbell in the house and I don't have to charge it. However having the battery allowed me to take it off the wall and troubleshoot the device. The image quality is good. It's not 1080 so if you need that this might not be for you but faces are clearly identifiable and it works equally well at night. It's in the shade so obviously some of the background is washed out but even then I can make out cars on the street and in it's most sensitive motion sensing mode it cars as they drive by the house (no it's not set to that). I did have some issues initially getting it set up and support was great. The problems were all my own fault (because of a peculiarity of my home network). Now that it is corrected it works every time. I couldn't ask for it to work better",Great doorbell. I will likely be buying more products from Ring
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Jan-20,Christopher L. Chaney,"I had a Ring doorbell for about a year and eventually was so unhappy with it that I replaced it with a Nest Hello which I am much happier with. The most glaring problem was that it would never notify me in time that it had seen someone on my porch. I would get the notification and go to check the camera only to see the person had already left. I live on a busy road and got movement notifications every time a car passed by. Even though I set the zones to only detect movement in my yard and porch I was getting notifications every few minutes, hundreds of times a day until I just got frustrated and turned them off, which completely defeats the purpose. The low price for saving recordings is nice, but those recordings were pretty much always just someone walking away or a car passing by, except for the one time it recorded someone checking my front door lock (see photo). I was asleep when that happened so I didn't catch him until my dog started barking when the guy went into my driveway. Video footage was pretty poor. The images and video looked like they were taken with a mid 2000's cell phone and on sunny days the image would be completely washed out except for areas that were in shade. The audio quality was also pretty terrible. When talking to people through the speaker they would have to lean in and put their ear super close to the doorbell so they could hear me and the audio I could hear was usually choppy and sounded a little weird. I don't use any Echo devices in my house, but I do have a few Google Home devices and those do not work very well with the Ring. I could talk to people on my porch but couldn't see the video feed. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice together when it comes to smart tech so that wasn't a huge deal, but I consider it a drawback. Anyway, none of those issues are present with the Nest Hello. If you're already using Amazon products in your house then maybe you'll have a better experience with the Ring than I did.",Not very good

Ok I have this mounted on top of a 16 ft sign pointed at my front gate. so when someone comes to my gate, the motion sensor sends me an alert on my IPhone - Since the camera is connected over my WiFi network, I can see who is there Live and talk to them as well as listen to them respond. Sometimes it scares people when they all of a sudden realize their being watched and especially if they hear me talking to them. LOL - What I thought was interesting was that Ring will replace your camera if it gets stolen (imagine that). Regardless, the camera is quality built, does a good job at night (low light conditions). I power it with a solar panel from Ring and never had an issue with it. I have tried others wireless cameras too however, this is the only one that worked in sub zero temps.

We do not have wiring for a doorbell so were especially interested in something that would not require wiring.  Shortly after installing the doorbell, we traveled and were pleasantly surprised to be notified on our phones when the dog sitter arrived!  It has been installed for about 3 weeks and the battery shows at about 84% with reasonable activity.  We are not close to the street so it won't be set off by passing traffic which I heard does drain the battery.  Our router is upstairs and the connection is just fine.  We did have the sensor video free trial while we were away and it was nice to be able to view it afterwards, but for us I don't think it's necessary. We work at home and often can't get to the door immediately so the ability to communicate is a great feature. I would say that Ring Video Doorbell works as advertised and we're pleased with its performance. 4/5/17 Update: Our Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell continues to perform well.  Although we did not opt for the video cloud feature, we have had the product in use since late October 2016 and today, when I checked the battery, there is still 53% charge left in it from our first use!  We don't have a lot of traffic or activity at the door, but enough motion for ins and outs that I thought we'd need to recharge by now.  I recommend having it, and we do intend to enable cloud video recording when we do any extended travel.  For $30 per year, you can't beat it.",Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Fits the Bill

Sometimes image quality poor even though wifi connection very strong. Update after 2 months: Very disappointed. My comments echo all the 1-star ratings.

I've been buying online and off amazon for years and I always research products before buying them. Unfortunately this product just does not work that well.  If you read the other reviews you will see that it has significant software issues.  The two biggest and most frustrating are that passing vehicles will set off the motion detect regardless of motion settings and that there is a very significant time lag between when the motion video is activated and when someone approaches the bell.  In almost all cases you will only see a video of the person walking away and not catch their face.  Anyone who knows this about the product could exploit this issue and simply run and steal your mail knowing that the camera would only turn on after their face is turned away from the camera. Final advise: This bell does look nice and the app does notify you if someone rings your bell, but it fails to provide much increase in security. I would recommend waiting until a better product comes out (from what I hear the pro version of this product has the same issues).",Software issues
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,4-May-19,Tina M. Cuevas,I was afraid to order since there were so many different types and dollar amounts.  I opted for this $99. version.  I love it.  It was easy to install ...with the exception of adding it to my front door frame which is not level so we just shimmed with a paint stick cut to size.  Also my husband had to cut off edges of my rock and we still have a little grouting to do but It works great !!!!  I think the only difference in the 1080 and the 780 is the clarity of the motion.  Probably.  So if you are wanting absolute clear videos...you may want to go up to the next level.  This is fine for my application.  Well worth the money.  $99. up front then $30. per year.  That's a bargain for peace of mind.  And I am in the loop with other neighbors if they have break in's and post it.  This was a total pleasant surprise benefit.,Great Product...works perfect

It was very easy to install and set up.  We did have to get the wifi extender due to it's distance from our router.  It has worked very well.  One can easily customize the area it covers so it doesn't pick up unnecessary motion. We had a large carved eagle set up next to our door.  One early morning it was stolen and the Ring caught the thief on video.  The Ring had alerted us, but we thought it was just the newspaper delivery service and ignored it.  Even though we thought we'd never see the eagle again, we reported the theft and shared the video with the Coon Rapids police.  They, in turn, posted it on their Facebook page.  They received several tips from the public.  The eagle was located and returned to us the same day the video was posted.  In fact, our local news channels covered the story as it unfolded.  The Associated Press recently included our story as part of an article they published about video doorbells and cameras. We are sold on the Ring and have just ordered a camera for our backyard.

I was very upset that the motion detection did NOT catch the thief as he was able to walk across the patio, move my wife’s bike, grab mine and walk right past the camera around 11 AM. I had all settings correct but the motion detection did not so it’s job. The reason I am not giving the Ring product 1 star is because through the app, I posted my missing bike and a “Neighbor” located it two days after my posting and I got my bike back. The doorbell picks up motion now but didn’t when it actually mattered. My WiFi connection to the doorbell is solid as well. Maybe I should have invested in the Doorbell 2? I’m going to give it a couple of more days to see how the product performs and hopefully change my review. *UPDATE* After changing a couple of settings the door bell works great! Picks up motion with minimal delay. I believe the issue I had was with the “motion range” setting. I had it set to 5-15ft but it needed to be on 15-30ft. Make sure you play around with the settings to make it suit your environment and also make sure it is a solid WiFi connection. If you have the modem/router that was installed from your internet provider, chances are you don’t have a very good connection (especially if the equipment is hidden or a good distance from the doorbell).

The concept is great but the company's execution is lacking.  From the beginning, I had issues with getting the view range set correctly.  If I set it so that every passing car didn't set it off, someone had to be standing close to the doorbell for it to sense motion.  Sometimes, packages were delivered without ever setting it off.  I lived with that for a year because when it did work, the image was very good.  However, I recently upgraded my wifi and needed to connect the Ring to the new service.  Unbelievably, you have to remove the doorbell to access a reset button on the back.  I have security cameras that don't require this.  That was annoying enough but one of the screws is stripped from installation.  I tried the original Ring provided tool.  Ordered a similar tool from Amazon.  Tried the rubber band trick.  NOTHING will remove this so I basically have a brick attached to my doorframe.  I am taking a hammer to it and going with a motion sensor camera.  By the way, if you google this issue, it appears to be fairly common.  I saw mention that Ring would send new screws but that's an empty offer if you can't get the old ones out.

I setup the device through its phone app. I installed it outside and the doorbell feature works perfect. The motion sensor would not activate unless I was moving inches from the device. After speaking to tech support and having them tinker with it remotely it was decided that the doorbell arrived with a bad motion sensor. Now they have to process (takes 2-4 days) the request for a new one and another 3-4 days to ship and arrive to me. So in about a week I'll try setting it up again and then also drop off the defective unit with the return packaging at the post office. UPDATE: I received a new unit and the motion sensor is better but not much better. Motion is needed within 5ft even after setting the default to 30ft detection and highest sensitive setting. It will still ""see"" cars on the road but not people. Also, I noticed after pushing the button the delay is long enough where most people will not stay long enough for you to respond back and the video shows the person walking away and not their face.

It wouldn’t respond to any button presses straight out of the box, so I plugged in the charging cable thinking the battery might be dead. It began to work while plugged in, and I was able to get it set up and connected to my WiFi. I ran the test to make sure it was working, and then I noticed the battery said 100%. So I said, “OK, time to install it.” After drilling holes and installing it, lo and behold it didn’t work at all. The button didn’t light up, the camera didn’t work, totally dead. So I detached it, and to keep this story from being longer than it already is, I figured out it would only work while plugged in, I called Ring customer support, went through diagnostics and troubleshooting, and discovered that I had a defective device. It was then that I noticed hundreds of fine scratches in the black plastic on the front of the device. I don’t know how easy the black plastic is to scuff, but this thing definitely looked used. I cannot confirm with certainty that it wasn’t scuffed by my handling of it, but I did nothing that should have caused that level of widespread scratching on the front of it. I suspect that I was sold a refurbished and defective doorbell. The lady from Ring customer service gave me the choice of returning it to Amazon or to have a DEFINITE brand new one sent from Ring. I obviously chose the latter option, and she was kind enough to offer expedited shipping for free. I have received open packages and questionable “new merchandise” from Amazon increasingly more often in recent months, and it seems like their reputation for sterling customer satisfaction has started to go downhill. Edit: Ring has taken a week and a half to ship my new doorbell. They needed to authorize my credit card for $1 to ship out the new unit, and the lady said it went through, and my package would ship the next day. 3 days later I still didn’t have any shipping info, so I called Ring support again, and they said my $1 charge hadn’t gone through for some reason after all, and nobody bothered to tell me. So that was on a Friday, and they said it would ship on Monday with expedited shipping. Right now it’s Tuesday afternoon, and I finally just got the email that it shipped.

When someone rings the doorbell you are supposed to be able to talk to that person immediately. Our experience has repeatedly been that by the time we get the alert that someone is at the door, it’s too late. The person is long gone. This experience is true no matter whether we are home or not. It could be related to a weak WiFi device built into the ring doorbell itself because all of our WiFi devices get a strong signal from our router every where, inside and outside of our house. There is no reason for this doorbell to fail other than the doorbell itself having substandard manufacturing. If you pay for the subscription to have all your videos stored on their cloud, you can then watch what was recorded that you were supposed to be able to see live. Save your money and avoid frustration and just buy a Blink camera. You don’t have to buy a subscription to see recordings with Blink. It is a motion detecting camera.

They send me some wedges to make it incline so that ring get right visibility. 2) Date 09/07/2019: Once I received the wedges, I installed them by placing single wedge, later with dual wedge and subsequently with 3 wedges. I made adjustments to height of doorbell as well to make it less than 48in from ground. None of these adjustment worked. I worked with technical team and made the adjustment on software & hardware as proposed. by end of the call, technical team identified that the doorbell is not good to capture the motion and though my doorbell was outside warranty period, I was sent a replacement doorbell.

I observed that there is no improvement on motion detection with new doorbell. I called the tech representative and was told that this model of device wont work as it is dependent on environment. I immediately asked service rep to stop giving me that reason as Chicago weather is great from the period (August to September) I was raising the issue. If it cant work in that environment, Ring should either pull this product back from the market or issue refund to the customer whom ring failed to deliver the quality that they are committed to provide. I was given multiple reason but technical team is unable to answer pretty basic question to support the product Please see the photo attached: I do have shrubs on side of the door but highlight path is 25feet long from the door. if anyone is approaching straight from that path, ring is only capturing video once the person is very close to door. (this has been tested on all 3 occasions when i called Ring Support team). Ring team is unable to explain why motion is not captured when someone is walking straight. they attributed to environment, thermal signature.. (throwing some technical acronym thinking the customers are fool). I work with these devices and my home is full with smart devices.. all those 3 days when i talked to sales/technical rep, the weather was great in Chicago and ring shouldn't attribute their device failure on environmental reasons. I won't recommend anyone to buy this device as this is not good quality product offered by Ring. This is substandard product and you will find much better options on amazon marketplace who can offer much better services.. Ring should pull this product from marketplace as by releasing this product, they are compromising the security of families who are depending on such useless product. I bought annual membership from ring which I am going to discontinue as it doesnt offer any benefit to me.. why to pay for useless device if it doesn't serve the purpose.. I hope this feedback will be helpful for buyers looking at this device online and thinking of buying something for their family security. Please buy wisely, after all its for your family's security..",Useless Device
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,22-May-20,Noel Chumbley,"Bullet list of my issues with the Ring Doorbell...1) if you entry is inset, walls on each side, you get good video of the are between the wall but just a bright blob outside of the area. 2) no mention that you need a minimum $30/yr subscription in order to be able to view a motion. 3) very slow, have had waiting times of over 10 minutes to see the motion after a detection, this mostly occurs while on cell data. 4) same issue with live view, and many times it just errors out and have to try again. Except for #1 it works best and fastest when on the same network as the doorbell but part of wanting such technology is for when your away.

If you shrink the street motion down it automatically shrinks the walking down to nothing.  It picks up people on the sidewalk and street but not walking up to my door from my walkway. For example: my mailman walks up the walkway puts mail in box and it picks up the motion after he is away from door.  The sound is okay but not nearly as clear as it should be.

Gill,"Easy to install (although I had our handyman do it). Works well enough. We live on a busy street during school drop off/pick up and you can't change or modify the ""zones"" so perhaps only 4 out of the 5 zones are monitoring. For 45 minutes at drop off/pick up, the Ring is going off constantly because it's catching cars/people walking by 30 feet away. Also, it's weird, but it rarely picks up my husband pulling into/out of the garage which is about 20 feet or so from the Ring camera, yet every car that drives by triggers it. The driveway is literally directly in front of the Ring, whereas the street is at a 95 degree angle, so that's strange. I'd like consistent monitoring. If someone is out in the street who cares, but if a car or someone is in my driveway, I'd like to be notified. The battery needs to be recharged every month, too. You'll need to unscrew it and charge it with a USB cord. We had to order the Ring doorbell Chime also because the wifi signal was so weak coming through the walls/concrete. I'm not unhappy with Ring, yet not totally pleased either.",Easy to install (although I had our handyman do it)

I just removed my old doorbell, moved the wires to the new Ring one, and secured the ring to the door frame where the old bell was. The only tool I used not included in with the bell was a screwdriver and portable drill (as a power screwdriver). It all took about 5 minutes. After I download the program to my Galaxy was easy and after opening an account with Ring everything worked as advertised. With the assistance of IFTTT and my SmartThings hub, I've created a rule that says between sunset and sunrise, turn on the front light when motion is detected.

I can choose to have notifications on my cell phone of rings or motion, and can also watch live view. All are recorded and you can view at any time. The subscription for this service is so low that it's a no brainer. It is important to have a strong WiFi signal to the doorbell for optimal service.

The Ring Video Doorbell is actually made for use on a house to replace your current traditional doorbell. But seeing we live in a motor coach, I had to of course install one. Hey, after all, it is our ""house"". The best news to me was that it actually can run on it's internal, rechargeable, battery! Yup...That means no wires need to be run or holes made in the coach. The batteries recharge via USB port and last for a very, very, long time. I have had this installed for over two months now and the battery is still at 85%! What does it do you may ask? Well, when someone presses the button, it rings an app on your smartphone (Android or iPhone). From that app you can see the person at your door no matter if you are home or not. If you care to then chat with the person, you can do that via it's built in speaker and mic. Even if you choose not to, it records the video onto a cloud storage area. Now the service does cost for the storage, however it is only $30 a year. (That's cheap.) So that means even if you miss the call, your still get a video of anyone that pays a visit. It even has motion sensitive areas. So you can setup zones for it to watch for motion and if detected, it will send you an alert and record the video. We do not do this however, for we do not need it to send us a notice and make a video every time we go in and out of the coach.

It arrived several days later and I rushed to install it.  The packaging itself is something to behold.  Think iPhone packaging. I knew if the same amount of engineering went into the product as went into the box then I surely had a winner. Amazing. It’s worth buying the product just to see the box.  Included are all the mounting tools you would ever hope to need.  A clear plastic area over the Ring is labeled “Try me,” and of course I did and my excitement grew.  Mounting the Ring was easy.  What took the longest was making sure the Ring had a good charge.  Had our existing doorbell been wired instead of wireless, I would just have had to attach the wires to the Ring.  I did have one problem when setting up the App on my phone.  I entered the incorrect wireless password.  I ended up having to call support.  Their hours on my package said they are open 9-5 PST but they are really open 7-7.  No complaints there.  The tech support person I spoke with was terrific. It was a simple matter for them to have me reset the Ring and everything connected.  Once done I had to test it and it really worked.  Last weekend we were travelling and the Ring alerted me that we had a visitor.  It was our Postal delivery woman.  By the time I answered the alert, she was getting back in her car.  “Hey Billy, thanks for the delivery.” She responded, “Are you inside?”  “No, we’re in Charleston.”  She looked a bit confused, got really close to the Ring and asked if I wanted her to sign for a package.  I don’t think she ever realized we were 300 miles away and we could have been anywhere.  The Ring is truly amazing.  Video saved to the cloud if you want.  Two way voice communication.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Feb-17,D.,"While rebuilding a home I just purchased in Detroit, my main concern was securing the home while it is getting worked on. I saw the Ring commercials in the past & remembered them when it came time to get things in order. I purchased it from Micro Center in Madison Heights, Mi & the reps there provided even more insight into it. The installation was simple enough. Charge it fully, sync it to your WiFi, download the app to your phone and/or computer, then screw it into the door frame or position of your choice. 4 screws into the frame, 2 screws to tighten the device to the lock frame. No wires & no mess. Took literally about 5-10 min for install from sync to hookup. I am usually skeptical about things proclaiming that installs are very easy but this one really was. Gets a + in my book. Camera is extremely clear, day or night, sun, rain or snow. You can adjust the range of the motion sensor from 30 feet out to any range within and adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. You can also add on an in house door chime if you do not have an existing door bell (like me) that syncs with the ring so again, no wires OR multiple ring devices for multiple locations and/or homes. It also works very well with my recently installed Xfinity home security. I now have no blind spot. Best part is that the Ring device allows me to see who's coming to my house when I'm not there. It can make people think you are there in the home when you aren't which is another +.  I just had an issue with our local water department claiming a technician had come out to turn on the service in which the tech stated that he knocked on the door but no one was home and that he waited 10 minutes before he left. The ring doorbell clearly showed however that he in fact just walked up to the door, did not knock (when the motion sensor is set off, it records the audio as well as the video), just hung up the 'sorry we missed you' door hanger and then immediately left. They were trying to charge me a 40.00 missed appointment fee for that but instead, thanks to the Ring recording, I just simply walked into an office and showed the video. Needless to say that the charges were reversed. I have also caught a Comcast tech pulling up in front of the home, sitting there for 5 minutes and then pulling off, something else I was able to prove as well. This device is well worth the money invested and I have told/shown my friends. 2 of them have just bought it within the last few days and I am going back on Friday to purchase another for a different house. These devices aloows you to do the impossible - be in 2 or more places at one time! Hope my review helps!","Doorbell + 2 way communication +  HD/Nightvision Cam = Yes, please!"

Works just as described and is extremely configurable. As for the wifi connectivity, I'm writing this review in the Cayman Islands and my Ring doorbell is notifying me of activity at my front door. Incredible! Glad I bought it. <><><><><>< UPDATE 20 Dec 2015 ><><><><><> I've had the Ring doorbell now for a few months and still love it. It's really been helpful this Christmas season with being notified about package deliveries while away from the house. But this update is about Ring's customer service. In November, the WiFi notifications stopped all of a sudden. It's easy to know when it happens because the familiar Ring sound on your iPhone/iPad doesn't happen when the house doorbell rings. I called Ring's customer service and asked them what to do. The phone representative performed a couple of diagnostic tests on the doorbell (with me pushing the button at appropriate times), then had me do a hard reset of the device. When that didn't clear up the issue, they shipped a brand new unit to me the next day. I did a simple swap of the old device for the new device and returned the old device to them post-paid. Didn't cost me a cent and the new device has been working perfectly ever since.

I don't have hardwired connectivity available for a doorbell, so I had to find a battery solution.

Live view never connects whether it is through the Ring app or the Rapid Ring app. I need to let the camera run out of batteries so it can do a reboot, in which live view will work with a few days and go back to not working. -No option to do a soft reboot from the app. Have to take the camera off the mount. -Video quality on this one not great. If the white balance behind you is too bright, you won't be able to capture much.

I wanted a bit more security without spending a fortune. After a lot of research, I decided to get a Ring Video Doorbell. I'm very impressed!!  The system came with easy instructions and everything needed to install it.  I had it unpacked and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Programming and synching with my cellphone was easy. The Ring system detects motion from my house to across the street. Sensitivity can be adjusted easily.  I can answer my front door without opening the door, which is especially helpful at night. Quality of audio and video are excellent.  I'm pleased with this system and feel more secure.  Also, when I'm away, I can still monitor my home and contact the police if needed.",Excellent Extra Security

The PRO has much better picture quality. After the 30 day trial, you end up with a Fancy door bell with a motion sensor. There is no recording of the movement or the ringing of the doorbell... you have to subscribe for this. This is a cheap knock off of a legit video security system... Ring recognized this, and then started upgrading to PRO and offering motion sensing lights and stuff.  If you are going to go all the way to RING, you are better off going to an ARLO or similar system that has multiple cameras, better sensor, more complex controls and the ability at No Charge to keep video recordings. Yes they are initially a bit more expensive, but you are getting something that is worth something - vs an inferior quality tool",The PRO has much better picture quality

I have worked with Ring support multiple times and I even changed out my internal doorbell transformer.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Jul-18,Nathan Jones,"This review is half negative, half positive. Negatives first: I purchased this for my small office on Prime Day along with an Echo Show because ring supposedly ""integrates"" with Alexa. The only integration is that when your Chime or your phone alerts you that someone's at the doorbell, you can ask Alexa to show the camera. Alexa doesn't tell you that there's movement on the camera or that someone's rung the bell; it will ring/alert on your smartphone app and/or a Ring Chime if you've purchased one, but then you have to ask Alexa to show you the camera (Echo Show). If you DO ask her to bring up the camera, you still can't talk to the person at the door or allow them to talk to you. I'm not sure I'll ever use that function, but it would be nice to have. Tapping the alert on your smartphone automatically brings up the doorbell camera, including the speaker, so the Alexa integration with this product is pointless. Further, after your free trial, it only records if you purchase a plan through them. You can still view the camera live, but you can't see video of anyone who rang the doorbell while you were away or didn't have alerts turned on. Plans are cheap - I personally only need the basic plan, which is $3/month or $30/year, and the professional plan is only $10/month or $100/year - but comparing it with other services (such as Arlo, which I also use), it's not something that's usually required. For the positives: As far as the product WITHOUT Alexa, it's nifty. You use your smartphone to be alerted to motion and/or when someone rings the doorbell, and there's an optional ""chime"" device that's required if you want it to ring elsewhere than your phone. Do not get this if you expect it to ring through Alexa. If you just need a doorbell camera that can be accessed remotely, my experience so far is that this is a pretty decent device. It can be wired into your current wired doorbell, or it can be used wirelessly. Our wiring is pretty scary, so I've had it on WiFi. I've been testing it by keeping it on and recording almost constantly since the day it arrived, and the battery is at 50%. I count that as a positive, because not only was it not fully charged when I installed it, my only comparison is a set of Arlo security cameras, which I've had to charge as often as every two days if there's been high traffic. Installation was easy, but looks like it could be more difficult if you're installing into brick or concrete. Overall, the statement that it ""integrates"" with Alexa is TECHNICALLY true but absolutely pointless. It works well with my iPhone 8, and I just ordered a Chime, which I'm excited to try out. I was extremely upset when I first figured out that it didn't work the way the description and reviews seemed to indicate, but it's grown on me and been very reliable so far.","Fun, but Alexa integration is absolutely useless"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jul-19,Andrew,"Purchased this Ring in 2018. Chose this model because of that fact that at that time, our home did not have a doorbell, so we were unable to hard wire it. We also figured that we didn't need anything too fancy, as our place was very small. A few months later we moved into a bigger home, with a doorbell and decided to hard wire this product. (Note, we never installed it in the first home since we knew we would be moving and were trying to avoid unnecessary damages to the property). Immediately after installation, we noticed that when reviewing video footage or a live view, there is an ear piercing 'wind' sound that is NON-STOP! You literally can't hear anything other than this sound, even if someone is speaking. We figured maybe it was installed incorrectly, so removed the entire camera and re-installed- nothing changed. The camera is enclosed in a doorway, so I'm certain there is no wind causing this sound, especially considering it happens every single time we view anything on this thing. We attempted to reach out to Ring, since by the time we installed it, our Amazon return window had closed, and they were unable to provide any assistance. I'm assuming there is a manufacturers warranty, but we weren't told anything about that. Super disappointing, as it would be nice to hear something other than this horrendous sound every time someone comes around our front door. Based on the fact that I have watched fellow Ring owners' videos via the app, it's safe to say, we received a faulty camera. I'll also point out that I'm aware that we purchased the 'cheapest Ring camera', but the video quality is mediocre, at best- I guess that's what you get with 720p. Someone can be standing directly in front of the camera and I wouldn't be able to pick them out of a line up. I am looking into purchasing a backyard floodlight camera, and considered Ring, but after this experience I don't think I can bring myself to spend $200+ on another camera, and risk the same issues. I appreciate the features of the camera and the Neighbors app, which is why I'm not giving one star. But I would certainly hope Ring is able to resolve this ridiculous issue with their cameras.","Good, not great"

If you want to skip the long review watch the video and let that speak for itself (every Ring video mine takes looks like that). The review is just the detail and support hell I went through as to my reason I gave it two stars. Bought mine via their website. It kinda works. However it failed me at it's one advertised feature! You'll note the person's face can't even be seen despite being in perfect view of the camera. It's all pixelated. I called support about this. Nothing they could do (had hoped they had a better quality version to no avail). Their questions were to state that the issue was with my WiFi (I am a network admin and I KNOW it's not due the router, the RING being the ONLY thing with a crappy connection).I have a 200Mbps line and the access point sits 7.5 feet from the Ring doorbell on the other side of the wall. I have devices 30+ ft away in the house through 2-3 walls that have solid connections I get a FAIR connection in my backyard which is 65 feet away through 3 walls 2 of them concrete. The Ring is only separated by a single wooden/sheetrock wall/doorframe. This is of course consistent behaviour with the device. The quality is like this on ALL videos. I had to buy a separate camera higher res camera to compensate. Basically using the Ring as an intercom at this point as the video has proven to be useless for it's intended purpose. Whether it's at night or in the day time its generally the same quality video. I tried working with their support and just got fed up as they kept trying to pin it on my network (which works for EVERY device in the house EXCEPT the RING thats the closest wifi device to the router). I gave them a bandwidth test and when it did not show that my connection was bad, they tried to send me to other ones until they got the result they wanted (they did not). Basically tried to pass the buck on to me. So if you want an intercom, this works well for that. For actual surveillance and security? Get something else. A dedicated camera paired with this will work just fine. I bought two surveillance cameras with POE injectors and WiFi Adapters for less than the price of the Ring. Those are doing a FAR superior job.","Resolution is crap, support is meh."

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Oct-15,Sully,"We installed our Ring Doorbell approximately 3 weeks ago and I love it more and more every day!  Let me start out by saying that the unit itself  is very well made and it comes in a variety of finishes so there is something for everyone.  Installation was a breeze because EVERYTHING you will need to install your doorbell is included in the kit; a mounting plate, a concrete drill bit, a tiny level, and even a special screw driver.  The instruction booklet is clear and concise but I would recommend watching one of the installation videos before getting started.  Our Ring replaced an existing wired doorbell so it runs on electric current.  If you don't have electric the Ring has a battery that once charged will last for at least a year before it has to be charged again.  Our Ring was very SECURELY  installed on our brick home and it was up and ready to go in less than 20 minutes.  Because of the price, if you are worried about it being stolen don't be.  Once installed this thing is not going anywhere!  You would need to hit it with a hammer to steal it and the company's policy is if it is stolen they will replace it for free. After downloading the free app and logging into our Wi-Fi, which literally took less than 10 minutes, we were ready to start answering our Ring thru our phones.  The video quality is excellent and very clear, as is the sound quality.  We also utilize the motion feature which notifies you if someone is within the ranges you easily predetermine.  This another awesome security feature that lets you know if someone is lurking around your door but does not ring the bell.  We can see who is at our door and speak to them thru the Ring from inside our home, from our jobs, or from a thousand miles away on vacation.  We live in Chicago where crime is at an all time high.  The Ring has afforded us additional protection to go along with our home security system. Everyone that comes to our house now wants to get one for themselves, including our mailman! We are very, very happy with this purchase and are considering putting one on our back door too!  I truly cannot rave about this product enough.

One would think that because I’m not using the motion sensing or any recording that the battery would last longer than 2 weeks. Nope. The battery life is super poor. Maybe I have a bad battery, but we also have an Arlo that does record motion and uses motion sensing, and I recharge that every couple months. When we had the motion sensing during the free trial you can set the distance for when motion gets picked up, which in theory is cool. I set it for 6 feet (closest distance), and it picked up EVERY single car that drove by (30 ft away). If that actually worked the chance that we would have purchased the Ring protect plan would be highly likely.  Now I’m stuck with a device that I can’t really take advantage of it’s “good” features, and I’m constantly taking it on and off the wall outside to recharge it.

Also, I get over 50 notifications a day of movement that are all cars driving by my house however I can’t turn down the settings because it already doesn’t activate in time to catch an actual person. I’ve had several people stop by and leave something for me on my porch and the doorbell never even kick on. I got my doorbell Dec. 2015 and it's now it no longer rings my hardwired internal chime. That means that other than notifications to my home, nothing actually rings at my house. I've contacted their support 3 times now and it still hasn't been resolved. I was told that the resistor in my homes previously installed, hard wired chime went bad allowing for 22-23 volts rather than the normal 16. This then damaged the capacitor in the actual ring hardware. What's frustrating is, the actual chime still works fine, all I need to do is remove my hardwired Ring Video Doorbell and throw it in the trash, then install my old-school, battle proven, doorbell. I was told this happens A LOT but it's still been more than a week for them to even have their escalated support reach out to me. They need to update the firmware to allow for live view (coming in their Pro version however NOT HARD to add to existing models for loyal customers). All in all, I would not recommend this product and feel that they still have a lot of improving before it's actually more than just a fun tech gadget. UPDATE: After contacting their support, Ring sent us out a brand new doorbell as well as postage to send the defective unit back. I was unable to identify if there were any actual differences but I was happy to have a new one none the less. I just didn't want the 22-23 volts of my current system to fry this unit too. I'm happy to say that it's now been more than 6 months with the new doorbell and it's still working as expected. In addition, Ring.com has rolled out the live view mode for this model as well which is something I was disappointed it didn't have in the beginning.  My only issue now is that every time a car drives past my house it the inferred signature sets off the motion sensor.

The battery does great with how much it goes off, we have a decent amount of traffic, but it doesn't take long to recharge and it goes back outside. Installation was quick and easy and it works great. I do recommend getting their wifi extender and charger. There does seem to be an issue with how well it picks up routers regardless of how no other electronic device we have has ever had issues picking up the signal outside but to me a small price to pay for a piece of mind. They update the product regularly and we can now share videos with those around us which is great if someone in our neighborhood has an unwanted visitor they want everyone else to know about. Overall a great product. A very satisfied customer and I think we will always have these around. I think it has been well worth the investment.",Great Way to Monitor Home
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Dec-15,Sweetie,So just installed my ring doorbell. I'm a female and it was easy even for me. All I did was follow the instructions from the tutorial videos and gave it a shot. First what I did is took my ring video out of the box downloaded that app on my phone. Connected the ring to the app. Then started the installation process I first took out my original doorbell looked at how the wires were. Then I cut off the power to my house from the breaker box. Then proceeded to put the panel on. Was very easy took on about maybe less than 10 minutes. Since I had previously connected the ring doorbell to the app all I had to do was snapping on once I had it installed. As you can see from the video it's good to go. Only reason I'm not given it a five star is that I tried it out a couple times were having people come up to my door and the video was kind of fuzzy when they were standing there so I'm not quite sure if that's my Wi-Fi or if it's the actual unit. But overall I love it.,So far so good

I went through the technical problem solving and found after using the ""test your wi-fi speed"" tool, my wi-fi wouldn't support the video. (which is what I bought it for in the first place) I left it in place anyway because it still notified me when someone was at the door and I could get a still picture. After about 6 months, it started dropping the wi-fi connection all the time. It's a real pain to reconnect it if you have to do it every day. I called the company and asked if I could send it in for repairs or to have it checked. THEY SAID THEY DON""T DO THAT! I definitely DO NOT recommend this product!!!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Dec-15,A,"The lifetime warranty on this doorbell is the real deal. This is a very well-supported doorbell. I was having issues with holiday season package thieves and a non-working wireless doorbell. Ring is the only video doorbell I could find that will work wirelessly. The first one had battery issues. Replaced no problem. The second one had sound issues. Replaced no problem. The third on works FLAWLESSLY. I absolutely love it. The smart motion sensor works well. I see everyone who comes onto my porch, but not my neighbors' porches (three doors lined up on one big house). Two way sound is mostly good -> if it's really windy, it's hard to hear sometimes. The video is way better than I thought it would be. I can see well enough on my phone, but if I download and watch on my computer, it is very impressive. I signed up for the cloud recording - it's the least expensive pay service of any of my security cameras, and it has been reliable over the few weeks I have been using it. The doorbell is also conspicuous enough to act as a deterrent. I've had a couple of alerts where people looked like they were going to come up the steps and then changed their minds. Both my postal carrier and my UPS driver said that a lot of their stops have these, and they really like them. Bottom line: It took a couple of tries, but I am one hundred percent happy with this doorbell. If you have an issue, use the warranty. It's a real thing. UPDATE: I have a CHIME now, as well, and it also works beautifully. The Ring Company gave it to me for free as a promotion, because I had bought two of their doorbells.",Life Saver

Buratt,I’m so happy with our Ring door bells and the app. We have them on the front and back door. They app doesn’t seem overly sensitive and seems to only chime when there is actual motion. Love the feature to be able to speak to who is there. We had a package due to be delivered that required signature. Was able to find out from the carrier where we could pick it up via the app vs having to call the carrier and get sent to multiple people.

I have it on the most sensitive settings. Alexa - I linked mine to Alexa - to test it. Mistake for me as it over-rides all volume controls and attempts to silence it. If you work shifts/nights think again as I had to unplug Alexa to stop the alerts. Overall - it’s good.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Nov-15,Phil128398,"I have been using ring for several months now and I am really happy with the video doorbell and chime. The installation is extremely easy, in fact I would say it almost seems too easy if that makes sense.  I felt like there had to be more to it but I was wrong...it really was that easy. The one recommendation that I would make  for a prospective Ring owner is to make sure that you have adequate wifi bandwidth and connectivity in the place where you intend to put the ring.  Around the time I installed the Ring I also installed a couple wifi cameras (a different brand) and I found that my wifi signal wasn't strong enough to support all of my wifi devices.  This has nothing to do with the Ring, but it's something to think about when you're adding a video based wifi device. UPDATE: So I've had the ring for a few months now.  It still works really well.  I called customer support when I had an issue with the Chime (which was my fault). Their customer support was top notch and definitely located in either the United States or Canada.  In addition to being super responsive, knowledgeable and courteous on the phone they had fantastic followup skills.  Even though it was a non issue the customer service reps followed up with me to make sure everything was taken care of. I recently purchased their ring recording service that records every time someone pushes your door bell (I think you can probably set it to record based on motion as well).  At work I'm not always near my phone so it's nice to be able to check when I get back to my desk and see who rang my doorbell.","Ring, surprisingly lives up to the hype with great customer service."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Mar-18,dylper,"EDIT: I ended up contacting support and they sent me the Ring Pro (hardwired only model). These battery/hardwired ones (Ring 1 & 2) motion detection is very slow (even if they are hardwired). For example you see the recording of the mailman walking away after dropping off a package. If you want good clips before the motion starts get the Pro (the hardwired only model) The Ring app is awful when it comes to loading quickly. Most times it takes a full minute for the app to load fully so you can view the clips. I would change my rating to 4 stars due to the fact that the customer support was good to send me the Pro, no charge. However, I just can't support anyone getting the battery powered ones as they don't allow you to capture motion when it starts. So I'm going to leave it 3 stars.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Jun-19,Matt,"First, setting the motion detection on this is ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE! My door is about 70 feet from the street, a side street that doesn't have constant traffic. Either I get a motion alert for every car that drives down my street or nothing, not even people on my porch. I have changed angles, turned off zones and it cannot consistently get it right. Some days it works great, most days it either works too well, or not at all. Either way the motion detection needs work. When it functions correctly the video is pretty good, but my Blink Cameras usually pick up the motion first and IF its someone I want to interact with, I usually end up having to start the live camera feed based on my Blink Camera motion settings, not Ring. Originally I thought it might be an issue with my WIFI, but I moved my router to the window  right next to the Ring device and it did not help with motion alerts. Overall, it is nice, but if you are looking for something that provides good, ACCURATE motion detection, I would go with Blink over Ring. The only advantage that I see for Ring over Blink is that you can interact with the person... Something that the new Blink Cameras actually allow you to do as well, so maybe its just time to upgrade the porch Blink Camera... something that has been consistently reliable and... doesn't cost anything additional for cloud services.",Slightly Disappointing

Where other cameras store footage for at least a limited time period, and allow you to download/save clips, ring charges for this service. Don’t worry they make sure you pay one way or another. If you are ok with paying for yet another subscription fee, great, but here is what else I did not like about Ring: - Despite showing signal strength at the near highest level, it takes me about 10 seconds to  answer a ring. That’s if it doesn’t timeout and cancel the answer altogether. My other cameras travel further with the same obstructions and are very quick. - Since I have to charge the battery (does not fit where my power extends) I have to pop it off every couple of months to charge. One of my screws underneath began to turn with the fitting, rendering the screw useless. After chatting with support, I was shipped super glue and a new screw… to fix their hardware failure. Ridiculous. Not to mention the suggested fix did not fix it. One can only wonder if I would have been shipped a new unit should I have been a cloud subscriber. - I like the ability to snooze notifications, as I often disable my other cameras and forget. However, motion detection is still set off by large vehicles even after setting my motion zones. I basically have a $150 doorbell that I must charge every couple of months.

Pricing from Amazon was well below the ""market"" and makes the Ring an even better value. We encountered only two concerns in installing or using the Ring.  First, installing the doorbell in brick (or masonry) requires a ""set"" of masonry drill bits, NOT JUST THE ONE PROVIDED IN THE KIT, as well as a ""masonry"" drill.  Since we had both this was not a problem for us, but a caution to others.  Secondly, we found the video to be much more grainy than the ads portray.  We have a robust wifi signal and still the images of people at our front door are not easily recognizable, even when parties known to us.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jul-17,KADE,"I was glad for the LiveView feature, which I was initially disappointed to learn it didn't have when I first bought it, so adding it was a plus.  However, the motion-feature is too slow to detect, as others have commented (it shows people walking away or sometimes there's nothing to show!), it's performance is not optimal, hence not the most reliable. My biggest gripe by far is the battery life.  My house doesn't have a built-in door bell, hence no doorbell wiring so I appreciated the battery feature of ring.  But that's where my 'appreciation' ends.  Ring's official statement is that you could get up to 6 months of use but weather affects it (cold mostly, and perhaps hot too).  After I heard the 6 month time frame, I mentally adjusted my expectation to say 3-4 months, but I've gotten 4 weeks at best!  It was definitely worse during the winter (had to charge every week or so), but it's now July and I charged the battery on July 5th, and then got a warning about 2 days ago that it's critically low so less than 3 weeks?  I am yet to go past 4 weeks without having to recharge it.  So the 6 month time frame Ring gives is disingenuous at best, and dishonest at the least.  If others have been able to get up to 6 months out of theirs running on battery, I'd love to know what part of the country (or the world) you live and what you've managed to do.  And yes, I've adjusted the motion zones, sensitivity and everything I reasonably could (for instance, the bell rings for push events only, not for motion), and still get very crappy battery performance.  I'm glad I have this somewhat inexpensive motion-based camera, but Ring has either got to put more effort in a more reliable battery or battery-operated performance or not sell it with the battery option at all, because the biggest nuisance of this is having to charge so often.  Imagine if when I really need the features the most is when it is indoors charging.  It is also not a reasonable expense or effort to install door bell wiring just for this and I certainly will look for a wired product (and a house with wiring) when I move to my next house but geez.","Good idea and useful product, but battery performance is terrible"

I am really annoyed with this thing as I would get about 20-30 notifications with nothing but a bush moving in a zone I said not to watch but me leaving my house and people delivering packages would NOT get picked up. I tried changing the motion settings with zones and sensitivity and nothing helped.,Prob one of the worst motion detection out there

If you do not have the yearly subscription , It does not record for even for a short time to allow you to see who is at the door. When the door bell rings, by the time one turns on the app to check and see who is at the door, it would time out so that one can not see who is at the door, making it useless. A word of recommendation; the product is useless unless  you intend to buy the yearly subscription.",Useless without the annual fee

Love this ring camera it is so convenient I have mine hooked up to my home wired doorbell so it rings an old indoor chime when Button is pressed. The reassurance I get from being home alone or not being home and expecting packages and or the solicitators in morning I can now stay in bed without answering the door or talk to the usps or ups person delivering packages or pickups. The option to record and review a timeline of videos is awesome I mainly purchased the ring to watch my mailman and ups as I constantly have my items stolen by porch pirates taking my packages and now I can deter them a bit by being able to talk to them when they get near my home or door. Video above is how my ups driver constantly throws my packages and or boxes of stuff and now that I have ring I can now file a report/complaint on him and be petty I love it 🥰 You can also view the neighborhood crimes and share videos which is nice definitely makes me feel as is and the alerts and montion alerts work wonderful for me!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Dec-17,LouCutrone,"Do not waste your money on Ring video doorbells, they flat out do not work in any way that is use-able. Someone rings your doorbell . . by the time the Ring app loads and connects with the door bell, the person has already left. It takes a good 30-45 seconds to actually be able to communicate with whomever is at your door, by then the person is gone before anything can happen. I have super fast internet (300 Gps) with a Orbi Mesh WiFi system, that is likewise super-fast . .  so it is not my "" internet/WiFi connections"" as the company would lead you to believe, it is the Ring product itself that is horribly too slow. I also subscribed to the annual Ring service that saves your videos for retrieval in the event  someone steals a package, vandalizes, etc . .  again I have never been able to see anything but the back of someone' s head on nearly all Ring videos of such events, including mine and other users.

I’ve contacted the company several times only to be told it’s working as it should. How is that true, especially since I have to recharge it every 2-3, when it should last “up to” 6 months. That’s nowhere near the expected battery charge duration. The UPS guy is the most frequenting visitor using the doorbell and I don’t order that much stuff. I even turned off the motion sensor to help preserve the battery charge, but it didn’t matter because the battery won’t keep its charge. The company does everything it can to prevent upholding the warranty, and the extra warranty I purchased on Amazon will not cover it until the company’s original warranty is expired.

The first unit I got the video was so grainy and not even watchable that I eventually was told it was defective...I got a replacement and the replacement was defective since it wouldn't connect to my modem . I had to sit there and troubleshoot both of the doorbells for different issues and ended up replacing them. So for the 3rd one they sent me a brand new one and it connected just fine but the video quality is soooooo horrible. My wyze cameras that are further from my router and MUCH cheaper have waaaaaaaaaybetter video quality. Hell they even have better motion detection. By the time the ring doorbell captures the small motion clip the person has already passed by or they've already entered through the door so it captieesjust the end of the motion. I definitely wouldn't buy it or recommend it to anyone. If there's just a smartdoorbell of rather pair that up with a wyze can at the door. So disappointed and frustrated that I lost so much time for 3 defective products. I will say though that product support is amazing....but that's about it. I posted pictures for comparison and the ring is actually running ok in that picture since theres no one usually using the internet right now. Wyze performs great all the time. Also I know they're different angles and what not but the vid quality when watching them are night and day.,Not worth the hype. Wyze has better vid quality for much cheaper.

It stopped working for no reason on October 6, 2019. I never worked well the whole time we had it. The charge did not hold, loaded very slow, if you did live view it seemed like that completely wiped out the battery. Now, a little over a year later, the product just completely stops working. I contacted support, they could never give me a reason why this happened. They couldn't replace it without a 1 year warranty (which would have been expired anyway). They offered me a discount. However, why would I want a discount just to get another crap product. You think when you spend $100 on a product it will last for more than a year. FIND ANOTHER BRAND! My original review of this product: I just got my ring doorbell. Setting the doorbell up to a new connection was pretty easy. The picture for this particular model isn’t very good.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-15,Perini Scleroso,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought this as a doorbell, and for that it is awesome. Easy to install, had no issues. Works as advertised for me. I feel it is securely mounted and not too large, and people immediately recognize it as a doorbell and push the button. I can see them well and decide if I want to answer or not. Lots of complaints on here about the motion sensing, but for me that is an add on and not why I bought it. However, I think the motion sensing works good enough although I live on a VERY busy street with constant traffic going by all day and night. Some people assume this is a replacement for a security camera and judge it on that criteria, but that is not it's job. It's not going to catch every person entering your yard, but by the time they get on the porch motion sensing kicks in starts recording before they push the button. If they come onto the porch and do not push the button, it will usually get them, but not immediately. If the approach quickly and leave quickly, it may not get them at all. But that's OK, because IT'S NOT A SECURITY CAMERA. It is a very sophisticated doorbell, and it performs that function extremely well. If that's not good enough, for you, buy a security camera.  See my video of the UPS driver dropping off packages at my door. Motion sensing didn't get him approaching the door, but it kicked in before he rang the bell, which you can see him reach out and do in the video. If he had NOT rang the bell, the video would have been the same. Note that the sound blanks out by design right after he pushed the button, because the chime sound was playing.","Great, sophisticated doorbell. Not a security camera, but it's not supposed to be one."

At this time I would not recommend this system until they fix the app. The app was massively changed so now it is nearly impossible to answer the door from your phone, the list of videos is now gone and replaced with a side scrolling NOT WORKING thingy, HATE IT!  The previous version of the app worked flawlessly, so why change it with this garbage.  Honestly I wish I could send all four units back. Hey Ring, YOUR APP NOW SUCKS AND DOESNT WORK!!!!!!!! I really love this thing!  I needed some sort of video door bell for my front gate.  The Ring doesn't typically work well over 20 feet from the router, so I got another Almond router for my downstairs front window to boost my signal, it worked very well.  I also purchased the flood light, for my front door steps, and that works great.  I had a professional install it, (I don't trust my hubby on a ladder or with electricity!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Apr-16,Robert W.,"I have two of these doorbell devices.  One I have owned for almost two years, the other is this one I bought on Amazon.  For the first year the device responded well, recorded video and generally worked pretty good.  For the past 6 months, things have changed 180 degrees to the negative.  The Android application takes forever to respond and locks the phone up until it does respond, meaning you can not use your phone for a very long period every time the application is accessed, either on purpose or because it has to reload every time you change screens.  Also, and I assume this is because they have over-sold their system, it is impossible at times to load any of the recorded video.  I have set and watched the screen on the phone for as much as 10 minutes waiting for a video to display (using WIFI), only to have it freeze for additional extended periods while it tries to play the video.  And today, it sensed a person walking past it but did not record anything, nothing.  Motion sensing entry is there but no video at all.  It isn't the battery, it shows (when you can get the application to load) to be over half full.  Suffice it to say, the principle is good, the implementation is really really poor and getting worse the more of these they sell.  Tried their support, not a comment or suggestion.

Sometimes I am going through activity for the day and they disappear.  Never to be found or seen!  Newest issue is it will not record motion.  I can check the live view and the actual doorbell works.  But nothing else.  I have reported every issue to Ring, and they respond.  But they keep saying their engineers are working on it.  Nothing has been fixed!  Great concept and could be a wonderful product, but I surely have second thoughts now. This is an update now several months later.  I’m even more disappointed.  I can be sitting where I can see outside and there is activity to set it off, and yet nothing happens.  I’ve seen where UPS delivers clear up to the door and yet, it never activates Ring.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Jul-17,Leo,"Got the ring door bell for my new house based on decent reviews. Installed the doorbell with hardwire option with no problems. Connected to WiFi with good signal. The video quality of the doorbell is fairly poor. I would compare it to early 2000's cell phone camera. Then I started noticing issues with the motion detection not working properly, which was one of the main attractions for getting this door bell. At first I noticed that no matter how sensitive and how far/close I make the setting, the motion detection would still be catching passing cars on the street that is about 80 feet away from my door, which should be beyond the furthest setting of the bell. Next I noticed that the motion detection is random at best with noticing people movement on my porch. First I noticed that a delivery guy was pulling away in his truck after dropping off my package on the porch before I got notification about motion (yes excellent wifi signal and 120mbps internet connection), then I started noticing that I can walk through my door back and forth and stand on the porch without any detection of my presence. So I contacted Ring about my issues. The (email) response time of customer support is fairly quick, but sometimes rep would either be not knowledgeable or think that you are type of person that looks for ""Any Key"" on your keyboard. In any case, after few weeks of back and forth of changing settings (which I already tried 10 times my self) I finally requested to have a replacement bell sent to me. Which I was kind of skeptical about fixing the issue... When finally receiving a new door bell, I installed it and noticed right away that the quality of the video was even worse than the first one. To the fairly low quality of video, now I have blurriness added and even poorer night vision quality. As for the motion detection, it became slightly better, but again, nothing that you can rely on. I can still walk out or stand on the porch for a while before it finally detects me (or not). Take a look at the attached picture of the video quality. Look how blurry it is with ghosting of the porch supporting poles, etc. Knowing how it performs, I would NOT buy this door bell.","Good idea, but pretty poor execution."

Hardwiring does not charge battery, only slows the decharge. Charge first.  If you have an overhang or recessed area where your doorbell is, you will get an incredible amount of backlight during the day.  People walking out of the house look like they are walking straight into heaven and disappear. That's in a span of 10-15 feet.  This morning, in the early sun I couldn't tell it was my own daughter at the door.  Consider the next gen HD versions if that's important to you however I can't speak to its quality myself. At 72 hours, I'm really wishing I hadn't bought this.  It detects motion, windchimes, tree branches, and really desensitizes you to the alerts. I turned mine off. The picture quality is poor and after 3 days the battery is down to 80 percent.  Removing the unit to charge it will be more of a hassle than its worth and at this rate, I'll be doing it once every ten days. I was hoping the fact that it is hardwired would keep me from having to charge it.

Recommend Ring to build in the following as addition to the existing features: Update software for EV feature. Somehow customer is able to make adjustment to the sharpness and light.

I had the Ring app up and running pretty quickly on my Android (Lollipop) phone (a newer quad-core, very fast phone with rock-solid 4G LTE service).  The doorbell pairing with my WiFi was equally fast once I realized that I had to temporarily make my hidden network visible to do the setup. The picture quality is very good, even with backlighting.  The flashing button light and doorbell chime are great confirmations for visitors that the bell has been rung. My problem is that it sometimes takes a couple seconds to ring my phone and other times, actually MOST of the time, it takes 20 or more seconds.  When it takes that long to ring my phone, the bell returns to idle and shuts off the camera / intercom feature rendering it totally useless.  I read that there is a ""live-view"" function to turn it back on being rolled out but I don't have that option. My WiFi signal is not an issue.  My phone is not an issue (I've tried it with WiFi and cellular 4G LTE).  It seems that the Ring app is rather clunky and processor intensive, resulting in slow response on the phone.  The app constantly displays, ""wait"".  Reminds me of the days of dial-up!  No thank you. ***UPDATE***  After several months using this doorbell, I like it even less.  After talking to tech support, I purchased a WiFi extender and placed it inside within 5ft of the door and have a ""very good"" signal according to the Ring APP.  That said, this camera is still totally unreliable.  Most of the time it senses motion and activates just as the person is walking away so all you see is the back of the person as they walk out of the frame.  When someone rings the bell I receive notification almost immediately on the phone but, by the time the phone connects to the video on the bell, the person is usually gone - totally useless! Ring finally added a ""live view"" to the app but it is also pretty slow and unpredictable.  It usually takes 30-seconds or more to ""log in"" to the camera, often resulting in a connection failure. Finally, once every couple of months the Ring disconnects from the network for no apparent reason and will not reconnect.  That means disconnecting the entire unit and bringing it inside to run the installation program again. Again, the Ring concept is fantastic!  If this device worked, it would be amazing.

I'm giving it some leeway because these kinds of products are *fairly* new and this one has exceeded my expectations (but it is the only video doorbell I have).  Of course, months or years from now (early 2016), these products will be smaller and better, but I'm *very* happy with this video doorbell. I installed it on part of my door frame where my existing hard-wired doorbell was located on a small piece of wood door frame.  I had to add a piece of wood to create a space wide enough to mount the whole device, but it was simple carpentry.  I took a spare piece of wood, a couple of cuts to trim the wood to fit, some screws to attach the wood piece to the existing door frame and then some paint to match the surrounding door frame. The Ring worked fine with my existing doorbell wires and existing door bell.  So Ring is always recharged and my doorbell sounds the same as it always did. I do not have the extra chime you can purchase extra.  My existing doorbell works exactly as it used to, plus all my phones and tablets ring when the Ring doorbell is pushed.  That's plenty of notification that someone is at the door, and it's all the notification I had - and more. Installation was pretty easy.  They included all the tools you need (although I used some of my own since they have bigger grips than the ones included and I have big hands).  I tested it inside my house for a while before installation, to make sure everything was OK before I started to install it. The Ring doorbell works very well.  There is a few seconds of lag between pushing the button and capturing audio; the video starts right away.  The audio delay is noticeable but doesn't bother me because it's capturing video right away.  That's great. Motion detection is adjustable and catches everyone walking on the sidewalk 20 feet from my door (as I set it up to do) as well as anyone coming all the way up to the door.  I've had it for less than a full year and I noticed the motion detection was a *little* less sensitive at first (summer).  It's very accurate now (winter).  I wondered if it's an issue with the temperature (summer vs. winter temperatures having an effect on how the Ring determines if the motion is from a person or just wind shaking a branch), or if the Ring has updated firmware - I don't know.  But it's fine right now during the winter months, and I'll know if the issue is season-dependent after the summer of 2016 (my second summer with the Ring). Ring requires a $30/year to store videos, and I think that's a very reasonable price.  The alternative would be to buy a security camera plus disk storage if I wanted to store my own videos, plus setup time and maintenance, so I don't begrudge Ring a nominal fee to store videos on their servers.  The apps and web site gives me access to the stored videos anytime, from anywhere. If you have the Ring-stored video, it would be nice if the iOS app had a multi-select to delete stored videos faster.  I've actually just gotten in the habit of not deleting anything, and I just let Ring clean up on their schedule (videos are supposed to be stored for 6 months, but I haven't checked if this is exactly the clean-up schedule).  I haven't had any issues with the video storage service or accessing any video.  You can save or share any stored videos (if you have the paid storage service).  If you don't have the service, you only get notifications and real-time video. I was worried people would be confused what to press to ring the doorbell - I didn't want them to press the camera eye.  That has not been a problem.  It's clear what to press during the day and the Ring's button has a glowing ring of light at night, so that was a concern I had, but it's not been an issue.",Highly recommended

Ring doorbell is a good idea. When it works it’s ok. Many times I have tried to see who is at the door and it never connects and gives an error. This happens a lot. I am very unhappy that Ring has to charge moneys so I can review the videos (Ring Protect Plan). To not have atleast videos from the last 24 hours for review is asinine and unfair. Not everyone is available 24-7 to answer the doorbell. I was considering purchasing another unit for the back Door but now this is totally useless to me.

It does almost exactly what I was hoping it would do. I just wished I had a better place to mount it under my covered front entry. My original wired doorbell is facing a brick wall, so that won't work.  The front entry is covered so the view outside is narrow, and because of the bright sun, the outside portion gets a bit over exposed and washed out. If I mounted it on my exterior brick wall in front of my front door, it will be exposed to the train and from what I've read all cause the device to stop working. The app and motion sensor work great and I now can see my Amazon packages being delivered or dropped in front of my door. I hope my new egg cooker is working tonight when I get home, it looked like he tossed it on the ground. I also got the wireless doorbell ringer which is now plugged into an outlet in my bathroom. We couldn't hear the old wired doorbell before so this will be an improvement. After about 3 weeks of use, my fully charged Ring doorbell is at 66% which makes me think I'll be recharging every 2 months. I'm not sure if that's OK because I had the impression one charge would last a year. Maybe I misread something. I'm still happy with it. The technology is very cool.

I installed it in place of an intercom and I feel much safer being able to see whomever is at my door rather than just talk. Installation was super easy, as is charging it. Customer service also great. First time I went to re-charge (about 4 months after purchase -- it came charge at 50%) I lost my screwdriver and they sent me a new one within days. My only mild issues: 1) I had hoped/planned to hardwire it, but it turns out the low voltage wires I have in my doorbell spot are DC and the Ring is only compatible with AC lo-vo. It's fine running on battery power but I'm not able to pull up video on command without the hardwiring which is a bummer. 2) Mo door is pretty close to the street so cars going past my house set off false motion detection alerts. I called Ring to fix the problem -- turns out setting the zone boundaries too close can exacerbate the issue, so I loosened them to about 10 feet. It didn't completely solve the problem -- I still get the false alerts but not as often. Sure, I could turn off the motion alerts altogether but I figure better to be safe than sorry. All of that said, I love my Ring. I can see when my gardener comes and goes from my atrium, I can see when packages/mail arrive. I love being able to tell people I'm home when I'm really not.

I have it ""hardwired"" to avoid battery issues that I have with my current old school video door bell, so I can't speak to battery life. I love that it captures video for motion detection, even if the doorbell is not pressed. With my old video doorbell, people could simply knock on the door and bypass the doorbell. Defeats the purpose. I think the manual says video can be effected below 20 degrees. We've had some coooold sub-zero winter days and only once did I notice the picture was not the best. But it was fine in much colder weather. Otherwise, the picture is clear and the intercom and live view features work well. I've talked to visitors at my front door from the comfort of my office miles away. I will say that it can be a pain to access in a hurry when your phone is locked. You have to log in. But it's less effort than actually getting up and looking through the peep hole. We also have the chime accessory, which is nice. A note on motion detection. We have ours set up for just a five feet or so in front of our door. Our house is set back about 20 feet from the sidewalk and a good fifty feet from the curb. Even with this setting, we get alerts from passing cars. Not all passing cars and it never picks up people walking by on the sidewalk (both positives). It seems to pick up a weird combination of cars passing *and* airplanes overhead. I'm not sure how the motion sensor works, but it can't be a coincidence that every video of a car passing also has a plane in the background. No biggie for us though. If your house it set closer to a busy sidewalk/street (or you live under a flight path), it's something to consider. You can turn the motion notifications off though.",Great doorbell.

Not having a wired doorbell also means the device has to be removed for recharging periodically.  I just received the low battery warning and attempted to unscrew the Ring doorbell unit with the little screwdriver that came with it. The tip of the screwdriver broke off when I tried to remove one of the screws. Oh well, I just ordered a compatible little screwdriver for $7.98 from amazon and I hope it will remove the screw without breaking. The screw was put in too tightly during the installation appointment. Follow-up: the installation company came out and fixed the problem with the screw. Ring Doorbell is a good concept, but hopefully better versions will be introduced in the near future.","Ring Doorbell is a good concept, but I would wait for next generation ..."

Also, when in the workshop, I often miss visitors coming to the front door. The Ring Video Doorbell is a great solution. Combined with ringer that's more audible throughout the house and the smartphone notification, I can now hear, see, and communicate with visitors from anywhere. The configurable motion detection feature allows us to sense when anyone approaches just within the porch area to avoid notices from passing vehicles.

It works great, when it works. And that’s the problem... 95% of the time (even with very good WiFi signal) it has a hard time connecting to the device to view it, or takes forever. I first purchased the chime pro, thinking that would help extend the range (even though the WiFi signal was fine) and it actually made my signal worse. I bought a generic WiFi repeater which helped, but even though WiFi signal is now near perfect, it still has connectivity issues. The motion sensor is downright annoying. No matter how close you have it adjusted to the house, it’ll ring your phone every 10 seconds when a car drives by the house 50ft away. I purchased two of these, and have the same issues with both.

I installed with a wired connection used by a regular doorbell.  The entire process took about 15 minutes.  (2)  Phone Customer Service is great, highly responsive and knowledgeable.  I was getting glare at night and was sent a ""corner kit"" that largely resolved the problem.  (3) The IOS App is good. (4) Abundant videos on every ""Ring-Related"" topic can be found on YouTube. The negatives:  (1) Poor picture quality.  There is no contrast or brightness setting.  Despite installation in a largely open area, and after trying multiple settings for ""motion,""  there remains way too much glare and backlight.  I've tried every combination of motion settings and none resolve the issue.  (2)  At close range, the appearance of ""visitors"" is unintelligible.  I opted for the 720hd version and it's virtually impossible to identify the face of a person at my door. Bottom Line:  Because the Ring Doorbell lacks the ability to refine the video output and because the Doorbell most often generates photos that are not sufficiently refined to identify who is at my door, I cannot recommend it.  A video doorbell, at a minimum, should have adequate clarity to KNOW who is at my door.  Regretfully, the Ring Doorbell fails on this count.  I'm going to keep it because it was comparatively inexpensive and it's better than nothing, but I am disappointed.  Do not be fooled by the marketing photos of someone at a door who is being captured by a Ring Doorbell.

I had to purchase a new interior doorbell and transformer for about $15 at Iowes to hook the ring doorbells into my existing doorbell wiring. I also purchased a Linksys Wi-Fi extender because one of my entry doors is some distance from my Wi-Fi router. I already had a Wink hub which work perfectly with the ring video doorbells, but I also tested the doorbells without the wink hub and got the same great results. I installed an android program called enhanced caller ID because it speaks notifications over my Bluetooth headset, thus when the ring doorbell motion sensor goes off or the doorbell is pushed, the message sent to my phone is read to me in my Bluetooth headset. I experienced a few glitches while trying to get everything working but the ring support service was exceptionally great every time I called. All of the problems I encountered were from something I was doing incorrectly or problems with other hardware or software other than the  ring doorbell. I answered my doorbell on three occasions from my hospital bed. Once for a postal delivery, once for a questionable fundraiser (which could have been a thief checking to see if anyone was home) and once from a person who was looking for one of my neighbors. After I returned home from the hospital I have had almost daily occasion to use the ring doorbell because I have visiting nurses and physical therapist, along with an occasional delivery.

Wish I knew, what I was getting into. So I gifted the ring away to my friend and I bought Ring video doorbell 2 and Ring security system. I wish I did not. The ring video doorbell 2 came with a year recording. And I can't extend that to Ring security system. Because ""that's not how the payment system is designed."" Fair enough. My next call, the ring device is not alerting on time. Can you unscrew the device and bring it closer to the router? Err.. the screw head is completely screwed.

If the phone is not on silent, they don't wake me up with vibration. The rep insisted that I do not understand how my phone works. After spending about an hour, I gave up.

First off, we are a Windows family, yes, affectionally referred to as the 3 percenters.  :)  We had been looking at Ring for a while and saw the WiFi password bug scare.  Made us hesitate at first, but it was quickly addressed and reviews were positive about it, so we took the leap.  It was a great investment!  I would consider myself as an advanced beginner when it comes to home repair.  It took me about 2 solid hours to get the hardware installed, software installed and get it up and running.  First off, we were installing into brick on the front porch.  The bit that comes with it might have eventually done the job, but it would have taken much longer and more blood, sweat and tears.  I had a Tapcon bit that is used for brick and concrete, that was a smaller diameter.  I pre-drilled with it, then used the one that was provided to finish the job.  Once finished, I used my Lumia 950XL, installed the software and started the configuration.  I did find the instructions online more detailed than the ones provided.  The Windows 10 Mobile version didn't work properly with the setup.  It would never move forward after connecting to the Ring Doorbell's WiFi.  I had to use my Surface Pro 3 with the app installed, which the Universal App is identical on the phone and the tablet and is very functional, to finish the setup.  Once setup, then it was ready to rock and roll!  Just did a few tweaks to the settings that we preferred and of course ring it 50 times.  Since we replaced our current hardwired doorbell, it rings the current inside doorbell unit.  Being hardwired also keeps you from having to charge it since it gets power from the wiring.  We also liked the prospect of Ring because of the idea of adding a Chime in the back of the house since we don't hear the current one back there.  The doorbell was so impressive, that we bought the Chime later that day!  Installed it and works perfectly as advertised.  Besides the Windows 10 Mobile setup, the only other thing that some have alluded to is some false alerts.  We have it set at about 5 feet and that works very well, but today is bright and sunny and very windy and it's false alarmed a few times.  But definitely worth it!  We would buy it again and would love to see more devices come out for us to buy.  Would also love to see the Universal App tweaked for the Xbox One.  It would be amazing for this to pop up on the Xbox One while you are watching TV and could answer on the TV and use the Kinect to speak through!  Thanks for making a Windows Universal App and porting to the phone, and an overall great system!",Incredible system and great investment for Windows Mobile 10 Users!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Sep-16,Nicole H,"The ring doorbell is a fabulous piece of technology that will enhance the safety and security of your home.  I've rated it four stars, because there is still room for improvement, however, it is off to an excellent start. Pros : Seeing who is at your door before you run to answer it. Being able to answer your door while you're away from the door or even your home. (They'll never know you're not home!) It really is a solicitor deterrent. I've noticed that people avoid ringing the bell because they realize they're on video. You can turn off the chime (this feature is still in beta mode, but Ring will do it for you) which is amazing if your dogs bark like mine when the baby is sleeping!  Just get the alert on your phone and answer when ready. Motion alerts. I love knowing that my packages are at my door before I even get the UPS alert. And no one is stealing things off my stoop. If they do, I've got the video for the police. The physical look is stellar, and fancy looking. I got the venetian bronze and it matches my home beautifully. No more boring doorbell! The night vision is EXCELLENT! I am actually super impressed with the video quality even in the dark. The setup is super easy. I am a female and I did it myself, in just a few minutes. I even hardwired it to the existing chime. The support is FANTASTIC. I've used live chat a few times, and they're able to run diagnostics in seconds (I had a wifi problem.) The Cons : If you have a big house, or a super insulated house, you might need a wifi extender.  Mine currently works on subpar signal, but there is a bit of a delay. I'm working on that, and its more my problem than Ring's. Setting the motion can be a bit tricky. I currently have it set further than I'd like, so I get garbage truck alerts, but its the only way to get the proper alerts for people approaching the front door. I think that will improve over time. There can be a bit of a delay between your phone alert and the actual ringing of the bell. I'm not certain yet if this is because my husband and I race to answer it... or if it is a phone problem, or a ring problem. Either way, its my experience, so I'm just letting you know you're not alone if this happens to you :) All in all, I LOVE the ring. It definitely makes me feel more safe and secure that my husband can see who approaches the house if I'm home alone, and I can answer if I'm not home at all. We're going to get one for my parents, as my grandmother with dementia lives with them. I think it will be helpful when she decides to wander - they'll get an immediate alert that she left the house, and they'll be able to see which way she took off. (Good luck getting a tough cookie to wear a tracker, haha).  I see lots of uses for this and think you will too. If you're on the fence, don't wait.

The main gripe i have is that it the Ring doesn't always send motion alerts to my phone, but I can see the recorded event on my history which is strange.  The 180 degree view makes the video like a fish eye picture which is expected.  I also wish that the night vision resolution was a big clearer.  When the Ring detects movement there is a slight delay before it starts recording so sometimes the person has already come and gone.

It has a good clear video, and the sound is decent too. It picks up a lot. However, I have it set to only trigger the camera if there is motion within 5 feet of the camera and yet it has been going off every single time a car drives past. You can see in my photo that the street is not even close to being 5 feet away. It’s more like 15-20 feet away. So it’s getting a bit frustrating. Yes, I could turn off the motion sensor but that’s the main reason I got it. I get a LOT of packages from amazon and I want to know when they arrive, since my mail man doesn’t ever ring my bell. I also want it just in case someone tries to steal my packages. Therefore I won’t be turning it off... I’ll just have to deal with the notification every 5 minutes. I’m hoping that they will somehow fix the sensitivity or add a feature that lets us select certain zones to ignore motion in like I have with my other security cameras.","Good overall, some minor flaws."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Jan-17,Darryl E. Johns,"The physical installation of this product is a breeze and the documentation devotes too much time to that issue. The software for this product sucks. I don't know who wrote it but it's obvious that the app was not quality tested. There are too many decision points where the action required is described in a conflicting manner. For instance, the setup took me into the cloud purchase  where I was tricked into entering my credit card info twice, yet there was no way to back it out or continue the setup. I couldn't even get the app to accept my address. The app asks for my home address, invokes a bot which shows my home address in a list, but when I'm forced to select from that list, the app inserts my neighbors address. I tried a dozen times and finally had to allow my neighbors address to be recorded. I hope I can amend this late. I did manage to get through the app and fix the credit card issue only to find out that the unit said my Wifi signal to the front door was weak. I was forced to buy a Wifi extender. Without the extender,  the door bell rang but I could not get a 'live view' from the camera. Even with the extender (which is some 30 feet away) I still get poor signal quality notices from time to time. I purchased this product as a door bell with multiple chimes (since I have a 3 story hours). Being able to have a record of who came to the door is a nice feature. However, if you think you will be able to talk to someone who has rung your door bell or even approached your door, forget that idea. After the app notifies you because the infrared sensor has been tripped, it takes too long to invoke the camera so you can talk. The inherent latency is too great. Perhaps the 'Pro' model is more responsive. I liked the ""Pro' model's form factor but it has to be hardwired. If there was a battery powered version I would have upgraded. UPDATE: Today I noticed my battery level is 88%, it was 98% two days ago. At this rate the battery will need to be charged within 3 weeks. I now know why the Pro model is hardwired. Wifi and the camera are power hogs. To fullfill the marketing claims, this video doorbell needs a stable power source; it needs to be hardwired. My recommendation: get the Pro model, don't screw bother with the battery powered cheaper model.",OK product but needs an extender and the app needs work.

It took me 2 times to run the setup using my Windows Phone. The physical installation went without a hitch. The only thing I would suggest is that windows phones do not delete the events the way that Android and Apple do. With a Windows 10 phone you must scroll to the right to enable checking and deleting events. Otherwise it is a breeze to use! We have very little delay between the ring and the popup on our phones and PC.  Great buy!! Update: July 18-2017 Since we installed the Ring doorbell about 8 months ago, we feel much more secure. We also don't have salespeople, politicians and other assorted unwanted visitors bothering us. The look I see when they hear me answer the door remotely is worth the price of the Ring!! I have answered my door from my daughter's homes 15-20 miles from mine and it is great to see when a package arrives.. Great item that is almost a necessity. Highly recommended!!",Ring Video Doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Mar-17,Tiffy,This works good for what I needed. I didn't have a peep hole so I got this and wired it where the old doorbell was. I had some johova whinesses come by while I was at work and I was able to talk to them through the ring. I liked that they thought I was inside. I also like that it records motion of who or what is going by but I had to turn down the motion sensitivy so I didn't record every car driving by or every person walking a dog by the house. At times it's a little slow connecting but that is due probably to my location not sure. Since I wired it to the old door bell it rings inside the house with the old doorbell box so that's great. I forget the turn on my schedule or change it to start motion sensing maybe after I leave for work but for now it records me leaving and coming home. It really was worth the price and has already helped me with another solicitor man who came to my door at 7pm flashed an id badge at the door and tried to sell me some water program but again I spoke to him via the talk button and sent him away. I like that it recorded him. I have only had my ring for a couple of weeks now but I think after the trial I will buy the motion monitoring fee it's affordable enough for my safety. It's best to have porch light on at night to get a clear video. In the video where I come home after I close the door you can hear the cars go by and birds chirping it's that clear. I would have given it 5 stars but it's seemed slow connecting to show me who was at the door but still worth it!,Awesome device
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Dec-19,KS,This is the older version of the Ring doorbell.  The view is VERY narrow (fish eye view).  I was surprised by the view (Not knowing I ordered the older version) from the camera and called the technical support.  The first guy I spoke to told me there was some dirt on the lens (?!?!!).  I assured him the camera was clean but had a view as if through a hole.  He couldn’t help me at all. Finally I Called back and was told that I had an older version and the view is what it is. Really not happy with this and will replace (and pay someone to remove and rewire the new one...).

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Jul-16,Jack,"I've wanted something like this for a long time and I'm happy with the Ring doorbell.  It's not perfect, but it meets my needs and is the best option I've found for this purpose.  I have one on my front door and will likely add another to my back door as well. Setup: I originally set mine up at work, just for testing; so when I got home, I had to set it up again on my home network.  I tried just going through the add device setup again, but I couldn't get that to work.  I ended up doing a reset (hold the orange button for 30 seconds), which did work.  I also have the chime and I had to do a reset on it as well, to set it up on the new network.  Other than that, the setup was very simple and worked well.  If you have multiple Wi-Fi connections in your home, as I do, you will need to set it up at the door, where you plan to install the device, so that it connects to the router/access point with the best signal at that location. Motion: I also enabled the motion detection feature.  At first, it didn't work unless I was standing right in front of the doorbell.  There are three steps leading up to my door from the porch.  I adjusted the motion zone and range, so that it monitors the area right in front of the doorbell and out to about 20 feet (according to the app settings) and I experienced better results.  The motion detection now detects people walking up to our door, as expected, but it also detects tree limbs moving in the wind, about 70 feet from our front door and cars driving past, about 50 feet away.  I tried to fine tune the settings to reduce the false positives, but if I turn down the range any at all, it stops detecting people walking up to the door.  As it stands, the motion detection picks up people driving or walking down the road and motion in my neighbor's yard, across the street.  Luckily, I do not live on a busy road, so the false positives are completely bearable for me.  However, I could see where this could be problematic for others.  I get two to six false positives per day. Alerts: The motion and ring alerts have been almost instantaneous in my installation.  I made sure I have a solid Wi-Fi connection at the door and I usually have a good connection on my phone, Wi-Fi or LTE.  I use mine with a Microsoft Lumia 950 and a Surface Pro 3 tablet.  In addition, my wife uses it with her Android phone.  We had someone pull up on the road, in front of our house, yesterday, walk up and ring the doorbell.  I was alerted to his presence as he parked in front of the house and was able to track him all the way to do the door and watch him ring the doorbell.  My wife answered the door and I was able to hear their conversation as they spoke, probably 15 feet away from the door (he was asking directions to one of our neighbors).  In that sense, I'm very happy with the performance of this device. Quality: The video quality is acceptable.  You can definitely recognize people you know as they walk up to the door.  I wish it were better for security reasons, in case I ever need to identify some malicious person.  On the other hand, it's probably as good as any other surveillance video I've ever worked with.  I have other HD security cameras around the house though; between this one and the other systems I have in place, I can probably put together something useful for the police. My doorway is recessed about three feet from the front of the house and the porch is shaded.  The view from the camera is frequently washed out, overexposed, starting a few feet in front of the steps leading up to the porch and beyond.  Consequently, when I receive a motion alert and watch the video feed, quite often I can't really see what's going on, depends on the time of day.  However, the main purpose of my doorbell video is to monitor people walking up to the door, not to monitor the road, so this doesn't upset me too much.  It would be nice if the video was always clear though.  Sometimes it starts out overexposed and clears up a second or two into the video feed.  Video near the door has always been clear in my setup. When someone walks up or rings the bell, it takes a few seconds to get the video up and talk to the person, but that is understandable, considering the internet setup and time for the app to load.  It’s pretty quick, but does take probably five seconds or so from the moment of the alert until you can speak to the visitor.  The audio quality on the mobile device or PC is not bad.  On false alarm motion alerts, I can hear birds chirping, insects and general outdoors noise at the front of my house.  I could hear my wife speaking to a visitor on my sidewalk, several feet away from the doorbell, yesterday.  The few times I’ve used it with visitors, I could hear them speaking well enough.  However, the output to the visitor is not great.  In testing, I can hear and understand the speaker, but I have to get very close to the Ring doorbell, because the volume is very low, even with it set on its highest setting. The device itself is constructed well, feels very solid.  Installation was a breeze and everything you need to install the doorbell is provided, at least for wood installations; you may need a drill for non-wood installations.  My doorbell arrived with a little over a half charge and it took two to three hours to complete the charge, before I hung it on my door.  The LED circle, around the doorbell button, shows your charge level when it is plugged in, so you know when the device is fully charged. Summary: Overall, I’m happy with the Ring Doorbell and would recommend it to my friends.  I’ll likely buy another one at some point, for my back door.",This is a very well thought and well constructed device.

Image quality, however, disappoints.  Part of it is, I think, due to where mine is positioned  and the amount of sky that's in the image.  It has to pull back on the exposure, leaving people in silhouette on bright days.  The mounting plate is too flimsy to shim, so I'm trying to find an aftermarket mount that could turn the camera in *and* down -- but just a little bit, not the 30-50 degrees that most mounts offer.

It does exactly what I want it to do, and is a great replacement to a video camera that I had pointed through our dinning room window onto our front porch. Setting up the Ring was really easy on the app and it was connected in less than five minutes. The real challenge came with connecting the doorbell to our home. Some of this was us, some of it was on Ring. When we removed our old doorbell we found that there were three wires behind it and not two. We chatted online with Ring customer service and found out that the orange wire wrapped off was for what use to be an intercom system in our house (I guess that's what those random wires hanging out the wall in our living room were used for in the past). The customer service rep said to use the remaining blue and white wire, and that it didn't matter which of the blue and white wires went to which screws. For me personally who is afraid that anything will burn down the house, this left me a little unsettled, but I'm trusting the Ring team. After finally getting everything connected I was ready to snap the doorbell on the wall plate. This is where the drama began. For some reason I could never get the doorbell to slide all the way down over the hooks on the wall plate. It wasn’t a big gap (maybe 1-2mm) but it left me worrying that it wasn’t properly connected. After tightening the screws on the wall plate for the wiring as tight as I could and fighting with it for longer than I care to admit I gave up and tightened the screws at the bottom hoped for the best and turned the power back to the doorbell on. It worked! Now that it is connected I am really happy with it. The daytime picture is great and so far I’m adjusting to the night vision. I’m no expert on how night vision works, but the night vision on this camera is a little darker than on the camera that is currently pointing out on our front porch. I personally think it’s because there is light reflecting off the white posts on our porch from the “ring” on the doorbell but I can’t say for sure. The pinhole camera view is also something to get use to, but all in all I am really happy. One final thing to note is that installing this to siding was really hard for me personally I am not 100% sure this product considered that in the process, and I’m going to have to keep an eye on how sturdy it holds to the house.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Dec-17,Ron in Montana,"We were excited to add the Ring Video door bell to our home security system. It is about the easiest way to bring yet another level of safety at a very reasonable cost. The installation was a snap, the directions easy to follow. Our system is hard wired, without the need for the Ring Chime. That being said, our router and modem are at one of the house, the doors at the other. We had to purchase a signal extender to get the video to work. Setting that up was no chore, but getting it all to sync together took a little time. The signal extender was not the issue. It was the time it took the Ring to connect with it. I had to reboot everything, disconnect the door button, and start over several times. The signal strength was well over 5.68, uploads and download times are well above the recommendations, but the actual time it took the door bell to connect was pretty slow.  It is sensitive to movement, and adjusting that also took some time. It was registering every car that passed by, even when set at 10'-15'. (front door is 49 feet from street). It even registers the swing of our rain chains! Once we got it all synced in, and adjusted for proper angle (recommend wedges) for vertical face alignment), it works very well, even after dark.  I would have liked to know about the wedges, and signal extender, plus the sync time. But with everything electronic these days, there's a learning curve. Overall, this is a great setup!

I bought this to make sure that no Amazon packages get misplaced. My review for this Ring doorbell would get 5 stars except there are a few thing that Ring’s competitors do better namely: No ability to record 24/7, make timelapses, or recognize faces (all things that Nest cams can do). Also the PoE Elite version is $500 which is a double the Pro cost. I would think that costs more to include a battery than add a PoE NIC in the cams, not sure how they justify the 2x cost. All things considered though for a $100 video doorbell and $3/mo to keep it running its a heck of a deal and I would (and currently) recommending the camera to everyone!

Keep up the great work Ring, looking forward to future product improvements!",Excellent Produce - Just A Few Shortcomings
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Nov-15,SFort,"Installation was very easy.  I originally installed this using the wiring from my old doorbell so that I wouldn't have to recharge it, but found the original doorbell was placed too low (around 39"" above the ground).  While the camera has good 180 degree lens, the low height didn't provide for the best image of faces (I had an excellent view of stomachs, however).  Because the Ring supposedly only requires recharging once a year, I elected to move it up and run it from battery, capping off the old wiring, which unfortunately couldn't be easily rerouted.  I'd suggest a height of around 60"" above the ground for the best capture of faces. On some review videos I watched for this product before buying, a little orange tool kit was provided.  That must have been an earlier version.  My package arrived with the tools inset into the formed plastic packaging - there was no bag.  Probably a cost savings maneuver.  I imagine even the tools will be downsized or omitted in the future (in all fairness, most of us already have drill bits).  The images are not as good as what is shown in promos but they are not bad, and the sound is good.  Quality of the product seems good, overall. The motion sensor feature is a huge bonus.  It essentially turns the doorbell into a miniature, limited security system.  True, a thief might not go to the front door before breaking in, but in those instances in which he or she did, perhaps to see if anyone's home, a video of the individual will be stored remotely and can later be accessed.  I've ordered the Chime, which I've read can be set up to send  doorbell sound throughout the house if the motion sensor is activated.  That would be another plus. I'm not giving this product five stars because there is no support for OSX (i.e., Mac users).  As someone who has yet to have his thumbs surgically attached to a phone, and who works from a Mac, this is a major inconvenience.  If the doorbell rings I have to find my phone or my iPad, which often is not within easy reach.  By the time I find one of them and get past the security screen and open the Ring app and click on the event the visitor will probably walked away.  I might as well have just gone to the door to open it.  According to the literature, there is Ring software for Windows 10, so it appears only Mac users have been snubbed in this regard.  If Mac support ever becomes available I'll bring this review rating up to 5 stars, assuming no issues present themselves before then. Overall a great product, and even better if you're not a Mac user. UPDATE after a week of use:  A few issues encountered.  First, the plate that attaches to the wall, and which the main unit mounts to, is too thin.  I have typical wood siding (horizontal planks) and it's not a perfectly flat service.  Consequently, the plate deformed slightly when screwed to the surface.  Not much, but a little, and that's all that's required for the unit not to fasten properly to the plate.  The tiny hooks on the plate fit into slots on the unit, and if the plate isn't perfectly flat, the hooks won't fasten.  I literally spend two days trying to figure this out.  It was more difficult that it might sound because I had to run my old doorbell's wire up the wall to a suitable height for video, and that wire necessarily has to go behind the plate to attach to the unit from the back.  After multiple failures I settled on a piece of plywood routed on the bottom to facilitate the wire.  The hooks on the plate still wouldn't seat properly, though.  If the tiny (tiny!) plastic hooks must go into the tiny holes on the unit to lock it in place, the plate really should be more rigid than it is.  I finally got it to work by taking a screwdriver and gently expanding the hooks, praying the entire time I didn't break one off.  I didn't, and FINALLY got the unit to seat on the plate.  Now I'm praying I never have to remove the thing again. Also, the battery doesn't last nearly as long as stated.  Prior to me hooking the unit up to trickle charge from my old doorbell wire, I ran it from the battery and it dropped from 100% to 85% in three days in 40 degree weather.  I reduced the range for the motion sensor but it continued to drop, reaching 70% only a day later. There's no way it would have lasted a year on battery.  Trickle charged, though, it has maintained 100% today, so I hope that problem is solved. As others have noted, this thing is great at capturing people's backsides.  I've got three videos of the mailman walking away from my porch.  None of him approaching, and this is with a wifi booster only ten feet inside the door.  I bought some wireless Chimes and there's about 5 seconds between the ""real"" doorbell chime (recall that I connected this unit to my original doorbell wiring, so it does activate my old chime) and the wireless chimes.  The trade-off here is that the wireless chimes can be activated by motion, while my wired chime is only activated when someone pushes the doorbell button.  Still, as I said in my initial review, that latency added to the time it takes to find a phone/ipad, unlock it, and load the Ring app makes the thing less than ideal.  A visitor should expect to wait 15-30 seconds after ringing the doorbell before anyone inside can respond. Oddly, some motions, like a car passing by, will trigger the motion detector, while others, like me walking up to the door and going inside, won't.  I can't explain this but it makes the unit a little less helpful as a security tool. I don't regret buying this unit but I think it will be a few years before Ring (or a competitor) really gets this right.  The reliance on the Cloud is probably the biggest drawback.  A signal from a doorbell shouldn't have to bounce around the world a few times before hitting your phone.  I don't mind the Cloud recording, but don't see why notification of visitors can't be a direct (local) signal from the unit, through your router, to your phone.",Good product if installed at right height.

Just make sure your notifications are on and you can access your videos right away and if you want to pay $3 dollars to save your videos I would do that too. I highly recommend this Ring Doorbell product.",Great Doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,27-May-18,AnOldMan,"Pro: seems to work ok. Con: 1) like a dating app, sign up free then get teased/sold on “advanced features” 2) “ring” time is too short 3) the app interface is confusing You have to enable “live view” call the device from the app. When the device calls the app and you answer you can see/hear but the visitor CANNOT HEAR YOU until you press the green button.  Seems counter-intuitive since you are already in the “call”, but makes sense from a security perspective since you might not want them to hear you.  Also the call seems to start in non-speakerphone mode, which makes no sense since if you have to hold your phone to your ear to hear, you can’t see... Alexa often cannot find/connect to device.",Falls short of expectations
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Dec-16,Tony C.,"Hello everyone in the Ring universe! I want to share my thoughts and opinions regarding my newly purchased Ring video doorbell and Ring Chime. 1)- make sure you evaluate the location of your new ring video doorbell because it has a very exaggerated FISH EYE LENS which gives you a circular view and magnifies everything close to the outer edges of the unit. Set it up first and play with the position, you might get better results. 2)- My front door is elevated  having to walk up 8 steps. This gives my Ring unit a higher view therefore picking up vehicular traffic before you pick up someone approaching your door. This gives me too many false alarms causing me to shrink the zones to practically 0 only to get an alert when someone is already on top of your door. Hopefully the Ring team will soon figure out this common scenario. Unless you are Hardwired to your Ring unit, you need to charge it to full capacity. The reason I mention this is because the more your Ring unit works picking up all these false readings, the faster the battery runs down, especially if you live in a colder climate. 3)- I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Ring Chime unit for inside your home especially if you have a multi level home. You can choose your ring tones and motion tones. This is a great addition to the Ring Video Doorbell in my opinion. 4)- Beacase I am on a fixed income with a limited budget, I would of purchased the companion wireless video camera to provide additional angles and views of my home. 5)- All in all, I just wanted to thank the people at Ring for making these products which gives me a new level of comfort and protection knowing who's at my front door. PS: Get on for your back door if you have one. You won't be disappointed!!",you might get better results. 2)- My front door is elevated having ...

Once that was done it was a breeze but Of course you have to charge the battery up first (overnight)then brgin to install. The funny part after I installed it and set the motion I was setting it off everytime I walked by doing something on the porch. Today was the first time I really got to see it from another state from which I installed it . Worked great not sure if my internet speed is enough because when  I started talking with the repair man it worked fine then got blurry etc. My problem was that I did not have a exsisting hard wired doorbell so I thought I would just buy a transformer and run wires to it to keep it charged 24/7 ,good thing I called Ring help support first they told me that I would have to have a bridged resistor and I could buy it at Home Depot . I went 45 minutes out of my way and HD said they didn't carry it that I would need to go to a Radio Shack which 95%  of them are closed down. So I can just buy it from Ring and install it that way",Great picture and wide angle motion pick up

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Oct-16,M. Driscoll,"I have both a Ring Doorbell and a Ring Doorbell Pro, and I enjoy both of them very much now that they are installed and operational.  I first ordered a certified refurbished standard Ring doorbell thinking no big deal, things get refurbished all of the time and I can save a few bucks.  After a whole lot of frustration during setup with the refurbished model, I returned the refurb and paid extra dollars for a new in box product.  Whatever was wrong with the refurb was clearly a hardware issue; my replacement product installed in a matter of minutes and was working decently.  Depending on product placement and construction of your house, you may need to consider a Wi-Fi extender.  I was making due without an extender, but I'd find myself experiencing network latency issues that caused choppy video playback and broken sound.  Because I strive for a smart home that truly works as advertised, I added the Netgear EX2700 that Ring recommends in their support bulletin.  The way I see it, if I'm going to drop $200 on a doorbell, I may as well drop another $30 to get my network up to speed so that it can support said doorbell. [...] There are some very distinct differences between the standard model and the Pro version that are important to consider when purchasing your Ring. HD Camera - Pro will give you 1080p; standard renders 720p. Battery - Pro uses a power pack that requires additional installation; standard uses a built-in battery.  Both can make use of existing wiring. Live View - With both the Pro and the standard models, you can view your camera feed on-demand by pressing the Live View button in your app!  This is a great feature that they have added, but it only exists when your setup is hard-wired to a power source.  Without, the continuous power supply, the setup defaults to preserving the battery life of your doorbell so that it will maximize your security benefits. Audible Alert - Pro requires that you purchase Chime ($30) for a doorbell to still ring within your home. Standard will continue to ring your doorbell's buzzer/chime/ding-dong-sound-maker without installing any additional hardware. Personally, if I didn't care about having the higher resolution camera on the front of my house (to catch license plates of vehicles driving by) I would have opted for the standard model at both the front and the back entrances of my house.  The hardware setup of the standard model is overall an easier process and the battery is built-in, so there's not much need to mess around with wires. I have to give praise to their support department.  I've worked in the technology field for over 15 years and I needed to contact them for assistance in setting up my Pro.  Due to my experience in the field, it turned out that my network password was slightly stronger than the product is designed for during the setup process.  Their support was easy to reach and friendly, and their first level support had immediate access to second level support.  That last part is a big deal to me because it means that you will not be bounced around from person to person or team to team over the course of days while waiting for your problem to be resolved.  They also came through with the appropriate solution in a reasonable timeframe, so I was happy with the fact that the company stands behind its product. Pros: Small footprint works with existing wiring in order to bring life (and smart-home automation through IFTTT) to a product that we never realized was capable of more.  Price point is reasonable and competitive for video doorbells.  Customer support is easily reached and proved to be beneficial when needed. Cons: In order to save any of your streaming videos online, you need to pay the annual $30 subscription fee for each device.  This is pricey when compared with Ring's competitors, and it can add up quickly.  I'd like to see them offer a discount for multiple devices, and I'd really love to see them add capabilities to redirect your videos to a network attached storage device on the local network.  While I don't envision them offering the ability for local storage, I do think they will come around to offering a multiple product discount in the future. Overall: Ring Doorbell gives you access to a business-grade security doorbell at a reasonable price for the standard home user.  Installation could be tricky at times, but the product is backed by effective customer support.  Adding this product to your existing home can help your feel like you're stepping into the future with a fun accessory, but it can also become a great addition to your home security network.",Standard and Pro are both worth your consideration; Excellent customer support; Enhance your Home Security

I'm not handy by any means, however the installation was extremely quick. We purchased this because we got notification from ADT that the Ring doorbell now integrates w/ the ADT Pulse home automation / camera system. I purchased the device because of this, and this only. I'm super impressed. Not only can I communicate w/ the folks who ring the bell, but I can also lock, unlock my front door, turn on the lights and I can even arm the alarm or disarm it. The reason why we purchased this is because we get a lot of deliveries. Maybe 2-3 a day. We lose some because we work. Now, I can communicate w/ the delivery person, open the door, have him or her drop the boxes in the foyer, and lock the door behind this person. Besides that, there is a host of other ways for us to use this. Totally cool, and really simple to setup. The setup process took me about 20 minutes. That means that anyone who is somewhat handy can do it in around the same time frame. The box has everything you need to install the device. Including drill bit, screws, and anchors. The video's explain how to install and setup on wood, concrete, etc. The developers of this product took the time and did things right. I just ordered another one for Mom.

I was so excited to purchase something that would allow me all day about motion and helped me sleep at night. I was never annoyed by the alerts, and once I stopped receiving them, I knew something was wrong... I am giving this product a 1 because it is a hassle. It was a pain trying to install the doorbell leaving the bricks on our front porch damaged. So I had to ghetto rig it. Anything to make it work. And once I found a solution, it was the best thing ever. The night vision did not work, the view was just dark at night. And once it stopped working, due to my router being “too far”, literally in the next room, it recommended me to buy ANOTHER item.

I did finally get the app to work correctly, but only after I unpaired my phones bluetooth connection to my Panasonic phone system. Not sure why a bluetooth connection between my phone and a bluetooth device interferes with the Ring app since Ring does not use bluetooth as the communication method to talk to their doorbell (they use the 802.11 wireless protocol.)  I can have the phone bluetooth paired with other bluetooth devices and not cause any problem with the Ring app, but not when it is paired with the Panasonic device. I do have a meeting scheduled with their level 2 support team to understand / resolve this issue. When the app works correctly, the product works great.  If I did not have issues with the phone app, I would have given the Ring product 5 stars. (based on installation instructions, product quality, video clarity, application feature set, etc.) Update 1/17/17 - I have had discussions with the Level 2 support team and they are working on a resolution.

I was wrong! After about a month we ended up upgrading to the Pro, anyway. The video is delayed, it’s not a great picture, and speaker is not very easily heard. We often don’t even get an alert until somebody is walking away from our door. It’s a decent product if you’re just wanting to deter possible intruders, but if you want good footage and actual security, i must recommend going with the Ring Pro.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jun-18,J B.,"This is a good idea that is not fully developed yet. The video is not reliable at all. It sometimes takes a minute or more to get a motion notification to my cell phone. I cannot get a desktop alert on my laptop 90% of the time. This got so annoying that I uninstalled the app from my laptop, and now I just use it on my cell phone only. I contacted Ring.com about the problems that I have experienced and they are sending a new doorbell to me. I must say that their customer service is very good but that is not the problem. The problem lies in the fact that the videos are first uploaded to the Ring cloud server and then downloaded back to your cell phone. This creates a lag time that is unacceptable to me. I often get a momentary error on my screen that says cloud server is unreachable. So you are at the mercy of the Ring cloud reliability. There is no way to direct connect to the camera without going through the cloud server. By the time I get an alert, if I get one at all, the person at the door is gone from camera view. The Ring support says this video lag is due to my internet speed and that may be true but since my DSL is average speed with 15mb download and 1mb upload, that means to me that this doorbell is going to be problematic for many people with DSL internet speeds. Ring support also tested my wireless signal strength at the doorbell and according to the Ring support, my signal strength is better than most.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Sep-16,Lost in L.A.,"UPDATE 5/30/2017 - Have now had our Ring doorbell for almost a year. Even on battery power it works EXACTLY as promised! We get prompt video notifications when someone is at the door, no matter where we are. In fact, the other day, we had an accidental FALSE alarm (on our ADT system) and the local police showed-up--as we had the Ring, and were away from the house, we could answer the door ring and tell them all was well. A very handy gizmo, works exactly as promised! I usually charge it once every 6 - 8 weeks. We've had a great experience with it. UPDATE 9/21/2016 - I have now used Ring Doorbell for over a week and I remain very enthusiastic about this product. I am using it with battery power (as our front door wasn't wired with a DC current doorbell) and it has been performing pretty much flawlessly! Even using a WiFi extender I get doorbell rings to my phone within seconds and a very clear picture -- and audio -- of who is at the door. Sound & picture quality is excellent. The motion alert seems to work very well, as well. One minor quibble: I do get 3-4 'false' motion alerts per day. I have the Ring set to low motion sensitivity (maybe a 10-12' foot range, but not the lowest sensitivity), maybe I'll lower it a bit more, but I'd prefer a few false alerts than to miss something when I need it. You needn't respond to every alert. They are all stored in Ring's Cloud for 30+ days (for a modest $30 annual fee + 1 free trial month), so you can review & delete them whenever you want. Overall, I'd say the Ring Doorbell exceeds my expectations -- thought it would be far more glitchy, but it's not. Main thing to stress: be sure you have a solid/robust wifi connection before purchasing, Ring very much relies on that! Works FINE with an extender, I have an older Netgear WN3000RP. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just purchased the Ring Doorbell Cam (not from Amazon as I normally do, but from my security company, ADT). I've only had it a few hours, and I know the reviews here are mixed, but so far my experience has been great. Unfortunately my main router is in the back of our house, but I have an older Netgear WiFi extender (purchased on Amazon!) in the middle of the house that works quite well. I was worried how well the Ring Doorbell would play with the WiFi extender. Well, right out of the box the Ring immediately connected -- just carefully follow the prompts (and there's a helpful accompanying set-up video) -- and it immediately found my network, connected, setup my account, etc. Flawless. The ADT guys mounted the RING on my masonry front door (using the supplied masonry bit), it's just two screws, but drilling into masonry/concrete is always a pain, so I let them do it. (ADT just sells the ring, doesn't really service it.) Anyway, the RING is maybe 25 - 30' from the wifi extender -- and outside the house, of course -- but immediately it appears to be working exactly as advertised! I am notified on my phone when someone rings the bell, no matter where I am. I have it set to limited-range motion detection (abt 10 feet). We happen to live on a very busy street, but so far I am not receiving ANY false alarms from passing cars or pedestrians. I am attaching a screen capture of our real-time daytime view. Considering it's wireless & battery-powered, it's quite good. As one popular review said, the RING is probably only as good as your WiFi signal and, I guess, your upload speed. We have a pretty fast network and, as I said, an older Netgear extender. Nothing very fancy -- but so far, RING is working a lot better than I expected, as my expectations, based on some of the mixed reviews, were quite low. When it works, it appears to work very well! One point to note: as other reviewers have pointed out, unless you are hard-wired to DC current, which our RING is not, you do not get a live-stream picture. On battery power, it's only activated via a doorbell ring or motion detection. If you happen to have a wired doorbell then it's quite easy to hardwire the RING to it, but you'll still need a good/robust wireless connection. I will update once we've used it for a while...","Brand new, but so far VERY pleased!!!"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Nov-15,Peanut,"They did a great job making this.It was really easy to set up, but I needed the Netgear wifi extender which I had a hard time setting that up all because I select the wrong encryption or what ever it was. Other wise the Netgear wifi extender would have been real easy to set up. Nice to know who was at your door and on all your phones. Things that would be nice to have: If you don't answer the door, a recording comes on asking for the persons name, reason for visit and contact number. I would pay for an upgraded app to have this feature. Option to have the video pop up instead of the message. I have my phone on my desk and while working I wouldn't need to swipe the message Option to adjust the wide angle lens. I don't need the lens to have that much veiw and it distorts the image and I think its harder to id someone I would make another unit without the door bell feature and add a small solar panel to charge the battery to use as a security camera. Would also be great if the Netgear Wifi Extender had a cover so people can place some around their property.. Also you can have a small solar panel to charge the unit. $3.00 per month per camera is reasonable for the cloud storage. I would buy a few if the price was around $100.00 each. These would be goodas security cameras because its easy to set up and I like that you can listen in or speak on differnat areas of your property. I could put one near my kids playground to watch them and talk to them if they are acting up. If you add a small touch screen you can use these as intercom units, just upgrade the speakers and be able to play music around the house or my wife can call me in the garage. The small touch screen can be used to call other units or all units. You guys can easily make this work, do it !!! You would sell thousands, but they must be very affordable","Now when I walk in the house I sound like Tinker Bell with the chimes. Works Great, Very Easy to Set Up."

After the power supply died a second time I decided I needed a wireless option. I looked at the Ring doorbell because it has good image quality and everyone I know who has one seems to like it. My first issue I ran into was setting up my motion settings, specifically distance from my door to the street. Every time I wanted to adjust this setting I had to start at the beginning, meaning there is no way for me to just go in and tweak that, I had to click through multiple screens to get to where I want. Related to this, no matter what I set this at I would get random notifications for cars passing. Not every car, just some of them. I set this to the lowest/shortest setting and still would get notified of a car passing. I eventually had to turn off motion notifications because of this. When I did get notified of motion and click the app to look it's pretty useless as the video is processing so you are looking at several seconds or minutes before you could even see what was going on. Lastly I got this for the convince of solar charging. I did not realize this is something that has to be purchased separately, no big deal, however the Ring solar charger has almost all negative reviews of not working so I am not even sure if it is worth the $50 to try. In the meantime I just take this and charge it inside every month. Update: dropping this down to 1 star which is really too many. After 2 months my doorbell stopped charging. I was sent a replacement that would not even setup and then sent a 3rd doorbell. The doorbell is working but the protection plan I paid for is not attached to it to I call to transfer that over and it can't be transferred. I have to pay for a new protection plan that restarts my 12 months and get refunded for the other one I guess. I don't understand this. I paid for a product and a service. I should not have to re-pay and hope they don't mess up my refund to get this working. I literally don't want another year of this.

The plastic mounting bracket is a negative. Unlike a metal plate, it flexes if screwed onto any piece of door frame that isn't perfectly flat, and the six tiny fingers that hold the doorbell to the mounting plate tend to snap off if stressed in any way. After a year and a half, three of the six fingers had broken, so I had to purchase another installation kit from Ring (for $20) in order to get a replacement mounting bracket. Ring doesn't sell the bracket by itself, so I now have some extra hardware for my junk drawer. When I install the new bracket I'm going to have to do some carpentry to make sure the bracket doesn't twist or bend in any way. So much for ease of installation. That said, having a video doorbell is miles ahead of having just a little button that rings the hallway chimes.

The motion sensitivty settings dont really work. We live on a busy street and it will alert you when most cars drive by, but not the ones that enter your driveway.  Tried a different mounting technique with the driveway in the main view of the camera and the samr thing happens. You have to set the sensitivity to very sensitive in order to see what enters your driveway. That means, even if you disable certain zones on the camera, it will still alert you if a garbage truck or dump.truck drives down the road.  Decrease sensitivity juat a little, and you have to walk up to the doorbell before it registers you. This also creates an issue if you are running on battety power because you have to mount it in a weird location, that youll have to charge your doorbell every few weeks otherwise you dont have any notifications.

I put smart in quotes for a reason. It's the dumbest 'smart device' I've seen so far. (Though I'm sure there's worse.) It does do what it says though, if your connection is fast enough (upload matters, people!), and shows you pretty well who's at your door. If it didn't have to go through the 'cloud' and instead used something I could maintain on my property, I'd actually be pretty happy with these things. The biggest problem is that this doorbell has the 'Apple Problem'. It has no video compression / resolution options that I can find, which is a real issue for people who live in places where DSL internet with <512Kbps upload speed is the best you can get. For that matter, the 'options' it has are fairly sparse in the first place. There's basically 'motion on or off' and then 'do you want it to ring your regular doorbell?'. I can stream 4 to 8 frames a second pretty well (at VGA resolution) over that, but when this thing tries to shove 720p video with audio over the connection, it's horrible. The company isn't exactly forward with the bandwidth requirements. They don't even put them on the box it seems. And they're dishonest about them too. If you have 1mbps upload  (like they say), you MIGHT get this to barely work. It will not work well though. You need ~3mbps upload AT LEAST to get it to smooth out.

That is like taking a picture of someone in the shade with the bright background.  All you see is a dark figure and can’t make out the persons face or features.  The camera needs to incorporate spot metering so the light is adjusted not to the background but the target.  Also it doesn’t appear that the motion zones work very well as I have mine set for almost zero feet and yet a car goes by on the street and triggers an alarm.  It is a cool idea and concept, but needs to be in an open porch to work as it is supposed to.",Needs Spot Metering

Ring is WAY, WAY BETTER! Camera is a significant, HUGE improvement over Skybell. Ring is more responsive; phone app is fast and easy to use. We can tell from the sound when the doorbell camera indicates only action on the street, such as the garbage collection truck, or when someone is actually at the door. That sensitivity can be easily adjusted to avoid picking up street motion. Skybell worked intermittently; hated the frequently garbled and unintelligible audio results. Motion detector with Ring is SUPERIOR, as is the speaker interface. With Skybell, people would walk away from the door before I could get the app to connect. Ring app connection is much faster. It is amazing to be five states away and be able to answer your door! People never know you are not actually home and you can give permission to leave packages at a neighbor's. Only downside to Ring is that I have to ensure I keep my fig ivy trimmed away from the camera to avoid setting off the motion detector.",This is the video doorbell to buy!!

We moved into a new house about a year ago, and have spent most of our time upstairs rather than downstairs. Because there is no doorbell on the upper level of the house, it was a real challenge to hear and respond to visitors at the front door. With the Ring Doorbell at the front door and a couple of accessory Chimes setup on the upper level of our house, we'll no longer have to keep looking out the window for a delivery that requires a signature, or miss an unexpected visitor to our door. To be fair, I've done everything except actually install the doorbell outside, but the videos make it look really easy to do. My husband will be the one to actually install the doorbell, but I actually think I could do it myself if push came to shove. And lest I forget - Ring support is fantastic! I was looking at their FAQs online as I was setting up the doorbell and the two chimes on our wifi network, and a chat support person came on and asked me if I needed anything. I actually  didn't, but I was still able to let them know that I was successful in getting the system connected to our wifi. I literally couldn't be happier with this purchase.",A True Godsend!

Thanks Obama. Anyway... the doorbell installation went pretty smooth. You might want to charge it right when you get it out of the box so it doesn't die on you when you are running the installation. I had trouble connecting to my 5G network (probably because of range issues) but it works great with my standard wifi setup. Probably positioned 30ft from my router on the other side of my front door. The picture quality is great on the recorded events... on the live view not so much though. That's to be expected though with compression for live viewing speed. The only two problems I have are that the recording lags about 3-4 seconds after a motion is detected... so when a criminal comes to my door looking for stuff it might not even capture their face. And depending on how stealthy and quick they are. Also they don't have an option to do live viewing whenever you want yet... supposedly this is going to be added to the software this month but we will see. Other than that I'd say this is a great product.,the doorbell installation went pretty smooth. You might want to charge it right ...

For this doorbell, the two noticeable complaints were either the range was short or too long. It wouldn't sense individuals until after they were leaving (short range) or activate every time a car drove by (too long). My Ring Doorbell sensor was set to short range so I usually pick up motion as people are walking away. This is with all areas set to sense motion. If Ring mounted their doorbell on an angled mount, this problem would get corrected because you could self adjust how far the sensor would sense motion.",Not perfect but workable

This last update to the app they added a ""Live View"" button so now even when there isn't anyone ringing my doorbell or motion I can still see what is going on. Although the price is a bit high it truly is worth every penny. The warranty Ring provides by replacing it if it is stolen is worth the extra money in my book. I called their customer support to ask about future updates to the app and they were very helpful. So good customer support. The camera was supper easy to connect to my wifi system (push one button on the back of the Ring). The resolution of the camera both during the day and night is supper clear. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because there is still a few things ""I"" want in the app. First and foremost is that if you have your motion set to only five feet as I do so I do not pick up cars driving down the road, the recording will not pick up the person as they walk up to the camera. So, every time my mail man comes up and drops off the mail and I go replay the saved recording it starts right about the time he is walking away from my mail box. Ring needs to start the saved recording five seconds prior to the motion event. I feel they can do this for the Rings that are hard wired in like mine. It might drain the battery to quickly if the camera is recording all the time. Second is as of right now you can not change the Ring Tone for the motion or doorbell ring. The sounds are okay but not loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment. I am told this will be changed in a future update to the app. Then lastly this is kind of an item ""I"" would like to have and it is in the app two On/Off buttons that will override the phones setting if it is in MUTE to allow the Ring and motion sounds. At night I sleep with my phone in Mute and if there is someone walking around by my front door or ringing my doorbell late at night I want to know about it. So, besides these few features I would like to see in the app, everything else about the Ring I love. It works great, was easy to set up, is supper clear, has a cool classy look and high end sound. Once they update the app with the 5 second prerecord feature for saved recordings, then I will gladly give this product a 5 star rating!!",Love my Ring!

It's only been installed a few weeks and because the placement of our front door wiring of our doorbell (recessed and not forward facing) we had to install on the door frame and will have to occasionally charge the unit.  The motion sensitivity is very sensitive and I think we may have to turn it off. I would put this unit at the less utilized back door and order the newer model to use in the front as I have read it resolved some of the motion issues, but I have also read that it must be wired into your existing doorbell wiring which won't work for me since it's recessed and not forward facing.

This product seems very well thought out, not only in terms of design, but the entire setup experience.  It's quite easy to install and configure.  If for some reason you need any help, the online support and community support is world-class.  There are some nice touches such as the inclusion of the basic tools necessary for the physical installation.  It's really a beautiful form factor with a nice finish.  The wide-angle camera really does a nice job ensuring you can see whoever's at the door. I used this one to replace an old NuTone front door intercom/doorbell.  I had to fabricate a plate due to the large hole left in the wall, but this won't apply to very many installations.  See photo. Others have mentioned that there are some things that could be better, such as starting video recoding sooner after motion is detected.  My other camera software actually captures a few seconds BEFORE motion detection, which has been great, but maybe that uses too much battery.  I'm sure many, like me, get power from the doorbell transformer anyway, so that wouldn't be an issue.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Mar-19,Robert Bliss,"I purchased the Ring Doorbell back in June 2018. You can see by the photos that the Ring doesn't face the same direction as my door. However, the camera view catches people walking down the sidewalk. I took a screen shot to show you that the camera captures fully any human walking down the sidewalk even though the Ring doesn't face directly that way. I would like to say that I'm am fairly satisfied with Ring's tech people. At least they are friendly and do try hard to satisfy their customers. When I first set up my Ring, it would not recognize movement from a human being until they were right at the Ring. I called and their customer service rep sent me a ""corner kit"" (for free) which angled the Ring more towards the direction the front door was facing. I was actually out of town for a couple of weeks and didn't get a chance to install the kit. When I opened the kit and tried to install it I discovered that it was too small and the wrong kit was sent. So I called and they graciously sent me a correct kit. I finally got that one installed using all the wedges (three) so that I got the maximum angle but the motion detector would not detect any human until they were right at the Ring. So I called again. This time the rep decided that it was facing too high. The corner kit also came with a ""wedge kit"" which angles the Ring downward. So I took one of corner wedges off and install a downward wedge. Alas it still did not detect any human movement until they were right at the Ring. So I too off another corner wedge and put on a downward wedge. So now I have one corner wedge plus two downward wedges. Still no human detection until right at the Ring. I am frustrated that it will not detect humans once they start down my sidewalk. I have friends who have human motion detection quite a ways before they get to the Ring. I don't know why mine will not detect such motion. The Ring has detected garbage trucks in front of my house which are about 60 feet a way. The one photo with me in it shows me at a reasonable distance for the Ring to detect me but it doesn't. I'm not sure if my Ring is defected or there is some other setting I'm missing. Every time I call the rep takes me through the motion detection settings so they obviously haven't revealed anything I'm missing either. I am frustrated because this process of installing and reinstalling has taken over 6 months and I do not have the Ring operating the way I believe it should. The camera sees all but the motion detector appears to be limited so at this point I am left with a big question mark.",Somewhat disappointed

I was worried my transformer would not be able to handle the ring and a standard led but 16v transformer is doing well!  Looks Beautiful at night! I watch the motion videos at night and erase videos that are of passing vehicles usually.  Trying to get a handle on the radius for the motion detector.  I think its because my door is about 5 feet above the street level.  I liked this product so much I am considering purchasing another unit or two for other areas of my home.  The only thing i wish they would consider changing is the Cloud Storage.  If I purchase another unit for say in my garage or backyard I will need to pay $30 for per year for 1 unit and then another $30 for the 2nd or additional unit...  :(  Being that video's are erased every six months from the cloud, ring should consider a discount for customers whom purchase more than 1 Ring Doorbell! Please note video is superb and usually flicker free-  Home Wifi Verizon Fios 75/75 - Smart Phone Samsung GS5 LTE Sound is excellent on phone and perfect for me to hear person speaking.  The sound is just low enough that the stranger at the front door needs to place their face right up to the camera to hear you!  Love it!",Leaps and Bounds Above the Rest!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Sep-18,Drew,"The Ring doorbell came nicely packaged with each component in its own compartment.  I logged on the app, as instructed, and installation was fairly simple from there.  I had a previously wired doorbell, so it did require turning off the power to the area and wiring it in (this is not as intimidating as it sounds). After two weeks, the doorbell has worked exactly as described.  The only negatives I've noticed are: 1. The camera activates a few seconds later than it should, so if the person isn't standing at the door for a second, it may not capture their face. 2. Our front door directly faces the street (~40ft away), and the camera activates when large trucks go by (moving trucks, garbage trucks, etc.).  I've tried tweaking the depth detection settings (in the app), but I can't seem to find the right distance where it detects people early enough, but not large street traffic.  I don't see this as too big of an issue, but it may be annoying to some.",Works as advertised

First, the battery doesn't seem to last as long as they say it does.  I have to charge it every other week.  The other thing is even on the highest sensitivity, there's a little bit of a lag to activate the camera.  My front door is set back, also like a ""U"" and my door is at the bottom of the U and the walls extend outward.  My mailbox is on one of those doors.  By the time the camera picks up the motion and starts recording, the mail carrier has already walked up, opened the mailbox, dropped off the mail, and is walking away.  It works great for when people are at the door, but if someone walks up to the door and turns around quickly, all you're going to get is their back as they walk away.","I think the reviews and advertisements were pretty accurate, with the exception of a couple things"

Motion detection is useless. It alerts you every 2 minutes for something as small as a shadow or tree leaf moving, and if you adjust the settings, it will not detect motion at all. I have turned off alerts to preserve my sanity,  but I leave the motion detection sensitivity set high so that it will actually record something, and this recording costs $30 per year. You can set detection zones, but this does not actually do anything. Of course, if a shadow tells the camera to record a 12 second clip, then it times out for 2 minutes, during which a theft could occur. I regret this purchase.",Useless for security

Have had the doorbell camera for a few years. Motion sensor ability and accuracy have declined as app and operating system has been updated. Plus we purchased two ring cameras, one for the front of the house, and one for the back of the house, and it’s the same. If you want to sit and watch live 24/7 it works great. But if you’re dependent on the motion sensors, they do not pick up anything until the person is leaving or they don’t pick it up at all. The cameras pick up a wide area but the motion sensors do not. Even though we have the motion sensors all set to “maximum” it’s still misses important areas. I would not recommend. We also purchased ring solar batteries for the front and back cameras. Had issues. So we returned and got off brand solar batteries that work better.",Would not but again.

I activated the motion detection feature which alerts me to deliveries that are left on the porch. Overall setup was a breeze once I figured out to charge the device in a wall outlet before trying to set it up. I first tried to charge it using my computer and that was a slow go....so use a wall outlet. The enclosed paper instructions were worthless! Go online and view the setup video before you begin.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Sep-15,Nicholas Parker,"**UPDATE 6/2016 ** It's still working as advertised but there's an issue. There is no way to adjust the volume and/or sound that it uses on your phone to let you know when someone rings the doorbell. On my Android phone, it blasts the doorbell sound twice. It's the same volume as my other notifications. My other notifications are short and simple (e.g. texts). This Ring notification is just obnoxiously loud - everyone​ in the room gives you dirty looks. It's so bad, I've turned off the doorbell notifications. Basically kills one of its main functions. --------------------------- First tip: If you are installing your own doorbell wires, make sure you screw them down as much as possible or the Ring won't attach to the base. My doorbell wires are thick and I guess i didn't have them tightened enough. Ring wouldn't mount. I thought I installed the whole thing incorrectly and removed it. Did some test runs and mounted it back after discovering this little quirk. One of those ""doh!"" moments. Maybe this will help someone else. Overall, the image and sound quality are very good. The fish-eye lens picks up a very wide angle that covers your entire entry way. It does produce the fish-eye effect but everything is still clear enough to comprehend what's being shown. The motion sensitivity level is adjusted using a very intuitive graphical interface on your phone. Big plus. Setting it right will eliminate false alerts. However, I am not getting consistent motion sensing at night. It does still perform its primary duty of handling visitors who press the doorbell 24 hours/day. I'm not a fan of the sound it makes outside at the door bell. It's kind of loud and does it multiple times. This could be annoying to neighbors. I would like to be able to configure it - maybe ring one time outside the house. For me, the old, inside doorbell only dings once which is easy to miss so I am going to get the Ring chime box to add more of a substantial ring. It does ring all the phone connected to it though. I read about delays with Android phones. I was concerned. There does seem to be a delay but not nearly as upsetting as some might have you believe. From a phone in standby, I think it takes about 5-10 seconds before you are up and running with the video and audio. It's acceptable to me. Any longer may become an issue. IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Apparently it is having problems with the LG G3 phone. It causes the Ring to echo everything they say back to them. It is something to do with the mic and speaker on the LG G3. I've reported it to Ring. Cost.... Yes, there is a $30/year subscription if you want cloud recording. This is where it keeps recordings of the events it catches. If you don't have this, it will just function as a video doorbell with all of the phone features - it just won't record the activity. You get a free trial of the cloud recording with the device when you buy it. For me, I think it's important and I'll be signing up. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCELLENT. You may think this is a bit expensive but you're also getting fantastic customer support. I had to use it a couple times with questions (by phone and email). One last comment ... I was a little worried that visitors would know what to do when they saw the Ring. The button will light up when you approach it beckoning the person to press it. Seems that most people get it.",Great doorbell! Make sure you screw those contact screws down! - LOUD ON PHONE
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Jun-18,patrick ciampi,"It could be so much better. First of all.. the fact that it doesn't save videos for free is insanity. I didn't read into it before I bought one each for my mother and for my brother. I use Canary in my home and it saves the last 10 videos or 3 days worth or whatever. Storage space is essentially free so for them to completely shut you out of the MAIN FUNCTION of the device is ridiculous. If you are at a movie and turn your phone off, you will not know if/who came to your door. This is just an idiot cash grab by them and one that will surely either change, or be the reason they sell the company or go out of business. The doorbell offers nothing without saving videos for you. The bell unit itself should be free if this is how they plan to run the company. But at 100-200$ they MUST offer some small storage option included with the unit. Moreover, the thing is finicky. The motion detection area is super hard to focus. Look to canary or any other of their competitors for comparison. Don't buy it. Just put a canary in a window near your front door and you will do much better. I am in no way affiliated with either company. I just own canary in my apartment, and bought two of these as gifts for people with houses.",Do not buy until they start including video playback with your purchase.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Jun-16,YE72,"For the most part, this device works but it has some issues. The basic doorbell ring works but the battery life was less than three months. You have to remove the unit and charge for 10 hours on a computer or about half that with a 2.1 amp charger.  There was no notification of low battery as advertised. If you are replacing a wired doorbell, there is no need to run on battery.  It does have a pretty clear picture and the ability to communicate is effective.  We were not home when a package came requiring a signature.  The ring came through on my phone and I was able to talk to the driver and give him approval to leave the package without a signature. The motion detection is not consistent.  It works well after you get the field of coverage dialed in.  Initially, it will trip the alerts too frequently. The problem is that if fails on some occasions when you know there was motion and there is no alert and no video recording.  As a security camera, you need it to work all the time.  The issue that soured me was the data usage on our smart phones.  In our case, we got data usage alerts from our wireless provider.  It turned out to be the Ring app that is on two phones in our household. Specifically, it is the motion detection that is a high data usage function.  I asked Ring support if we could have the bell ring on both phones and only have one phone receive the motion alerts., They told us that could not be done.  On the positive side, the support team has been very responsive to emails. The other drawback is that it does not have on demand video viewing.  You only get video notices and recordings when there is a ring or motion detection.  They have introduced a new model that has on demand which is disappointing to those that bought this version.  I would expect that the data usage and battery issue may be the same in the new model but you may want to contact Ring support before buying. Overall, the doorbell works well.  You just have to be sure that the battery is working and the unit has not been disconnected from the wifi (this happened only once and was associated with the loss of battery power).  If the unit does become disconnected, you have to uninstall the device and then reinstall.  You don't have to remove the phone to do this and it is easy to do.  You will know there is an issue if you stop receiving alerts. It was clear to us that the unit was not working on the first day as we had alerts in the morning and then nothing after that.  The motion detection needs work but when it works it is helpful. If you have an unlimited data plan on your phone, the data usage will nor be an issue.  I would not depend on this for a security camera.  Its field of coverage is limited to the door and surrounding area and it does fail to alert/record in some instances.  Even though it detects motion most of the time, it needs to work all the time. Bottom line, I would buy this again as I had no doorbell.  There are cheaper wireless doorbells that just ring to a receiving unit in the house, but the ability to see and communicate with this unit makes in worthwhile. I would have given 4 stars if the data usage was not an issue. I don't know that I would spend an extra $50 to get on demand viewing given the limited field of vision.  I think you are better off with wireless security cameras if security is your primary concern.  I am trying out the Arlo system and so far I am pleased with it.",Needs some development but basic functionality is good
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Mar-19,Nico Janssen,"**Update** Reduced to one star. I will emphasize that it is not good for security. Today I had a package stolen that was placed directly in front of the camera, and it did not pick up anything. Now I am out $40 and don't have anything to provide the police. I will be replacing this camera and my entire ring alarm setup with something that actually works. If you want a camera that is able to deter home intrusion and porch thieves than get something besides this doorbell. This product is simply an expensive doorbell that can ping your phone if someone is at your door. ** Has its pros and cons. Major con is the speed at which motion detection starts recording. It is not fast enough to catch our mail person coming. We have a walk way and steps that lead up to the camera. The camera does not begin recording until she is done delivering and getting back in her car. Seems pretty useless if it takes over a minute to begin recording. Other con is the night vision quality. You have to be a few feet away to be recognizable. It's also really annoying that you have to buy the chime separately. Pros are that the app is great, the battery life lasts longer than I expected, and the angle is very wide so it capture my entire front porch. The camera itself looks nice in venetuan bronze. Overall it's not worth it to me because it doesn't record in a decent enough time. Someone could run up and cover the camera before anything is recorded. It makes a good video doorbell, but not for security. Not good for security, but good enough for a simple video doorbell. Probably better video doorbells for the price.",Could not catch porch thief.

I installed Ring there and it works great. While sitting in my office here in SoCal, I startled a repairman who was taking a ladder into our house to do some work.

I didn't realize that the microphone turned on during motion alerts. Well, he heard me and couldn't figure out where the voice was coming from. He set the ladder down and looked around and even pulled his cell phone out to see if someone was calling. Then, I realized he was hearing my voice. Too funny.

It was exactly what I was looking for and mett my specific needs. I really like it.  I did read a few of the other reviews and did not understand why one of the reviewer was having the issues they were having.  I have had my Ring for almost a year now well eight months plus. I have not had one problem with mine.  It was VERY easy to install (mine is not installed by wire but just mounted) the installation video was very easy to understand. It also connected to my WIFI  effortlessly.  I have this mounted just outside my front door and have an Apple WIFI extender plugged in just inside the front door. I have had this extender here long before the Ring product.  And it all works well. Mine videos any motion as soon as it is triggered.  I get the person walking up to the door way before they actually get to the door.  I have my sensor setting at the max 30' and have all zones open.  The one comment I might make is I did not realize when I purchased this product that after the free 30 day trail of the Cloud video that you had to have a contract with Cloud to keep the video ability of this product otherwise, it's simply a door bell. Recently, I had a few issues with the Ring but after help from the Ring help team we figured out that my internet service provider was making changes to their systems which temporarily disabled the Ring completely.  It is working fine now.  BTW, the Ring team were very helpful and very pleasant to deal with.  I did see something that Ring now provide different ring tones but I can't seem to find that.  I did follow the instruction on how to acquire the new tones from the app but they did not appear.  Maybe someone with Ring can help me with that.

Saying that, I now cannot return this product because I was supposed to return it prior to May 3rd.  I will try to call Amazon but I have my doubts.  Be wary about this product.

I registered a new account with Ring and loaded the app. Device was easy to setup and connected to Wifi without difficulty.  Wish I would have read the reviews more carefully. I learned the hard way you CANNOT view recorded video until you subscribe to a Monthly Monitoring Plan!  You can only ""view live video""  which is so slow to load that it is useless.  It it takes 3 to 5 seconds just to connect to the Ring servers to get a response. Then you can see there was an event detected on the list but you cannot see what it was.  Forget about using it as a live camera,  it is worthless.  I did not buy this to have another monthly subscription.  Do not buy unless you need another monthly charge on your credit card!

Saulnier,"This is a newer product that will get better with updates and new versions. They have been thoughtful about theft protection, sensitivity adjustments, quality and style. It looks great and operates quite well. Because the doorbell interacts with your WiFi and home Internet connection, it is at the mercy of their speed and reliability. It is also at the mercy of your phone's speed and Internet connectability where ever you receive an alert. I have decent home speed and a Samsung Galaxy s4 through Verizon with good results. An impatient visitor may leave before I get a chance to reply but this usually only happens with delivery people. The quality of the doorbell is great. The quality of the video is also great. It's a fisheyefisheye type lens for maximum coverage so it is warped but it is easy to see people's faces and understand what's going on. There are absolutely improvements that can be made, but the product is very usable as it is. I expect great things and innovative products from this company in the future. Also, video clips can be downloaded from the cloud and saved to your phone for future use such as catching a crime or verifying when someone came or left your home. For what it is, it's very affordable and very easy to set up. In fact,  I was a little disappointed how easy it was to set up. I like a bit of technical challenge with new products. This one was very easy. In fact,  it's been functioning flawlessly since I installed it over a month ago. I use it to keep from interacting with solicitors, religious folks, and political folks. It's also nice to know when a package arrived. This complete system costs about as much as a quality camera with no software. If you're reading this review, you're interested in this technology. Just buy it. It's only $200. You'll be happy you did.",Just buy it!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Mar-16,GodReigns,"Although the door bell does give you the ability to speak with whomever rings the bell, there is, what I would consider, a major flaw in the product that significantly reduces its value. It has a motion sensor, which all the advertisements touts as a major benefit. The only problem with this technology is it is extremely slow. For example:  I have Verizon fios internet in my house. I have the highest level router that Verizon offers, the router is 18 feet from my video doorbell. The connection time from the time that the camera picks up motion until it is transferred to my cell phone through my router is so long that I very rarely see anything on the screen when I respond to the notice. Additionally, the camera does not log a video segment resulting from the motion detected in sufficient time to capture the reason for the activation. For instance, my mail person walks across the front of my house and comes to my mail box which is right next to my front door. By the time the motion sensor notifies me that motion has been detected the mail person is long gone. If this had been someone actually stealing something from my mailbox the video doorbell would have been absolutely worthless. Furthermore, if you do not have your cell phone with you at all times when you are inside your house you will not know if someone is ringing your bell. Ring should provide at least one Chime plug-in with the purchase of this camera. Based on the price that you have to pay for this product that is the least you would expect. Additionally, the alert that comes through your cell phone is such that it is very easy to miss the notification especially if you are in a place where there is a lot of background noise.  They say they are working on updating their software to provide more alarm tones but they told me they have no idea when they might be released. Soooo, who knows what that means.","Buyer beware, Good but still needs lots of improvements to be really great."

Installation is easy. I have a brick home and used my hammer drill to make the necessary holes to mount it. The drill bit is included in the packaging. It worked ok. Since my wireless router is pretty much on the other side of the wall from where the Ring is mounted, I haven't had any connection issues. After a week or so, I started experiencing issues with my Ring. I would get motion and ring notifications, but no video. After going through all the possible troubleshooting methods, such as resetting the device and re-adding, I ended up contacting customer service. They were GREAT! After explaining the problem, they didn't give me any run around, they quickly shipped out a replacement and had me send back the defective device. After that, it has been working great. There are a few issues I have with it, that I will explain below. The zones and range settings on this need some work. On a daily basis I get false motion notifications for cars passing in front of my home, about 30--40 feet away. No matter how I tweak, I still get them. Ring is coming out with a new updated Pro version that has changed the way you set zones which will more than likely remedy this issue, but, I would like to see improvements on the existing devices. Video is good. Clear picture during the day, and the night vision is good too. My Ring is running on battery, which, despite the false notifications, seems to have a good lifespan. I haven't had to take it off to charge yet. But then again, it's only been a couple of months. I have a Wink hub at home with quite a number of devices hooked up to it, including Ring. I made a ""robot"" that turns on my porch light, that is connected to a Lutron Caseta Wireless dimmer, when Ring senses motion or someone rings the bell. Works great. Overall, I am very happy with Ring, it looks cool and works well. I always recommend it to friends and family.

It will register cars driving up and down the street which is about 50 feet away, even if I have the distance set to only 5 feet. Garbage day is horrendously annoying!!! On top of all of that, the notification delay experienced when people actually do approach your door, such as the UPS or FedEx drivers, and when someone actually rings your doorbell, is unacceptable.

I bought the first version just to record our front screened in porch area, as the area is not as large. I have noticed a slight delay with when it detects motion compared to the second generation, but think that might be due to the fact that this model does not come automatically with mounts to be able to point the camera down or to the side like the 2nd generation does.  Since the Area is much smaller, I’d say this is perfect for what we need in this small enclosed area. The video is clear both at night and during day time, and 2-way voice talk over the camera works surprisingly well! I’m glad I didn’t drop the extra $100 in this case, but would suggest if you have a larger, more open area get the newer model.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Mar-16,Speedy,"I purchased and installed this item from an elderly family member. While it's a great device, there are a couple of issues that are very annoying. The good: - Nice quality video and very wide angle lens. - Great to monitor activity near your door and deter unwanted guests. - Relatively small design with good aesthetics. The bad: - Motion sensor gives off many false alarms. During sunrise the motion sensor goes off several times in the morning. The sun is in sight of the camera and it appears that the sun is setting off the alarm as there is no motion during those alarms. The motion sensor works by measuring thermal change. There is an option to block off zones for the motion sensor and adjust sensitivity. I have blocked off the region on the edge that the sun crosses during sunrise, and I have played with the various sensitivity settings. None have stopped the morning false alarms. - The mounting plate is flimsy plastic. This is not a problem if you are mounting the plate on a smooth surface such as brick or wood. However, on an uneven surface, such as common stucco, the plate will deform when you screw it to the wall and make it difficult or impossible to mount. A metal plate would be much better. I had to smooth out the uneven spots if the stucco to get is smooth enough for the mounting plate to work. - The security wrench is low quality. Do not tighten more than barely snug the two screws that hold the unit to the base plate, or you will strip the tool. - Finally, THE SOUND CANNOT BE ADJUSTED! This really bothers me. EVERYTIME there is motion a loud wind-chime sound is played from your phone. I called tech support to ask how to change the default wind-chime sound to something not as loud and more discreet. I was told the sound cannot be changed and the only option is to leave your phone on silent / vibrate mode. I want to know when people approach the house so that was not a viable option for me. The wind-chime sound is LOUD and gets obnoxious very quickly if using the motion detection option. Deducted 1 star for the remarkable lack of ability to change the motion sensor sound or door bell sound to less obnoxious sounds. Deducted 1 star for motion sensor false alarms. It is a great device and I would buy it again. However I am not happy with it due to the sound and motion sensor issues.

First, it's easy to install for someone who is not up on the latest technology - I had no issue and even easy tutorial videos were helpful.  Next, upon the first button push, the thing really worked! Having said all of that, now that I have had it installed for a month, it only works for me as designed about a third of the time.  The other times are false alarms from the motion sensor picking up traffic (but there are settings that I have not been able to work that are designed to improve sensitivity functions), the other issue is you hit your button on your app and it just ""spins"" and thus missing whatever was happening anyway. Also, I was surprised to realize almost everyone knows what these things are.  Sales must be good!  The pizza guy rings the bell and puts the pizzas up to the camera so you know it's him, the postman shows he is leaving a package, etc.  This makes me think the bad guys probably know as well and all they would have to do is cover their face for the few seconds it would take to duct tape the camera lens. In all, I think the motion detector is the most valuable thing on this product for ""security"" purposes.  I don't believe the doorbell part is fooling anyone anymore. One final note about the install - I had a wireless doorbell previously and if you also do, you will have to get the ""ringer"" part of the ring that plugs into a wall as well and is not very loud at the loudest setting (nor customizable with the ring tone).  This is $29.99 at the time of this review.","It's okay but after having installed a while, I have realized the doorbell is not fooling anyone."

Side note: I have really good wifi signal and bandwidth. I tried the same things with the one I bought at home depot but it is doing the same thing. So the app at some point suggests buying the Ring Chime Pro to extend the wifi signal. So now I bought that at a local hardware store, tried setting it up, the same thing is happening, I can't even get past the setup. I tried to set up all 3 things again and nothing. 😑","Ring Customer Support Told Me To Return, DEFECTIVE"

Installation was NOT easy, despite the videos on the iPhone app. Apparently, mine came with the back plate already attached and it was confusing to find the orange button they say to press and the other things you need to see to charge it, etc. I had to call the company, who explained that for some reason mine came assembled which is apparently not standard practice normally. You will need a drill to install this and if you set the perimeters to go off at too far of an area like I did, you will get a steady stream of annoying alerts on your cell phone.

I've been putting off installing a drop cam outdoor because of the burden of pulling a power source outdoor wherever I want. Ring answered my prayers!! I have it hooked up to the regular door bell outlet so I don't have to worry about the battery either. My doorbell faces the side and not towards the entrance and initially I thought I have to mount it on the door away from the door bell to cover the entire driveway. But even when the camera is installed on the sidewall the coverage is so wide I end up using the existing doorbell outlet and still cover the entire area I wanted to monitor. And the motion detection is amazing. We have plants in the driveway and when it is windy and if they plants move the camera ignores those motion and only detects motion based on the thermal imaging. I've had zero false warning so far. I don't think there is cons at this point. Must buy if you are looking for a state-of-the-art motion detecting cam that doesn't require a hardwired power source.",detect motion and do all the great things a Drop Cam can do but does it ...
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Jun-16,Icemaster,"Big disappointment.  The concept and design are good, however the implementation is not ready for prime time yet.  After initial installation the unit performed well, however after two days and a few visitors & deliveries the unit failed to alert on any IOS or Android device.  All steps listed on the Ring support forums were tried multiple times, including full resets and reinstallations of the applications to no avail.  The device was given a static IP, access point reset and device was moved next to the AP, after a couple more attempts at a hard reset the unit began to work again however failed again once it was moved beyond a reasonable distance from the AP.  I did try to contact their support however was routed around a few times in the IVR and didn't want to wait - already spent a few hours trying to trouble shoot.  It's possible that speaking with someone would have helped, however for a device that was purchased as a supplement to my existing equipment it's just not worth the hassle or any more of my time - for the price point this shouldn't take that much troubleshooting.  It's going back.  If the platform is so unstable that it quits after a couple days, or the wireless range is as limited as it appears to be, I'd recommend waiting for the next generation or install an expensive wireless camera as an add on to a traditional doorbell.",Overpriced for unreliable performance and stablity.

I own the Ring doorbell, Ring chime pro and the stick up cam, have had them all for about a month. Very easy installation on all three and setting up was simple.  I used 15 pound, double sided outdoor tape to mount the products to avoid drilling holes. I have had zero issues with any lag when the doorbell is pushed and having the chime pro is great. The chime pro really makes the whole setup even better because I never had a doorbell to begin with, so if my phone is on silent or do not disturb, I still can hear the doorbell. The motion settings seem a little buggy at times and I can't get the neighborhood part working right at all no matter what I do, so there are some software issues, but I haven't taken the time to contact support. Live view works great and playback on anything saved is good too. Really is a ring of security around my house. Overall great products that give security and peace of mind.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Jul-18,David Martin,"I have had this doorbell installed for just over 12 months.  The installation was quick and easy replacing a previously installed hard-wired doorbell.  Because this is hard-wired, I cannot speak to the actual length of time you could expect to get from the battery before needing to recharge. The motion sensor seems to work fairly well, but does seem to have a delay in recording.  This means that most of the time the person is already at the door before it starts recording, but only some of the times.  It is very reliable when the doorbell is pushed - it will begin recording immediately if it hasn't already detected the motion. Here is where this doorbell becomes absolutely useless.  It will only record for 20-30 seconds after detecting motion so while somebody is still standing at your door, the recording will end.  You have no idea what happens after it stops recording so if something happens you have no video evidence.  For me, this makes this an expensive novelty and not mush of a security device. I would recommend bypassing this video doorbell and researching others like the new Nest Hello.",The installation was quick and easy replacing a previously installed hard-wired doorbell

When I got home I had to completely hard reset the doorbell and remove it and then re-add it back on the app. There's a huge pain in the ass for ya. Also I found out that there is absolutely no way to store even a day or two worth of rings without their damn subscription service. If I had known this going in I wouldn't have messed with it at all. Also, the camera is poorly constructed. It'll show all the way up to the eve of your house but not the ground.

Our door has the speakeasy door grill on it and it’s not as discreet as a peephole to see who is outside nor is it easy to access unless you’re 5’3” or taller.  My kids are able to look on the TV when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell to see who it is rather than trying to look through the speakeasy little window. They just use the fire stick and say Show me front door and it pulls up the camera. When we are home we use our phones to access the video. I’m giving it 4 stars only because there is lag time when you get the alert and the app actually opening. If it’s motion, whatever it was is usually gone by the time it pulls up and you have to go back and watch the video to see what it was. But overall very pleased!!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Mar-19,Stacy Fortenbaugh,I recently purchased the Ring video doorbell. Although setup was a challenge. (It took 30 minutes to get it to connect to my WiFi) Once I got it up and working it worked great. I was impressed with the clearness of the video and the fact that it notifies you when someone approaches your door. It provides a short video of anyone that gets close to your door or anyone pulling into the driveway. One negative that I found and it was not indicated when I purchased the product is that after 30 days you have to start paying for the ability to save those videos. That should have been made clear in the ad. It does work well though and it could save your life and your packages some day.,Ring is good way to stay safe in your home
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Jun-17,Pat,"I really wanted to like this doorbell. The concept is wonderful and I really need something just like it. Over a 2-day span, I spent countless hours on the phone with tech support trying to iron out the bugs but, so far, to no avail. PROS: **It set up easily. **Tech Support is friendly, patient and is very interested in being helpful **Tech support was easy to reach and easily understood CONS: ** The motion sensor starts recording when the tree in the front yard starts to sway, when a car is driving by, when someone leaves the house but, unless they ring the doorbell, it only sporadically alerts and records when someone comes to the door. **If someone just walks onto the porch or up to the front door (which is the main reason we purchased it), it may or may not alert or record anything.  We've tested this numerous times ourselves, and with customer support, to see if we could figure out a pattern or a rhyme or reason for this, but to no avail. **It becomes somewhat like ‘the boy who cried wolf’ when some days it alerts constantly, especially when there’s the slightest breeze or during a busy time of day when cars are going and coming. **There is a short delay between the time someone is on your front porch and it actually alerts and sends the video, so the person could be gone by the time the video reaches your phone. **When it does record, according to tech support, unless you are watching a live feed there is no way to enlarge the video to see the person(s) more clearly, even when uploaded to the cloud ... and, as I said, there is a few second delay so I haven’t been able to catch a live feed, except when testing it with the tech on the phone. **Even though I have the ‘Ring’ app icon on my phone’s home page, there is no indicator to show that I’ve missed an alert (like a missed text or missed phone call). I spent at least an hour on the phone with the tech regarding this particular issue alone.  So, if I’m away from my phone or need to put it on silent etc., I have to constantly open the ring app to see if an alert occurred. This is both cumbersome, annoying and somewhat defeats the purpose of having the app on my home screen. **Have not been able to get it to do more than vibrate when an alert comes thru.  If I could get it to make a sound, I would know there was an alert even if the phone was in another room.  I’m guessing there is a way to do this and tech support alluded to it but after hours on the phone, I forgot to ask a second time. However, that still would not resolve the fact that there is no way to know there was an alert unless I open the app. **I also haven’t figured out how to talk to whomever is at the front door. **There’s only a 30-day return policy thru Amazon and I’m almost at the 30 days. I've spent 2 days on the phone with tech support, “let's try this, let's try that, let’s turn off this zone, let's bring in the view area” etc. etc. etc. Their patience and composure is amazing; however, my issues remain. So, all in all, on the rare occasion that the Ring doorbell actually picks up a person coming to the front door, it works ok.  But the cons seem to outweigh the pros for me. Maybe someone who’s had it awhile and likes it could offer some suggestions? Otherwise, I’m afraid I just wasted $200. Regarding Amazon: I know this is a product review, but I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Amazon and the service I received, as the service will influence future purchases for me and will definitely make me think twice before ordering. PROS: **Easy ordering process **Tracking provided **Speedy delivery CONS: **About a week after I purchased it, the price when down by $30, which is a considerable amount. In fact, that would almost pay for a year of cloud service. ** Rude Amazon Customer Service.  Contacted Amazon thinking, like most major retailers, they would do a price adjustment but they said no, they don’t match prices.  I explained I didn’t want to match prices with another store, I was inquiring about a price adjustment against their own prices …no, they don’t do that either. Ok, not much I can do so I let it go. **After my call, I received a customer service survey asking if I was satisfied with the response I received so I responded honestly, said I was not and explained why. Shortly thereafter I received a rude email telling me the response I originally received was correct and not to ask about it again as my email would not be answered. That surprised me as I was not asking about it again but simply responding to THEIR emailed survey. **This is the part of the email response, verbatim: “I realize this is frustrating; however we aren't able to offer any additional insight or action on this matter and any further inquiries regarding this issue won't receive a response. We appreciate your understanding.​ Best regards, Gnanasekar K. Amazon.com"" Ironically, my 2nd comment was only made in response to Amazon's customer service survey. Again, I know this is a product review, but the service received from amazon is part of my product experience and as such I was very shocked and dissatisfied with Amazon’s customer service.  In the past, they’ve provided excellent customer service.  Of late that trend has shifted. The price adjustment issue and the customer service response will most definitely affect my amazon purchases in the future. June 26, 2017 After receiving a wedge piece in order to angle the camera differently and spending another couple hours on the phone with Ring tech support (who again were extremely nice), I have decided to return the doorbell.  In theory, it is a wonderful idea.  The fact that you can hardwire it to your existing doorbell was a great option too. However, in the end, it didn't serve my purpose which was to see who was at the door or who came onto our porch, especially when we weren't home. Would love recommendations on something that might work similarly, without the need for batteries or electric wiring.  Was really happy with the fact that that the Rng wired to the doorbell, thereby not needing batteries or additional wiring and would be very interested in knowing if there is anything else like that, that is better at sensing motion made by people :)",Wanted to like it

The instructions were very easy to follow and with the video made it even easier and fast to connect to my Wi-Fi. After the installation I was just amazed at the wide angle of view and sharpness. I wish I had found the Ring Doorbell before I sprung for the cost of security cameras that I have also installed. Just the ring doorbell covers more of my front yard then the security cameras costing twice as much.  With the ring doorbell there is not one blind spot to the front of my home. What a feeling of security I now have knowing that there is no way for an intruder to go undetected.  My front door is to the East and with the sun in the morning shinning directly at the doorbell you would think there would be no way to capture anything visible, Wrong. I have noticed that there is less than a second before the doorbell will filter out the sun and you have a very clear view again. The motion detection has been well over 75ft during day light hours. Night time is not that far but then I have several street lights and a neighbor with a very bright light shining up at his at his 2nd Armor Division and American flag.  One last thing, the Audio just like everything else is just outstanding, and if you answer your doorbell you might want to turn the TV down just a tad.  Should you have a problem that you need help with or just don’t understand something, just give their customer support a call and they will take care of you.

Got one anyway and hoped for the best. So far happy with its performance.  The motion detection is almost immediate. For ringing doorbell, there is sometimes a 3-5 second delay getting alert on phone, then another 2-3 seconds to see video feed. Sometimes its almost instant. Picture is sharp and clear.  I mounted mine a little low and close to door replacing hard wire button. Was afraid would not pick up enough of the porch and see the persons face. Was pleasantly surprised  it had great coverage with the fish eye lens. You can also pinch/zoom the feed to zoom in on face. Unit is solid and looks well built.  Only gripe was the concrete drill bit with not true and would have made a raggit hole.  Had my own bit anyway. Spinning color button is cool and when hard wired, glows white for seeing it at night.

I actually believe many reviews on this amazon list are paid to make it look good, so I do have a hard time believing them. There were so many people having problems with their products. I figured, if I buy from Amazon, I have 30 days to return it or whatever. If it doesn't work, I'll send it back. My test: I received it today, opened. Directions were simple, as I saw a video online. I have a stucco home. I turned the power off, pulled the doorbell outside out, drilled holes in my stucco (I am not a house husband who likes to fix up the house). In fact, I did a terrible job at installing it because it wasn't level, plus it didn't cover the original doorbell hole good enough. (I had to go to Lowe's and get Stucco patch). Once installed, I tested it out. It worked just fine. No problems. The wife connected, the video showed, and I can talk back and forth, review the recordings straight from my phone. I have a free 30 days cloud, but once that's over, I cannot review video, as I talked to customer service via their online chat (which was much faster than waiting on the phone for 8 minutes). Now let me say, my office is the first room you enter when you open the door, so I'm pretty close to the door, maybe 15 feet away. Also, I have comcast internet around 100mb upload, 20 download, pretty fast.  I also have iPhone's 6 and my wife has a 5s (they both worked video and talking). I had my kids test it outside, and they all wanted to play on it and talk back and forth. Crazy how it works. I did have to put the settings of the motion to the most sensitive because it wasn't activating far away, but I do have an enclosed porch, so it may be hard. It works now with cars going by, and people at the front door. I hope they develop the video on demand like they said they are going to do soon (meaning I can look outside whenever I want through video and not just when motion or someone clicks the doorbell), which is what I'm waiting for. I don't like that you can't look outside anytime you want through the camera (that should be really easy to do and VERY necessary). If they don't come out soon with something, I hope to find something better that does.","I read the reviews, I tested, works, but ...."

It works better than expected. As I work from home, I wanted a way to be able to answer the door without having to physically answer the door--especially if it is a stranger. In addition to being able to speak with someone outside my door, it is kind of nice to be able to answer your door--no matter where you are--giving the illusion that you are home at any given time. This feature is great for if one goes on vacation, is out shopping, etc. In addition to the doorbell feature, we also have the motion detector activated. Since you can set the range from the front door, we have eliminated false alarms by drive-by traffic. Any time there is movement (detected by heat--so you don't get false readings from tree branches, etc.), an alert is sent to my phone. Another great feature is whether someone rings your doorbell or it detects motion, you can view video feeds that it captures if you pay for the yearly service (we got a free month trial--which we will probably renew).

I love this concept. I've had the device for two months.  There are glitches that need to be worked out.  1. The video can work well if you have a fast router.  Ring doorbell customer support worked with me on setting up the router so that it is optimized to work with the doorbell. Important lesson, the router works best the closer it is to the doorbell.  The signal weakened due to my brick exterior where the doorbell is mounted.  2. Doorbell doesn't reliably record people approaching door but catches them leaving. About 65% of the time it will record my dog walker entering but always records her leaving. 3. Can't initiate recording.  There are times I'd like to be able to initiate the recoding but it's not possible yet. The good news is the customer support is fabulous. They have replaced my device to help elevate some of the clitches I was having. Not just the device itself but also the wall plate and screws for the device. They've called me to troubleshoot and followed up to see if things were still working well. They are aware of the clitches and are working on software updates.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Feb-16,Evelyn,"We installed the Ring doorbell 2 weeks ago and overall, we like the unit.  Installation was fairly easy.  We have it hardwired onto a brick wall.  Getting the unit attached to the back plate is a little tricky so I'm glad it's hardwired and the battery won't need to be recharged since it's constantly getting power. My router is upstairs but I do have a WiFi extender downstairs that is fairly close to where the Ring is mounted.  I've done a few speed tests and I'm well above the minimum 1 mb recommended upload speed. The picture is decent.  It is pixelated sometimes but nothing too bad.  The picture (background) can be too bright at times but I think it may be due to the fact that I have the doorbell installed under a covered porch facing west.  I've talked to customer service about the brightness and they said they made an adjustment but it didn't really make a difference.  If the USPS/FedEx/UPS guy parks his truck in front of my house, you can barely see it.  All you'll see is a white background.  (I've attached a picture.)  The background does gets better in the afternoon. When the doorbell is pushed, I am notified almost immediately on my phone and since it's hardwired, I get an audible ring inside my home.  I love that I can talk to the person without having to open my front door. The problem I have is with the motion detection.  I've worked with customer service many times on this issue and have given up mainly because after trying different things (adjusting the range (# of feet it detects something), the frequency (# of times it notifies me when it detects something), and the latency (I think this is the speed that the doorbell communicates with the network), nothing helps.  The customer service guy attributes my problem to the way my porch is configured.  I have a porch railing that may be the problem but I'm still not 100% convinced that it is.  I want the Ring doorbell to start recording as someone is walking up to my porch.  However, it starts recording when the person is either already at my front door or when they've already turned around and walking away.  When I set the range all the way to the max (30 ft), I get notified when every single passing car drives by but it won't detect a human being that's maybe 5-10 feet away.  The customer service explained that it has something to do with the heat signature (cars give off more heat than humans) which I understand but I still think it should detect a human more quickly than it actually does. Another thing I think can be improved is to be able to change the motion settings without having the physically push the doorbell.  If for some reason I had to change the motion settings while away from home, I would not be able to do so because I wouldn't be physically there to push the button for the settings to save. Ring's customer service is excellent.  Because of my motion detection issues, I've called, chatted and emailed with the customer service reps and have received nothing but excellent service.  Each and every person that I've dealt with really tried to resolve my issues. I would have given it 5 stars if the motion detection worked the way I would like.  I had thought about returning it because of the problems with the motion detection but despite its shortcomings, I decided to keep it because I believe having the Ring enhances our home security.",Great customer service but product has some shortcomings

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Jul-18,Jnine,I was very excited to get this product as we have a gate that is far from the front door.  I wanted to be able to answer the door (gate) with my phone instead of running out to the gate everytime someone rings the bell.  The battery does not last too long and we do not know when it is not working until someone tells us they rang the bell and there was no sound.  When you do not have the $10.00 a month plan you only have a few minutes to answer the call.  You may have to carry your phone with you at all times.  I have had this for eight months and I have successfully answered two rings.  I think if I get the plan I will be happier with this item.  I just do not want yet another debt.,We are not happy

The doorbell portion and Ring Chime work great if you want a $200 doorbell. The motion sensor doesn't work well.  Bought a second one.  Would not charge. Returned it. Bought a 3rd set with two cameras. Charged it up and the motion sensor didn't work at all.  Called the company and they confirmed it didn't work and would send out a replacement.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Oct-19,petdav,"We needed to add a doorbell to our recently purchased home but did not have electricity run to the door for one. It seemed that the price of adding electricity would be similar to purchasing a battery-powered Ring and the added video security would not be a bad addition to our home so we ordered a Ring Video Doorbell. Installation was easy (except that they did not include one of the security screws we needed which leads me to believe that we got a box that had previously been opened) and it generally works just fine. I don't want/need a live video feed so that is turned off and we live in a quiet neighborhood so we do not have a lot of front door activity. Even though I would guess that we are on the ""low side"" of active users, the battery only seems to have a 6-8 week life span before needing a charge. The Ring website says we should expect 6-12 months of battery life but we are not even getting half of the lower figure.",Battery life shorter than advertised
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Dec-15,Win2000,"Love this wireless doorbell. It does have a few quirks that you must either accept and live with or return it and go back to a regular doorbell. First, I like that motion in addition to someone actually ringing my doorbell will alert me. It's great for when UPS leaves a package at my door (no more guessing during the day if I received a delivery). I chose to hardwire it (very simple as wires from old doorbell were already there). A couple of nice things about hardwiring it are: First, it's on a small trickle sort of charger so it will not go up in percentage greatly but it doesn't go down that much either. Second, which I HAVEN'T seen mentioned anywhere else in any review or on RING website is that when hardwired like we did, the LED bring light which people push to ring the doorbell stays lit up a nice cool white color all the time (looks really great at night and makes it easy for people to see where to push in the dark). It't the same ring light that lights up and circles blue upon pressing the button but white all the time is nice. In addition to having our mechanical bell ring from this new video doorbell, we also added the chime to a room on the other side of the house. Both the doorbell and the chime were extremely easy to install and link up to our wi-fi in our home. One other nice thing is that if you need help either setting it up or for any technical issues, the Ring team at their customer service department are all very helpful. I have recommended Ring to a few people already and most have purchased and also been very happy. These also make a great gift for the holidays. Kit comes with everything you need to install on any type of surface (including a drill bit and a level). Get the ring. For peace of mind and for security. Only thing is, if you are getting this for a gift for someone, like a spouse, don't make the mistake of saying , ""honey, I bought you a ring today"" as she might be expecting something a little less techie and with a lot more flash.","Love, Love, Love The Ring..One of the BEST gadgets today"

And the ability to review things later if you get the Ring Protect feature for $30 a year is also cool.

Also like to mention they  did not make me go through a bunch of unnecessary steps to fix the issue. that may other companies try  In a very timely matter diagnosed my device as defective  due to what they called stuck in Night Mode.  John  resolved the issue by taking  immediate steps to replace my device.  The warranty on the ring video doorbell is 1 year.  As I mentioned I had mine for 1.5 years .  ring replaced my device outside of the warranty because they stand by the great product they have.  Impressive  stuff .

First, installation is as easy as they say: charged the battery before installation, removed the old wired doorbell, and installed the Ring doorbell (which slowly charges using the doorbell wiring, no need to remove the battery). Wifi setup also easy, and my router is close to the front door, so signal was good (app gives you signal info). All features are great: motion or ringing the doorbell sends quick alerts to our phones, and we can answer on our phone. Once, my kid can home from school, rang the bell, and my wife and I (both at work) answered from our phones, and we could hear each other and our kid, and had a 3-way conversation over the doorbell!

I also have two Ring Chimes for backup when phone isn't charged. Easy set up. Videos stored in Cloud for a fee: very reasonable price. Option to store locally on personal hard drive would be great. I prefer Ring Cloud storage since its easy to setup and use remotely and multiple Doorbells are easy to add.

I also subscribe to the cloud recording which is really nice to be able to see recordings of people approaching my door for later review. Installation was really easy if you are handy at all.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Feb-16,Rex,"Ring is a very good idea, but the execution still needs a lot of work. There are a number of critical problems the company must solve before I will be satisfied with their product. 1. First and foremost, I discovered the hard way that if the Ring falls off your Wifi network, the only way you will know is by the fact that you stop receiving motion and doorbell alerts. There is no notification at all on the smartphone application that it is no longer communicating with the doorbell. As a matter of fact, it will still show you the last battery status it received as if it were still connected. For 6 straight days I received no alerts while I was out of town and when I contacted the company to find out if something was wrong, they informed me that the Doorbell had apparently fell off my Wifi network (no idea why, of course). You can only reset the device locally, so if this happens, you are just out of luck until you return home. To me, this is the biggest problem with the device. There is no way for me to know that it is working and if it isn't your only clue will be a lack of alerts over time. 1. a. Related to the above, if the device falls off your network, it will also not sound the doorbell locally through the Chimes. So you won't get an alert and you won't get a doorbell ringing in your house. 2. As noted in other reviews, the recording feature for motion alerts usually starts far too late to be useful. You either see nothing because the person has already left, or you see their back as they are leaving. When UPS, FEDEX, etc. drop off packages, I either don't see the driver at all or I see his back as he is leaving my driveway. 3. Also as noted other reviews. There is no way to remotely access the device if you miss the alert. You cannot remotely turn on the camera and intercom if someone is standing at your door unless you caught the alert on time. Overall, I really want to like this product, but it still has some critical flaws that need to be fixed. The company seems very response and professional, so that is a positive. Hopefully they will work quickly to address some of these issues.","Good idea, but the execution needs some work."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Dec-17,Tara Cullen,"I purchased this doorbell anticipating that I would be able to keep an eye on my holiday deliveries while at work as well as warn potential solicitors not to ring my doorbell due to my sleeping baby.  I spent a lot of time reading reviews and comparing this to various other models and this seemed like a great deal however after installing it, I very quickly realized that this does not perform as advertised.  The motion sensor is absolutely terrible.  I currently have the app set to a distance of ~15 feet however every car that drives by my house (40 feet from my door to the road) activates the motion sensor and I get an alert which is extremely annoying being that it should not activate at that distance.  On the other hand, I have had several packages delivered to my door this week and not a single delivery person activated the motion sensor and I have no record of the delivery.  The inability of this doorbell to activate and record at the correct time (someone walking up to my door vs a car driving outside of the motion activation zone) renders this an utterly useless smart device.

The Ring doorbell has an internal battery that is charged by the power from the old doorbell wires.  We love the way it works, gives us a great view of our porch and we can see who is there without them seeing us.  You can actually talk to the person via the doorbell and hear them.  We have tuned the motion sensor so that it only picks up someone coming up our steps.  The application is very well done and makes it easy to turn the sensitivity up or down in pie segments of coverage. The appearance of the doorbell box is very professional and slick.  It doesn't look like what it is, just looks like an attractive doorbell that lights up when you use it (a circle around the button lights up blue.) Had some teething problems at first.  Seemed to take 20-30 seconds for our phones to ring after someone rang the doorbell.  By the time we responded sometimes they had left.  Sent an email to Ring support, they asked me to test our network and provide some technical details.  2 hours after I supplied the info they had downloaded a firmware fix and the ring time went down to 2-3 seconds.  WOW, now that is customer support. Note that you can respond remotely.  We were in Istanbul, Turkey, and had strong WiFi in our hotel.  We were surprised when our phones indicated that we had someone at the door . . . we could see them and the bibles they were holding . . . we told them that we were too busy to come to the door and they left.  Since our home is in San Jose, California this was really impressive! We did order a couple of their remote Chime devices so we could hear the doorbell upstairs or somewhere that we didn't have our phones with us.  All you do is plug them in wall outlets anywhere in range of your WiFi signal, install them in your Ring application, and you have remote doorbell ringers. Highly recommended!  We are buying a set as a gift for our daughter and her husband for their first house (shhhh, it's a christmas present.)","Highly recommended, does everything they claim and install is easy!"

My installation, however, was a little tricky because it was mounted in place of my old Nutone Intercom Doorbell.  We had to pull that out and then cut a piece of my TimberTech decking board used on our new deck, to fit into the Nutone space.  We then (He) had to drill some holes to get the wiring through the engineered wood and then have the proper screws to secure to the Nutone box.  My handyman did a nice job and the doorbell is awesome.  It's the first time I had video and it provides a whole new level of security for my family.  It's very well made.  I will say, too, that it is nice having a record of who is coming and going at all hours of the day.  My kids are not thrilled with that, though.  I love this thing.

This was a fine point I did not know about.  At the time of my purchase, $3/month for the ""cloud storage"" which allows you to have video playback.  It's too slow to load the video on my phone or iPad in a timely manner, so I felt compelled to verbally answer before I knew who (or if someone) was at the door. If you cannot direct wire it, you must purchase the chime.  My bell was mounted on an adjacent side wall so it was not a usable location for video. My front door is well protected by side walls and an overhang, so the lighting contrast is too great (it's too bright to see more that a few feet past the room overhang), but it's clear if someone is on the porch out of the sun. I'm still fine tuning the motion sensing.  I get lots of ""false"" readings. Hopefully, the fee for minimal cloud storage will be included someday.

The only thing I'm worried about is that the camera lets me get all the way inside (when I'm coming in through our fence entrance) almost to our front door before the camera starts recording.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jan-16,RF,"Really good product out the box. There are a few things that could be improved. I'll start with the battery. After 17 days (current outside temps are around 34 degrees), battery is at 70% according to my iPhone. My iPad says 100%. I think the iPhone is correct which means the battery will not last 6 months let alone 12 months. Some days the motion sensor did not trigger at all and on other days it seemed to trigger every few hours. I imagine lowering the sensitivity will preserve battery life. I will eventually hard wire it, but am waiting on the resistor because I don't have a door bell chime. Another issue is that people see the camera, look right at it and still look around for a doorbell. I don't know why people do not recognize the circle as the ""button"" to push. Maybe ring could put a little bell logo on the button. Maybe after I hard wire it and ther ring glows white people will understand it's a button. I'd also like to see a doorbell only Ring (no camera) as I have to doors and a Ring Chime inside. The chime is a great add-on BTW. Overall the build quality is excellent. Ring is easy to use and install. You must have EXCELLENT wifi to your Ring or the video will lack. I ended up buying a wifi extender. *****UPDATE***** Ironically I just wrote the above yesterday. Now the battery is showing 85% instead of the 70% as of yesterday. Then this morning I get an email from Ring saying my battery is low and it's time to recharge. So I'm not sure what's going on. The temp this morning was 15 degrees. Maybe this is why the battery is acting up. Another day gone by....still having issues with the battery. After fully charging it went to 80% after an hour. I did find out the firmware was out of date. After emailing customer support the firmware was update to improve battery life. I also found out the old firmware didn't actually just the sensitivity levels even if you tried. The update should fix that issue.",Great product and has me looking for more smarthome gadgets.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Jan-16,IGottaDoItRight,"First let me say that I really like it as a doorbell. I am disappointed in its usefulness as a motion detecting video camera for my environment. My house sits 4 feet off the ground. The doorbell is approximately 21 feet from the sidewalk and the traffic lanes start at 32 feet and beyond from my door bell. My mail box is about 8 feet to the left of the Ring. I purchased and installed the Ring in December 2015. In my area that means cool to cold and sometimes rainy weather. Note that the motion detection is based on infrared. Ring does not detect when my mailman comes up my front steps to put the mail in the box. I believe this is because he's very well bundled up to keep warm. Also, he actually only has to come up to the top step and not all the way to the door. Maybe the heat signature from just his face is too small to pass the algorithm evaluation to qualify as being in range. I found that if I set the range to register further out from the ring device, about twenty feet, it would sometimes pick up the mailman. However, it would also alert me when the neighbor across the street comes down their steps and more frequently when cars pass by. The device does register when UPS delivers to me (or my neighbors) because it registers their trucks. :) I have never been alerted to any one on the side walk or on my front steps even without a coat. I walked around in front of my house to test this. After a couple of calls to Ring customer support I learned that the device is programmed to ignore heat signatures in the lower area of the image. The support person was on the phone while I paced back and forth across each step, one at a time, starting from the bottom and working my way up. She told me when she saw a heat signature. No heat signature was detected until I reach the second step down from the porch. Thus, the higher the entryway from the street or sidewalk level, the less any activity will be registered on the sidewalk or grounds in front of the entry because the lower the heat sources are in the image. In all cases of my experimentation I do get alerts when someone is on my front porch, as long as they are not well insulated with their back side toward the camera. I live on a somewhat busy residential street so even with the motion detection set at around 8-10 feet I get a lot of motion alerts from Vans on up to fire engines passing. This is because the area of heat is larger and therefore determined by the program to be closer to the camera. I tried angling my Ring by putting shims under the mounting plate to facing down a little. I'd really like to be alerted as soon as someone starts up my front steps. But that didn't work out so well for my house. Two problems come from tilting the mount. First, unless the mount is also pulled out away from the wall as well as titled, once the mount is tilted it is hard to access the locking screws at the bottom of the device to lock the Ring to the mounting plate. Second, there is slightly less head room in the image. The closer one gets to the camera the taller they are in the image. I chose to leave it level and just use it for the video doorbell and reduced the distance to only read motion on the porch. I have to accept the limitations for my environment when it comes to the motion detection. At some point I may decide to add their stick-up cam if I feel a need for more security in my neighborhood. Another point to be aware of: If you do not have enough space on the door frame or if your door frame is not flat, you may want to do some minor carpentry to make it sit level with the wall of the house instead of on an angle. My house has a security door that was mounted onto the door trim. On top of that I have shaker slates on the exterior of my house. In the photos attached you can see the white bar of the security door blocks some of the view of my porch on the left. I chiseled out a section of the shaker slate and used a flat piece of wood along with some shims in its place to get a slight downward angle. Then I spray painted the wood with some paint I had left over. The wood was then secured to the house and the bracket then mounted onto the wood. A little messy, but not too noticeable.",Motion detection issue with houses that sit off the ground

I love that I can see everything that happens when I am home or not home outside.  Gave me a different perspective, actually.  My boys push the doorbell button when they come home from school, just so they can say ""hi"" to mom at work.  It truly was a great purchase.  Wish the cold winter Wisconsin weather did not alter it, but it lags and the charge decreases quicker.  I am understanding of that, and I can overlook that.  Otherwise, you can not go wrong!",Love the Ring doorbell
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Jan-17,Steven Nguyen,"Waffled a lot before buying but now I don't regret getting this at all. I had to get this version because my doorbell isn't hard wired. I don't think there are any other non-Ring options that are battery powered either. Installation: Not had...Was a little tricky mounting because it wasn't exactly flat so had to try a bunch of different ways before it slid up into the mounting bracket. Sensitivity: I was a little worried that it wouldn't catch people because there are stairs leading up to the doorway but it gets the vast majority of people in time. I think the only way it would miss someone is if they sprinted up my steps, went to my front door and then dashed back down the steps. Video quality: Pretty decent.  Not as good as the new version but good enough for you to tell who's at your door. Sound quality: Not great. Have had some conversations with people at the door and it's hard to hear them, kind of like when you have bad redemption on your phone, and it seems hard for them to hear you to. Totally doable though. Do you need this? You didn't think you did but after you get it you'll wonder how you lived without it. Incredible piece of mind seeing everyone who comes to your door. Seems like it probably dissuades would-be troublemakers too once they realize they're on camera.",Must-have

The video was ok but not great and the sound was not good at all but lt did notify us when someone was at our door. However with the not so good video and sound it was not worth keeping.

I found it so disheartening that I have not reported it 'til now. But Okay, You asked! Some time back (very early on), I sent in a suggestion to change the behavior of the Ring app in both Ring and Motion events. The suggestion was in fact implemented, but subsequently rolled back. Bottom line: The ring app should NOT open with the microphone activated. This should be obvious. Remember, the Ring Doorbell is primarily a security device. If your Ring app is activated by either a ""ring"" or  motion event due to the presence of someone at or near your door -- possibly  with ill or nefarious intent -- you just might like to surreptitiously OBSERVE said visitor/passer-by without your background noise or any sound gathered from that microphone (TV sound, etc.) being transmitted to the external doorbell. Once you have determined that you wish to speak to that visitor, would be the appropriate time to (manually) activate the microphone! Some time ago, the Ring app was changed in accordance with the above (presumable on my suggestion), but sadly, within the past few months it has reverted to opening with the microphone ""live"".

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Dec-15,C. S. Lewis,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. In August I purchased my RING Doorbell for our front door. I also purchased 2 chimes -- one for upstairs, and one for the basement. I was so pleased with everything I've since purchased two more RING Doorbells -- one for our garage door entrance into our house, and the other as a gift for my in-laws. It simply works as described -- charging and setup was easy, the physical installation was easy (though our front door is constructed of some insanely dense wood and I bent a couple of screws in the installation process -- so a little pre-drilling may be in order), and once it was up and running it functioned perfectly. I love the two-way communication feature. For example, last week I was at a swim meet with my kids and I received a notification someone was at our door. When I looked I saw it was one of the neighborhood kids wanting to play, and I was able to talk to her and let her know we weren't home (I'll try to include the video clip here in the review). The motion sensor is nice, too, but we get frequented by neighborhood children so often the motion sensor, even on the lowest setting, can give me more notifications that I like. The RING doorbell feels and looks solid, mounts and dismounts easily (with the tool provided), and has a nice appearance. I think it blends well with our existing door hardware. As you'll notice in the picture, I decided to mount the doorbell directly onto the door instead of hard-wiring in the place of our existing doorbell. This was simply due to the size of the RING Doorbell. It isn't exactly small, but for the function and convenience it provides the size wasn't a deal-breaker and I don't mind having it sit alongside the old doorbell. And perhaps if a second generation model shrinks in size significantly I'll consider replacing this one. Lastly, I've had to contact RING Customer Support a couple of times with questions and the support staff was very friendly and helpful. We're very pleased with everything we've experienced with this product. Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell","Two-Way video communication, Motion sensing, wirless or hard-wired ...

The picture is not quite as clear as my other cameras but one huge advantage is that you mount it where your previous doorbell was which is low enough to see the person's face.  This has been an issue with our other cameras that are mounted up high and pointed down.  The motion zones are adjustable as well as the sensitivity.  It will pick up and record motion even if the person has not rung the doorbell and you can even get a live view any time using the app.  It was also really nice that I could hardwire it to my existing 'Westminster Abby' doorbell so I didn't lose that.  I bought a second one for my daughter's house where she had no security camera before.  These are a relatively inexpensive option to a larger camera setup or a nice addition to one as in my case. My only concern with these is that occasionally, if someone approaches the door and moves away very quickly, they are gone before I have a chance to open the app.  I can go back and replay it and see who it was though.",What a great product!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Jun-15,Tony,"Its finally working!  The kit was very complete.  But the configuration process was not so complete.  Tech support was courteous but was not helpful.  In the end I tried every possible path to configure the device.  I say path as there are a few options.  This is most of what I tried and then what worked for me.  During the configuration process you connect your android to the device; that worked.  The next step is to connect to your home wifi.  If I just provide the wifi pass phrase, it fails to connect to the cloud servers.  I noted on my wifi controller console that the device never gets an IP address.  So then I try again, but to try again I had to close the app and wait for the device to timeout before trying again.  The second time noticed an Advance button below the home wifi pass phrase.  The advance button provides two options; static or dhcp (automatic) ip addressing. So I tried DCHP (automatic) first, dont forget to select the Save button below that before you advance to the next step; but this did not work.  I then tried again by selecting static this time.  It seems to auto fill the screen for you, but not really.  If you dont over-type the static fields, it does not work.  So third try, this time I select static, enter the appropriate information in all fields (over-type) quickly, dont forget to select the Save button. Next....  And to my surprise, it worked! (done).  Well almost done.  Next you will need to mount the device.  The back plate was tricky, even with out mounting it to the wall.  When testing, the app did not seem to auto start if the device button was pressed.  Rather a notification appears on the locked android screen.  If I double tap the notification on the locked android screen then I can answer the bell.  The picture is not bad, and the sound quality is acceptable.  The device has a very wide angle of view so the fact the door bell is at almost waist level does not seem to be an issue.  I have mine hardwired so the original indoor bell still works and the wire should keep the battery charged.  The recordings are also not bad.  Over all its a great little device.",Its finally working!

The app is easy to navigate and I purchased the year live view so I leave the live view on my device or go back and see the saved videos when the ring is activated. I loved it so much I got one in the brass finish for my next door neighbor. Who really fell in love with ours. The only downside of the Ring Video Doorbell is that it uses my 2.4ghz network and not my 5ghz network that is much faster. All and all it is worth the cost for something that  integrates so well into your house and really gives you a great feeling of security for you and your family.",Security made Beautiful
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Mar-16,MsFit,"We recently had a new alarm system installed with many upgrades.  We had wanted a camera that covered the front entry.  Our security company wanted a fortune to do that because it required an expensive DVR to record the action.  We passed.  A few days later I ran across the Ring Doorbell.  Well, forget expensive camera setups.  The Ring unit does it all,  motion, camera, speaker system, alerts plus it plays the action live on your cell phone no matter where you are and also records everything for later viewing if necessary.  It was simple to install and uses your current door bell wiring to keep the battery charged. It will also work on battery alone.  Setting the motion detector takes a few tries but it works great. Now you can see who is at the front door (or any exterior door on battery power) whether they ring the door bell or not.  Your cell phone will receive a prompt alert to notify you someone is there. You can use the speaker to talk to them live (even when you are away from home) and the entire action is is recorded for later if necessary.  Ring charges $3.00 a month to Cloud store your videos and you can manage them from your cell phone or their web page.  This thing is amazing and works very well.  Highly recommended.",Simple to install and it works.

So no saved videos and no being able to check motion after the trial is over.  Battery runs out quickly on it and it picks up trash trucks and buses even though it really shouldn’t.  They want you to buy a slanted item to hook to it but I don’t feel like spending more money on it.  It’s an ok product with an expensive gimmick with the monthly fee to see people at the door. WiFi isn’t great either.  Pretty disappointing overall.,Not the best product

I know when my packages get delivered and I can speak to the delivery guy and ask him to put my packages at the side of the house. It's great that you can see who is coming to your yard but you can also talk to them if you're not home which is a great feature and a good scare tactic for anyone who is not supposed to be there.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Jan-16,JT,"UPDATE - it's even worse than originally stated. Once the 30-day trial period ends for the cloud service, it becomes pretty useless.  Two reasons: 1) The latency from an event to a notification on the app (either proximity or doorbell) is 15 or more seconds so unless it's someone standing on the porch waiting, you'll miss it.  If you do catch the event, the first 15 seconds and everything prior are missed.  Adding to the latency, it takes the video another 5 seconds to stabilize because of the compression (worse at night).  If it was a false alarm e.g. a truck driving by, you'll never know why. The USPS dropped an Amazon order on my porch and even though there was a Ring alert it looked like a false alarm (nobody there in the field of view) and the package sat on my porch most of the day. Without the ability to see recorded video, the events are useless. 2)  I refuse to pay the cloud service fee on principle.  If it worked better then maybe I wouldn't mind.  But I also have a nice big NAS box on my network and they could easily allow me to pipe the video to my own storage.  Of course that will never happen because they'll give up a revenue stream.  It's not a lot of money but I don't need a doorbell that costs me a recurring $36/year. Downgraded from three stars to two stars. -------------------------original review-------------------------- There are a couple of significant design flaws: One - The motion detection feature is pretty much useless unless you place it somewhere that doesn't have any normal motion. On a front porch where most people will use it, you're more likely to have cars/trucks passing by and people walking their pets on the sidewalk.  Even though the app has a control for motion sensitivity, there is no setting that can discriminate well enough to avoid false alarms from far away objects - even if you set it to ""approx 5ft range"" which still triggers on a car 100 feet away. Tech Support says it's detecting heat, not motion, so the lowest setting is looking for a large heat signature and the highest setting is looking for a small heat signature. Regardless, neither setting will tune it so that it will only trigger when there's motion on your porch. And regardless of the setting, the triggers are wildly inconsistent - triggering one time when someone is walking on the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street, but not triggering another time when someone is walking in the front yard. Two - there's no way to see the camera view unless there is an event first - either motion was detected or the doorbell was pressed. You might want to use this for example if your dog is barking at the front window and you'd like to see what's outside.  Unfortunately you can't, unless there's a trigger event first. I'm sure the reason is to conserve the battery power which Wi-Fi would use to stay continuously on.  But if it's hardwired to power then this shouldn't be an issue. You'd think this would be easy to implement as a user configurable option.  But nonetheless it's not possible to see the camera view on demand. Lastly, the doorbell plays a chime through it's speaker which I didn't care for, but there's no control in the app to disable it. Luckily, Tech Support can disable it if you submit a support ticket and request it to be turned off.",Overall a middling product with some significant design flaws that need to be fixed.

I may never find out. The mound for this product is so flimsy that, unless you have a wall as smooth as a pancake griddle, don't plan on mounting this. I have an average tract home with an average stucco wall. Even with the mount so loose it was threatening to fall off the wall the mounting plate distorted so much I could not seat the doorbell on it. I really don't even have the option of returning it now as I already ripped my old doorbell off and drilled four holes in the wall next to my door.

I got it because my wife when she was home alone really wanted to see who was at the door and ideally be able to talk to them. The $30/yr for the full video recording package is very reasonable.  It would be nice if in the future we could dump the videos to a NAS or cloud storage of our choosing.  They might allow something like that eventually.  They seem to diligently be working on their API.  Install was a breeze.  I have recommended this product to my non-techy friends and I really have confidence I won't be getting a call after they get it to install it for them.  The only knock I have against it is that when I hooked it up to my existing analog doorbell, since it allows current through the wire to charge, it was making my bell buzz.  I ultimately disconnected my existing bell and bought to ""chimes"" through Ring and I love them.  I don't miss the old bell.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Aug-15,Crystal,"This is a great product.  I love that it does not require a hard wired doorbell since I don't have one, but for those that do it also has that option.  It looks great on the front of my house and works as expected.  My video and audio quality is limited by my extreamly slow internet.  I called up ring customer service and they turnedd down my audio and video setting on the lowest possible level at my request.  My upload speed is only .25Mb/s, optimaly you need 1Mb/s.  This is due to my extreamly slow DSL since I live out in the country and am at the range limit.  With that said, this unit perfomes as hoped for.  When someone showes up at my door my phone alerts me to their precense even if they don't ring the ring.  I've been able to catch the elusive UPS guy to have him take some packages, saves me 1hour round trip to the closes UPS store.  In my testing the alerts come rather quickly, either instant or withing 2 seconds.  From the time someone rings the bell till I'm talking to them is quicker than if I can get to the door if they rang a standard door bell.  I've had no issues with the motion detection it works very well for me with very few false alarms.  You just have to adjust the settings for your environment, however if a big flying insect comes right up to the ring, it will prolly trip it, as it did in my case.  All in all I've had maybe 2 false alarms in the 2-3 weeks I've had the ring.  The only downside is the lack of the ability to access the video from the ring remotely without a motion triger or a ring.... I guess this is called on-demand access.  Once ring updates thier units firmware to offer this feature, it will be the perfect unit.  For me on-demand would be nice but not a necessity.  They also have a chime that can be purchased seperately to ring in the house like a standard doorbell, but I have not purchased this item and cannot speak to how it performes.  I hope this review helps, I took some time deciding which ""door bell"" I was going to purchase and am glad I chose ring.  Good product and great customer service.","Ring.....

The biggest negative is that if your device is battery-powered and you live in an area with a cold winter, it will not operate for maybe 5 months of the year.  Lithium batteries do not work for long outside my door. And many times the app program is slow, or doesn't respond.  I think it requires a super-fast WiFi connect.

I'm too exhausted from dealing with it to list all the issues i faced, but the two major issues are: 1)The motion alerts go off constantly. this has been much documented, and it renders the security feature of the doorbell useless.

This is a type of product I will never buy from Amazon again.","If you want this to be under Ring warranty, don’t order it from Amazon!"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Jan-20,RoxanneOH,"I wish I had looked more into how the battery works.  It DOES NOT charge when it is hard-wired!  The only way to charge it is to unscrew the whole unit, take it off and then charge it with the USB cable.  Unscrewing it is a pain due to the way it was installed because the person who installed it and I both thought we wouldn't need to unscrew it again.  Bought this thing in September and it's now January and this thing needs charged again!!  It's freezing cold outside, dark in the morning when I leave for work and dark at night when I get home.  It's too cold and too dark to stand out on the front porch and practically stand on my head to try to unscrew the unit.  If I had had any idea that the Ring DOES NOT charge when it is hard-wired, I would never have bought the thing!!  For as much money as this thing cost, it should draw power from the electric it's attached to, not have to be completely taken down and charged via a USB.  And don't get me started about not actually making any audible sound when the button is pushed!!  You have to buy another add on or doorbell chime of some kind to actually hear it!

I will say three negatives:  video quality, audio is horrible, and white balance.  There are 5+ year old smart phones with better cameras then this device.  It's as if this company bought all the left over 10+ year webcam, cameras, and installed them on this.  The white balance is horrid, only focusing on the 6 or so feet from your front door, and unable to adjust to sunlight in the distance to see who may be walking up to the door.  Unlike any camera or video device that allows you to tap on excessively bright areas to bring them into focus, this one can not.  It's simply a cheap ccd/optics/and outdated electronics.  The audio is choppy and if lucky half can be heard.  Calling Ring and or putting in a help ticket results in the router,  or cameras location, or the construction of the home being the blame.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Feb-16,twitte,"Wow!  This is a great addition to my house and security system and it actually works very well.  I was surprised by the quality of the Ring doorbell (a very solid, nicely designed product) and all the extras they give you to help with the installation.  Just about everything you need is included in the box (except electric drill).  I watched a couple of the YouTube videos and got some pointers.  The actual installation took only a few minutes and followed exactly as shown in the video.  Setting up to my internet (before mounting) was a snap and very easy to do.  I decided to hook up to my existing doorbell wiring since it had the correct voltage.  This is better if you can do it since it will keep the Ring doorbell charged.  Either way (hooked to existing wiring or standalone using built-in rechargeable batteries) would have worked for me.  I downloaded the free app to 2 cell phones and 3 tablets so it could be used in multiple locations.  You can also view the videos on your PC.  It only made sense to me to subscribe to the yearly cloud recording service (for only $30/year).  I ended up adjusting the zones and range so that it wouldn't be triggered by my neighbor's activity.  The quality of the video is excellent.  Since I mounted it on a rough surface (stucco) I put a light bead of clear silicone around the base to keep any moisture out.",Ring Doorbell exceeded my expectations and ended up being a great addition

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Jan-16,KJF,"We love our Ring doorbell. We first bought this when my wife was recovering from foot surgery and had limited mobility. It allowed her to see who was at the door. She could tell delivery guys to leave packages, and tell friends to wait a bit while she made it to the door. It worked great! Since then, we have continued to find it extremely useful. We can monitor the house during the day or while working in the back yard. We can see when packages are left. We can choose to answer the door, talk to the person, or ignore solicitors. I can't imagine going back to just a regular doorbell. We recently added a Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Chime for the basement. A couple of notes. We replaced our old doorbell, which was wired, so the Ring doorbell stays charged and activates our existing wired bell. So I have no experience with the battery in the Ring doorbell. Notifications to a smartphone can lag at times a bit longer than ideal. You can adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. It apparently works off of heat, and is much more sensitive in the winter (picking up passing cars), but can easily be adjusted down. Installation was easy; the Ring doorbell even comes with the necessary tools. Connection to our Wi-Fi was a snap using the IOS app. We like our so much we have told our friends and family about it, and several have purchased and installed their own.",Can't Now Imagine Not Having This
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Dec-19,Ashley Berger,I have had the ring for a while now and love it. Used the existing doorbells power and haven't had any issues with that or the connectivity to my wifi and I have it passing thru at least 5 walls on a normal att router/modem.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,8-May-15,EJC,"A very solid 2.0 product.  I was a little hesitant to order since the reviews were very bipolar (either 5 stars or 1 star).  Keeping with that trend, I give it a solid 4.5 stars, if that were possible.  Since most of the positives have already been commented upon, I would like to address some of the negatives that gave me pause when I ordered. Here are issues that others had, and here is my take: 1)  SETUP.  Setup is similar to many other modern generation WiFi/""Internet of Things"".  Download app, connect to Ring WiFi, input your home WiFi settings, voila.  I had no issues. 2)  PHYSICAL INSTALLATION.  The Ring comes with a great little install kit and they make it as easy as reasonably is possible without adding significantly to the cost.  With that being said, I installed it into a brick wall and the masonry drill bit dulled after two of the four holes were done.  I was a little bit annoyed, but I'm impressed they even included anything.  I also wish the installation instructions were a little more clear on how to wire the Ring to my existing doorbell's wiring.  I am not able to read the simplistic wiring diagram, and so I resorted to watching the install video and looked at the order in which they attached the red/white wires for my doorbell.  For people who have a clue this probably is simple, but not for me.  I'm just glad it worked and didn't fry my Ring. 3)  CONNECTIVITY.  My router is literally 10 feet away, through a brick wall, from my Ring.  I have not had any connectivity issues and the doorbell ringing-to-app alert time is seconds most of the time.  The video is not perfect, but pretty good and more than usable. 4)  MOTION SENSOR.  My Ring faces a relatively busy street.  Upon initial setup, even with the motion sensor configured for 5 ft, it went off every time a car passed by.  Whatever adjustments I did or software upgrade Ring installed, I now seem to be in a happy medium.  Not too many false alarms, but occasionally the motion detector does not pick up someone walking up to the door unless they literally are next to the sensor.  I will say that it seems the ambient air temperature also affects the overall sensitivity of the device.  The doorbell part works fine, however. 5)  BATTERY LIFE.  I installed mine with the doorbell wires and currently the battery level stays at 100%.  Initially, when my motion sensor was going off very frequently (even with the alert setting set to the less frequent number of alerts), I did note that my battery was draining into the 80% range despite being attached to the doorbell wiring.  After doing a little search online, Ring actually mentions that the ""trickle charge"" may not be able to keep up with the utilization of energy.  They don't say what happens when it isn't able to keep but, but I can only assume that I would have to take down my Ring every so often for a micro-USB charging inside my house.  Fortunately, my doorbell electrical output now seems to be keeping up and I have not seen any charging issues as of recent. 6)  CHEAPNESS.  Overall the build quality is appropriate for the price point.  The plastic strip at the top quarter, where I assume the IR sensors are covered, does look a little chintzy (see another customer reviewers photos) compared to the rest of the product.  However, it doesn't really bother me and so I would not penalize Ring for this minor oversight.  Very few companies have the ability or financial freedom to be as detailed oriented as Apple is with all of their products. 7)  CLOUD VIDEO.  Videos recorded by the Ring are uploaded to the Cloud -- free for the first 30 days.  After that, it is $30 per year, which seems reasonable, however, free is always better and probably not realistic. One week into ownership, I am very happy with the product.  Great job!",My answers to all the ONE-STAR ratings!!!

The coverage area is good, video quality is solid, iPhone integration is easy, Wifi connectivity stable, battery life good 1 year in (charge them maybe every 2 months, or a little more if we're setting one of them off frequently), work in freezing temps, and night vision gets us good views of wandering Deer. The neighborhood feature is nice to see if neighbors have issues/theft from the porch. I think Ring should also provide signs, like, ""Property under Video Surveillance by Ring"" as a deterrent (and free RING advertising). We pay for the video recording, nice to have in case you want to save videos, or something fishy happens. It's a little weird talking to people from your phone that can't see you, but a nice feature nonetheless.

The only thing I was disappointed with is if you want to be able to view older videos you do have to pay for a subscription.

Install was easy and quick, we downloaded the app, hooked it to our doorbell and started using it right away.  Our original bell still works, the unit itself is fairly discreet but it's good looking so I don't mind having it on the front of the house.  We have the motion sensor on all the time and it is pretty sensitive with a big field of vision.  Once you have it set up, it will play a nice chime sound (or vibrate if you have the sound off) on your phone to alert you that either someone rang the bell or entered the field of vision.  All you do is click on the alert or on the ring icon and it will prompt you to accept the incoming alert which will keep the video stream open and enable the two way sound.  If you don't catch the alert you can still play back the video if you subscribe to their cloud. The image quality of the video is very good and the two way sound is also surprisingly good. I did subscribe to their cloud service because it was cheap enough and I like being able to play back the video.

I thought it sounded really cool and went ahead and bought it.  The setup only took me about 15 minutes, including drilling and mounting the unit.  I had a standard doorbell with 2 wires and the Ring uses those wires to trickle charge, so I never have to charge it manually.  It easily connected to my Wi-Fi, and also rings my original doorbell. It's really nice to be able to see who's at the door, as well as talk to them.  The motion detection is also a nice feature if someone just comes to your door and doesn't ring the doorbell (knocks instead).  It will still allow you to see them and talk to them.  The motion is a tad too sensitive though, even on the lowest setting.  My only request is I'd like to see a ""view on demand"" feature, which Ring says they are working on.

I like the video doorbell but it really doesn't trigger the motion sensor right away. There are times that there's a delay and sometimes it doesn't get triggered. Like today, the mailman dropped off a package at my door without triggering the motion sensor. I actually got a text from Amazon saying my package was delivered. I even turned on all the zones on and set the range to 30ft, still nothing. The button to ring the doorbell, it's like you have to push hard to even get an alert. Sometimes it doesn't even alert you the first time it was push and sometimes there's a delay. Overall I think it's ok. The 2-way talk works pretty well. The video seems nice and clear. Set up and installation was quick and easy. But the motion is what kills it the most. UPDATE: January 26, 2016 - A month after using it, the battery is pretty good. 15% and still going. The motion detection seems like it got better. But the ring, may still need improvements. Or it's the notification. Yesterday I saw the Amazon Prime Now delivery person outside. So I ran downstairs and waited. I could hear it from behind the door but I didn't get any notification until seconds later. I don't think I ever heard it make the same sound as when someone rings the bell.",Battery is awesome.

Brown, PhD","The original Ring video doorbell was easy to install with its built in battery and optional wired connection.  This is one of the few video doorbells that offers both power options. WiFi pairing went smoothly and video quality is good, but not excellent. Unfortunately, the main benefits to added security (mainly storage of event triggered video) requires a subscription.  Video streaming and motion triggering are free, but there is no storage of events (doorbell or motion triggers)  from the past week.  There also isn't software included for local storage of video on an always-on computer kept in the home.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Jun-17,Craig,"While this doorbell is a great idea it's not worth the money and probably worse than a regular doorbell. I've had it about 8 months and only had it perform as advertised once. First, it's slow to ring. I can literally hear people at the door, walk downstairs, and answer the door before my phone actually tells me there is someone there. I expect it's reasonable for someone to ring my doorbell, wait, and decide to leave before I ever knew they were there. And if I don't pay for additional cloud video storage (which I think is price gouging) I might not even be able to find out who it was. Second, for some reason the doorbell uses a metric ton of bandwidth to broadcast. If the doorbell rings every other device in the house lags for about a minute. This is also true with the motion detection which is rather spotty (you can sneak past it unnoticed if you walk reasonably slowly). This makes everything from Netflix to online gaming unbearable if you live in a busy neighborhood. And the motion detection thing would probably be really scary if I was trying to use it for security. Third, the device lacks any integration. It would make great sense to link the doorbell to the lights. If you really wanted to be cool you could link to smart TV's, game consoles, or Amazon Echo. None of that exists. Again, it's a killer idea. It just fails to function properly in any sense and is less useful than a ""dumb"" doorbell. I gave it two stars because at least the hardware is sturdy (tough plastic) and physically it is well designed. Everything else... not so much.",Pretty looking and sturdy... not much else.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Jan-16,S. Jones,"I've had for a few months now, here are my impressions: - Seems well designed and constructed - Easy setup - tools included, joined to wi-fi painlessly.  Pretty good range on the signal as well - my phone gets a pretty low wireless signal where the Ring sits, but I haven't had any connection issues with the Ring - Good 'reaction times' when someone presses the button - Decent audio / video quality All the negatives I've found revolve around the motion detecting bit of it.  First, plan on spending the $30/year for the cloud storage otherwise the motion bit is completely worthless for you.  There's enough of a delay in 'motion detected' to you hitting 'answer' that you'll probably never see what caused it.  The cloud storage will record those first few seconds you missed, so you'll be able to go back to it. Also, the motion detection just seems like it could be greatly improved.  The 'zones' and 'range' bit sounds great, but it doesn't work.  My house sits about 40ft from the road and I have the 'range' as low as it will go (5 ft) and I still get notices every morning at 5am when the newspaper guy stops on the other side of the street.  I really don't even pay attention to the 'motion detected' alerts anymore, I might as well turn them off actually. Things I wish it would do: - Live look in.  I don't know if they ever will add this - it's not meant to be a constant monitor, but it would be nice to trigger it to show me 30 seonds or so. - Notification schedule - I'd care less about this if every little thing didn't trigger the motion - Change the 'jingle' the device itself plays.  I'd like to be able to turn it off, but a simple 'ding' would be better. - Let me store the video myself and not be tied to the cloud service","Good doorbell, bad motion detection"

Don’t even think I am going to contact Ring this go around to troubleshoot and waste more time. I got it for the back door and didn’t want to invest 100.00 more for the ring doorbell 2 as I already own for a couple of years. I was aware that the video quality was not going to be as good as the 2 video doorbell but the is unacceptable for me. Can’t get a good picture of the face of the individual in focus!

However, anyone who stands on my stoop for more than the millisecond that the UPS man does is captured just fine.  And anyone who rings my Ring doorbell is captured no problem.  The audio is clear both ways.  My WiFi router is in a room inside my house which is fairly close to the Ring unit...perhaps 12 feet or so from it.  When I first installed the Ring many of the videos it captured were showing varying amounts, up to half of the video displaying green.  What the cause of this was I have no idea.  But that problem vanished after a month or so, and again I have no idea why, I didn't change anything.  As far as the oft-reported issue of the motion detector detecting cars passing by on the street, I simply tinkered with the motion detector adjustments in the software and had no problem setting it satisfactorily,  If you set the detector range too far out it will indeed trigger on the vehicles passing in front of your house...simply cut back on the range until it doesn't.

I get packages delivered often and it usually starts recording as the delivery person is turning around after dropping off the package; there is no chance to see their face.

I am currently in the free 30 day trial, but will be paying the $30 annual fee for continued cloud recording. This was extremely easy to install with the provided equipment and tools in the box, including the screws. I have a stucco exterior to my house and I hard wired my Ring Doorbell to my mechanical ringer. Connecting the Ring to my Wifi was simple and took a total of about 2 minutes. Installing on the exterior wall took about 5 minutes. So in less than 10 minutes, I was up and running. The only thing I had to calibrate was the motion sensor settings. It was picking up everything from cars in the street to dogs passing by over 30 feet away. I turned the setting down to 5 feet in just the one quadrant that looks at my walkway and it is now perfect. No false readings. Only minor gripe I have is that I have to get the company to activate the Live View for some reason. Not sure why?","I love this doorbell. Should have bought one sooner!!!

As far as the whole ""cloud connected option"" is, it works exceptionally well in my situation. the router is no more than 15 ft away, and with a 100 Mbps upstream and downstream connection, everything looks crisp and cool for a device smaller than some peoples wallets. The fisheye effect is not as bad as I thought it would be. it captures a large viewing angle without distorting anything beond recognition. It may take a few calls before the quality reaches closer to a 720p resolution (it downsamples no matter how good a connection is, but its descent). No studders or lag in a live or cloud accessed video. I thought this would be more or less a childs toy when it comes to video quality, but im impressed.However, it does pick up large vehicles from the street as you can see in the video.

By the time I got the screws mostly in the wall, they were stripped but still not flushed with the bracket.  Shorter screws for solid wood would be a better option and not cost too much.  Secondly, I installed the bracket upside down the first time.  There is printed text taped on the brackets that let you know the right side up, but you have to remove the tape to access the screws.  Once you remove the text, there is no indication which side is up.  It would be better if there was an arrow molded into the plastic or something. So far the Ring works pretty good.  My voice comes through the ring pretty choppy using my phone and visitors have a hard time hearing me.  I hear them fine though.

According to a Ring support person I dealt with, the Ring doorbell needs to be within 20-25 ft of your wireless base station to work well - if it isn't close enough there may not be a strong enough signal which can cause the video on your phone to be jerky, break up, pixelate, etc. (I can attest to this.) Their ""solution"" is to place a wireless extender close to the installed location. Depending on your situation, using a wireless extender can cause significant latency (signal delay) between the doorbell and your phone; resulting in a noticeable lag (up to ten seconds or more) between the doorbell press and notification on the phone, delay in video/audio, etc.  (I can attest to this as well.)

I tried every support option available including factory reset, but the app will loop back on the wifi settings with no option to move forward.  I contacted ring support went thru same steps and they said to bring it to retailer. Since I bought it at Amazon (Amazon owns Ring...right?!) it gives me no option to return (after 30 days). Ring support was very adamant to replace unit.  They made me stay on the phone with Level 2 (?) for about 30 +min support to justify the return/replace.  After almost an hour on the phone, they finally decided to replace it.  This is definitely  not the service quality I expect from an Amazon company. Unfortunately, ring is my only option for true wireless so Im stuck using them.","After a couple of month of mediocre functionality, the ..."

We’ve now had it in the city for 3 months and realize it is the device itself. Lags when their is motion, if it even connects. We are hardwired and it still operates terrible, it does not consistently sense motion. Daytime pictures are so blurry there is no chance you’d be able to identify a stranger.  Nighttime.. well look at the photo attached. The photo is a night vision shot in a city, with street lights. I have a photo from that same time on my Pro and it is very clear. The Ring (Pro) has similar issues occasionally, but very seldom. In the long run save yourself the money and go right for the Pro. It does lag so I’m also considering going for an alternative brand all together, rather than sinking more money into this system.",Avoid it. Go Pro.

Items appear/feel to be of good quality. I hooked it up to my existing doorbell easily and quickly. Set it up with the Ring app as well as Amazons Alexa easily enough. Still tinkering with the motion zones, but it is working as I expected. Sometimes the live view does not connect so I have to go back in the app and then try again. And maybe its my surroundings but the video almost looks a little black and white rather than color. It’s not though. At this point the ring doorbell is exactly what I expected.

Unfortunately the Ring doorbell falls squarely into the latter. I actually bought two, one for my front door and the other for the back. I read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and decided these were the best option. I was wrong. Major disappointment. They constantly send notifications of movement even when the zone is set to 5 feet and the movement is across the street. Worse still is that the video quality is so bad you can't make out faces or license plates even if you know what it's supposed to be. If that isn't enough, the time it takes to connect to the live feed is so long it wouldn't matter if you did want to see what movement you're being notified of...and that's assuming it even connects...most of the time it times out and says it's having difficulty connecting to the camera! I strongly (STRONGLY) recommend anyone interested in these look elsewhere.",Do not buy these!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Apr-16,Amazon SuperReviewr,"I don't like that they immediately upsell you on the CLOUD storage. Meaning, if you don't buy their monthly plan, you won't be able to archive the video footage. You can't even download it. ALSO - it takes about 20-30 seconds from when someone rings to when it registers on my phone and I can view who's there. That's a LONG time to keep someone waiting without a response.  When I contacted support, they said it was most probably the distance between my router and the door bell, which is really no more than 25 feet. It's just through a thick door, I'm guessing. So it would have been nice if they'd made that clear in the marketing materials or gave you a WIFI booster in the package. If I had the chance to do it over again, I would not spend $200 on this. Technology just isn't there yet.  Needs to be instantaneous without the monthly subscription plan being forced in your face.","Lag in answering, no storage (without their upsell plan).

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Feb-16,MJC,"My neighbor recommended this audio/video device after our neighborhood had a break-in.  One of the issues was that persons were ringing doorbells to see who might not be home.  While my neighbor volunteered to install it, noting it was incredibly easy to replace the existing doorbell, I opted to have my electrician install it, along with some other ""smart"" devices in my home. My electrician had not seen this device and was very impressed.  The range of sensitivity for motion detection is startling.  I finally had to lessen the range to 10 feet (from 30) as cars driving by would activate the ring, and getting notified that you have activity at your front door at 1am can be, well, startling.  There is a feature in which you can turn off the notifications on a specific schedule, but, for me, that defeats the purpose.  I have been able to ""answer"" the door several times while away and the caller never knew the difference. And, yes, I answer the doorbell via the Ring App even when I am home.  I've been able to see delivery persons and so on.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a front-door or back-door camera/motion detection system.",Well worth your money; impressive and consistent performance.

I finally pulled the trigger and ordered it and have been very disappointed.  First, it is not very attractive.  I got the bronze color and it just looks dated and old.  I could live with that if it worked well.  It has problems though: 1.  The video is very choppy and you really can't talk to anyone because the delays make it impossible.  The voices do not come through smoothly. 2.  The battery life is about a week if you have any kind of activity.  Who wants to charge a doorbell along with the other 10 items I already have to charge. 3.  Currently my device will no longer sync with my WiFi at all and the device is dead. This was a very expensive doorbell that should have worked better for all of the hype.  For the record, I am fairly technical and have a lot of connected devices in my home, so I do not believe it is user error. I hope they can make this device work better because the idea is very cool.  Will likely test out the August doorbell when it is ready.  I have the August lock and it works very well.",Great idea that falls short in reality

Since I work from home and these entrepreneurs are very persistent once they see my car out front, I wanted a way to speak to them without having to waste time. I also like the idea of being able to see anyone trying to get into my back gate when I am not home. Unfortunately, I have an issue with the motion detector: the house is set back 35 ft or so from the road, but my yard is basically a small hill, so cars driving by will trip the motion sensor no matter how close I set the sensor to scan unless I set it to only scan a 5 ft radius. BUT, within a 5 foot radius, it does not pick up motion at my door until the person is basically through the door, and because of the delay in turning the camera on, I rarely ever get faces or see more than the delivery guy's back (not helpful if, say, someone is stealing a package). Additionally, it would not start recording anyone entering my backyard until they were already through the gate.

The functionality is poor. It records as it should, that is good.  It alerts when you want it to. The problem though is it always records whenever it is activated, even if you are going in and out all day.  May not seem like much of a problem, but then you have to delete the recordings.  How hard can that be?  It takes a finger swipe to delete and then another finger touch to tell it that yes, after the finger swipe, I really want to delete this video.  If I go get the mail, a recording for going out the door, another for coming in the door.  And so on.  This gets annoying after a few days of doing this.  There is a scheduling set-up and you think you can set times to not record if you are going to be in and out, but that only disables the alert.  It still records.  I contacted Ring tech support, they say there is something in the works so you can do batch deletes, but they could not tell me how long that would take. If you go to work in the morning, come home in the evening and never go outside, maybe it will work for you. But if you have kids or are retired, you will quickly become annoyed at all the finger swipes you need to do to keep your device cleared.  I want something that works for me, not something that I have to work at to keep it cleared.",The idea of this doorbell is great.  The functionality is poor!  Read on......

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,21-Mar-19,Bruce D,"This product has several annoying and significant flaws. Firstly, if you don’t have power connected to the doorbell, then I do not recommend buying. My situation is for a battery-only doorbell, and the battery on the Ring barely lasts three weeks. I am now doing my third recharge - hopefully the battery will refresh and last longer. Secondly, you cannot turn off the motion detection feature. You can stop the annoying alerts, but your video triggers with every entry and exit from your front door. Your video library builds up with footage of many front door exits to check the mail, walk the dog and go to work... etc. Good for the brand owner who wants to sell you cloud storage space but useless for the product owner. Because the battery runs down so very quickly quickly and the video captures are so very many, you need to very regularly check the product health, charge the battery and delete all the crap videos that are building up. This is a high maintenance product. Do not think it is a “set and forget”. I’m giving it one more try but suspect I’ll be going back to my non-video doorbell.",Think twice - this is not a set and forget device

At one point they said they were going to send me a new doorbell but as always they lied and never sent it.  I’ve had damage done to my house 4 times and conveniently it never records when it’s suppose too.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Sep-15,James P. Jaster,"I really like the Ring. The audio on the original one received from Amazon did not work. I received timely and excellent email technical support (Jesus) which resulted in an exchange for the malfunctioning unit. Network configuration and setup was straightforward with understandable instructions. Some frustration set in during mounting on stucco. Tightening the base screws distorted  the base as it conformed to the non-flat wall causing the Ring main unit to not seat well. It took awhile for me to figure out that I had to loosen the screws so as not to distort the base. Also, the bottom security screws need to be backed almost completely out to properly seat the mounting lugs. More time to find that it was better to remove them completely, then reinstall after the Ring was securely attached to the base. Operation is not perfect, but acceptable with hopes of improvements down the line. The motion recording delay as reported by other reviewers is a problem. The FedEx person leaving a package will trigger, but they are often long gone by the time the video is recorded. I hope it is addressed in the future. I expected my door chime to work, but it does not. I need to spend some time and see if this is the Ring's fault, or mine. Overall, I'm happy with the Ring. This is a lot of technology for little money. The company has a great attitude and I fully expect improvements in the future.","Not perfect, but I like it."

Not even that we just didn't have the button, the wiring that went to the doorbell had been ripped out at some point and we would need to knock down a wall to rewire it.  Well, that sucks and isn't going to happen.  So I reviewed the options on the market and went with the Ring.  We like it!  We got it with the chime, and the chime works really well to let us know if our toddler opens the door, which thankfully she's only done once.  The ONLY bummer is the battery doesn't last long.  It's really meant to be triggered two or three times a day.  We have a kid.  We have a dog.  We have jobs.  We have deliveries.  It goes off more like 5-10 times a day.  We did reduce the alerts and the sensor sensitivity and we still don't get a month out of the battery.  I contacted Ring and told them I'm not running a bordello, my Ring isn't getting THAT much action, but I just got a response that we use it a lot and expect to charge it more.  Given our other option is to have no doorbell I'll just charge it more often. It came with a charger cable but nothing to plug it into, so make sure you have a USB port that you can use.

I've missed several deliveries at this point and complained to Ring but they haven't fixed the issue in over a year... it actually makes this thing kinda worthless when you don't know it's not working... you can go into the app and check it of course but really does anyone need to babysit their doorbell to make sure it works? OLD REVIEW Works well overall, Looks great.  Overall, pretty happy so far.... but it has a few drawbacks... 1) our front door is fairly close to the street. the smallest motion Zone range is STILL too large. the Ring picks up passing cars all the time instead of anyone on our walkway or at our door. I would still really like to use the motion feature but.... 2) because our motion feature reacts so often, the battery on the Ring drained in less than a MONTH… which is quite a lot less than the 6 months to a year that's advertised so I'll be turning off motion all together. 3) the mounting plate is really hard to get seated… the rubber backing on the device looks like it’s a seal that’s supposed to stay on the device, however we were only able to get the mount to install correctly after removing that rubber seal…. mentioning that in the instructions would be helpful… the Ring actually fell off the mount onto the ground when we thought we had it secured… took a bit of work to figure it out. 4) the ability to pick different door chime sounds would be great.  You're stuck with the factory ring. 5) The charge port is only accessible if you remove the Ring while charging it… 6) the lag time between the doorbell and the app is a bit long— of course I’m sure that depends on LTE and wifi signals…",Has a major flaw... does not alert you when it goes offline.

I had mine set for 5-10 feet motion zone (the lowest) and it still picks up cars and movement on the street that's about 100 ft away. 3.  Poor screw quality that strips EXTREMELY easy so do NOT use a power drill.  Use the screw driver they provide and hand tighten and loosen carefully.  My does not need recharged yet but I'm dreading getting the screw out because I stripped it the first day.  I hope my Grabit drill set works!!! 4.  Missed alert recording is really cool.  So if you have it set for motion and you miss the alert at the door, you can go back and watch the video later.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Feb-18,d_hug,"This thing is pretty worthless. It takes forever for the app to open when you receive a notification of motion or someone is at your door. By the time it’s open the person is walking away or getting impatient. Sometimes it says it can’t connect to it, even though it is hard wired and WiFi is strong with super fast internet speeds. It will sometimes not wake up when someone approaches the door unless they push the button. Also, it only records in 30 second clips, even if someone is still on the porch making motion. It should record until the person leaves. I have no idea what was said or done after the 30 seconds. Not really worth having, IMO. Will try selling this and installing something else. Unless they fix these issues, save your money and buy something else.",Takes too long for app to open & clips are too short

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Feb-18,Jesus Garcia,I'm very satisfied with the doorbell. The motion detection works great. Sometimes someone rings the doorbell and I won't get the notification until way after when it's too late. But that is rarely a problem. Not sure if its due to my internet connection.  I did end up buying a router to use as an access point since the modem is only  about 20 feet away from the location where I installed the doorbell but the wifi signal wasn't good since the video would be choppy. I literally placed the router behind the wall where the doorbell is located. And the video quality did improve so wherever you install it just make sure the modem isn't very far. Also I doubt the battery will last very long. I installed it on 2/1/18 and today is 2/12/18 and the battery indicator states 69%. I have it set on regular notifications and the motion detection to the lowest setting. I think I am going to end up subscribing the the cloud service since it's the only way to record footage and be able to access it later. Something useful in the event it ever gets stolen. Since Ring has the protection policy if it gets stolen they'll replace it free of charge. Of course they reserve the right to not replace it if they fell it's fraudulent in any way. It's more of a courtesy then obligation. So if I have it on video I figured it's more evidence of the actual theft. Because if you don't subscribe you can only see the live video feed at that moment when motion is detected or someone rings the doorbell but if for whatever reason you don't answer you can't go back and see who it was.,I'm very satisfied with the doorbell

It's still my best option but it's frustrating that it only picks up motion in the afternoon and evening. The camera faces north, and in the mornings when the sun is to the east, it will not detect anything, including large vehicles that come up the drive from the north and pass the east side of the house. It has nothing to do with the connection to the internet, and everything to do with the camera and the motion detection. Also, the night vision is poor and limited. So if you have slower internet and your options are limited, this isn't the worst.

Wagner,"First, Ring is a great product. Setup is very simple (assuming you have a good-to-great home wifi setup) and quick. The doorbell unit  and the mounting bracket are well-engineered and well-constructed. Other than an early need to 'reconnect' the device to wifi (requiring that the unit be dismounted and remounted) it has worked continuously since installation. Overall, we are happy with the device and the supporting app and infrastructure. The challenges have all been around the motion sensing aspect of ring. First of all, I understand a little of the science of infrared motion detection and I know that it will always be 'quirky'. It doesn't 'see' the mailman right there on the porch because he is all bundled up with scarf and gloves but it 'sees' garbage trucks and school buses way out on the street because they contain masses of warm organic matter. Be prepared for spurious motion alerts. Mounting the Ring at normal doorbell height give a waist-level view of visitors which is a little weird. Consider moving the unit a little higher than a standard doorbell. I'd be interested in a feature that allowed the Ring to be mounted at eye-level with a extension/auxiliary button at waist-level. I probably have an above-average wifi router/internet connection in my house. If yours is old or minimal you might need to consider an update and remember that if wifi/internet is down, so is Ring.

Purchased on Feb 7th and had a real use for it really this monday, after I left at 11.30 a package out of my door for the previous owners of my place, which disappeared at the next recording 12.50 without any recording in the middle. Ring support told me that the camera SLEEPS on its own in Frequency: standard mode to save battery if the movement alert is not answered in the phone, so ""most likely"" it was asleep during that time and it didn't pick up who stole the packages. The solution was to set the alert to Frequency:Frequent mode, and proceeds to tell me of EVERY single car that goes through my street, yet... I only know my mailwoman's back, not her face, because it starts recording roughly 5 to 6 seconds after it detects the motion, and for a hardcoded 30 some seconds.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Oct-16,Walt,"I bought the Ring doorbell disregarding many negative reviews. I’m beginning to wish I hadn’t. Though there are many attractive features about the product, and I suspect that if it were working right, I’d love it, I haven’t been able to get it working right. First problem: cross-talk. Installation was easy, but on first testing, the doorbell to cell phone connection was unclear. Video was a bit blurred and it was impossible to understand the speaker on the other end. Definitely the router was too far away, so I bought a wifi repeater (another $40), which helped a lot.  Many people seem to have this problem, and you should be aware that a solid connection with the router appears to be necessary. So now video is clear but very the audio is almost unintelligible. The problem is that there is a slight delay when talking and the microphone on the receiving end picks up the voice and sends it back to the original unit. Thus if you are talking into the doorbell unit, what you say is picked up by the cell phone and sent back to the doorbell. It’s as though both people are speaking at the same time, even though it’s actually just the person at the door talking. If you turn off the microphone at the cell phone while the doorbell person is speaking, you can hear just fine. But to then talk to the doorbell, you have to turn the microphone back on -- and turn off the speaker so you don’t hear back your own voice coming back from the front door. When one person is talking, the microphone on the other side should be squelched to prevent this from happening. Second problem: Ring support. I sent an email to Ring requesting help on updating firmware. There are instructions on how to get the firmware updated, but it doesn’t work when I follow them, so I asked for help. I received an automatic return email acknowledging my inquiry and asking for 24 hours to respond but assuring me of the strong desire of Ring to show me how great their support is. Three days later, I sent another email asking for attention to my first email. Another three days later I’ve heard nothing. Ok. So it seems like if it worked it would be great. But it doesn’t work as it should, and I don’t know what to do about it, and Ring doesn’t seem to care.",It Almost Works

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Apr-18,Ariel Jones,I wanted to wait several days after install and trying it out before writing my review. I’ve now had my Ring Doorbell installed for 10 days and I couldn’t be more satisfied. Let me start off by saying that I didn’t need it to serve as a security cam or device because I already have a security system and camera installed. My main purpose for the ring was to usu the video doorbell function and 2 way intercom. The install was fairly simple. There were several videos online in case I got stuck along the way. The internal battery was pre charged at 58% upon delivery so I charged it to full capacity which took a couple of hours. I planned on installing via hardwiring replacing my existing doorbell. I wanted it fully charged in case that didn’t work out since we have an older home and sometimes it can be tricky. The hardwiring went perfect. No issues. The intercom and video functioned perfectly! I had previously purchased the iseeBell system and the customer service was non existent and the sound never worked. So this was a refreshingly simple process compared to the iseeBell experience. Another plus are the neighborhood alerts. We get alerts from other neighbors giving you a heads up of any breaking or suspicious people knocking on doors. It feels like the Ring Doorbell comes with its own neighborhood watch. I love that. The cloud subscription does come with a trial but as I mentioned earlier we already have outdoor cameras recording so I don’t think it’s something I’ll subscribe too. Overall I am really pleased with the doorbell & customer service I am definitely going to be purchasing more of the other cameras for install in my backyard. I’ve attached a pic from the ring doorbell of the delivery we received earlier this morning.,Install was simple and the resolution is great!

Did some searching online and found that Ring ONLY works on 2.4 GHz and router MUST be set to channel 1 thru 11. Channel 11 seems to be preferred. Had to manually program my ASUS to channel 11 (after a firmware update on my router to allow channel changes). Sooo.....be sure your router is set to channel 11.

The restriction to use only their servers with associated fees in this day and age is inexcusable. Keep that as an option but not ""that or nothing."" When Ring corrects that issue I will give 5 stars. **UPDATE** Ring has recently created a live view function. This is a much needed feature and definitely a step in the right direction.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Jul-16,Josh K,"CONS: 1. Occasionally misses a ring. I even bought the extra chime product in case it was my phone's audio causing it. Still not 100%. Called support and they said it was probably the motion-detection, or that it was in sleep but it's not a fixable issue. Unless a firmware update fixes it, it will always miss a ring occasionally. 2. To charge it you have to remove it and plug it in like a phone, so you are without a doorbell and its security abilities. 3. I got a low battery alert by email which is good but I figured I'd have more than like 8 hours to get to it. When you get that alert you have to get right on it. 4. This is the worst part. The subscription is a joke. They advertise that with the subscription that you can save your videos for up to 60 days. Who needs to save it for 60 days!? I just want to be able to see who was at my door 10 minutes ago when I was in the shower but you have to pay a $30 a year subscription JUST to do that. I have to pay for a feature of 60 day storage that I do not want just to see someone who was at the door 2 minutes ago. Please make a feature that offers like 10 days of storage for like $15 a year. It's definitely possible and should be given as an option. 5. Motion detection alerts had to be turned off because no amount of adjusting kept it from notifying me when a car went by even though my house sits back about 35 feet from the street. 6. If you hear a noise at your door and decide to use the app to see a live view of what's happening it takes 15-40 seconds very often to connect. I have a brand new top of the line router, I work on networks as a part of my living, so it's nothing wrong with my setup. 8. I don't believe there's a way to switch the chime to something else. You should have a selection built into the doorbell as well as be able to create a custom sound, and for a product that claims to be so great, it's very surprising that it's not possible.

Pro:  Decent quality and user interface is good. Cons:  Without monthly fee, Ring blocks access to videos or pictures and only allows access to live feed.  When notified by motion sensor, access to live feed is too slow and lags out causing you to go through the app which prompts you to buy their subscription. Many products have the ability to access video from several days with cloud storage or local backup and with optional membership, allows access to older recordings.  Ring needs to change this policy to stay competitive.  This has been very frustrating and completely loses security feature. I will be purchasing another product and it will have paid for itself within a year or so. Update* Have purchased a MECO doorbell with expandable memory without a monthly fee.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Aug-19,Jason W,"I purchased a new Ring Doorbell in July 2019 to replace one that I bought in 2016, which has been having sporadic audio problems. Unfortunately, the video quality of the new 2019 Ring Doorbell is far inferior to the older 2016 Ring model. After installing the new device, I immediately noticed reduced quality and blurry, out of focus image. To make a good comparison, I placed the batter-operated 2016 Ring directly on top of the hard-wired 2019 Ring and pressed the doorbells simultaneously. The attached photos speak for themselves--the quality of the 2016 Ring video is far crisper than the 2019 Ring video. I don't know if Ring has substituted the optics with lower quality parts, or if this is a hardware problem, but regardless of the cause, the result is sub-standard video in the new 2019 Ring Doorbell. I also know this was not an isolated, defective device because I received and then returned one 2019 Ring Doorbell because its video quality was, incredibly, even worse that what is shown in the photo. The blurry attached photo is my ""improved"" replacement 2019 Ring Doorbell. Unfortunately, this means I will have to go back to my older 2016 Ring Doorbell, because even with the audio problems at least I can clearly see who is at my door.",Disappointing - Ring Doorbell from 2016 has better video quality

My internet provider tells me it’s ring; ring says it’s my IP. The issue at hand is I need to somehow force the front bell to connect to the 2.4 signal. I tried standing in every part of my .75 acre lot (I thought furthest away would do the trick) as well as right next to my modem and nothing.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Jul-17,Akashagarbha,"The ring is a clunky box of a device that is overpriced for what it is IMO. It's basically a cloud-connected video camera and ""doorbell."" It follows in the footsteps of Boze, Apple, and Beats that sell shiny gadgets that are light on functionality. The difference being that those other examples have elegant design features that set them above other products in their class. The Ring doorbell is not an innovator in that area, with it's unimaginative form factor. It doesn't make up for this in any way through other functionality. One of the selling points of Ring is that ostensibly you're making your home more secure with a surveillance system at the front door (not a favored entry point for criminals though). It is relatively easy to setup, but it requires some knowhow for installation. For example, you'll want a 5V power supply (hopefully the one you used with your previous doorbell) because otherwise you're going to be removing the doorbell and charging every few once in awhile. You also have to do a little dance with Wifi networks to get it to connect. Then once you are connected you can opt in for their upselling of cloud storage for your events, but there's no way to record this separately. There's no DVR integration or anything like that because they want your pennies on the storage subscription of course. it's a little greedy. Once setup, the device is OK. My main gripe is that after 4 weeks, my device just went offline. The instructions for accessing the device require you to remove it, which is a huge giant hassle. Also, how is this type of thing secure when it's not reliable? The Ring doorbell indicates it can't connect to Wifi. That's strange because every other device I use is going along just fine on Wifi. Ok, so I reset the Wifi modem and followed the instructions to reconnect my Ring device (by unscrewing it and pressing a button on the back of the device--yeah, real elegant). It now works, except when it suddenly doesn't again. So now I am away from the doorbell, but I can't see who's coming up to it. You've failed your purpose Ring. This is not even Five 9s much less six.",How can something be secure if it's unreliable?

However quick 5 hours to charge. Easy to take down and re hang for charging. Informative for the neighborhood thread/chat. We have 2 for our doors that dont have a hardwire doorbell so it's covered access all over. Front door is hardwired to our doorbell so we never need to charge that one. The charge lasts anywhere from 1 to 2 months depending on road. I suggest the chime extender for access to Wi-Fi for further cameras,Great product.

The camera takes about 1 1/2 to 2 seconds to come online, after triggered by the sensor, so whenever someone passes by the corridor in front of our door, the camera catches their backs as they walk away.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,8-Dec-15,Dennis Plaza,"I installed my Ring Doorbell 3 weeks ago.  First of all it comes with the tools you'll need to install it on almost any surface.  It even has a level and a bit for drilling into masonry.  I wired my Ring to the wires of my old doorbell.  Ring provides helpful video sites that clearly show step by step directions.  It really was simple.  Ring works with or without electrical connections, but if you can wire it, the built in battery stays charged.  If you can't connect it to existing wiring, Ring comes with a USB cord so you can easily remove  Ring from it's mount, plug it into an outlet, and then use it's special tool to remount it.  I was amazed to use the Ring and witness for myself the exceptional quality of the fisheye lense.  The view covers most of my yard and extends to across the street, which is surprising for such a tiny lense.  Images are clear and facial features are best when a person comes up to my door and rings the Ring. I can see and hear everything on my iPhone.  Conversing in real time with people at my door is clear and without delays.  I was recently 300 miles from home and spoke to my son when he rang my door.  We were both amazed at the sound quality which was free of any detectable lag time.  I really like being able to see and hear what's going on at my front door and front yard, especially when I'm not home.  I originally thought the Ring was a bit pricy, but purchased it base on its positive reviews.  After seeing and experiencing the overall quality of this product, I found it to be worth every penny.  Just the peace of mind it provides, not to mention my family's personal safety, makes it a product worthy of your consideration.",Ring Surpassed My Expectations.

Installation was pretty straight forward. Battery life sucks. Motion detector goes off all the time even set on lowest setting. What I really hate is that it doesn't ring in the house. On the phone yes but I'm not always by my phone so I don't hear it. What I hate even more is having to buy a wall outlet chime. More money out the door!  This should of been included!,It's ok.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Nov-15,Yannick,"Ring is quite impressive in its ability to pick up people that don't even use the doorbell. This is most impressive considering Ring is battery powered and hit by the elements. Mine gets sun on it in the morning, also it's under an eave so it doesn't get directly rained on, and everything works great. Depending on the settings it does pick up a few larger trucks, while missing some people when it's cold and rainy, but the button works great and rings my phone and Chime just fine! Not only is it a video doorbell that you can answer anywhere with your phone it also stores video of your people who come to the door. I can answer the doorbell even if the visitor just knocks as it as motion sensing built in. I can see when the postman drops off mail. And for $3 a month all the video it records is saved online for 6 months.

The Ring unit indicated that is connected to my Wi-Fi, but no video feed. I check the trouble shooting and it takes me to a link of the install video- over and over again.

Installation was easy, video is clear, and alerts are fairly quick.  I did order and install a 20º angle adapter, since my existing doorbell was near two adjoining walls. The only negative I have after running several tests is the dynamic range of the camera.  My porch is covered and therefore in shade.  Fortunately the camera is automatically setting exposure for the shaded porch fairly well, but everything just off the porch is just washed-out-white.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Sep-15,pharoahogc,"Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HToHe0z74MM Is any doorbell actually worth $200.00, well short answer is yes definitely! but I'll you why in long answer. From the The company “Ring” is this new  WIFI enabled smart doorbell, its a gorgeous looking piece of tech, and comes in 4 colors(Satin Nickel, Venetian Bronze, Antique Brass, and Polished Brass) to match any style home, I chose the Antique Brass,  and I am loving it. The size of the device is not to big at all, it can easily fit in your hand. And installation is a no brainer even if your not a handy person, Ring includes everything you need to place this on any door, brick or concrete area. and they also include a charging cable, you may be thinking why a charging cable well that is because this is the world's first batter operated “smart doorbell” and I know you may be thinking well how often do i have to charge this thing, well the good answer is once every year, just one time every year that's what ring is saying, and I got to say i believe them, I've had my unit now for some weeks and it still says it is 100% on the ring app. also you can wire it up from your existing doorbell also and not use the battery. Installation was super easy and guided once you installed the “ring” app on your android or apple device. Now let's talk about what makes this doorbell so special. As you can tell by looking there are 2 things to take notice here, the camera lens and the button. The camera is an HD sensor with clear video and audio so you have no problem seeing what's going on at your door. there's also a 2 way mic on the device so you can talk to the person outside (think of an intercom) with a camera.the button when pressed gives an Immediate sound to the ring and also to your phone. On the phone you can see who's at your door and accept or deny the the alert. If you accept you can immediately start talking to the person outside while seeing them. This is a really great feature if you're not home as burglars usually ring the doorbell first and see if anyone is home,. Also you can set up alerts on your phone to activate as soon as the ring senses motion, and the great thing about it is you can adjust the sensitivity sensors from 3ft to 30 ft. also, when it senses motion it automatically starts recording only ( if you have the 30.00 annual cloud storage fee) if not it will just notify you, so I definitely think the fee is worth it due to the fact that you can check back on any video from the past 6 months. Overall I have to say for just the piece of mind of having a smart doorbell which also acts as a security cam makes the ring doorbell absolutely worth it and a welcomed extension to your home. with this device you're always home","(Video Review) Great Product, with security bonus."

After about a month it stopped detecting motion. when I went to the live view it just said “activating device” but said it was still connected To my phone. I had JUST purchased their protection plan 2 days before this happened to save all motion (which it will not do after 30 days without the plan!!!) so I call and they send me a new one. I set up the new one AND........ same thing it says updating and I can’t view the live view and it does not detect motion. So I call once again the girl was extremely nice and said it was because both devices are not updating and they are both “refurbished” (Which was news to me)! So she asked me to contact amazon to send a new one. Amazon will only send a return label and refund. So now I have no ring device and paid for a year of data to save motion videos I will never see.,Stopped working after a month.

I had been researching video doorbells for a while, and before Christmas our neighbor had his Amazon order stolen off of his porch, so we decided to finally purchase one.  I love being able to see when packages are delivered, people approach our house, and generally see what is happening outside our home when we're not there.  I also like that my husband's phone can also be linked to the Ring and if I'm unable to answer a motion or ring, he can as well.  We're also able to see/talk at the same time from our separate phones (it doesn't kick one person out if the other answers). What made us chose Ring over the other video doorbells was the ease of use, as well as the overall cost.  While you have to pay for the Cloud video recording ($30/year), and it is a higher upfront cost, it's cheaper in the long run. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we live close to the street (a semi-main road to a high school) and while a lot of large vehicles like buses set off the motion sensor, sometimes the mailman is already walking back to the street by the time Ring picks up his motion.",Great investment for piece of mind!

It can be power by either a battery or get wired to the low voltage wiring for the existing doorbell.  I can not testify to the how long the battery last, but I have had it up for a month and is still working fine.  The associated app tells you about the level of the batter amongst other things.  It has served well as a both a security camera and a door bell especially with the extended chime that is sold separately.  Without the extended chime, you may not hear the bell from outside, but it does ring on your phone once you have the app installed.  In regards to the app, it does allow multiple people to use it and receive the alert that someone is at the door. The only thing I do not like thus far is the monthly fee for the cloud service that is needed to store video.  It is not a substantial amount at $3.00 a month, but with all the cloud services we consumers already have, there should be a way to integrate that into our existing cloud services.  I understand it is a business model, but perhaps they can provide that capability at a price point so we can set it up to connect to our own cloud services.

This needs fixed before I would ever recommend buying another Ring product.",Motion sensing is terrible. Would not recommend. Regret this purchase.

I have done that so many times also with no help.  The last person I talked to said that I have to factory reset my phone, now why would I have to do that every time this thing does not work.  I mean come on that is a lot of things I will lose to get a product to work.  Also why would it happen on both of our phones?

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Feb-19,Eon Springer,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my parents year before last (2017) and by August the unit had stopped working completely, would not charge reset or turn on.  Bricked.  Called them and let them know about it but never processed the return until this Jan 2019 (pregnant wife and baby born and all the usual things that take priority in life).  They were nice enough to process the return even though it was a few months after the 1 year warranty had expired because we had notified them prior that the device wasn't working.  Send me a new unit that didn't work either.  Wouldn't charge or setup the wifi or do anything really.  An hour with tech support and no resolution.  Asked for an upgrade to a Pro or Ring 2 with no luck for my time and effort of dealing with 2 broken units.  They wouldn't agree so I'll be accepting my 3rd ring in a few days when they ship it.  If this one works I may upgrade this review to 3 stars.  In the meantime I'd go with a Nest or SkyBell, anything but a ring.  Maybe the 2 or Pro are built better and have less issues, but this is a bit ridiculous that these things can't even make it to the 1 year warranty.  Stay away or give them your money at your own peril. Eon Springer",2 broken units in under a year
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,11-Dec-15,twodogs,"Just installed the Ring today. Initial observations... The wifi set up took more time than it should have; it took 4 times pushing the button on the back to get my phone to see the wifi signal. Installation should be easy but it wasn't for me.  I pre-drilled all the holes and the first 3 screws I put in all broke. I mounted on wood and drilled the holes just as deep as the screws.  I had to use vice grips to remove the broken screws without heads then use my own screws.  Not a big deal but a pain in the a#%.  For $200 I would expect screws that don't break.  Suggestion for inventor Jamie:  please spend a couple cents for better quality screws. I didn't connect to my existing doorbell wires as they are powered so I am using the battery that came with the unit.  The app shows battery level (which is great) but my brand new ring out of the box for no more than an hour is showing only 60% battery life.  Again, not a big deal but if it is new why isn't it showing 90%+? Five stars if not for the wifi issue, broken screws and almost half dead battery. Now on to the good stuff... The interface is nicely designed and set up beyond the wifi issue was super easy. Once installed you're a couple settings away from having this thing live! It is so easy I thought I was missing some steps. The video quality is incredible. Will update the review with comments on how the motion sensor is working but straight away it was perfect. Nice job Ring! **Update Dec 29. After a couple weeks of use there are two issues. 1.  Motion sensor is only triggering recording when person is walking away.  Think I saw this in some other comments.  Kind of a problem when you can only see the back of the person who was at your door. 2.  Most of the time (prob 90%) when I receive a notification that someone is at the door the I never see a video feed - only a spinning circle.",close to great **updated

The Ring said I could hook up to existing doorbell wiring and assumed it would charge the battery but it did not.  I hoped it would ring the existing internal doorbell system but it will not.  The motion sensor is sporadic as far as seeing motion.  I walk on the porch and sometimes it alerts and sometimes not.  I had a cheaper NightOwl video doorbell I was replacing which did better at all the above and did not require a paid subscription to view video history (had an internal SD card).

I normally don't post something with a recommendation unless it is literally ""life changing"" The video I am sharing is my wife ringing the doorbell and me at our store.

The point being the person at your door does not know where you are.  It works through your Wifi so there is no cost other than $3 a month or $30 for the year if you choose to store your video on a cloud (which I did).  They say that most burglars ring the bell first to see if anyone is home and in researching prior to buying this, most burglars see the ring doorbell and don't even ring it because they know they are being video taped.

The problem I had was every time I mounted it to my house it would stop working.  I had to then delete it from my account and then re-add it back.  I tried switching the wires and I tried the resistor.  Neither worked.  It does take a bit of time before it calls you when it detects movement or when somebody presses the button.  I called for tech support and was in hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  It did not give me a length of time I would be waiting but would let me leave a message for a call back in 24 hours.  That kind of tech support is not going to do it for me.  Sorry Ring but this is going back.,Not ready for prime time.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Jun-16,EvanS,"This has exceeded my admittedly low expectations. I really didn't know what to expect but have been pleasantly surprised by Ring's performance. The device is unobtrusive and easy to install, and the battery is still at 50% after 6 months of normal use. I have subscribed to the annual in order to be able to save videos, which has already come in handy. Well worth the minor annual fee. Make sure you have a good wifi signal at the doorbell location though. Marginal wifi will result in missed ring and motion notification. A cheap wifi extender solved my distance issues here. Video is crisp and clear, voice sound is easily good enough. As for motion sensitivity, my house presents a demanding situation where the doorbell is mounted perpendicular to the walkway and the visible area of the walkway is very short. So many times if someone just walks up to drop a delivery and walk away, I may only get their back on the live video. But the saved video (viewable in a few moments) usually catches the visitor's face. Ring continues to develop and I have found that IFTTT integration is very useful, as i have my entryway lights come on when the doorbell is pressed and my audio gets muted. For anyone that's looking for additional security and/or convenience I'd recommend Ring everyday. And continuing development looks to make the product better as time goes on.",The device is unobtrusive and easy to install

We have adjusted the motion sensitivity several times but some cars on the street (200 ft away) still trigger the alert.  Be aware the vendor is seeking the monthly fee.

I first had a problem with the first device I received and I was sent a replacement within 1 week.  The package that came with the Ring box, had all of the tools needed to install it except for a drill. It went up real easy and the instruction and video were great to help out.  I can see who is outside my door and who is nearby. I set the device for a 180 deg. view and at least 25 ft. out.  I get instant notification and I get to see and talk to whoever is outside.  The only draw back is that I can't delete and previous videos. Also after 30 days you have to pay for Cloud service at $30/year. If you have any videos on it, the Ring cloud server will not let you see any previous video. You must pay the ransom! I talked to a customer service rep and they said that the reason for the $30 cloud fee was due to their lowering the price of Ring so they can recoup their money.

I have to use the battery option, cannot hard wire it.  I live in Minnesota and the winters can be cold.

It's fine in the summer, but will probably look at other options. Update:  Waste of money.  It loses connection to the internet at least once per week.  The health check says it's online and working but it isn't and doesn't.  It does not re-establish connection on its own so I have to go through the setup each time.

The problems are that the motion only gets people as they are leaving and you never see their faces unless they ring the bell. The bigger problem is when I get a ring or motion alert it takes so long for the app to connect to the camera that the motion is gone. Whats worse is that you can not view the recorded motion for a minute or two after the motion and by then it is too late. The few times I have tried to talk to someone when I was not home they could not understand anything I was saying.

What I do like is what this technology will become...but it's not there yet, IMO. Nearly every time I receive a motion detection or ring signal, it takes too long to log in and wait for a video connection. I have the fastest Wi-Fi connection available.  The image quality is good enough. BUT most times, instead of seeing someone in front of the Ring, I see a vehicle or person walking away (the detection and recording process is delayed). I also don't like the Admin setting's limitations for my wife and I.  She is the Administrator, which means I can't delete the ever growing video feeds. Shouldn't require two paying accounts, either, to view iCloud events...that's an extra $72.00 per year for dual monitoring capability. It would be preferred if connectivity could include your television, tablet or other commonly on and used device.  Right now, you're limited to viewing the app through your mobile phone or (I think) an iPad. You can only view past events, not live, unless motion is detected or someone pushes the button.

The video feature leaves much to be desired. Although the picture is very good, sometimes it takes quite a while for it to even come up on the phone screen. It's completely fuzzy at first and also freezes but I wonder if that could just be our internet connection. Not sure how to fix that but it sure would be nice! Also, we get notified the battery is low but we hard wired it into the old doorbell so not sure why.

The setup for the Ring Video Doorbell is simple and the installation is easy if you follow the instructions.  We used the Cloud free service for a month and then purchased the annual product at $30.  I also bought the chime and installed it in the house and, like the video doorbell, is easy to setup and install.  My only issue with the Ring is the motion detection function.  I have tried many settings (done on your phone) but still can not get the motion alerts to not ""see"" the large trucks that travel up and down the street (trash trucks, UPS, etc.).  The system works on heat registering so the larger vehicles leave a bigger heat register and trigger the motion alerts.  I understand that they are working on this and when it comes through, I would gladly give the product a five star rating.  Even with that misgiving, I would highly recommend this product because of its quality and the safety that it provides.

It does what it says it will do. It's been helpful while we've been away in keeping track of our dog sitter. It's also helped with deliveries as Fedex and UPS don't seem to want to ring the doorbell anymore (I suspect they know what the Ring Doorbell is and know I'll know they were here). It can be slow between someone being on the porch and my phone informing me they are there. However, it hasn't been too bad. Most of the time, I can get to the door before I would be able to haul out my phone, load the app, and get it going. But, it is a nice security device and I feel more comfortable knowing that I have it. One issue to consider: if power goes out at the house and your internet connection/wi-fi isn't connected to a battery backup, the Doorbell is useless. How do I know?

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Jul-16,Jonathan D.,"This is a good product that could have been great. I suspect that software tweaks could resolve the issues, but until they are resolved I can't recommend this product enthusiastically. 1) The motion sensor is way too sensitive. Even after dialing it back the detection radius to 7 or 8', it still picks up large cars or trucks that drive past the house from roughly 80' away. 2) The motion sensor issue cause the battery to drain much faster. Battery life is still acceptable, but nowhere near what they've advertised. 3) Motion sensing to way too slow. As numerous others have said, by the time it detects motion and starts recording... It's usually too late. 4) The camera takes a few seconds to adjust to the current lighting conditions. The front of my house gets a lot of sunlight during the day so most of my daytime videos start completely white and slowly become viewable over the course of 2 to 5 seconds. As a doorbell alone, I'd give this product 5 stars without a second thought. But one of the main reasons bought it was the motion sensor. I wanted to see when deliveries were made and when my kids got home from school. As it stands, most of my notifications are cars going by. When I get a delivery, it's a video of the person walking away. As for the kids, the video usually starts just in time to catch the screen door closing after they've already entered the house. That's ""if"" I get a video at all. I was getting so many false positives that I set the ""smart alert"" setting to ""Light"" (receive fewer alerts). Of course, I have to add to the chorus of those who want additional functionality. The ability to activate the camera remotely would be nice, as would integration with various smart home systems. And now that they've made a solar panel to trickle charge their standalone camera, it would be nice if they made a solar panel for the doorbell too.","Great doorbell, terrible motion sensor."

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Dec-16,MRE,"In fairness, here is an update to my original review below: we had to order a new cable modem recently (thanks to badgering from my cable company about the old one being too slow and not supported anymore), and the faster speed of the modem seems to have solved the battery and lost connection issues.  I just wish Ring had suggested this back in the fall when we were trying to figure out what was wrong.  We might have been able to save the hassle of exchanging for a new one, if we had known it was the modem speed hindering us.  I also fault Ring for not providing more specifics about what speeds of modems are acceptable.  Our old one fell within their specs, so we didn't think that could be the problem. After I posted my original review, Ring customer support was very proactive about trying to help me solve my issues (as evidenced by the company's responses to the review).  Through email, Ring put me in touch with a customer service rep who set up a time to call me.  Unfortunately, the call was not at the scheduled time (the first time it was 15 min after the scheduled appointment, the second time it was 1 hour (!!!) after the set time).  After the second time, I gave up with this method, since it didn't appear that my time was valued by the company.  I appreciated their efforts, but I decided I would just try to solve the other issue (delayed motion detection) by myself...or as a last resort, I could call them instead. Original review (2 stars): I bought the Ring doorbell, because we don't have an easy way to see people at our door (no side window or peephole).  However, I am strongly tempted to go back to our regular doorbell after all of the problems we have had with this.  Just like other reviewers, we have the same problem that motion only engages once the person is walking away.  Obviously, this is useless if we want to see the face of the person.  There is also a seemingly long delay between the bell being pushed and the sound coming through on the phone or plug-in bell.  The other two major problems are the battery life and loss of wifi connectivity.  The wifi connection always reads as very good, but connection is lost at least once a week, meaning the doorbell has to be taken down and re-linked to the wifi.  We often don't realize this until days have gone by with no motion or someone we are expecting tries the doorbell and has to text instead to let us know he/she is outside.  Battery life is my biggest complaint.  The Ring doorbell is marketed as having a 6-month battery life.  Professional reviews said it would be more like 2 months, but we can barely get 2 weeks.  We have limited motion/use of the doorbell, meaning we don't have a lot of activity at our door that would drain the battery.  Motion settings are low too, reducing the drain.  The first Ring we bought barely held a charge for a week.  Ring exchanged it with another, after reviewing our records and agreeing we likely had a faulty battery.  However, the second doorbell we received is no better, and it can hold a charge for maybe 8-10 days.  But, with the constant loss of connectivity and battery drain, we are messing with the doorbell at least once a week.  I don't recommend spending the money on this product.",Do your research before buying this product

But at least it would also capture someone at the door if it took them more than a few seconds to get in. About a week ago the doorbell started going off in the middle of the day. Over and over and over. No one was at the door when I answered it. It continued to go off, while I stood there looking at the doorbell. Pressing it made it stop. So, hoping that it was a fluke, I left everything connected. It did this again at about 2 a.m. today, so I lifted one of the wires to the bell (not to the ring unit). After reviewing recorded videos tonight, I see that it failed to capture any of 3 of us coming home over the span of about an hour. It also failed to capture a trip that I made back out of the front door to the car, But it does have the usual 15 or so cars turning down the block videos throughout the day.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Jun-18,christopher a fuller,"Terrible Product I purchased this because we have no peephole on our front door and no doorbell.  Installation was fairly easy. 1. The app is horrible. Not only is the interface cumbersome and not intuitive, key features that a user frequently needs to access are buried. Also, if you think you are actually going to get a look when someone rings the doorbell, think again. When someone rings the bell the app takes several seconds to load and the video feed even longer.  We timed it. Any time the doorbell was rung, the app took more than 60 seconds to load and the video feed even longer. Consequently, anyone who rings your bell will be gone by the time you get to look and see who’s there. That’s what happened to us every time.  The Ring unit was receiving a strong wi-fi signal and we kept the app up to date. Nothing doing. I went through a lengthy chat process with Ring support in which I had re-explain the problem three times before anyone understood what I was even describing.  If your issue does not match their template of problems, good luck.  I was kicked up to a “higher level of support” which required me to schedule an appointment with their ninja-level support team or whatever they are. I threw in the towel at that point. I’ve got enough going on in my life. I don’t need to go through this for a doorbell. 2. The manual says the battery life should be six months to a year.  Try 2.5 months. Yes, it was fully charged when I installed it. 3. When I tried to remove the device from its bracket so that I could bring it inside to charge it, I discovered that one of the non-standard screws that secure it to said bracket was stuck. Thus, I was unable to recharge it. I tried a great many things but finally just pried the stupid thing from the wall. 4. Though it is tempting because of the low price I strongly suggest you either invest in a proper video surveillance system or how about just a good old peephole and wired doorbell?  You’ll save yourself a lot of trouble.",Terrible Product

Freeman,"The video is quite good, if a little fish-eyed. The audio is unusable due to latency. Would I buy again? No. The primary reason I purchased the Ring is that it allowed local storage of video: granted it was a special API, but it was possible, just like my prior device. However, unbeknownst to me, due to a software update they removed this ability, forcing you to purchase their cloud service to store video's. This is a deal breaker and why I stopped my purchases of the ring camera's for the interior, front and back of my home.Not sure which doorbell/camera option I will be replacing it with, but this one is my last purchase from Ring. So, if you only want to see who is at the front door real-time, or do not mind paying someone else to see who is at your front door, the ring does a good job of that.","The video is quite good, if a little fish-eyed"

The cam works great if you just want to be able to see what's going on but the motion detection absolutely doesn't work as it's supposed to. It detects everything AFTER it's already passing and almost out of the frame. It doesn't detect people until they are turning the door knob on the door. The motion detection goes off every time a car drives by but doesn't go off when someone parks right in front of my house or walks by on the sidewalk. I get alerted about 40 times/day for cars passing but never when anyone walks by. When the mail is delivered I'm alerted when the mailman is already walking away from the door. I would have returned it but it is still useful to just be able to look on the app and see what's going on outside regardless of the motion features. For that it's totally sufficient.

I had purchased this about two years ago and was gifted a subscription to the service from a friend. The device itself is great.  I usually take mine off to charge every few months, and use it for both a doorbell and to be able to confirm delivery of packages and such. As part of the subscription, the video will have to the cloud and you can access later.  Without a subscription, you can only view live video and immediate door bell rings to answer.  So without a subscription, the device is far less useful.  With even a short storage save (one day?), the device would be much more useful, as we could see what doorbell rings we had missed, or have a video if there was a faulty delivery or theft of delivery. Without subscription, it's a 1-2 star product.  With subscription, it's 5 stars, but since it requires a monthly fee, only 4 stars.",Subscription Based

It does everything it promises to do.  Plus - the company doesn't talk about this feature very much, but it's my favorite feature.  When the motion detector senses movement in my front yard, it starts taking video.  The video is stored in the cloud.  So a person doesn't have to ring the doorbell to be on video.  Anyone prowling around in my front yard is also on video. I used Ring for about a week, then made some modifications to my setup.  I wouldn't have given it five stars that first week, but then I got a wifi extender, putting the wifi connection very close to the front door.  This reduced the lag between doorbell ring and phone notification, and made other wifi-connected devices in my home work better.  I bought the wifi extender here on Amazon for about $35. Today I had an electrician out to do some wiring for my Ring.  My old doorbell was in a bad place that no one could find, so he ran wire up to where I installed the Ring.  Now my ring is hardwired to my legacy doorbell (ding-dong!), as well as a power source.  I was going to get a Chime, but I did this instead, with the added benefit of the hardwired power source. In summary, I give it five stars because it is an awesome $200 security system.  For me to be perfectly delighted with Ring, it was necessary for me to add a wifi extender, and have some work done so it could be hardwired to my legacy doorbell.  Totally worth it.",All Expectations Fulfilled (after I tweaked my setup a bit)
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Dec-18,Christopher G.,"This is my out of the box, installed review. I bought an old house that I'm slowly remodeling. There was a doorbell present but nothing inside for it to ring so I went with this. I'd seen good reviews and bad reviews for both this model and the ring 2 and decided to try the cheaper version, hoping that it had been out longer and had a chance to be updated more. I have very heavy stucco on the house so decided to mount it directly to the door. It looked more aesthetically pleasing to me, right in the middle. I did mount it several inches above the stated 48"" recommendation. I'm 6'4"" so just thought it looked better at chest height rather than belly button. The setup and installation was pretty straight forward and was fairly easy to accomplish. I purchased an additional remote chime to go with it so I could hear anyone at the front door if I was on the back deck. That all works well. No complaints. The first day was hit and miss with motion detection. I tried every setting available through the motion wizard and manual motion zone settings. Repeatedly walking up the approximately 25' sidewalk to my door in an attempt to fine tune the settings. I came in standing up, slow, crouching, waving my hands in the air, anything I could think of. I couldn't get it to alert unless I was standing directly in front of the door and kind of bouncing around like a moron. My highlight of the day was when UPS dropped off and I managed to catch the delivery guy walking away. I thought I must be close. Sadly, I was wrong. About 30 false notifications later with nothing to show but an empty door way, I called it a day. Day 2 came with high hopes. I once again did the monkey dance out front, hoping for some Ring love. Trying different settings, hoping for a better result. I watched Amazon drop off again without a single peep. I watched as my wife opened the door to retrieve the package and felt the shame as the ""someone is at your door"" chime finally sounded. I watched the mailman approach, thinking surely this it. I watched as he deposited the mail and walked back down my front sidewalk like a steathy ninja without any notice from Ring. I once again endured the shame as my wife opened the door to retrieve the mail, only to hear the clinging of "" someone is at your door"" and the lack of eye contact as she silently shook her head. Send that crap back she said. I will not be defeated easily though. I have a working doorbell and a call to customer service ahead. Maybe it's faulty. Maybe I can still save face. 3 stars for a working doorbell 😁",Wanted to love this...

First they automatically set you up a trial period of ring protect.  They should be sued for this.  By the time you trial is up you cannot return the product. This is when I found out that without there service this is a useless doorbell.  At least I would have expected to get a screen shot of the event, one day to view the event. Instead I get there marketing add telling me I need to pay them to use the features I bought this for. The live view fails half of the time and takes way to long.  The screen goes to activating device then back to the main menu.  So you have to keep going in a loop until it actually connects.  By the time you connect who knows what it actually triggered on. As for a doorbell well that’s a joke.  Let’s just say I hope your guest are patient.  The delay is horribly long. You need to buy the chime to go with it $29.99.  Then to make things even better you can’t even hear it.  The volume at its max level hardly makes it across the room and if you have TV or radio on forget it.

Pros: 1) Installing the Ring Doorbell was very simple and there are plenty of videos available online if one needs a visual 2) I had a question about connectivity and customer service was very responsive and helpful...even on a Sunday afternoon 3) The Ring was installed one week prior to our trip from MD to Hawaii and I was able to see my neighbor, taking care of our pets, go in and out of our home each and everytime (once a day was agreed upon for the house visit) Place for improvement or adjustment from my use 1) Response time* was not perfect, but I was able to connect to the Ring quick enough to see the neighbor reach for the door handle with the set of keys - The setting distance was set for about 15-18 ft (halfway on the motion setting) This means there are several seconds of delay before I was able to log into my Ring app and for the video to pop up - I havn't tried increasing the motion distance sensitivity; but I assume that at 22ft-25ft I'll be connected quick enough to see people walking up the driveway and walkway to approach the front steps Conclusion: Enabling me to connect to my house in MD from Hawaii on my phone is a cool novel idea with obvious security benefits. I would highly recommend the Ring as a first line solution for those looking into home security.  Last, I am hoping that the company will expand to door/window sensors for an all-around-the-home security solution in the near future. *I'm still using the first generation of iPhone5 and after all of the newer OS update, all of my apps take few seconds longer time to boot-up (FB app is the worst)",A must have simple video surveillance/doorbell

I bought three.  There are well-documented issues with motion detection that have been written about, but in my case now that two of three of mine don't work, I am writing this warning.  The key issue is it works for a year and then the wifi and battery diminish significantly. ONE was DEFECTIVE:  After two years and two northern winters, one of the doorbells - all are hardwired- will ring the bell but detects no motion once on its dock outside. It was permanently removed when I thankfully heard a low-level vibration from my inside doorbell unit, which thank goodness I heard before it caught fire (it was crazy hot with the constant vibration).  Not within warranty so I've got it in a box. SECOND LOSES BATTERY and WIFI:  The second one hard-wired in the same spot will not work once it gets cold.  It worked its first winter, but not now in its second. Ring says to bring it inside, so I manually charge this hard-wired unit for 8 hours and re-install outside and it gives me maybe half a day of working and then only the doorbell works.  The wifi originally was ok for LIVE VIEW but after a year it degraded and Ring sent a Chime Pro to help, but it isn't needed since the wifi router is virtually in the room next to the bell (about 10 feet away).

The Ring itself is very easy to physically install, and getting it connected to the software could not have been easier, if you follow the instructions. It is simple and there are only a few steps, but be sure to do them in the right order. Once it was hooked up, and the doorbell wires put on the right screws, it worked the first time. I did have an issue in that my front door sits 7 steps above the sidewalk and at a slight angle. Ring has a set of wedges you can buy to put the device at the right angle. An additional complication I have is that my front porch is screened, which reduces the sensitivity of the Ring. However, it was easy enough to get it set properly. It now notifies me of someone approaching at the right distance and there has only been one false alarm. I do have it set to give me the most frequent notices, and if I lowered that, I am sure I would not get any false alarms at all, but one a week is not too much for me.

If this worked every time and it had a longer battery life I would really like it but it leaves much to be desired, I would not buy it again and I will probably upgrade pretty soon.",When it works it’s great but it’s not reliable

First, find the icon, then the app loads, then you activate the camera, which in a few cases already got me an error message. 2) Being about 8 meters from my router, my Ring complains of poor WiFi signal quality. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the device knew about its own charging status. If it is at 23% and you plug it in to charge, it will stay at 23% forever.

My house is pretty large, and my router is upstairs on the opposite side that my back door is on and the connection is poor but the video quality is still okay, clear enough to see who’s at the door. Also, I’d highly recommend getting the chime plugin with the doorbell, just adds kind of a traditional feel of an actual doorbell. My only complaint is how sensitive the motion detection can be, it can get really annoying during the day and late at night. Even with the notification settings on the lowest sensitivity I was still swamped with “motion detected at your front door” every 5 minutes. I finally just turned all motion detection settings off, but if you want, you can set up a schedule for motion detection in the app.",Love it...but the motion detection...not so much

The company did offer to work with me to get it corrected but, since I purchased another wireless camera system (different company), last year that started out great and within 3 months went downhill from there I decided not to try another one of these.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Nov-15,L T.,"Ring replaced my wifi doorbell which didn’t have enough range. I purchased Ring on a recommendation in one of the publications I read??? (I forgot). It was just OK until the extenders were available. That was a big improvement as one now rings in the house and one out by the pool. Before that if one didn’t have a piece of hardware handy or on, you might not know there was someone at the door. I am a very heavy Amazon user and as you know UPS rings the front bell and drops the package.  Even if I’m carrying my  phone since  I use a security code on Iphone and Ipad, thankfully. It takes too long to tap the phone , enter the code (i have fingerprint enabled that works 1out of 3 times) and  open the app. I still find it easiery to just go to the front door rather then stumble and bumble and I have a 2 story 5000 sq. ft home. Same applies when not home. Several apps, WSJ, Reuters, messages etc. show on the hardware screen as they hit.

I had gotten replacements but they are failing too and I just tossed another one in the trash, that had nearly caught on fire. . I have 2 Rings, 2 stickup Cameras, 2 chimes and  1 chime pro.  This is a toy and not a security device.  Rarely does it actually capture the activity since it is so slow to start the recording and it stops recording even as the activity continues.  If you do capture the activity from start to finish it is just luck.  The stick up cameras are the same.  When I'm away from home it is very iffy if I can connect to the service to view the activity.  Most of the time I get ""Can't connect to ring"".  They have frequent outages and push updates that will cause the remote chime to stop working.  This is an over priced and under delivered product.  After a year I would stick by this review.  Just this week one stickup camera and one of the door bells just stopped working while I was away,  Once I got home I had to reset them and then reconnect them to WiFi.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Feb-16,Mark Read,"Firstly, the Ring Doorbell is actually pretty cool, if it works.  As others have mentioned, the wifi connectivity between the doorbell and your router needs to be excellent, otherwise it simply doesn't work.  However, there's also another bigger issue - connectivity to Ring's servers which are hideously slow, and since everything has to route via them this causes a significant problem. Playing back recorded video from their cloud either via the app or the website is painful.  I commonly experience 20 seconds of buffering to get 2 seconds of playback, and that is on a good day.  With that kind of latency having a two way conversation is simply impossible. I tried testing by standing right next to my router with doorbell in hand, so as to rule out wifi connectivity issues.  I'm also at the end of a gigabit connection in Singapore so it's certainly not a last mile issue.  Being in a country other than the US may very well be a contributing factor depending upon where they are hosted, however if they're not set up to provide a decent service for non-US customers then they should simply not allow for it to be purchased outside of the US in the first place.","Nice idea, let down by poor connectivity"

To not let potential thieves know that nobody is at home. 2. To deter solicitors 3. To have peace of mind of knowing when anybody approaches our front door. Regarding #1 - burglars will typically swing by your home in the middle of the day (when most people are at work) and ring the doorbell.  If someone answers, they pretend they're trying to sell some made-up service.  If nobody is home, then they attempt to break into the home.  With this doorbell, no matter where I am - I'm able to *always* answer the door, because the call comes through to my cellphone, where I can ""answer the door"". #2 - If it's a salesperson, it's much easier to get them to go away by just hanging up on them quickly (think of what you'd normally do to a telemarketer). #3 - This is a pretty cool device to adorn your doorway.

The bell itself is very good, looks great and is easy to install. However, the core of this solution is the app, which is an embarrassment (at least its Android version). For me, the main value of a wifi doorbell is to get alerted by a mobile device when I am out of sound range of the interior bell in my house. The app fails to do so and renders the entire solution pretty much useless. I am also unimpressed by Ring's customer service. They do not answer emails asking for support related to the app. I am surprised that Amazon put its good name as a technology company behind something this amateurish. Update: Ring customer service responded after I left the review. They scheduled a call with one of their service technicians a few days later. The technician was very helpful and friendly. Over about 45 min she managed to get the acoustic notifications to work on my Android phone and the Android ""house"" tablet. In both cases it was Android settings (different ones, since they are on different versions of Android).

In the past our automated canine doorbell would alert us to anyone at the door, so it didnt matter where we were in the house.  The new current model canine doorbell does not work, so frequently people are at our door out of earshot of the doorbell and we are unaware. Installation was very easy and the app configured it for our wifi in moments.  It required purchasing a ""siding"" mount for our vinyl siding, but beyond that I had no problems. Now when anyone approaches, I receive a notification on my phone.  I also have an LG Urbane smartwatch, and the ring app notifications appear there as well.

The Android app is supposedly compatible with my version of Android but even after the tech updated the doorbell's firmware we couldn't get live view working. Even using the web browser interface on my desktop computer wouldn't get live view. Then the tech discovered their web interface isn't compatible with Windows 7. First of all, developers need to take backward compatibility into account — there are still millions of computers running Windows 7 — but more importantly, the PURPOSE of using a web interface instead of a standalone application is to eliminate operating systems compatibility issues! (EDIT: Upon reflection, I'm guessing the software designers relied on a Windows 10 API that's not in Windows 7 and 8 rather than writing all their own code in the web interface. This would save them money, of course, but it also negates the raison d'etre of a web interface, elimination of OS compatibility issues. The really sad part is that whoever on the design team thought of this probably got a raise rather than a slap on the wrist for doing so.) Another quirk is that the video signal is always sent through the internet, even when you're viewing (or trying to view, in my case) from within your own LAN. Obviously, you need to send video over the net to view when you're away from home and using your phone to connect, but there's no reason to do so when the camera and the viewing device are on the same local network. As a result you can't see the view from the doorbell camera when your internet connection is down, even if you have power and your doorbell and viewer are both connected to the same router! Dumb, dumb, dumb. But it's probably another example of doing what's easiest for the people who write the code rather than doing what's right for the people who buy the product. Also, I would note that their Android app doesn't recognize device orientation (yes, we're in the year 2018!), so it was very awkward to use on my Android tablet on its desktop stand, which is of course horizontal orientation: Everything was sideways.

Basically, charge the battery in the Ring (via included USB cable), then pick your installation location - drill 4 holes, and install the mounting bracket.  A nice touch was the inclusion of a small level that works with the mounting bracket to ensure your installation is eye-pleasingly level and straight.  Two security screws on the bottom of the Ring unit complete the installation. My only caveat to potential buyers of this  product is to seriously consider including the Ring Chime / Network Extender as part of your installation.  Unless your doorbell installation is very, very, very close to your WiFi router, you'll need the Chime to extend your network (plug the Chime in as close to your Ring doorbell as possible).  Devices as small as the Ring Doorbell using WiFi have a notoriously short WiFi range, primarily due to the fact that there's no room in there for a big WiFi antenna.  I can tell you, however, that when a Ring Doorbell and Chime are installed together, the results are rock solid - I'm happy.  Plus, one of the doorbell chime sounds you can choose is dogs barking - great idea for deterring anyone ringing your doorbell with bad ideas if there's nobody home. I like the Ring Doorbell so much, I've purchased a doorbell and a Chime for my sister's upcoming birthday.  She currently has a rival product that she is not satisfied with, primarily due to connectivity issues.  She saw my installation, and she was sold.",Loving my Ring Doorbell and Ring Chime!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Dec-15,Richard Mark Baker,"Having fallen in love with the product before I'd ordered it, we've had our Ring doorbell for not quite a month now.  Assuming you've got decent walls, the installation couldn't be easier.  There is of course an adjustment period getting motion settings and sensitivitysettings dialed in.  After that, all was well...  for a while.  Then we started getting alerts with no video.  Sometimes the videos were choppy.  Sometimes the sound was too. Ring's tech support people have been very helpful.  It seems that  there are two ways to power the device.  One is by way of the internal battery.  The other is by drawing power from the wiring to your old doorbell.  Figuring we'd never have to charge the battery we wired the device to our old doorbell.  At this point, Ring's tech folk think that the line voltage or current may have been slowly cooking our new doorbell.  Anyway, they've graciously agreed to send out a new one.  When we get it will be installed without connecting it to the old circuits.  How bad can charging the battery once a year be? Anyway, we are looking forward to getting/installing the replacement so check back in a while for part two of this review.",Having fallen in love with the product before I'd ordered it

Yanez,This ring doorbell is not perfect but it works well most of the time and is a theft deterrent. The motion sensors will at times pick up movement a bit too late but for the most part we are glad that we purchased it. We get to see who's at the door even if we are away in a cruise ship somewhere in the Bahamas. It also works as a security camera because if you have contractors working within the view of the camera you can check on them all the time using the live view feature even if you are away from home at work or on vacation.,Love our Ring doorbell

That prompted me to think of options to eliminate that. I bought this camera with high expectations because of all the great reviews that I was reading, but I was very wrong. Yesterday I got an alert around 6 pm showing my delivery man leaving me a package. I was at work and all was well. When i got home around midnight, the package was missing and wouldn't you know, NO PACKAGE ON MY DOORSTEP! I watched all the motion alert videos after the delivery and not one showed anyone walking up  to my doorstep at my apartment but somehow the package was gone. I've tested the camera at night myself by literally standing in front of it and it will not go off. It works great during the day, but somehow at night it does not sense motions.

When it works it's super cool!  I can see who has been hanging out on my front porch, and it's nice to see who's at the door.  What's strange is that sometimes it doesn't pick up anything.  Like the time someone stole something off the porch?  Not a thing was seen on camera.  Didn't set it off. Problem is that it picks up all sorts of traffic as well.  98% of the motion is a car driving by the house.  No matter how much I adjust the visibility/motion sensitivity I end up watching trucks roll by the house.  This has to do with the way the doorbell is angled due to the siding on my house.  Purchased the Ring wedge (which should come with the doorbell) and will see if that helps.","Great for a doorbell, just okay for security"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Mar-19,David H,"This review is for the Ring Doorbell 1.  There are 3 things you should know before you buy that are not currently included in the product description: 1. The camera cannot be powered off (unless the batteries run down). 2. The batteries cannot be removed from this model. 3. Recording cannot be turned off for this model, only the alerts.  According to the product team, recording can be turned off for the Ring Doorbell model 2 via the ""Motion Record"" control in the app.  However, this option is not available in the app for the Ring Doorbell model 1.  You can use the snooze feature and also disable alerts, but the recording of events never stops posting to the cloud (if you have a basic or higher subscription plan).  It just turns off the alerts.  So even when you want to stop recording for whatever reason, you can't.  IMO, that's a major violation of privacy and has the potential to be abused. I'll give it 2 stars because the technology works.  But the above issues make it a no-deal for me.  Returned product the next day.",Know before you buy (Ring Doorbell 1)

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Oct-15,Dan W.,"I recently installed this as my doorbell. The video calling is invaluable, but there are a number of quirks that have reduced my rating below a perfect five stars. Read on. INSTALLATION My house has stucco walls. You need a special drill bit to go through stucco/concrete, which I happen to have, but it's damn near impossible to get your holes lined up perfectly. The Ring backplate has no slack for where the screws go through the plate. If you're off, you lose. (I have a similar complaint about many other gadgets. You'd think they could have made an L-shaped channel to give you maximum flexibility for where your screw holes end up, but no.) In my case, I ended up surrendering and using Gorilla Glue to attach the backplate to my wall. It took a day for the glue to really cure up, but now the backplate is properly aligned and not going anywhere without the use of a chisel. The doorbell, itself, still comes off easily with two screws. The electrical and WiFi aspect of setup is relatively painless -- no more difficult than setting up most other ""Internet of Things"" devices. CONFIGURATION The motion sensors have configurable range for when they'll trigger recordings to begin. You have to then ""ring"" the bell to save these settings. This completely failed to work, and I've had an ongoing dialog with Ring service about what appears to be a software bug on their end. Even when I had the range set very close, cars going by on the street (a good distance away from my door) would trigger the video recordings and phone alerts. Having my phone alerting me multiple times per day, all false positive, was completely unacceptable. After some extensive back-and-forth with the tech support at Ring, we somehow got it to disable the motion alerts yet still record motion-triggered video. It's not that you can't do this from the UI. It's that the UI is seriously buggy and takes multiple tries to get your settings to stick. Very frustrating. BUT WHEN IT WORKS It's fantastic when somebody comes to your door, rings your doorbell, and you can respond to them from halfway around the world. This is the killer feature that makes this product invaluable. The fact that it leaches power from your existing doorbell wiring is immensely useful. Install it and forget it. WISHLIST - Better configurability with the motion sensors (e.g., have somebody walk by and get a real-time meter of what the sensors are seeing). - Web browser access, not just smartphone access. - The Ring is a hefty device. It would be nice if it were half the thickness. Also, the mounting plane needs to have more slack to help you align it with holes that aren't drilled precisely. IN SUMMARY Great concept. Good-but-not-great hardware engineering. Beta-quality software that's still very much a work in progress.","The video calling is invaluable, but there are a number of quirks"

Kids and I played with it for a good 15 minutes and the cloud captured it all so we could laugh at ourselves over and over again. Video quality is good with the porch light on and fair when it's off.  But it will let me know who's at the door when I'm not home and,  more importantly to me, capture thieves who try to steal packages from my porch again. So as a first impression I have absolutely ZERO buyers remorse here.  I was also pleasantly surprised that my wife and I could use our phones at the same time to answer the door. Way cool!  The only thing I'd suggest is adding the option to view the live feed on demand without a motion or door bell alert.  Looks really rich and sexy and definitely adds a wow factor to my front door. too.",Super easy and does as promised

The required monthly fee to unlock most of its features limits its use. It is only useful to monitor the door camera for a short time when you are expecting someone since the live camera only saves video and doesn't stream so deactivates itself after a few minutes and viewing history even a minute later requires the monthly fee. I set the zone to the lowest setting and the motion still triggers from the street 25 feet away. The feed isn't able to be viewed/saved to your own phone or computer without downloading from the paid cloud service first. I rated 2 stars only since this low price model does give you some usefulness and I might have purchased anyway even if the paid subscription requirement wasn't so will hidden in the legal fine print.

Then I realized that the recording required an ongoing subscription/cost in addition to the cost of the device. Now I get ring notices, but usually there is no picture of the activity, I guess because no picture is made at the time of the motion (a timing issue). It will have a picture if someone rings the bell, but otherwise it is useless as far as seeing someone come up to the door. Don't believe they are quire there as far as security.

Customer service was great to try to work through things, but in the end I was unwilling/unable to move the router closer to the doorbell (it was already within ten feet).  Nice idea, but instead I have a  web-connected camera and a motion sensor that tells me when someone is at the front door.  It doesn't allow me to speak to them, but neither did this (because it didn't work for my home/location).  However, I am also able to record from the camera without a fee (Ring requires a monthly subscription and no option to capture video locally). I've searched for a hard wired version of this.  It would be well worth running the CAT6 for POE and hard wired internet connection for reliability reasons.  I will wait for an improved option.  I did speak with an intercom company who told me they were coming out with a hard wired outside intercom that would do all the Ring would do, but with local recording, etc.  The only problem is they never called me back (they said they would when testing was finalized and the product released).

I just purchased the year's coverage for the newest product because there was still time on the year for the other two products.  When the new product's free 30 days expired, they stopped the subscription plan for the two products already covered rather than just add the new product.  This caused me to have to remove the Ring products and reset them.  I had to chat with several Ring employees, many who ended the chat rather than help.  Many blamed my wifi; others made ridiculous conclusions and statements.  I have purchased other security cams from Amcrest, where there is no need to purchase a yearly plan.  Ring does not allow its customers to get recordings unless they purchase a yearly plan.  And evidently, if you do not purchase one as they think you should, the product does not function well.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Feb-16,Paul G.,"It's a nice idea, but just not as reliable has I’d hoped.  The Ring Video Doorbell is great if you like to be alerted that something occurred at your door, though you’ve likely already missed whatever that was.  Whether accessing it thru the phone app or a PC (Windows 10 app) the alerts are pretty consistently about several seconds after the action (and it's not because of broadband latency -- other wireless cams on my network stream just fine). I have my Ring Video Doorbell hooked up to power so I'm not just relying on the battery.  However, my guess is the battery is the limitation in the design -- the device is meant to be run via battery power for as long a period as possible so it's fairly miserly with the power utilization.  It's not ""Always On"", which is likely why you can't remote to it and take a look whenever you'd like.  Again, I'm just guessing here, but it likely has a low power “detection” function that wakes the rest of the unit up, sends out an alert, and begins recording.  Unfortunately, that means I see the receding backs of a lot of door visitors and delivery people. I've tried playing with the motion sensor range to have it wake up sooner, but that has resulted in cars on the street triggering it (which means I now have a lot of empty doorway shots, saved to my paid Ring Cloud storage where whatever triggered it has long passed out of the scene) and I still don't seem to see people's font sides.  In fairness, I’ve only had it for a few cold Winter months, and maybe the outside temperature has been a factor. I hope the company will have firmware updates that help address these issues.  Right now, I'm somewhat satisfied with it.  It is easy to setup and not nearly as expensive as more professional devices would be.  At least it does ring the doorbell and give me the potential to catch a very slow and patient door visitor.",Nice idea that somewhat somewhat delivers

We called the company's tech services and were told that although they don't tell people before they purchase it, the system does NOT work properly in any part of the country where the temperature gets at or below freezing.  The type of battery used for the system is not made for freezing temperatures and if the weather gets near or below freezing the battery will not last longer than a few hours before it needs to be recharged (essentially the battery cannot hold a charge in the cold temperatures).  The battery is supposed to last 6 months to 1 year before it needs to be recharged according to the company.  Who wants to have to recharge the battery every few hours all winter long??

Simple set up, plug it in, go to Ad Device, click, click, click and done. Do the test! Bang it works, love it. We left the doorbell in the livingroom and our 5yr old was the assistant to listen to us and ring the doorbell. We tried all of our phones and ipads, they all get a notification and we can all watch and talk with the Ring device at the same time. The 5yr old thought this was the coolest thing ever invented, since his iPad. Ok, installing it at the frontdoor... Took the box with me, took my existing doorbell off, disconnected two wires. Took the Ring backplate, matked four holes, drilled the holes with drill that came in the box, 1-2-3, easy screws in the plate, slide the Ring on it. Two screws underneath.. Done! Back in the housem kids rang the bell, all devices got allerts... I set the motion sensors a couple times (fine tuning), and I guess we are all good! Gosh, this thing is amazing! I can 't wait to communicate with friends, UPS people, track who swings by... Or even send strangers away. Even as I write it my motion sensor sends a message to my iPad. I click on it and immediately see the front side of our home.. I notice the wind blows, my palm tree swings a little because of the wind, but most importantly nobody there.. And that 's what I like! Sets my mind at easy... You never know who shows up at your house. I am sure this Ring will give us a lot more peace of mind, for sure when we are not home. I know I need to finetune the sensors again, set them less sensitive but that is cool in the app. Did I mention the app was easy peasy? Go buy it, I thought about it for a couple days but trust me, just buy it. We are not affiliated with Ring or the company behind it, just a GREAT product!","Received it today, installed it, tested it and all ready LOVE it!"

It was a great picture - when I can get it to work. The app is SUPER slow to get the video feed working when the doorbell rings (at least 25 seconds lapse between doorbell ring and video coming up) so it doesn't serve the purpose I purchase the item for (to see customers at my door when I'm in my basement workshop).  We live in Iowa so the winters are cold; despite being hardwired to our building's electrical, the Ring battery only lasts about 1 month on a charge. When it's low or completely dead, I can no longer use Live View and it won't notify me when the doorbell is rung (though our doorbell does still ring). So monthly, I'm forced to unscrew the Ring device, bring it in for hours to charge on the USB cable, and reinstall it outside (all while hoping no one rings our doorbell in that time period). I'm very unimpressed with the speed of the connection to the video app, and the life of the battery (and/or the inability to actually hardwire the device to our electrical system). The only thing this device has gained me is the ability to open Live View to check in on snow falls when we're on vacation in January. Not worth $130.

It is clearly more than just the usual doorbell but people don't know quite what is happening until you start talking to them through it and even call them by name! I've actually seen some people looking around to see where my voice was coming from. My neighbor was surprised that I was talking to her from work as she was standing at my door! She asked my wife, ""do you mean he can see me?!"" Almost everyone who sees it in action wants one. The picture is clear and features are easily recognizable even at night. The set up is very easy. I had to call them once because I had unplugged a chime and was trying to set it up again and it would not work even though I pressed the re-set button as stated. From calling support I learned that I had to press the re-set white the chime was still  plugged in. I would not have had to call if that had been clear in the instructions-or maybe it was and I missed it. The motion works well but I find that if I restrict the field to the road then I only get the backs of deliverymen walking away or sometimes no one if they are swift. If I do not do that then I tend to get false alarms from vehicles passing by. Our door is fairly close to the road but fortunately we do not have much traffic so that is not a big problem. The videos are storable in the cloud or on your device. I have found that what determines whether I get the video or not is how good the service is where I am. If the network is very basic then you may not get the video. In such cases I have found that if I turn the wifi off and just use the phone I have no trouble getting the videos. My one gripe is that I wish the chime sound was louder. I have mine on the max volume and wish it could be louder still. Full disclosure: I am part of the ring explorer program and will receive a chime free for being part of this program, but I would never have been a participant in the first place if I were not so pleased with this  product.

The settings I prefer would be to be able to remotely activate the camera whenever I want and also to be notified when there is motion and it record it without opening the app. Just some minor touches to the software that would make it more powerful is all.",Indifferent

It does almost everything that is advertised. Three small issues: The security screws are too flimsy for multiple uses. They get stripped and then the whole unit needs to be replaced. Battery reminders are sporadic and unreliable. I got one two days after the battery was fully charged. Battery is currently charged, the software is wrong. Finally, the communication with the outside can be very choppy. Of course this is due to network issues, but the wonderful idea of talking to the outside as if on an intercom is overstated. That said the hardware, finish and especially customer service is one of the very best I have ever encountered. I would not hesitate to buy again even with the small issues.",Almost Perfect

We wired it to our existing home doorbell and also purchased two wireless Ring bells. The item comes with about everything you need to install it and was pretty easy to do. Be sure to keep the charging cord and the screwdriver. It needs to be recharged. The app tells you when its low.  Ours lasted about 2.5 months but our doorbell gets rung at least once a day by UPS or FedEx. To recharge you use the supplied screwdriver to loosen two screws on the bottom. The app works well and can see who is delivering packages to my house and who is at my house when I'm not there. I can communicate with people that are at my door when I'm not even there! You have the option to pay for a cloud account that records any video. The video is clear but it all depends on your internet speed. I would definitely buy again.,Great device! Very nice to have

Last year we had issues with packages going missing left in our front door, with the motion sensor we instantly see, and can even communicate with who ever approaches our front door. I also like the ease of use on the app side. One of things u think they can improve on is that if you have an existing door bell in a junction box like we have in Florida the back plate is not wide enough, and you have to modify the area, usually if you have a block or stucko home, but over all A very good investment for those in search of a piece of mind. I would like to man an adjustment on this review, even though the product is great and I still about what I said earlier, I had my first issue and has to call their tech support line, unfortunately the pursuit is amazing but one of the worst tech support teams I have ever dealt with on the phone.

I had trouble hooking it up to my doorbell so it doesn't ring my original bell in the house. I have an echo device that I connected so Alexa simply tells me if there is someone at my front door. The motion sensitivity could be improved. Even when the sun goes behind a cloud or comes back out it triggers the camera to alert for motion. This causes a lot of false alerts that I have to tend to on my phone. Also, there is major lag time between a motion sense and an alert being sent to my phone.

Two weeks after installing the cam, we had prowlers in our backyard - extremely creepy to watch on video - and had it not been for the Ring floodlight cam we would not have been alerted to the presence, nor been able to scare them off with our voices once the two-way talk was activated. So thankful for this device. This is so much better than just a drop cam which records every movement. You can actually be alerted when there’s motion in the backyard. We have it set to “people only” so that we don’t get alerts for possible tree swaying, critters, etc. We also have the front doorbell cam and love being able to answer the door even when we don't actually open it or better, when we're not home.

Any time I delete a recording, the app exits. Quite often the recording does not erase. 4. Updated app on iPhone lost at least one good feature.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,14-Sep-15,Lzrman38,"Revised with 3 more months of experience.  I've now had good experiences with recording who comes to the door.  I can answer no matter where I am  talking to a person who rings the doorbell even when I'm out to dinner or somewhere else.  The false motion alerts are now manageable and I'm working to reduce the range of sensitivity.  Even with a couple of little shortcomings, I like the product a great deal. ********************************************************************************* I really wanted to like this product.  It.s a great idea.  But it's a disappointment so far (about 6 months).  I mounted this in my west facing front porch alcove, about 40 feet from the street.  We live in a residential neighborhood on a not very busy street. The first big problem I have is false motion alerts.  You can adjust the sensitivity of these alerts, changing the distance from the door and the direction it sees.  Even when I adjust it down to about 5 feet, cars and trucks going by 40 feet away trigger the Motion Alert.  A Ring tech said to change it to about 30 feet where they say it's lest sensitive to sideways motion (cars).  The result after I did this was 32 false alerts yesterday after Noon 43 this morning before Noon.  To realistically depend on this door bell to alert you when someone really approaches your house, and not when cars drive by, it must be fixed.  Otherwise it's just a nuisance. The second issue is that image I see when something triggers the motion alert is usually not good.  The wall next to the unit is visible and properly exposed, but the view to the street is washed out, over exposed.  Somehow this needs improvement.  I can, however, see an image of a person standing near the door.  I just wish it were clearer. I'll change the rating up if these issues are fixed.",Good idea — shows me who is at the door no matter where I am

The set up was simple until I hooked up my existing doorbell.  I installed the back plate and wired my existing doorbell.  Shorting the two screw terminals caused the doorbell to ring so I knew I had power to the back plate. However, once I installed the Ring doorbell I could not get the inside doorbell to ring or to charge the Ring doorbell internal battery. .  Reading on line it appeared that my existing doorbell power supply was under powered.  So I went on line and found a list of compatible doorbells.  I replaced my entire system with one listed on Ring's compatibility list.  It was a 16VAC 10VA system.  Once I installed the system, I still could not get the doorbell to work or charge the battery.  I called Ring support and I ended up getting a new back plate.  I once again hooked up the new plate and nothing!  It was driving me crazy.  I used my meter to determine I had 16 volts at the screw terminals.  I used the continuity setting to check both back plates and I could not get continuity between the screw terminals and the metal tabs on the back plate.  With that result it was impossible to ring the internal doorbell or charge the Ring unit.  I don't know why I did it, but I removed the terminal screws and check continuity between the copper contacts under the screws and the metal tabs.  BINGO.  The terminal screws are electrically isolated from the copper contacts under the screw.  These copper contacts are also slightly recessed.  Now I connected and reconnected these wires 10-15 times and never got the doorbell to work, even though it could jumper the screw terminals to get the doorbell to ring.  Once I realized that I had to make sure the wires touched the copper contacts regardless of touching the screws.  Wow it worked!  This is frustrating because I have never seen a case where the screw terminal was isolated from the connection on the circuit board.  Three weeks went by before I resolved this issue.",Screw terminals on back plate are electrically isolated from the copper contacts under the screws.

It does not work on 5 ghz systems or extenders. The reason for three stars and not five is because of one major flaw that could have been easily corrected at this price point; the doorbell is not a door bell. Meaning there is no chime inside.

When the lighting is not perfect, the video from my unit is much much worse than this. Compare that to the photo with the man from the promotional video. You can see the huge difference in quality.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Sep-15,Michael Cowden,"The alerts show up on your phone right away, but there is some delay in notifications and starting the video feed.  People might walk away by the time you see who's there.  But I do like the idea.  The software on the smartphone side just needs some improvement to reduce the delays.  It may also need an update to improve its utilization of power and a better wi-fi antenna.  If there is more than a wall or two between the Ring and your wi-fi router, the signal may not be strong enough for it to handle the full video resolution.  If that happens, it's hard to even tell who's there, and the audio and video might not work.  So consider that you may need to relocate your wi-fi AP or router, or add a signal booster or secondary AP closer to the Ring to make it work right.  I think the idea is good, but it needs some improvements.","Great idea, so-so execution"

You can't use the camera to record video on your computer you have to use Rings cloud service. The doorbell has a battery on board and the doorbell has to be removed periodically to be charged.

In the 10+ months since installing it has been a valuable security component for our home providing both video feed on motion detection alerts as well as when someone actually rings the doorbell. You can see and speak to them, via the camera, virtually from anywhere in the world. Until recently, the primary negative was that you could not see real-time LIVE video unless there was an alert (either motion or doorbell pressed). The Ring team responded to this constructive feedback and now provides the feature which works GREAT!

And installation was a breeze. The caveat is the lag or time it takes to react. By the time it starts recording, the person ringing the door is either done waiting or the delivery person has their back turned on their way back to their truck. I have fast internet and the signal strength is really good. Another reason for the 2 star rating is the fact that you have to pay to have the video stored on their servers. Similar product offer free storage for a time period or storage amount. Lastly, there is no on-demand viewing! That was big one for me. If I want to see outside, I should be able to. I have returned the door bell and set up an arlo camera in its place. I am much happier with that set up as the ring was not alerting me in time. Great concept, great service, great looks.

The Ring addressed everything I thought was missing from the Doorbot and then some. - The camera has amazing coverage.  I can see my entire patio. - Motion detection is my favorite feature.  Not only am I alerted when someone is within my specified distance, but I can use it to communicate with someone even if they don't ring the bell.  I use it everyday to talk to my kids (sometimes they ring) when they get home from school etc. - Live View is great b/c even if I miss a ring or motion, I can still hit live view to see if anything is going on and communicate if I need to. It's easy to install as Ring provides you with everything you need including a screwdriver and a bit for their security screw.  I have mine hardwired, but you can also use the rechargeable battery. UPDATE: Ring sent me a Ring Chime for free so that I can try it out and review it.  I already have my Ring Doorbell hardwired to my home, so it not only rings my phone, but also the chime I already had.  I honestly didn't think the Chime was going to be anything special b/c I have the hardwired chime, but why not try it out.  Setup was easy using the app and the volume can be adjusted and tested as well.  I thought the Chime was just going to ring when someone hit my doorbell, but I was very happy to discover that it also alerts you of motion.  I put the Chime in the basement near the laundry machine and now if I can't hear the house chime and don't have my phone on me I will still know what's going on at my front door.","which I thought was good, but not great"

Easy to setup and use and the quality of the video is very good. Unfortunately, because of recording laws here in Germany I had to turn it off. This is a solid and professional product, I would however like to see these improvements & modifications; 1. Modify the app to allow users to capture a screen shot of the action and save it in their local smartphone photo library. This will provide customers in countries who cannot use the online recording service the opportunity to capture a still frame of, e.g. someone stealing their bike. 2. Modify the app to allow real-time access to the Ring Video Doorbell camera and mike  - independent of the motion sensor or ring button. 3. If Video Ring  wants to open up the European market they will need setup a video only (no tone) recording service on a server in the country of use, i.e., a German-based server versus saving data recorded on a Ring Video Doorbell used in Germany on a USA-based server – which is a big No No!.

King,This is useless if you have a strong password on your Wi-Fi it’s simply will not connect.  Their solution was to change the password on my Wi-Fi which is not an option given that it connects to literally a dozen other devices in my house that I would then have to completely reset.  I don’t have the option to put in a powered doorbell so none of their other models will work I have to use a battery version .  It’s too late now to return it so now I’m stuck with this expensive piece of trash useless useless useless .,Don’t bother if you have a decent password on your Wi-Fi.  It will not connect .

I am very highly satisfied this time around with this doorbell. Since I had a doorbot previously I had the same holes drilled into the brick so I just mounted everything together with the now new (2) security screws I was up and going in less than 10 min. The HD cam is way better and clear. Only thing is the cloud storage recording option... but at least you can easily go back in time to view what happened at your door step.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,2-Jan-20,Zach,"The product worked great for the first few months. I wasn’t thrilled to charge it once a month, so I messed with the settings and turned off the motion alerts. Fast forward another 6 months, and I’m constantly charging it (at least biweekly). Even though I have a reminder on my phone to charge it, I’m usually reminded my guests asking me if my doorbell works or not. Long story short: the battery life is awful, and we’ll probably replace it with a non-Ring product soon. Update: after 1 year, we’ve decided to go back to a normal doorbell system. Even when the Ring was charged weekly, it failed to work with the Chimes. We’ve tried updating the internet settings, updating the devices, and resetting everything. I’d rather troubleshoot an old printer than deal with the Ring one more day.","Battery life is awful, you’ll need to charge at least biweekly."
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Feb-17,Aperio,"Ring worked for one week then started ringing the chime non-stop. Support advised me that my door chime was unsupported, so I bought a new chime ($45) and it had the exact same problem (the chime works fine without Ring). The internal battery also stopped charging. I've had to disconnect the ring device and return it to Amazon. When it worked I really, really liked Ring. It had worked exactly as advertised and made working at home easier since I could see whether or not I really had to answer the door. Their support was very responsive but after several email exchanges the problem persisted and Ring became unusable for me. So I did return it and have asked for a replacement. Ring has one more chance, if the next one fails then I'm done with Ring. It was very easy to install and connect to my network. I noticed that a number of people had reported the same problems I experienced when I read through all the product reviews in Amazon. I pointed this out to Ring support and asked how they resolved the issues for the other users, I never got a response regarding what they determined from the issues reported by the other users. Update: Replacement Ring installed, so far working well (day 2). More updates to follow. Update #2: The second Ring worked for a few weeks, but then failed with the exact same problem as the first one, it started ringing the doorbell non-stop, but this time it started in the middle of the night. I noticed that the battery wasn't fully charged after I tore the device off the wall. Another reviewer noted that the device seems to be trickle charging the battery when hardwired and therefore the battery would deplete even when hardwired. I agree with this conclusion, being hardwired I shouldn't have seen the battery below full, but it was. I also notice this time, since this one lasted a bit longer, that I was getting many (and I do mean many) false alert of motion. I set the range to 5 feet but still got way to many false alerts, it seems like the device way picking up any trucks (delivery vans, garbage trucks...) that passed on the street, the street is about 25 feet away. I didn't bother contacting support since they didn't help last time. I really think they know what's wrong with these things but you can't get that information from them even when you ask how they solved the same problem reported by other users. I was the test case for a number of neighbors who were also interested in the device, I told them the problems, they can decide if they want to try it for themselves (I don't think any of them will). Thank goodness I bought this on Amazon and could return it easily, I didn't have to arrange the return via Ring support.","Tried Two Ring Devices - Both Failed, Both Returned - No More Chances for Ring"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Apr-16,Cyoak,The frustrating part about this doorbell is that Ring promised live cam functionality in future updates. Right now you can only view video if the doorbell detects motion. There is no way to access the camera on demand. Based off that information I purchased this doorbell and installed waiting for this update. Later I get an email saying that they are releasing a new product and you'll have to buy the new product in order to use live camera functionality. Also motion detection needs more fine tuning. I live about 30 feet off the street and my door/doorbell faces the semi busy road.

Also, the wig if issues, but other than that so far, I must say I love the new technology. I do not see any unforeseen issues with it and hope not too.

It is worth the $30 a year for cloud recording storage of the videos. The motion sensor grabs quite a bit of movement, even if someone is walking in front of the house. The app does a good job notifying you of motion detected. The camera is a little slow to start the recording, so if a visitor is at the door for only a little bit, it records them walking away (their backside only). Also, the app on the iPhone is a bit cumbersome to use.

I will probably move up to the pro ring eventually for the higher quality video. Video service is cheap at 30 a year. Easy to set up. Video is pretty good. Had to shut off notifications for motion because it picks up cars driving down the street, even when set to a distance of 5 feet. Overall we love it. I originally tried a sky bell, was SEVERELY disappointed with it. Took me a year to get the nerve to try another video doorbell.

Since the system is likely to be installed to replace a existing door bell the instructions are geared towards helping one through that process.  In my situation I'm installing it in an older home where the existing door bell system was abandoned several remodels ago and therefore had to supply a new power source; This also requires a very large resistor.  Fortunately the customer service rep was able to guide me to a web page within their help / fact section that explains how to wire this to a new source providing all the info including clickable link to a site that sells this hard to find resistor.  I have an electronics background and searched for other sources for this very large resistor (25 OHM 10% 30W) and the only source I could find is the company Ring referred me to but this resistor is back ordered five weeks.  Fortunately the Ring works without issues on it's internal battery for many months and will wire in the resistor / power source once it arrives.  Set up and access via the app is straight forward. I did have problems connecting the Chime, an add on piece of hardware that functions as a external chime you can plug into any 110v socket.

But I don't want to disable them because this way I can tell when Postal delivers my mail or when there is someone at your front door. I really hope and wish Ring can fix this annoying feature and this will be the best Wifi Doorbell on the market hands down!!",I like Ring much better than the Skybell

You will need the diode if your home's existing chime is digital vs. mechanical. It doesn't always chime in the home though, so I need to further troubleshoot why. This is why I gave 4 vs 5 stars. The recording feature is so helpful to see who has come and gone. I'm curious to see how much that will cost with Ring after the thirty day trial ends. Live video will still be accessible after the trial period. And I like how neighbors will post warnings of stolen packages or suspicious activity in the Ring app.","Excellent product, recommend for everyone"

I have enjoyed the peace and we'll being of knowing when I have a package at the front door and there is movements near by that I will be notified. There is a small nominal charge for the annual recording and it is optional....but if I ever needed to provide a video to police makes it all that much better.. I got the Chime about a month later.

My only issue is the ringtone to my IPhone is not consistent. It will ring on occasion with movement. During the times it does not ring to the phone it does however acknowledge that someone is at the door or has moved near the door when I go to the app on the phone. I am able to manually view anyone on my doorstep and speak to them if I choose. I will make a call to the help line for assistance. The security of not having to answer the door when I am home alone is very reassuring. I previously did not answer any unexpected knocks on my door.,Good Security

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Feb-17,Big Daddy,"Our wired basic “ding dong” doorbell worked flawlessly since our house was built in 1960. Unfortunately the wiring was damaged beyond repair during a recent remodeling project. The Ring Doorbell looked like the perfect replacement. Foremost, it is battery powered with an advertised battery life of 6 to 12 months. The security features are also desirable.  Since installing the Ring Doorbell nearly a year ago the battery has never lasted more than 15 days. Often I was recharging it after 4 or 5 days. In an effort to extend the battery life I went to the trouble and expense of hard wiring my Ring Doorbell. This doesn’t seem to have much effect. The battery life is still around 5 to 10 days. Often after recharging I have to do a clean set up. UPDATE...Ring support helped me work around my battery problem. Ring's excellent 24/7 support  is good reason to consider Ring. I would recommend spending a little more and get the Ring Pro.  It's hard wired and doesn't use a battery making it more reliable. If I had done this I could have avoided my problem.",Happier Now

It's easy to use, has great features and everyone we show it to is amazed.  It took a little while to fine tune the sensitivity and locations for sensing motion.  We had a squirrel that set it off multiple times every morning - it's much better now.  When I'm at work I can see that UPS and FedEx don't ring our doorbell but just drop off packages near the front door.  When we're out of town I know when my son stops by to feed the fish.

It works even better than claimed.  But the best thing about this device is the customer service that comes with it.  Many companies claim to have good customer service.  But they usually do not.  This company goes beyond the call of duty when providing service.  I misplaced or lost my tool for securing the doorbell to its base.  I also noticed that I did not correctly connect the doorbell to its base.  I was temporarily setting it up to check its functionality and was running on the battery only.  This should last around 1 year but, if I could not remove it from the base, I could not recharge it.  With a heavy heart, I called the company hoping that I could purchase a replacement.  Imaging my surprise when they told me that they would send me a tool free after I proved that I owned one.  This cheered me greatly since not only would I get a replacement tool but I now knew that that company was concerned about the security of my device.  I could now really believe that they would send me a new one if it was stolen.  I would highly recommend this device, or any other device that this company provides.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Sep-15,Steelers007,"I found this product to be very useful and decided to keep it, although in some tough environments it does not perform very well. Here are some of the challenges I run into: 1.- Installation is easy unless you are trying to drill into old tough brick. In this case you will need a hammer drill and a good masonry bit, which the one included with the package is not. 2.- Heavy truck traffic will be detected by the motion detector. The ring was set to detect only at 5' distance, but kept being fooled by trucks going by my street, about 30' from the device. I tried many options and nothing worked. The situation was worsened by ongoing street work during this past month, as the gas line under the pavement was being replaced. I had to disarm the motion detection alerts as the great majority were false alarms. 3.- The device misses people coming to the door sometimes. I think I have the cause narrowed down to the late afternoon sun hitting the ring and messing with its heat detection algorithm. On the plus side: 1.- When somebody comes to your door and rings the ring bell, you are able to talk and see them without opening the door. This was important for us as we have a new solid door and did not want to make a peephole in it. 2.- Every motion detected get logged to the web even with the alerts disabled, so if you are expecting a package you can check whether it was delivered or not. You could also get a picture of whomever it was that made out with your TV and other valuables. :-) 3.- I went on a trip across the country and saw the mailman coming up the steps to my door and looking around. This was a surprise as I had the mail held during my absence, so I had to fire a complaint to the Post Office. 4.- Still across the country, I was surprised by an alert that somebody had rung the ""bell"". I was able to answer many miles away and learned that the gas company wanted to reconnect my gas that day. I was able to tell them that I wasn't there and to come back in a couple of days. This was important as I wouldn't want the gas company to leave my house disconnected, as the only one on the street. 5.- I found their support to be responsive. They solved all the problems they could and told me promptly when the problem was beyond the device capabilities. Overall, I found the device worth the money plus what I had to spend on a hammer drill, even though its performance was less than perfect in my environment. Others will probably like it even better.","Ring worth it, but less than perfect."

A quick look showed a sketchy individual pushing at the door then turns to the left where he sees the light of the ring doorbell and quickly departs. Called the police and offered the video to them but they were only interested in the color of his clothes. Because it was a night vision shot we could not provide the information.

At first I enjoyed the ring, but it’s not what it seems. The image is never clear if you are going to place it outside. It’s very pixilated and the night vision is trash. Literally they would have to break into my car in broad day light for me to catch them. Also it lags, it notifies you right away when there is motion at your door but once you click to view it takes minutes to even connect to the device and even takes longer when you are not home. It also skips footage. You could see someone pull in the drive way but never shows them getting out and walking up to the door. If you want an outdoor camera this is NOT it.",Disappointed

Still people are halfway inside before ring notifies us that motion has been detected. It takes less time to just go to the entry than to go to live view or to respond to a ring alert. The small screws that hold the ring to the base insert into a plastic pieces that came out with the screw the second time I had to remove ring from the base to charge it. It is useless. I think the worst thing about this whole Ring experience is that  it was it was on sale for $99.

I then proceeded to buy a couple more and use them for the motion triggered camera and cloud storage at different locations around my house. I opted for two more ring doorbells rather than the camera only product- it doesn't make sense to limit the field of view and the doorbell is much wider.

Love the fact that it captures action even before anyone gets to the door.  Since it sends an alert, even my dog has learned that someone is at the front door.  It's great to track your own coming and goings.  Having it wired to an existing powered doorbell (almost everybody has that) turns on the live view capability of the camera which makes it perfect for just checking what's going on.  The camera is clear, has great resolution and a huge field of view.  I think it does have the effect of keeping the criminals away since they know you're going to have them on camera.  It's great that if your in the backyard, the garage or somewhere else where you might miss a knock at the door you're alerted an can respond accordingly.  Installation is simple.

I’m most disappointed with the reaction time between motion detection and the beginning of recording.

It is a non-brainer. about the ring, let me start by saying the concept is phenomenal and it works very well. it is still not perfect but i think for a first gen it was pretty good. besides, if i was a thieve and i see a ring doorbell i will just turn around and go to the next house that doesn't have one. They are upgrading the firmware and apps to increase battery life and features. I am using the battery to get the best view so decided not to remove my house original mechanical ring bell.

If i move and remove it i might just have to repaint the area.

One from Amazon and another from a big box retailer because I needed a color they had in stock. I installed one on my front door and one at my back gate that's used as an entry as well (I live on an alley). The front door Ring is hard wired and the back gate Ring is running off it's internal battery. I have had it up for about a month and the battery level is at 75% today. Not bad. The hard wired Ring was easy to wire. Ridiculously easy. The only problem I had was the weather stripping around the mounting plate makes the fit very tight when trying to install the body of the Ring to the mounting plate. Ring's website suggests taking off the weather stripping. My front porch is covered and I live in Southern California so weather isn't going to be a factor regarding the life of the Ring. Camera quality is good. Not 4K HD but good. I even caught a couple of my son's friends doorbell ditching us. I'd post the picture if it wasn't illegal to post pictures of minors on websites. Take my word for it though, the picture is pretty funny. The motion sensor seems pretty sensitive but you can turn it way down and set the frequency of notifications if it gets out of hand. Ring partners with some smart lock companies also which can enhance the benefits of the Ring. It's nice to know who is at your door and what's going on at your door even if you're away from your property. One feature that I wish it had was live view. The only way to access video on the Ring at the moment is if the Ring detects motions or if someone rings the doorbell. That triggers the camera and sends you a notification and starts the camera. I've heard that live view, being able to activate the camera at will, is coming. I have an 11 year old daughter that will want to start dating in the coming years (20 years if I had my way). Live view on the Ring would be great for the late night date drop offs. This leads me to another feature, 2 way audio. You can talk to people through the Ring and they can talk to you. Audio is great. Sounds clear and is loud enough. I scare my kids all the time when they come home from playing outside. That alone is worth the price. Yes, the Ring is a little on the pricey side but the features it packs is worth it. My wife is so much more comfortable knowing who is at the door and seeing what's going on without having to go to the door. All in all, I highly recommend this product.",Yes it's a little pricey but the features are plentiful. Great product!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-May-15,A. Schaeffer,This is a very cool product that still has a few rough edges but will be a grand slam if the development team continues to refine it.  Installation was a bit harder than I was expecting - but that was (mostly) because of my particular installation.  The old doorbell wiring was barely accessible and required a hail mary or stone mason - and the masonry bit supplied is too large (or the anchors too small) to mount the Ring. The combination of motion sensor and door bell/cloud recording is a great feature.  The way we have ours set up is to receive motion detection information on wall mounted tablets at home (so we know if someone is in the vicinity of the door as well as record the event) but only receive actual door bell notifications on our smart phones.  This allows me to review the motion detection events after the fact but not be bothered every time a deer wanders by or the UPS guy drops off a package - as I suspect most motion detection events are false alarms.,"Great product, still some rough spots but amazing, amazing potential"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,10-Feb-16,Jim Shea,"Great product so far...needs to have a live video feed though. The company told me its coming so I am giving them a 5. I must admit, I had  trouble with the installation to my existing home door music chimes. When the Ring button was pushed the wired-in house chimes continued to play the melody over and over again about 4-5 times before stopping.  I also had bad video and audio quality.The customer support team worked diligently with me to troubleshoot the issues. They even sent me a replacement unit, no questions asked.  Superb support!!! I finally figured out the problems.  It had nothing to do with the product!!! It was the result of the stone exterior of my home. The stone surface is irregular so the base mounting plate was not perfectly flat after drilling holes into the stone and screwing the base plate onto the stone with masonry screws, even though it looked flat. It was very difficult to slide the Ring unit onto the base plate. I had to use considerable force to accomplish this (major RED FLAG, though I did not realize it at the time). The Ring unit/base plate no doubt  ended up in a somewhat ""flexed"" or ""warped"" state, even though it was not visibly ""flexed,"" enough  to adversely effect  the electrical contacts for the pre-existing home melody chime.  Once it dawned on me what the problem was, I removed it all and then  attached an inflexible piece of  hardwood (solid OAK)  to the stone then screwed the Ring base plate to the wood. The Ring unit slipped on the base plate very smoothly. Now, for the poor video and audio quality issue... the heavy stone exterior  and heavy metal front door, impeded my WiFi signal sufficiently from the router  to disrupt the video and audio feed.  I installed a Lynksys RE 6500 range extender in the attic space  directly  above the wood ceiling that covers the front porch and is directly above the Ring unit. The product is great the and customer support is unparalleled for an inexpensive product.",Great Product and superb customer support!

Now I just talk to them via the RING app.  If I know folks are coming over, i leave the door unlocked and when they RING I answer and tell them to let themselves in. Nice thing about the cloud recording is that you can see 'what' happened as well.  Example:  was on vacation and wifi was spotty most of the day.  In the afternoon, back in the hotel, I logged into wifi and saw I had RING activity at my door.  It was a large package I had expected to be delivered days later, after my return.  I saw the delivery then was able to call a neighbor and ask him to secure my package. 4 out of 5 may be upgraded later.  As I said wifi connectivity can be spotty...RING needs to ensure it consistently works as well as my house wifi works.  Second is corrosion.  Beach area = salt air.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,2-May-15,Monica Tei,"ring.com version 1.3.59 Setup of the doorbell was easy and fast.  The wifi ssid of your router must be broadcasted.  After the setup completes it can be hidden, non-broadcasted. Tested many of the functions while using the same wifi as the doorbell with an iphone 5  IOS 8.3 and everything works really fast.  Once the doorbell is depressed the video comes on within about 1 second. It takes a little more pressure to depress the doorbell button than I expected. As soon as the doorbell is depressed, the phone rings, the hard wired doorbell rings and the phone brings up the live video feed with ""accept"" or ""decline"".  One should watch a video on how this app works to understand the ""accept"" or ""decline"". If accepted, voice is almost instantaneous.  The video because of the 180 degree ""fish eye"" lens is somewhat skewed but the quality is good. Video playback of recorded events is very good.  Cloud recording and retrieval is actually quite fast as well as download to the phone of the recorded video. Two-way audio is clear and crisp. Motion detection is ok but needs further improvement.  Most of the motion detection (videos) and alerts are when someone is leaving and not as they are entering.  If sensitivity (distance) is set to high, moving cars or objects are more likely to trigger an alert. One can set up to 6 zones but the sensitivity is for all of them and not individually. I have not yet tested night vision because my outside lighting is activated by motion that is more sensitive than what I have the doorbell set to. The drill bit for cement/stucco is bigger than the supplied screws and fasteners. So beware if using the supplied bit.  The support team was more than happy to send bigger fasteners.  Waiting to receive them to verify. Tested with an iphone 4 IOS 7.1.2.  In a nut shell pretty much useless.  Unless all you want is to review recorded events or have an audible alert of the door bell or motion alerts.  Trying to have live interaction with video and voice makes the phone non responsive.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Oct-16,C.C. Rider,"Bought this unit to solve several problems (security, communication, etc.) associated with setting up a new office in my 3-story house in the woods. Very secluded setting. The Ring Doorbell addressed all of my immediate security and communication needs and put it in a very manageable device that did not require extensive wiring or a whole lot of work to install. It works like a charm, is very sensitive to motion detection, and provides excellent video and audio results. It saves me from running all the way downstairs in a hurry to answer my first-floor office door, plus it alerts me before the doorbell is even rung via motion detector alerts so I can see who is approaching, even at night courtesy of its IR abilities. It even detects cars that approach my office area. I noticed an imperfection dead-center in the camera lens of the first Ring Doorbell I purchased, which blurred the central image, that could not be removed. Looked like some sort of residue but felt like a scratch, so either a manufacturing or packaging/shipping related defect. But hey, that's just my luck: if it's going to happen to 1 out of 10,000 people, I'll be the one! Still, no worries: I just sent it back to Amazon as defective, ordered a new unit, and am waiting for it to arrive so I can replace it. I would've preferred purchasing the Ring Doorbell Pro, for the added features it offers especially the live video on demand, but that unit requires hardwiring for the doorbell, which I don't happen to have where I installed the Ring unit on my home (I'm using it on battery power). However, my Father, whom I was business partners with, passed away recently, and although I operate our family business now out of my home office, many people still drop by his house a mile or so away from me to conduct business there...or at least they claim to. I'm ordering the Ring Doorbell Pro today for his home so I can see, for myself, if people ARE coming by there as they say; to be able to instantly communicate with them when they do if I'm not there or am busy; and to monitor the area in front of his home and office to provide much greater security there quickly and easily. These units are Wifi driven, so if your Wifi signal is weak where you'll be installing a Ring Doorbell, I suggest investing the money in getting the Netgear AC750 Wifi range extender to solve your problem, also available from Amazon. It's pricey, but it does the job, able to vastly improve your signal strength and range. My router is on the third floor of my home; my home office is on the first floor. The Wifi signal is already weak on the first floor and was non-existent outside the metal double doors where I placed the Ring Doorbell unit. Due to the distance from the router and the particular building materials used in my home construction - including interior metal load-bearing beams, metal doors and windows, cinder block and concrete first-floor construction with a thick coating of Dryvit exterior siding, which literally wraps the first floor entirely in signal-blocking wire mesh netting - getting a Wifi signal outside to the Ring Doorbell unit seemed improbable. But the Netgear Wifi extender (installed on the second floor) made it through all of that and provided me with a very strong signal to work with on my Ring Doorbell. As an aside, I now run my office PC off the Netgear extender, too, for faster Internet connections. I'd highly recommend one of these Ring Doorbell units for anyone looking for a sleek, easy, fair-priced solution to the kind of problems it solved for me.",Ding Dong! The Best Is Here!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,7-Dec-17,dinkydoo1972,We needed to replace an old analog doorbell as I had removed the old chime box inside the house because it would interfere with the placement of a TV wall mount.  I missed having a bell but was unsure what to replace the old bell with until I came across Ring. This product is a wonderful replacement thus far. We’ve only had it installed for 6 days but I love it. I only hope the battery lasts as long as advertised (6 months to a year). There’s peace of mind with this little device outside my door. I can now be made aware of any motion or ring at my home no matter where I am. Wonderful!!,Great piece of tech security

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Jul-16,Heather A,"Why did I wait so long to buy one of these??? I love my Ring doorbell and can't imagine going back to a traditional doorbell ever again. There's nothing better than being able to know when someone is at your door, whether you are home or not, and being able to converse with them without having to open up your door to a stranger. The installation of this doorbell is a cinch! In our case we had to fashion a wooden mounting base for it as our old wired doorbell was in a very tight area next to the door and I also wanted to have this doorbell at an angle to catch both the door and people walking up to it from our driveway. That was the longest part of getting this installed. The actual doorbell install takes about 5 minutes or so from start to working. Watch the installation videos from Ring before you start and you should not have to hire anyone to do this for you. Getting the Ring on the WiFi was easy and the app walks you through the connection. We did ours before installation but the Ring videos do encourage you to do it just before you mount the doorbell to your house. You can access your doorbell's camera both from mobile devices and computers. On the computer you can either download a dedicated app or connect to your camera via Ring.com. This allows you to have access to your doorbell no matter where you are or what you are doing. The Ring Doorbell now supports live viewing. Mine did not have this feature enabled out of the box but I contacted Ring support and they pushed the update to me within minutes. My only complaint about the Ring Doorbell is video quality related. There's really no way to tweak the quality and because it's outside the sunlight can cause the video to be a bit jagged and glare-y at times. When lighting is optimal the image quality is definitely acceptable for a 720p camera. I can live with it, but wish there was some way to enhance the quality to compensate for the lighting. If you have any questions about the doorbell feel free to ask. I will be happy to do my best to answer them.",Why did I wait so long to buy?

Easy to install and setup. Exceeded my expectations and I am amazed at the video and audio quality. I gave it 4 stars on the motion detection because fine tuning the settings can be a little bit of a pain. It’s not difficult and they offer a wizard but a little finicky. I also don’t get the messages I’m now receiving about “renewing” their trial service.  In other words they now want me to pay for some level of service, which by the way you cannot do as an in app purchase. So, that’s a little annoying. I still have 20 days to go before I truly understand what I will be loosing and I don’t recall seeing this “option” anywhere (not to say it’s not easily available but I don’t recall reading about a service plan to save my videos).

Because of this the only way I was able to hear the doorbell was through the phone app. This says it works with Alexa but it only works with the show for video. I have the echo and I was hoping the doorbell would chime through the echo. You can purchase a chime ring for $30 that rings in your house. Also you can turn the ring sideways but you can't adjust the camera so the video shows sideways. Not happy with the product and will be returning it.,Great idea but needs improvement

He bought one and recommends it to his clients.  The construction crew also bought a few and the manager took pics to recommend to his company.  I use it on battery power and it will last 3-4 months being used 2-3 times per day.  If you add the perimeter alerts, it can drain the battery in a few weeks.

Direct Sunlight triggers false alerts If your door happens to get direct sunlight be prepared for numerous false alerts. 3.

At first it would ring continuously when it rained.  We switched the diode and caulked it in better, which resolved that problem.  A few months later it no longer was able to make a WiFi connection and we have not been able to correct that.  In attempting to repair it, we stripped the thread on the bottom that secures the unit so it can not be removed.  So we decided to forgo the video and just leave it as a doorbell.  A year later it now intermittently rings in the middle of the night when the temperature drops outside.  We have disconnected it totally. This is very disappointing since the whole concept is a good one.  My only advice is if you do purchase one, please install it carefully.  Ideally it is protected from direct rainfall.  Do not over tighten the bottom screw.","We switched the diode and caulked it in better, which resolved that problem"

The motion detector can be set from 0 - 30' and exclude zones if needed.  It's not triggered by simple movement -- it needs a heat signature, too -- so anything hanging nearby and blowing in the wind doesn't set it off .  The camera has a wide angle and shows images in color.  The phone app alerts you to all motion or a ring when active.  The best part is that you can see and talk to the person without having to open the door.  The app also allows you to set everything up and check the recordings of all rings or motion detected -- you can save, delete, and even upload the recording if you need to report something or have documentation.  The online site does not receive the direct video feed when the device is activated (it goes to the phone) but it is very user-friendly to review recordings and delete in bulk any that are not needed to keep.  My only 2 critiques:  1) sometimes the sound recording lags the video to start and 2) you have to ring the bell itself to enable any changes to the motion detector range.",Very happy with this purchase!

I expected as advertised for the unit to distinguish between a trash truck and pedestrian at 60' vs someone coming down my driveway at 20' to 5'. I constantly get alerts of vehicles and pedestrians. When I contacted tech support, he said "" I should angle the unit down slightly so the sensor terminates on my path instead of the sidewalk and street."" This would effectively eliminate the ""smart algorithm"" the unit boasts to have in distinguishing between and vehicle and pedestrian. And upon further inquiry, the tech also said "" the unit is also detecting the driver in the vehicle this causing the alert."" So basically, if you want this unit for distinguishing between real doorway motion and pedestrian motion, don't expect a lot. All of this is said with the correct motion settings.

The cost is much much lower than your average IP camera and the feature are much more practical.

I was expecting to make a call to our electrician to come and install the device but my wife and I were able to tackle the installation and setup on a Saturday in no time so really no added cost other than the $199. Our house is connected to VAC power, so we weren't certain that it would charge the ring but a quick chat with their support online confirmed that it will power the Ring from the AC (good to know and it would have been helpful to have on the FAQs section).

They had me loosening screws on the mounting unit so it doesn't bend even though i was on a solid surface. They had me buy a new transformer and I replaced it. I had to reset the door bell about 10 times with no luck getting it to stay on hardwired. Finally on my last call with them they had another person look at all of the notes from all of my calls. They then had me remove the 2 wires and make sure that they are tight and no frays of wire where there. Did it and the next morning it was off hardwired and back on battery. All of this was over a weeks time. I also got a bit frustrated by one person telling me they would expedite the mailing of items and then 3 hours later I would be on with a different person that says the company does not do expedited.

For the price, it may be a good alternative for other security cams to just use indoors.","A little sensitive, but still like it a lot."

And working with the 2nd one several days I finally got it to work. It is hardwired but would not ring the indoor chime the app also said it was on battery. I called ring they said my chime was not compatible. I got and installed one from their list. The result was same. Thinking maybe my door bell transformer was too small I connected another set of wires to the backplate using forked connectors and ran them out behind the mounting plate to check the voltage under load. Still had 16.5 volts ac. I had a really difficult time getting the ring door bell back on the mounting plate with the extra wire and connectors underneath. Had to use quite a bit of force. But then it started working correctly. The connectors between the door bell and mounting plate are too finicky and are just not ready for prime time.

Only issue was a large scratch on the doorbell when I unpacked it. I thought of sending it back for a replacement but my wife wanted it installed the day it was delivered.

The front of my house has no windows and I've always had to call out ""Who is it?"" before opening the door - or else go into the garage and peek out through the mail slot that is located next to the bell. Now I just look at my iPhone. So much nicer. I also like knowing when someone is at my door when I am away from home. I have received excellent customer service from Ring's Community Support staff. They have answered my questions promptly and provided the information and help I needed. When hardwiring the Ring didn't make my existing mechanical chime work, I found out from Community Support that my old chime, a NuTone made in 1959, is not compatible with my new doorbell and was given a list of chimes that are. I decided to use a Ring chime instead of replacing the old one but have left the hardwiring intact, which keeps the Ring doorbell charged in the 90% - 100% range. Changes I would like to see in the future include a shorter lag time between motion detection and notification and a choice of motion-notification sounds, instead of only the shrill sound that is now available.",Great product that serves my needs

The cloud recording is awesome and we can monitor the device from our computers, our iPads and our iPhones, which is great. We can answer the Ring from anywhere. It is motion activated and we can adjust the range of the devices and the sensitivity (how often we receive notifications). We can see when we receive deliveries, mail, when solicitors stop by...and so on... At first, we were receiving way too many notifications and we were burning through the battery charge too quickly, but now that the sensitivity and range of our devices is appropriately adjusted, both of our Rings work really well,  The two things that could be improved: (1) the battery charge does not last as long as I would like. This is likely because we have a lot of activity, but the charge generally will last for a month or so and we'll have to recharge. It's not a big deal, it's really easy to recharge and Ring sends me an email to let me know when the battery is getting low (so I can monitor my battery life on the app and I get an email) (2) If I forget to recharge the battery and it completely dies, I have to reset my Ring (reconnect it to WiFi) after recharging.

For $200 you'd think they could do better. The screws broke right at the wood level, filling the holes I drilled, and becoming impossible to remove.  I had to drill new holes and then used some screws I had that were stronger. Suggestion when installing, dont use the screws provided. Updated: After installing and trying it for a while I discovered the same problems others have reported. It's very slow to respond to motion, about 10+ seconds, making it fairly useless. You get a video of an empty porch. I worked with support and tried various sensitivity settings, to no effect. Even set to 6ft large trucks driving by 30 feet away would set it off. Really good idea, but the motion detector just doesnt work. The doorbell itself is a little better, when pressed you get a notification on your app in 1-2 seconds. If someone is at the door and waiting it's not too bad, though they think it a bit slow. If a delivery person presses the doorbell and leaves by the time you open the app and accept the connection they'll be gone and you'll see an empty porch.

Now it's an integral part of our home security and I heavily rely on it.  Some of the addition perks:  1)  Ring's stellar customer service 2)  Additional piece of mind when I travel 3)  Access to any events regardless of where I am in the world.  I also added 2 Chimes to the mix.  They work like a champ.",Ring Video Doorbell - Well Worth the Purchase
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,18-Dec-15,Kevin Puccini,"Does what i need it to do.  I had a lot of issues setting it up and getting it to work, BUT customer support was AWESOME!  They were patient and worked with me as many times and as long as it took to get it working.  now it works fine and I don't have any of the original problems.  It is not perfect yet, hence the 4 stars.  As other reviews have stated, if the motion is straight at the device it may not pick it up and sometimes the ap takes to long to open and if someone was there you won't see them. However, if someone rings the bell or is messing around trying to get in or something it will pick them up.  Also the video clips will show what you might have missed.  I think this a great little device to help protect the home.","AWESOME Customer service, good device"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Apr-16,Smilt,"I have 2 of these -- one for my front door and one for my back door. Here's my take: - Overall, the product is great. It does what it says it's going to do. - Excellent customer service. Clearly a priority is put on making the customer 100% satisfied. Anytime I have had an issue, I received a prompt reply from a representative. In other cases, I was offered a new video doorbell as a replacement for devices I was having issues with... no questions asked. I appreciated the trust that the company had in me, and its desire to resolve problems at any cost. - Set up is relatively easy, though I've had problems putting the doorbell on the mounting plate and pushing it down so the top of the doorbell is flush with the top of the plate. This is necessary before you tighten the screws. If it's not flush, it's possible to rip the doorbell off the plate even with the screws tightened. - also worth noting: if you're not careful, you can easily strip the security screws. Maybe that's just me, but that was my experience - the doorbell button itself and motion detection have worked consistently well - one unit had inoperable two-way talk; it was promptly replaced - the share video button often doesn't select when I tap on it; seems like I have to mash it multiple times to get it to work Would love to see the following improvements/options: - Custom/downloadable ring tones. - A live look-in feature. Allows you to see what the door bell sees at any point in time, even if it has not been activated by motion or someone pushing the button. - A feature during playback of recorded video that allows you to pause the video and save a frame grab to the camera roll; even better if you allow us to crop it instead of having to do it later thru the iPhone camera editor. Being able to grab a screen shot is particularly handy when a suspicious person is at the front door and you want to have a clear shot of their face and clothes to alert police and neighbors. Overall, sharing is a clunky, frustrating experience... Esp if you want to send a portion or snap shot of the video instead of a link to the whole thing",Works well.

First, the great: - It works.  Easy installation, easy setup, etc. - I can answer the doorbell from the fourth floor of my house without running downstairs - I can see when packages are delivered and confirm delivery when I'm not home - I get alerts when someone enters and exits the house And the rough edges: - I live in a townhouse with a fairly commonly used sidewalk.  The 5 meter motion sensor is still too sensitive and catches lots of road traffic that I don't care about. - The device is a little big.  Not too big, but I needed to confirm my HOA was OK with it.  They approved it. - The iPhone app has locked up a few times. And the wish list, but not a reason to not purchase: - The video quality is good, but it's no gopro. - Live video.  It'd be nice to be able to just access the video on demand. And notes: Make sure your wifi is strong outside.  Thru my brick walls the wifi just outside the door is lousy.

In addition, as we are a bit isolated, any movement usually means there is someone near and we are alerted and able to assess any situation that may arise.  It was very easy to install, the camera and audio are both very clear.  It brings an added layer of security.  This is definitely something I would purchase again.",Happy with product!!
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Jul-17,cyberdoc,"DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!! I purchased the original battery-powered Ring Video Doorbell at Costco, but found out after installing it per instructions that it sporadically quits and has to be reset by physically taking it off the mounting plate and pressing the internal orange button to reconnect to Wi-Fi. It does NOT reconnect itself automatically to the Wi-Fi network, like just about every other Wi-Fi device on the market. All the other models, including the Chime Pro, remote Chimes, and Video Doorbell 2, DO reconnect automatically. This seems to have been a basic design flaw that invalidates the entire reason one buys such a device. What happens if you're on vacation, there is a power outage, and you cannot be there physically to take the unit off the wall and follow the button-based reset procedure? You're out of luck. The Video Doorbell goes down and never comes back up, leaving your home unmonitored and unprotected. From chatting with their help desk, there is apparently no plan to upgrade firmware to allow you to reset the network connection remotely, which would have been the obvious fix. They do NOT mention this critical flaw on the website, nor do they offer any upgrade path to the Video Doorbell 2, which DOES reconnect automatically and therefore rectifies this glaring (and unacknowledged) shortcoming. I think this is shortsighted, customer-unfriendly company policy. The original Video Doorbell is seriously defective, and in a way that negates the entire reason for buying it. DO NOT BUY. If you still want to deal with Ring, go for the model 2 instead. ------------------------------------------------------- Update 8/16/17: I am upgrading this review to 3 stars due to the exceptional customer service at Ring. After explaining the problem via Chat, I received a helpful and useful response from the Ring rep. They quickly sent a replacement unit, this time a Video Doorbell 2 (which fixes the Wi-Fi reconnect problem). However, the first replacement they sent had an issue with the setup, so we had to contact them again. To their credit they immediately sent a second Doorbell 2 unit that arrived soon after. This one installed perfectly without any issues -- exactly as described on their instructional video. They even provided prepaid postage to return the defective Doorbell 1 and 2. The new doorbell connected instantly to our Chime Pro unit, and all functions seem to be working well so far. I upgraded this review from 1 to 3 stars due to Ring's exceptional customer service on two separate occasions, which addressed our needs without much fuss or having to do much on our part. They did what every good company does: assume the customer is right, and seek to provide a remedy asap. I could not go higher than 3 because the Video Doorbell version 1 is not a good design. Go for the Video Doorbell 2 instead, whose only shortcoming for us at this point is the lack of the optional gold cover plate that Doorbell version 1 offered.",DO NOT BUY -- CRITICAL FLAW ** UPDATE - FROM 1 TO 3 STARS **

If you have many stairs leading up to your house it will not work as a motion detector. You will get many false alarms with moving objects on the street. If you're purchasing it as a doorbell, it will work just fine. But if you're purchasing it for motion detection of unwanted visitors, it will give you too many false alarms. Also according to the technical support team, the battery will last for only 720 events. That is two per day. I had the product installed for 15 days, and my battery down to 50% because there were too many false alarms. Again, I want to stress that if you're using it as a doorbell, it will work just fine, but don't turn on the motion to Texan because your battery will run down very quickly, even as you yourself or your family members are going in and out of the house.","Good as a doorbell, bad for a home elevated off the street and motion"

Strong,"We've had this product for a couple of months now. Let me start with saying I loved how easy it was to install. It took very little time (about an hour) from being in the box to being hardwired into our house and connected to the network. My biggest annoyance with this product is already being addressed in the new model that was just announced...that would be that regardless of us having our motion detection are set to the lowest area, it still picks up the traffic in front of our house so we get motion notifications all through the day. Like I said though, it looks as that has been addressed with the ability to draw the motion detection areas you want. I wish this product had a way to set your own notification sounds. While the ring tone is quite unique and easy to establish what it is, I can't help but think this would be a welcomed addition to the app. We are also very excited for the ability to live view from the Ring at anytime. This was something I've been waiting for. I'm still waiting for the update to roll around that allows this option but can't imagine it being anything but useful.",Great Addition to Any Home Security System

I am trying to adjust sensitivity so I see more on the initial approach of someone but that gives me more false notifications due to vehicle traffic. Was not aware I would need a ring chime...not a huge deal just like to know my expenses in advance. I also did not know what the cloud costs were going to be? I think it is reasonable but I hope they don't start jacking rates. That may cause me to drop cloud coverage. There are enough monthly expenses, I don't want to add another one.  So far so good overall. Have a stick up camera waiting to see results from doorbell first. Updated. Added stick up cam at back door just as easy. Also didn't know every camera needs it's own cloud subscription but they have been very reliable.

It will, then, await a response before starting to record.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Apr-16,Allison Evans,I work from home and my office is in my basement.  I wanted something that would let me know if there is someone at my door if a package has been delivered.  After much research I chose this doorbell for a these reasons: 1. The ability to mount this on my gate where I did not have doorbell wiring. 2. Two-way communication with people at my gate 3. Motion detection 4. Video storage  (requires a subscription but not too expensive) 5. Integration with both IOS and Android phones I received the unit almost a year ago and have been very happy with it.  Most of the time it works great but I do have a few minor complaints which the Ring team is working to address. 1. The function to let me know when the battery level is low doesn't always work.  A few times I have had it go completely dead and have to go through the setup again.  I now charge mine every month and a half or so.  It would probably last for two and a half to three months without charging but it's no problem to charge.  I expected my battery life to be lower than advertised since my WIFI router is a decent distance from my doorbell and I get four to five motion events per day. 2. The recordings occasionally start while someone is walking away versus walking toward my gate.  This is fairly uncommon but worth mentioning. I would like to be able to turn my camera on remotely so I could check to see if a package has arrived or just to take a peek the covered area while I'm away for piece of mind that everything is still where it should be.  I understand that this is an upcoming feature that is being rolled out to wired devices now. I recommended one to a friend and he seems to be happy with his as well.,Great product for what it was designed for.

The wifi has to have a very strong signal for it to work reliably, and even then it seems like the time between when someone rings the doorbell to when my phone actually notifies me takes too long.  By the time I get the notification and answer the ring, the person is already walking away from the house. I've also had people tell me they didn't realize it was a doorbell.  While not ring's fault, maybe a redesign of how it looks might help with that. I would probably not suggest this to someone at the time of writing this, but hopefully Ring will improve the response time for the phone apps at which point it would be worth buying.",While I like the concept

The product was beautifully packaged with easy to understand (and follow) instructions, and included all components required to physically install.  Installation was a snap, and the instructions and videos were some of the best I have ever seen!!  Works on either a powered connection or on a battery pack if no power is available. Installation of the Ring App on the Android was seamless and connection to the device super easy.  By far the best installation experience I have had in years.  Motion detection setup easy.  The device works well, however the fish-eye lens takes some getting used to when viewing video, resolution quite good! The video starts recording only when the unit detects motion, or the ring button is pushed.  Only suggestion would be to have the software capture a few seconds of video prior to the motion detection or ring event like many of the security systems on the market, so the recording captures some of the time leading up to the event. All in all a great product, with a very positive installation experience and fully usable software.  You won’t be disappointed.",Definitely Worth it!

It's a little quirky but I like it a lot. Right now it works great. The only quirk is in the evening. My doorbell is mounted on a wall perpendicular to my front door. It faces a brick wall that gets warm when the sun hits it in the evening. Then the IR motion detector can't see a person then. It's hard to blame Ring for the problem but I knocked off a star anyway. It would be much worse if my house faced south. I suspect that many of the poor reviews that complain about the motion detector have issues caused by the sun messing up the motion detection.,It's a little quirky but I like it a lot

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Jun-16,Duane,"Wonderful device, great design and functionality, I guess. Sadly, I cannot use it. Undescribed on the product description, but hidden in the troubleshooting details of the fourth manual listed, I finally confirmed: (1) that it does not work on ""windows devices"" unless you use WIN10, and (2) although the manual says it will work with IOS 7.1 and later. That is not true. Proceeding to find a solution: (1) I tried to download the IOS application from the app store. It will not, because the Ring app requires IOS 8.2. (2) I then tried to update my IPhone IV to IOS 8.2. It tells me I have the latest level which is IOS 7.1.2. (3) They suggested a direct internet download of the app at [...]. There is no such website according to Safari on my IPhone. Therefore, I am returning the device. My wife and I are very disappointed - we really wanted and like this device. Saw it at My nephew's house. He has the latest equipment including IPhone6 and WIN10. I do not have them. I do not like WIN10, I will do not need and will not buy a state of the art phone for a price I cannot afford just to activate a good device. Unfortunately, Ring has designed this solution only for early prosperous early adapters who want and will tolerate the cost and effort of working with the latest flakey software and hardware interfaces.

When it works - it does pretty well, although with actual doorbell rings, the app is slow to connect even though I have a pretty good wifi setup at home. I've had more and more issues with the lack of motion detection which is mostly what I wanted it for. There are several times in recent weeks where I come and go and it never detects me, even though I'm in front of the doorbell locking or opening the front door. Earlier this week, it stopped detecting all motion until I unmounted it and hit the orange reset button. I've changed my motion settings to include Zones 1-6 and there are time where it picks up nothing. That's a little frustrating. Battery life is decent so far, its about 50% after 3 months.  I live in a condo community and bought it mostly for when packages arrive and as a deterrent for anyone poking around. As I've noticed issues, I do check the app more often (I have motion alerts off) and there are days where I know, for example, it should pick up the neighbors walking by as they leave and arrive for work, but it doesn't. I'm still testing my motion detection problems, playing with settings and will probably next contact Ring next.

The app is also very user friendly. I have it hardwired and it was easy to install. The picture and videos are very clear. And motion detection is very sensitive.

What were originally instant notifications and communications became laggy and delayed. useless for 2-directional conversation.

This was a push without notification and if you do not sign up for one of the Protect plans, your stored videos are deleted and you cannot view even the most recent videos.

The contemporary design could be a turn off to traditional home owners. Our house is more modern than traditional so it matches the unit. It's physically on the fat side, an iPhone 6 is 0.28"" thick also with HD video and wifi connectivity. I imagine there's a reason why the Ring unit is 3x thicker. I feel the notifications should be faster...there have a been a couple of instances where delivery people have rung the doorbell but the app isn't particularly fast for us to respond and utilize the two way talking...people have left before we could respond. I do like that separate occupants can have different emails for the unit to customize settings/notifications. We also have the Ring Chime installed so we can hear visitors from anywhere.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,31-Jan-19,Caleb Bossert,It's a good doorbell... Once you go through the hassle to set it up. I bought my first doorbell and set it up. Looked great but it had an issue not showing color video. I thought this may have had to do with slow wifi or a low battery. I called Ring customer support and the lady told me it was neither so they sent me a new doorbell. Hooking it up to the wifi was easy but the mounting bracket they sent with it did not fit. I figured I had tightened the bracket too tight so I took it off and just tried to just slide it on without it mounted. The bracket did not slide on and fit on. So I needed up taking two grip stickers and sticking it on until I can get a new mounting plate. So the doorbell works and alerts you but it does have some hardware and software issues here and there that need to be more closely monitored in the future.,Good but with a couple frustrations
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Nov-18,Karan Alan,"The second I installed my Ring doorbell, my lift master garage door stopped working.  The garage door does not have a wifi signal and is not on the same breaker as the doorbell.  Ring has no solution to the problem, except for hiring an electrician to see if they can understand the problem.  The box says DIY installation, install by yourself, and quick and easy install - that is completely false.  I have been emailing the company trying to resolve it for a week and a half, so it is definitely not a 15 minute installation as they advertise.  At this point, I can use my garage door with the ring doorbell off the base, or I can put the doorbell on the base and use the doorbell.  To uninstall it will leave four very large holes from the installation. I wish I never bought it.","If you have a Liftmaster garage door, think twice!"
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Oct-15,Rich H,"Love this wireless video doorbell.  I researched all the wireless video doorbells and read the reviews before deciding on the Ring.  I certainly do not regret my decision.  I selected the silver nickel finish that matches my front door hardware. There are several other colors to choose from.  One thing I noticed when I received my Ring was that is was smaller then I expected, and this is a good thing.  I didn't want some large clunky device near my front door.  Setup literally took me about five minutes to install the iOS app and get the Ring on my WPA secured wifi home network.  Installation was also easy and you have the option of installing the Ring standalone (which is powered by a long running internal rechargeable battery) or it can hook up to your existing 24VAC wired doorbell.  If it is connected to your existing hardwired doorbell it will derive power from the 24VAC transformer.  The other advantage of connecting to existing doorbell is that when the Ring is pushed, your phone will give you an audible and visual alert and your existing doorchime will ring.  I chose to wire mine to my existing doorbell so I could hear the chime even if I didn't have my phone near me.  If you are afraid of connecting wires then you don't have to and installation is a cinch.  The internal battery is supposed to last about a year before needing to be recharged (micro USB cable included).  The other cool thing is that all the installation tools come with the Ring, screw driver for philips and security bit, masonry drill bit, level, screws and anchors.  It can be installed on wood, stucco, concrete, brick. The audio and video quality is great.  I had to install my Ring in front of a metal junction box where my existing doorbell button was so I was afraid the metal might limit my wifi range.  My wireless access point is about 30' away from my Ring and I have full signal strength so the metal box had little if any impact on my range. The Ring also has motion detection built in and night vision.  I can see a person outside the front door even with no outside lights turned on.  The motion detection has adjustable range and alert sensitivity so it can notify you if someone walks up to the door and doesnt push the doorbell button.  When motion detection sends an alert to your phone, you can answer the Ring and see and hear what is going on without letting anyone know you watching.  This is great for security purposes. My favorite part of Ring is the customer service.  To me, excellent customer service is a MUST, especially now a days when many companies don't seem to care about the customer.  When I received my Ring purchase from Amazon, the picture quality was blurry.  I decided to contact Ring customer support before reaching out through Amazon.  I explained my problem and Ring sent me an advance replacement.  I received my replacement in two days.  The replacement video quality was perfect and I have not had a problem since.  I returned my original Ring unit in the prepaid padded postal bag/envelope.  I am impressed with the speed and ease of dealing with Ring so this is a happy customer!  I have been using my video doorbell for about three weeks now and it works great and is very cool.",Love this wireless video doorbell

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,11-May-16,Zack,"$200 for a doorbell?! Yes it may seem a bit crazy to spend that much on a doorbell but it doesn't take long before the true value starts to show. As long as I have a data connection, I can be alerted to activity at my front door even if the person doesn't ring the doorbell. I can also interact with them as if I'm home. Case in point, some guy was walking the neighborhood trying to sell some weed killing service. Instead of interfacing with him directly, I simply answered the doorbell from my office and spoke to him as if I was the Wizard of Oz. A similar situation arose only this time it was a Comcast salesman. I was away from the house yet still had no issues answering the doorbell. When a package is delivered, I am notified of detected motion and a recording begins (as it does when someone rings the doorbell). I can modify the motion detection range and zones so that only activity in the specific zones are alerted. Sadly the location of my standard doorbell was way too small for this unit which initially was a bummer. I really wanted to hardwire it in as I wasn't sure how well the battery would hold up but after many months of constant motion detection from our comings and goings and it recording all that motion and uploading it to the cloud service, the battery still has a great charge. And let's not forget their free replacement program in the event the unit is stolen and their awesome customer service. All in all, I'm very happy with the device.",Peace of mind

I did do a substantial amount of research on the product and have been pleased with both the performance  and quality of this product. I must say I've found ring to be a very professional and customer service based company who produce quality products. The fitting instructions are easy to follow, plus you can watch the installation videos on the ring app that you download to install on your device or on the ring web site. Just a few points to note: the device comes with a very good long life built-in rechargeable battery, but you can also hard-wire the video doorbell. It's also important that you have a good broadband connection so that the device performs effectively. I've hard-wired my video doorbell and the advantages of this are that the built-in long life rechargeable battery will stay trickle charged, you will be able to watch live video from the doorbell on your ring app on your device and the ring push on the door bell will stay illuminated with a ring of white light. The only downside that I can find is that when you make changes to the settings in the app you have to press the push ring on the doorbell to save the changes made. However, I'm led to believe that ring are possibly working on updating the app so you can just save changes to your settings directly from the app. The customer service that ring offer is first class, I contacted them for some advice on hard-wiring the doorbell to my system because I didn't already have a wired doorbell fitted and they explained everything, they sent a circuit diagram and gave me all the information on the correct transformer I had to use. So, all in all, very pleased with the end result of this purchase and would highly recommend this product.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,25-Nov-15,Joseph Wilk,"I was pretty excited for this doorbell but it's not anywhere near as good as advertised. The motion detection I thought would provide a layer of security and show me when people are approaching but it is hit or miss and mostly miss. UPS and FedEX drop off packages so quickly the motion detection starts after they have already left the front door. What's the point if it doesn't start when they are approaching? The video also lags a bit. You do not get clear video and audio until maybe 5-10 seconds into the recording. The actual video function is cool and works well when someone is at your door. That part seems to be the most solid. The battery life is not as good as they claim. Two days use and it is already in the 80% range after a full charge. I see it lasting maybe a month per charge. You also can not do video on demand when you want to which is a major oversight. Why the hell not? There does not seem to be anything better on the market for now so I guess I'll keep using this until they improve it with a Ring 2.0. Also, I can't get the chime to connect to my wifi network no matter what I try.",I was pretty excited for this doorbell but it's not anywhere near ...

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Nov-16,Regular Shopper,"Great idea, but constantly drops connections making the item unusable.  The Ring device is also VERY complicated to get it reconnected to your wifi without having to re-do the set up process again. Disappointing. When it comes to clarity and storage of images the item is lacking. During the day, the images are fairly great. At night, however, is another concern. Images freeze and are very blurry. One night (rather late) a person walked to my door. I was unable to see who the person was because although the ring alerted me, the image could not be viewed. I was away from home and ended up having to call the police to ensure things were alright. If the device would have worked without issue, I could have skipped the need to contact the police. An additional concern with the device is that Images captured must be accessed fairly immediately. After a few moments images go to storage (paid for separately) and cannot be accessed.  (I ended up paying for the service to get the images, which turned out not to be available).  Further, when trying to check the device at random times, images don't often appear. Customer service is a concern as well. I contacted them for parts that were missing from my device on delivery from Amazon, as well as to get answers to a few other questions. The process seemed almost futile. To date (almost 2 months later) I still have not received the replacement parts. In general, the concept of the item is a good idea, but the Ring definitely needs more work. Having connections that constantly drop, images that are frequently frozen or inaccessible, paid storage which will only store 6 months of images (in separate subscriptions for each device instead of all Ring devices), and  poor customer service, don't make this an ideal product. Definitely take a look at other devices before purchase. The security of your home and family are at concern. Hopefully, Ring will upgrade the device and software soon. Until then, I must sadly rate the product as two stars.",Consider other devices first. ...
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,16-Jun-16,Jonathan,"It is an expensive upgrade to your current doorbell but worth the investment.  When someone presses the doorbell within a matter of 3 or 4 seconds every device you have installed the app on will notify you that someone is at the door.  You can pull up the camera and see who it is and if you want to talk to them there is 2 way communication available.  This works well whether you are on your home network or away from home.  The box comes with all the hardware you need to install it.  I would recommend hard wiring it to your existing doorbell wiring if that is an option since you will also be able to use the new feature they rolled out called ""Live View"" which allows for on demand viewing. It also works with IFTT, if you are into home automation you can have a doorbell ring initiate other actions in your house like turning on lights.  The motion detection feature tends to be a little oversensitive and will definitely pick up big trucks driving down the street.",A worthwhile upgrade

It has been a life saver to have the iPhone and Apple Watch alert me any time someone is ringing the front doorbell. I have used it wired and on battery and while wired, it tracks motion and alerts me. It is hard to fine tune it to my yard with so many cars traveling down the street but I finally got it down to a reasonable level. The motion detection eats the battery so I turned it off while it was on battery power. I expected a long lag between the ring and notification but I was recently on vacation and I was alerted to someone at the front door and they were still at the door so it is definitely quicker than WeMo and Canary for motion alerts.

The Ring Video Doorbell is astonishing! This is my first device of this type so I have no other similar doorbell to compare it to. Here is my experience since installation in July 2015: Ring contains all you need in a very nicely presented package/kit and is very simple to install. There is no need to concern yourself about polarity if you decide to hardwire it because it mimics the polarity of your installed doorbell. If you decide to operate on battery only, it is designed to maintain a charge for an insanely long time, which varies according to your usage and settings. It looks great and visitors will notice it right away. My recommendation is to hardwire this if possible. If your wiring needs work it’s a good idea to get it fixed…the features, like being able to hear your doorbell without having your mobile device at the ready, is a huge convenience factor. Also, there is no need to worry about battery charging, as the power is supplied to, and trickle charges the Ring. I keep a spare mobile device on at home so as not to have to always depend on my phone to answer the door. Due to my floor plan, the combination of the spare mobile device, my phone, and the house doorbell, I don’t really require a Ring Chime, which is Ring.Com’s accessory that acts as a bell/chime for really spacious digs, or for those that don’t hardwire the Ring and have to depend on their mobile devices to hear the announcement. I had no issues with WiFi. The notice was less than two seconds. This may be due to the fact that my router is 15 ft from the Ring. The reviews indicate that some are having latency issues and this may be due to router proximity. I turned off iphone WIFi and tested it on LTE (four bars) and there was only about a three second difference in latency. I can certainly live with an extra three seconds, especially knowing that I don't have to worry about racing to the door in time as one does with a traditional doorbell. The first time I answered the Ring I was in a store and was astonished to hear it ring in my shopping cart. I was able to answer in a flash without them even knowing I wasn’t home.  You can even answer the door in bed if you want to. The video and audio is amazing. The HD does a great job in presenting the background (love to look at the clouds in the video sometime…. is that a raven or a baby dragon up there?) The audio picked up some visitors whispering about what was growing in the flowerpots by the door. They never did realize they were being recorded. My husband, who is in law enforcement, showed a video to one of his co-workers and without hesitation they said they would order one that night. That brings me to the security features. I’m sure that most of the time the events being recorded…motion detection and rings…are innocent but there may be that one time that it would have been a good idea to have audio and video of a not-so-innocent visit to your property. That video is stored in the cloud, and also available to save to your device to review again later. The developers are very diligent about improving the device and you can expect several welcome enhancements in the near future such as video on demand, video management, web access among others. They seem to want to blow the competition out of the water.",Highly Recommend !!!!!

Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell satin nickel. I was excited to get a video doorbell. This model allows you to see, hear, and communicate with your front door (or any door) from anywhere in the world via the phone app (I'm using the iPhone app). Installation: Before installing, you'll have to charge the unit via USB and set it up on the phone app. I unscrewed my old doorbell, which was hardwired, and installed the Ring doorbell in less than 15 minutes. It even comes with a Ievel to make sure it's straight. It will work if it is not hardwired, but you'll need recharge it every few months. If it is hardwired, you may need to install the little diode if you're using the wifi chime. I did that, but it caused buzzing from my old wired doorbell. I took off the diode and it works fine. Using it: The app tells me when there is motion at the door. You can set the distance for the doorbell to sense via infrared motion. It records all movement. If you pay $3 a month or $30 a year, it will save all your videos for 6 months and you can download them. You can also talk with whoever is outside your door if they ring the bell or not. There is even a live feed to see what's happening at your house. I also checked out a beta Neighborhood watch part of the app. There you can see postings from people in your area.

The phone application works well and seems free of bugs. However, in practice (for me at least) by the time the 'call' got to me on my phone the person at the door was already gone. After the fact you can go to the Ring website to review the video that the Ring doorbell records when the button is pushed or it detects motion but be forewarned that (after the 30 day trial period) you will be asked to pay a monthly fee to use their cloud storage for video. If you don't pay then no video. There is no way to configure the Ring to use your own cloud or local storage and there is no API ('tho Ring support says they are considering one). I refuse to pay $36/yr for a doorbell's proprietary cloud storage so the device is now useless for security recording purposes.

I've shown several people and all are considering purchasing. A couple of things: 1) I will give it a few months, but it does not appear the units battery charge will last a year as advertised. I've not yet had the unit for 30 days and I'm at 68% remaining battery charge. Maybe it's due to high usage as a result of testing, playing with the settings, etc.; 2) It was difficult to slide the unit onto my wall mount without exerting considerable pressure on the unit. I finally did it and it's as solid as a rock but pained me to put so much pressure on the unit; 3) Lastly, I am not looking forward to removing the unit to charge it because of #2 above. It would be nice to have access to the charging port while the unit is still attached to the wall mount. The port is located on the backside of the unit which requires that the unit be removed from the wall mount to charge. That's it for now but will continue to update over time. I have a pretty sophisticated alarm system with cameras inside/outside the house and Ring makes a great addition to my system. I am contemplating purchasing another unit for my back door.

However it still needs some tweaking & further minor functionality  features. Since I'm disabled in a wheelchair, my usual couriers already know, that it will take me a few minutes, to respond - if I'm home. There is a 2 minute delay between the doorbell being pushed & the notifications actually opening to respond back on my android phone, however it's a much faster notification on my iPad. I think I will need to purchase a higher speed WiFi modem to support all the newest WiFi enabled products in my home, ie: smartphone, tablet, iPad, printer, doorlocks, doorbell, motion sensors, security cameras, etc - all WiFi enabled gadgets. It might help speed up my notifications to my phone from the ring mounted outside my front door if I'm vamping up my speed via my WiFi modem. Ring still has some quirks, but they're working on it slowly, operative word slowly. Eventually it might be where a lot, of people are content. They're now even coming out, sometime this Summer, with a wireless speaker to conjoin along w/ring w/o having to use your phone/tablet. Which I think is pretty neat!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Dec-16,Alison CO,"I was delighted with the Ring doorbell for the most part; it picks up motion as close or as far as you adjust on your Ring App, and records motion and doorbell ringing videos if you wish.  I also like the communication with the person at the door via my Ring App, if I cannot get to the door for whatever reason.  Unfortunately, I have to give it a rating of 2 Stars because I am very frustrated with Ring's not resetting itself after a power outage or, in my case, frequent power surges.  The slightest surge, even if it's for 1-2 seconds, causes the Ring to go offline and there is nothing you can do manually from the Ring App without going out to the Ring Doorbell, using a very, very small screwdriver to take the cover off, which is very awkward. This takes a good deal of time, and then you have to press the orange button on the back of the Ring cover, while someone else simultaneously resets the entire Ring Doorbell on the cell phone via the App, just like you are completely starting over, renaming it, finding the wireless info, and re-inputting all information including the Wi-Fi password.  I understand some of this is for our protection, but this is very inconvenient re-setting it over and over and over again. There must be a more convenient way to do this. Very frustrating. So if you are considering this item, know that it does as advertised, but having to re-set everything every time there's even so much of a power surge, is not good in my opinion.","As advertised, but a headache when there are power outages and/or surges!"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Apr-16,Super-Elastic,"I have both Skybell and Ring. Skybell works very well, Ring doesn't. Here are my gripes with Ring: 1. There is a subscription fee for Ring, but Skybell offers better basic service without a subscription. 2. Skybell has technical support. Ring does not. Ring Ring's technical support number and after quite a while on hold, you will receive an offer for a call back. Ring, Inc. did call back, *with a robotic voice saying no technical support is available* (WTF? Why bother? That's more irritating than not getting a call back). The second time I called, I also accepted the offer of a call back, but never got one, which was somehow vaguely more satisfying, or should I say less exasperating. I have not been able to reach Ring technical support! 3. You cannot view a live video feed unless the doorbell button has been pushed or motion is activated. On Skybell you can watch a live video feed at will at any time. Want to see if there is a package sitting on your porch? Unless the package moves or it jumps up and pushes the doorbell button, no you can't with Ring. Edit: after digging further I see that Live View is only available if Ring is hard-wired. Mine is hard-wired, as proven by the fact that it rings the doorbell mounted on my wall. Nevertheless, the app shows that it is running on battery power, when it is not. 4. Ring touts ADT Pulse integration. What does it consist of? If you're using the Pulse app, deep within the menu you can push a button on your screen and open the Ring app. And if you're using the Ring app, deep within the menu structure you can push a button on your screen and open the Pulse app--after you enter your Pulse login credentials. Why not just open either app when you want them; it's far simpler? How totally lame is that? 5. This is a matter of taste and personal opinion: Skybell looks better and is smaller. 6. There is a new product coming, so even if you still want a Ring you should wait for the new, improved Ring. 7. Ring is cheaply made. Ring is made in China. Skybell is at least assembled in the USA.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,28-Sep-15,Ray S,"I purchased two Ring Doorbells; one for placement adjacent to the front door and one for the back door.  I purchased the one for the front door on July 27, 2015 and the other a few days ago.  The front of my house is about 25 feet from the street.  During the day a car passes by the front door an the average of one every ten minutes.  I have found the motion detection very hard to set.  Ideally I wanted the to be able to detect people approaching the front door or people walking in either direction (horizontally to the front of the house) to be detected but not for vehicles to be detected. I have had numerous emails to customer support but this was not able to be accomplished.  However I now have it set so that I get on the average of about five vehicles per day recorded.  Most of them are vans or trucks or school buses.  I am satisfied with this setting.  It is set to about 10 feet.  No amount of hard resets or blanking out zones or decreasing or increasing the zone range was able to tweak this any better.  Customer support was good and quick and they had some excellent suggestions.  I just do not think the motion application in its present state is capable of doing any better because of my home proximity to the street. The Ring function is excellent as is the video and audio. The ""intercom"" function is great.  I had fun when I talked to a politician at the door when I was at work. I was able to see him well while I talked to him  I have also watched several deliveries to my front door. Setting up to my Wi-Fi was easy and took about five minutes.  I have a Wi-Fi speed test application on my iPhone 6.  The lowest upload result out of 10 readings was 11.66 Mbps and the lowest download was 18.59 Mbps at either the front or back door. The second Ring Doorbell  is at the back door and is being used solely for motion detection.  I have had it set up for about two days now.  The back yard is completely fenced in and there is no one visible from where it is set up because there is a six foot stockade fence.  I have the motion detection set up to its maximum range.  Motion was detected two times this afternoon.  The only thing I could see moving in the video was the shade on my house from the trees moving.  I will be experimenting with the settings in the coming days. I have ADT and these two Ring Doorbells add another layer of security. I have vinyl siding and I had to get a ""D4 and D5 Surface Mounting Block, model # BLK040H04H, internet # 202674773 from Home Depot. http://www.homedepot.com/p/Cellwood-6-625-in-x-6-625-in-White-D4-and-D5-Surface-Mounting-Block-BLK040H04H/202674773?keyword=202674773.  I attached the plate with one,  two and a half inch galvanized screw, to the side of my house.  Then I attached the Ring Doorbell  plate using the four screws that came with the doorbell.  The surface plate was necessary so that the doorbell plate could be flush with the siding.  If I had tried to attach the doorbell with only the parts that came with it, it would have broken off from the siding soon after installation. I also purchased the Chime and the  WiFi was easily to set up as well.",I am satisfied with this setting

They should consider adding a way to adjust the camera lens during setup. For example, if your door has a wall nearby, you’ll have to do something to point the entire device away from the wall.  Otherwise any picture you have will contain the wall covering half of it.  Not very useful.  They should also reduce the cost.  These should never cost more than $100.","Works well, but..."

This would be an absolutely amazing product but there are flaws. In my experience so far, The Ring does what is advertised. The motion sensors will alert to motion, even cats that walk by, and the app works just fine with no problems for me. The only issues I have is the inability to customize the tones within the app itself. I'm not talking about the separate chime that you can plug in at your house, but the notification alerts from the app on your phone. The motion alert is a windchime sound and the ring alert is that of a doorbell. I really wish I could change these sounds myself. Also, why doesn't Ring allow you to randomly view your live feed at anytime you want? Why do you need to wait to get an alert in order to see from the Ring? Another issue is not having a choice to store your video. You HAVE to use their Cloud service in order to see previously saved alerts. If you choose not to use it, then you will only be able to view your alerts as they happen in real time. It's great if you're quick enough and can get screenshots, but in order to view past video, you're going to have to pay $3 a month or $30 a year.

Tried to look at several forums etc to resolve so not 18 month later we have been using it stand alone with no real doorbell.  Would not buy Ring product again.,Doew not work with doorbell wiring to charge or activate house doorbell.
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Oct-15,MMoo,"I'm VERY pleased with this purchase.  I'm also pleased with the speed in which I'm notified of both motion and the ringing of the doorbell.  After reading reviews I was anticipating issues here.  I think the potential issue may be more closely related to the users wifi signal strength vs the Ring product.  My wifi unit is downstairs and could have been an issue.  But we have a wifi extender on the second floor (main living space) from ADT specifically to drive better video performance through our kitchen wireless camera.  Those experiencing issues may want to try such a device, it's worked wonders for our ADT camera (and possibly the doorbell too). My only critique would be the poor quality of the screws.  Sad I have to say anything negative about such a great experience and it's the darn screws.... Oh well.  I broke the first 2 screwing into wood trim board before getting 4 from my own stash.  If Ring wants to continue to offer the complete kit to help installation, I recommend a better quality screw or adding a small drill bit to pilot holes into the wood before attempting the screws.  I found the kit unnecessary but realize that not everyone has all the tools for installation.  And in that case, I would note up front that a power drill is necessary (for at least the drill bits).",5 Star purchase!

I’ve only had it about 2 weeks and whenever anyone is at my door it’s so slow that it activates when they already walked away or doesn’t activate when someone is in the perimeter. I am so disappointed and it really wasn’t worth me purchasing at this point. I will be calling company because at this point it’s not doing what it’s supposed too.,A little disappointed

Let me preface by saying I live in a rowhouse in downtown Baltimore. I'm giving this device 4 stars because it is an incredible value, performs far better than expected (based on reviews) and it's nearly perfect for my needs. This kind of tech makes me so happy. I was looking at spending $300-$400 for some wireless cameras when I came across this device. This covers what I wanted and more for a lot less. Pros: Wifi enabled with easy setup. Incredibly easy. I use a Nexus 6p on Verizon. The important thing is to turn off wifi notifications and mobile data before going to set up your device. No cables. You only need to charge the device every couple months and it only takes a few hours (uses micro usb). High quality video with night vision. Two way audio with decent quality. Motion sensor camera capabilities. Cloud video storage. Remote access. I'm expecting a package today and I'll be able to direct the UPS person to where they can drop the package whether I am home or not. Cons: Motion camera isn't perfect, there's a delay when picking up activity to when the recording begins. However I feel if something needed to be recorded there would be enough time to catch someone in the act. The sensitivity is questionable as well. Kind of bulky and attracts children. Live streaming is currently unavailable for android. Should be up the end of May.",The perfect solution for a city block.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,2-May-16,ptr,"Great customer service. When installing this doorbell, I predrilled some holes that were too small for the provided screws using my own bits. I then proceeded to use a POWER DRILL and broke 3 of the 4 screws heads while installing it with this method because of too much torque. Everything mounted fine and worked. However, upon reviewing the image from the Ring app, I notice now that I wanted the camera lower than where I mounted it to get more of the person in the camera perspective.  It would thus require me to dismount the back plate removing the broken screws with a plier but possibly breaking the backplate. I notified Ring customer service of my mistake and desired intentions to lower the unit. I get a NEW, FREE BACKPLATE PRIORITY MAILED to me ASAP WITH ALL THE NEW HARDWARE SCREWS to support my 2nd attempt with a hand screwdriver now. Amazing customer service.  Needless to say I will be purchasing 3 new stick up cams from their website w/ the free promotion of solar panel rechargers by my next paycheck to cover the other sides of my home.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Sep-15,SD,"Update Jan 12, 2017:  So I ran into an issue with my Ring whereby it no longer activated my interior doorbell despite the fact that it was hardwired.  I troubleshooted it and it appears to be a hardware issue.  Was dealing with support, and in about 4 emails they agreed it was a hardware issue and simply asked for my address, name, etc and said they would send a new one immediately.  I have to say, that's incredibly impressive customer service almost 1.5 years after the original purchase! Overall I'd have to say I'm quite pleased with this purchase, though I will update over the winter months should I have issues with inclement weather. Thus far, outside of occasional issues with the wifi signal in my house (fault of my router, not the doorbell) where the video doesn't come through and I have to reboot my router on rare occasions, I'd say that 90% of the time this doorbell works fine.  Chances are if you're getting too much pixelation and/or video not coming through, it is likely more your routers fault than the camera.  Video takes much more bandwidth than say surfing the net, so while you may think you have good wifi and it's not the issue, chances are if you run a speed test with a mobile device near where your Ring doorbell is when you're having issues you'll see the speed is too low as well.  I have replaced my actual door bell and hooked it up directly via low voltage power without a hitch. Some items that would make this a 5: 1. I had to install it on an angle due to where my doorbell was installed.  It comes with no hinges or brackets for what I have to imagine is a common install and it was painful trying to create my own. 2.  Would like the ability to simply turn on the camera at will via my phone, vs only when motion or the bell is rung. 3.  The motion detection is WAY too sensitive.  I have a couple of flower pots in front of my door about 5 feet away, and when it is slightly breezy even on the lowest settings I get notifications galore. 4. No ability to save video to your own internal network, and basically forces you to pay the $30/year which will no doubt go up over time. The only other thing I would warn is that go into this knowing that the actual picture quality is nothing like what is shown on the website.  There is a ton of barrel distortion and fish eye, which is simply the reality of the lens used which enables it to take a much more expansive view.  Without this lens type you'd have to install the doorbell closer to eye level vs 3.5-4 feet off the ground to see faces.  But the videos on the Ring.com website showing a perfectly rectangular view is no where near reality.  The view is more like looking through a circular peep hole.","Great product, a few improvements would put it at a 5"

It has a motion detector, and whenever anyone comes up our steps, we hear chiming (soft and pleasant) and can see who is there.  We can set how far out we want the motion detector to reach, so that only people coming up our steps are covered.  Also, when I'm away from home, the soft chimes let me know when someone is at the door.  We can see who is there or who has been there, as there is a video recording which we can keep or delete.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Feb-16,Zach Goossens,"I'd say this is a good idea, but the implementation is a little imperfect. First, I did get a dud on my first delivery, but Ring customer service was excellent and once they determined that the unit was malfunctioning, they sent me a replacement very quickly.  I can't fault them for that.  The replacement works much better and has not had the problems I had with the first one they shipped me. The problem I do have with the Ring is that the motion sensor is just too sensitive.  I've got it at the lowest setting and it is still frequently activated by anything larger than a full-size pickup that passes my house.  I get motion sensor hits all the time on buses, or panel trucks driving by.  If you intend to put this on a door that faces road that gets any significant traffic, you may have a similar problem.  With all the false alarms, you tend to disregard the alerts and it becomes a lot less useful If someone actually came to my door and did something sketchy, the alert would probably get lost in all the false alarms and I would probably not notice.  It also drains the battery faster with all the unnecessary activity. The video doorbell functionality works very well though.  The sound and video are good, and if that's what you're looking for, it does a great job.  You can communicate with someone at your door even if your'e not there.  If you don't need the motion sensor, or if you intend to install it in a place without a lot of traffic, it will work well.","Video doorbell aspect is great, motion sensor is not as good."

The biggest reason I bought this item was for package thieves, which requires the motion detection to function properly. It does not. Yes, I have changed sensitivity and zones, but it doesn't help. The sensitivy is either too high where traffic will set it off or it's so low that people can be 1-2 feet away and I will not get a notification. It simply doesn't work well. Even the doorbell function doesn't work the majority of the time. For example, the video doesn't load on the app. I just get a spinning wheel and all my internet connections are extremely fast, over 100 mbps for my devices and 30-50 mbps for my 2.4 ghz connection.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,20-Sep-15,GREGORY GWIZDOWSKI,"Until I installed Ring Doorbell, I operated my tax business in my basement based office with frequent interruptions to answer my front door.  An intercom did help to notify clients that I was on my way to let them in.  But now - with ""Ring"" - I can see and talk to whoever is at the door (wanted or unwanted) - without leaving my desk. Customer service has been totally helpful and very receptive to suggestions I presented: 1) develop an interface (or some type of mirror app).to project video to my computer monitor. 2) give ability to save video capture to my personal cloud drive 3) give ability to activate camera function at any time 4) better ability to filter or change motion detection alerts The only negative problems I encountered was due to my phone settings and my dual band router being located in the basement.  To overcome the weak wi-fi signal, I recommend installing a ""powerline"" wi-fi range extender if your video transmission is coming in choppy with long lag time.  Also, my cell phone was somehow switching from 2.4 gig to 5.0 gig (which Ring does not use).  To overcome this, I went to my phones wi-fi setup and set it to forget the 5.0 network connection.

I'll probably end up setting up a dedicated AP on the other side of the wall for the doorbell. It seems like even if you're on the same network, the doorbell still sends the feed to the ring servers which adds latency, especially up here in Alaska. Customer support is top notch.

It installs incredibly easily, and their step-by-step instructions work well.

With young kids around the house, being able to see who's coming and going while we're out and about gives us an added level of comfort.  When we were at dinner and noticed that 3 kids had come over to play with the boys, we called our babysitter to let her know it was OK if she wanted to send them home if she wasn't comfortable with the number of kids over.  The motion recording and cloud storage are also great security features. Their customer service is among the best I've ever worked with (and I've worked with a few).

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Mar-16,DieselRN1980,"The Ring doorbell is Fantastic! The HD camera provides high quality pictures and really good sound. They've added motion detection that works great once you find the proper range to be triggered by motion. I'm pretty handy when it comes to home improvement, but the installation was so simple. There is a great installation video on YouTube so you can see how it's done before you tackle the it. I would recommend getting a Ring Chime if you're not gonna hardwire into your existing doorbell. When I installed my parents Ring Doorbell I noticed they didn't have their phone with them and would miss when someone was at the front door. The Ring Chime fixed that problem. I installed a Ring Chime on the first floor and now they can hear when someone rings the doorbell if they don't have their phone. The software has gotten better since I've installed our first Ring Doorbell. They update the software as new options become available. You can fine tune your motion detection to send an alert if someone is waking up from 5 feet to 30 feet away from the Ring Doorbell. You can also adjust the frequency of the motion notifications, or tune them off completely. The color options available for the Ring doorbell cover a majority of the popular finishes. We love the Ring cloud subscription. It's worth every penny to be able to review your triggered motion videos or answered Ring videos. You just might catch someone stealing you package off your porch.",Ring Doorbell is worth every penny

The produce is very easy to set up and install, including the app.  It is simple to use.  I don't like that it is slow to wake when it detects movement, but if someone is mingling or standing in front of it, it should work fine. Initially, it appears that there have been a few times I've walked past it and it not detect any movement.  It does add comfort knowing that I have it.",So far so good
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,5-Jun-15,OnlineKnowHow.com,"Hope that my review would help with your Ring installation. After a couple days of pain, I finally figured it out. My first device was installed quickly but notification was coming with a huge delay. Tried to remove device on the phone app and setup again and notification stopped working completely. Called support. They helped me to setup again. The trick was to ""forget"" ring network in my phone wi-fi settings. Ring worked fine until I put it on the bracket. Called support again. They promised to send me a new bracket. I decided to replace the whole device. Got a new one from Amazon. Setup was quick, but device stopped sending notifications once I put it on the bracket! Tried to experiment by removing from the bracket and holding it my hands behind the door. It worked with a huge notification delay. And finally, the Eureka moment. It looks to me that wi-fi antenna is at the back of Ring and it is losing a signal once it is set on the bracket. The solution was simple - I put $17 Medialink Wireless N150 Travel Router to the outlet near the door, repeated setup on my phone to connect to a new wi-fi network. Worked like a charm. No notification delays  and excellent video quality. Ring likes a strong wi-fi signal:-) Dah.. So, I am giving it 4 stars.",Installation advice

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,26-Jan-16,Jason Horvath,"I highly recommend the Ring Doorbell... it's been such a great addition to our home.  The capabilities it offers are great.  I've found it helpful in monitoring the activity at home while I'm away... I've always wondered who comes by the house during the work week - well, I've been able to see each and every person.  We do live in a new development with a lot of construction taking place so it's helpful to know the faces who are making a presence around our home - if they do or do not ring the doorbell.  It's also great to see what deliveries we've gotten - it's easy to tell what has been dropped off (or not)... and then if someone were to come take the dropped off package, we'd at least have a video of it.  The $30/yr cloud recording is a no-brainer in my opinion... it's very reasonable and really accents what the Ring doorbell is all about - additional security / piece of mind.  Additionally, our front door doesn't have  ""peep hole"", so having the Ring enables us to see who is at the front door before we open it... just some additional piece of mine. The installation was a breeze (and the instructional Ring video was helpful).  Keep in mind that we are in a newly built house so the wiring of our existing doorbell is new - I'm not sure if ""older"" doorbell systems would be any different, ours just happens to be new.  Our installation was into a stucco - I wasn't too excited about drilling 4 holes in our new stucco, but I did, and it was fine...the drill bit that came with the Ring worked great although it did get chewed up pretty quickly... I wasn't going to be able to drill much more with it (i.e. if I needed to drill another hole due to a mistake). As with any cutting edge product, there are certainly improvement opportunities, but it still yields a 5-star rating in my opinion.  One of the improvements, which I believe should be able to be done through a firmware update, is that of being able to access the camera at any time (i.e. waking the camera with your phone/tablet/computer) as currently the video feed only works when there is motion or a ring.  It'd be great if you could push a button on  the Ring app to just ""view"" what's going on in your front yard - to see what the weather is if you are driving home from work (20 miles away)... that said, while not critical, it'd be a nice option. I've included a screen grab from the Ring app of someone ringing our doorbell - as you can see our porch is recessed and can be a bit dark, but the Ring does a great job adjusting the light to capture everything within the porch, however, it does then overexpose the area outside of our porch. Highly recommend!  The customer service has been great and the product is amazing!",What A Great Product!

Just what I was looking for. Instructions were clear and simple. I was able to install it and set it up entirely by myself. When I had a few questions the support was excellent.

When I first installed the bracket is was not flat due to the uneven wall and the clips did not line up with the doorbell. I had to adjust the mounting tension to get it to finally fit - took about 15 minutes of adjustment but finally got it to snap on. 2.

I used to travel away from home a lot and being able to answer the doorbell while at work via my cell (yes they have an app for Ring) and if there is any motion in front of my house I can just pull up the image from the app when I’m alert. It rang while I was out of town with a coworker and he was like what is that so I showed him. He was like the image is so clear and I explained to him how it works. He bought one for his house immediately. Same thing happened with my brother he bought two one for the front and one for the back. Everyone is happy. I had to change my Wi-Fi router which means I had to change my all of devices to reconnect to the new router. With the Ring Wi-Fi enabled Doorbell, I just had to remove the two screws from the bottom that help hold it in place and press the orange button on the back and use my cellphone to change to the new network and just put in back.

I called to get replacements but they did not arrive until I called 2 more times. Then, I was sent a different model (looked completely different on the back and did not require a diode for wired installation). After several hours of trying that to work I called again and was told I needed several extra steps before it could be hooked up wired (not shown on the installation video). I finally got it to work with my indoor doorbell and got a video at the door. That lasted for 2 days. Now the motion detector goes off all the time (10 times today) despite me reducing the sensitivity as much as possible. The worst thing is that when it goes off, most of the time the live view will not come up. The occasions when it does come up, it takes so long that an intruder or thief would have to be in a wheelchair for me to catch them.

Schmidl,"It is pretty much useless except as a normal doorbell. It does ring my doorbell (just as my doorbell did before) when someone presses the button. But it does not notify my phone until a few minutes later. Same for the motion sensor. In addition, the motion sensor is inconsistent, both missing notifications of people standing right in front of it, as well as notifying me of cars driving down our street past our house (with the motion zone set on 5 ft, the closest zone only). Overall, not impressed.","Delayed notifications, inconsistent motion sensor"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,9-Dec-15,Recman51,"I don't write many reviews.  I believe this is my first on Amazon and I've been a prime customer for about 8 years.  Quite simply, this is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made.  A few weeks ago I got an alert on my phone that a young man was at my front door.  I ""answered the door"" from my office using my Ring video doorbell.  He was startled that I had him under surveillance because the door was closed and no ""apparent"" cameras were visible.  He went into a spiel about raising money for a school project and claimed to be a neighborhood kid - the ""son of Jim and Nancy Jenkins a few streets over"".  He had no paperwork, no identification, nothing.  I told him I was busy at the moment cleaning my gun collection and asked if he could come back at a later time (I was suspicious and wanted to gather more info and capture it on the RING when he returned).  He said he would be back later that day.  He never returned.  I later found out from neighbors there was a group of young men attempting same thing on various streets in the neighborhood.  Verified my suspicions as well....there is no ""Jim and Nancy Jenkins"" in our area.  It was a scam and perhaps worse...a prelude to a robbery if we weren't home.  Money well spent.  Picture is good, audio is good, and I love the fact that motion detection range is adjustable.  Took me a while to dial it in to just the right distance because for a while the IR was picking up cars going by in the street (hot engines or just heat in general).  It is especially helpful during the holidays as I know the moment a package has been placed on my doorstep.  Gonna try and steal it before I get home?  Go ahead...you're on video.  Boom.","RING thwarts scammer, potential burglary"

Paid for itself the first weekend in use.  I have a bed and breakfast in the Poconos.  I was out running errands and had someone arrive without a reservation.  Had I not had this doorbell I would have missed them.  I was able to communicate easily through the device and accept their reservation.  Doorbell is rechargeable. I installed it back in July 2015 and didn't have to charge it till jan 2016.  It was very easy.  It even sent me a text when the battery was low.  So many uses for the ring doorbell product.  Wish I had this for when my kids were younger arriving home after school. Chime extenders are also great.  I can place them where I want in the bnb and even disable them individually with my phone if needed.  I also found that I could ring them remotely.  I have freedom with the ability to answer my door remotely and piece of mind with security. Can't wait to try the new stick cams!,Highly Recommend The Ring Products!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,3,Reviewed in the United States ,30-Nov-15,Brian Lucas,"I like the Ring Doorbell app but it has its downsides. #1 the motion sensor responds too late. By the time someone is walking to the door to drop off mail or a flyer or something, the motion sensor kickso in as they're walking away and you never get to see their faces. #2 there is no live viewing which is highly desired. Theven competition has this option. #3 You have to purchase their cloud space. It's either $3 a month or $30 a year. It may not be much and I may elect to purchase it however they give you no other choice like uploading to your own cloud or sending the file via Dropbox or something. This is also a deficiency as compared to Ring's competition. Other than those negatives, the positives are very good. Easy user interface, great style, and has the potential to dominate the market if it would fix those major deficiencies.",Good but could be better

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,19-Sep-15,Sailon,"This is a great idea if it worked but it is totally worthless if you live in a house that has walls made of anything other than paper. If your house has a brick exterior, that will dramatically reduce the WiFi signal to the unit which will result in choppy video/audio and extended delay times before you are notified of a visitor... IF you get one at all.  In my case, I was not even aware anyone rang the doorbell, forget audio/video. Customer service is pretty much a joke.  Better be prepared to wait 20 to 30 minutes before you can get a human and that experience will not be very fulfilling either.  OR, you may choose to leave your phone number to be called back sometime in the next 24 hours.  At that point, what are the odds that you will still be at your house ready to work on the problem? WiFi signal strength is the big issue here and I suggest you run a speed test by your front door where the unit will be located with the door CLOSED.  Then get on the phone to their customer service and leave them a message to call you back.  Give them the WiFi speed at the preferred unit location an see if they think that it will work.  They could easily publish a minimum WiFi speed for the unit to function but that would result in their sales dropping like a stone. If the walls to your home are paper thin and your wireless router is just inside the door, winner, winner, chicken dinner!  Your video doorbell will PROBABLY work (no guarantees here either since many come from the factory defective, read all the one star reviews).  They also provide no solutions or suggestions to overcoming this common problem with their product.  If they come up with a work around, get back with me. I even went to the trouble to add a WiFi extender and increased the WiFi signal throughout my house but not enough to overcome my outside walls.  That did benefit my signal strength throughout the house but still left the Ring unit as a paper weight. The good news is that I bought this thing through Amazon Prime and those guys are THE BEST!  Amazon Prime gets 5 stars as usual while this product would get zero stars but I only has one choice.  I have money burning a hole in my pocket when a product like this is introduced that will function as advertised but this one has a LONG way to go!","It just isn't ready for Prime Time, buyer beware!"

That’s thing is heavy, what could be possible inside?  Did they mess up and send me some iron weight pate? So first thing you notice when you open the package, this thig (ring bell) is heavy and made of metal. It does not look like a cheap plastic thing coming from china (no offense to anyone) Then second thing you notice is  there is all the tools and the screw to install it. There is even a level to be sure that you install it right! Finally the app is just amazing to install, everything is quite simple AND there is video incorporated in the app to show you how to install it How cool is that? You can just remove your old bell and replace it with the ring bell. You’ll have both sound, the regular one and an alert on your iPhone. Alert take 1 to 4 seconds to be show on your iPhone so it’s ok from there, there is a two way speaker of good quality and the video You know exactly what is happening Very simple to use once installed The motion sensor works quite well and you can choose the distance.

I connected to a wired doorbell location, so I did not need to recharge the battery. The product works exactly as promised -- when someone rings the doorbell our cell phones (Android for us, works with iPhone too) notify us. Even if we are 500 miles away, we can see and talk to the person at the door. The video quality is not HD, but it certainly is clear enough. We've used it to ""sign"" for FedEx packages when we were not home, but the FedEx driver talked to us and left the package at our door.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Aug-15,Irina Voloshin,"This product was exactly what we were looking for to solve a problem with our townhouse setup: allowing us to see who is at our door when not on the ground floor (which we rarely are), talk to them if necessary, and avoid running down three flights of stairs if not someone we wanted to chat with at our door. The bonus of being able to have multiple users receive the notifications and answer the door chyme, turn off notifications easily when traveling or at work, and be able to receive notifications when out of town are fantastic features. That said, were I to review the product in the early weeks after it arrived, I would have given it a much lower rating. Truth be told, installation is a tad tougher than indicated for most setups (our wood panel siding added some difficulty, but I am handy and had the necessary tools) and getting the product to work with our WIFI had some hiccups. When I contacted customer service they responded quickly, made some changes to our account (including throwing in two months of free cloud service for testing purposes) and the device has worked seamlessly ever since. We are completely satisfied with the Ring doorbell and have recommended it to friends and family who have come over or seen the notifications light up on our phone while at dinner or the bar. The device and cloud service are much cheaper than other options, with easier installation and setup compared to getting your home security system setup with cameras and a recording device.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Mar-17,Steven Ebstein,"I purchased the Ring video doorbell to enhance my home's security and deal with the rare occasions we wanted to screen our visitors or someone could not come to the door. Every advertised feature works as described. Before installing the Ring, I tried another doorbell before getting the Ring - the Zmodo (not the Greet). I returned that doorbell because it took too long to alert both my Android phone and the internal device (their wifi extender buzzes when the doorbell senses a visitor), around 5 seconds, and video capture was significantly delayed from when someone approached the door. In contrast, the Ring alerts my phone a second or two after someone comes within range and starts capturing video at the same time. I bought a Chime and that provides a nice audio alert inside the house. The audio alert can be different for a visitor who triggers motion detection and when someone actually presses the doorbell. I followed the instructions for setting the motion detection. In the month I have owned it, I have not noticed any false alarms due to motion detection. The Ring is installed in our vestibule and does not trigger on cars or pedestrians (25' away). As far as I know, it has always triggered when someone entered the vestibule. The only notable flaw I found is that programming the Chime was not smooth. Whether due to latency to program the Chime with a new sound or volume or something else, it was difficult to reliably change the Chime sound or volume and took longer than it should have to get my choices. Since I was able to change the sound and volume to what I wanted, and since the system has operated stably in the month I've owned it, I kept the rating at 5 stars.",Works as advertised

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Dec-15,Clifford Meyer,"We purchased a Ring Doorbell and it works exactly as advertised. When the doorbell is pushed it rings on all 4 of our devices: 2 iPhones, 2 iPads. I had a question about installing it and customer service was excellent. I found that it was best to chat with them as opposed to calling them. It turns out the issue was very minor, you need to push down HARD to connect the Ring to the base that is attached to the wall. What I am most impressed with is the potential. Both the IOS app and the firmware on the device can be upgraded. Ring apparently has many software improvements in the works that will continually improve the unit. We also purchased Chime which added a doorbell. It was a no brainer. Basically plug and play. We had previously talked to a Security firm and they wanted $ 1900 for a similar solution. This was a very affordable alternative. The unit comes with a built in rechargeable battery and requires no wiring, although it can be directly wired into an existing low-voltage door bell. The video and voice interactions are stored in cloud and can be played on any device (phone, iPad or computer).",A very easy solution to Home Security.

Here’s why... 1) You have to purchase a monthly subscription from Ring to record video of who rang your doorbell. It’s free for the first few months but after that you pay. I didn’t know this when I purchased. It’s not hugely expensive but after spending $200 on this recording device, hooking it to my home WiFi (that I already pay for), and my cell phone  (yet another service bill ) why can’t this part just be FREE! It just feels greedy to me so I refuse to pay. 2) The battery on the Ring doesn’t stay charged for long and gets worse each month. In the beginning it needed to charge every month but now it’s every two weeks. Bottom line- not worth it unless you hard wire the Ring and pay the monthly service fee to Ring.",Buyer’s Remorse

First, the Ring does not allow the ability to view motion alerts without a monthly subscription, whereas the ZModo doorbell had local storage for viewing alerts for up to 24 hours. This may not seem like a big deal, but it became even more critical on another failing of the Ring...  There is a full minute lag on delivery of notifications to the app on the phone for motion or ring events, even when at home, on the same WiFi network. I repeatedly would get motion alert events, after I had walked past the Ring, into my house, and locked the front door. Not very useful, particularly when someone is at your front door. The ZModo consistently delivered near instantaneous alerts. Lastly, despite being hardwired, the Ring often went offline unexpectedly and would drain the battery fully before coming back online unless I took it off the mount, brought it inside and charged it manually. When in this mode, pressing the button would not ring my home's doorbell. Another issue I did not have with the ZModo. The Ring support tried to explain this away and blame me and my use of the device and the cold whether. Really? I live in Georgia... its just not that cold. Thanks but no thanks. Going back to my ZModo.","Power issues, notification lag, and required monthly subscription to see video events. Buy a ZModo instead!"

Installation:  Installation is very easy.  I was easily able to drill the required holes with the included drill bit.  The installation video included with the downloadable app was simple and affective in teaching the installation process. Configuration: Configuring the device is very easy.  The trick is adjusting the sensitivity of the device to avoid the motion detection sensor from constantly detecting cars or other things.  Once you get the device set to the right distance/sensitivity it is all good. Operation:  The camera has a great video resolution and provides a very clear picture via the app.  The ability to converse with someone at your door via the app is also very cool.  The mic/speaker on the doorbell are excellent. Overall:  Great product!  Can't wait to see what else this company comes up with.,Amazing Product!

A few examples of how it has delighted us: 1) During the holiday season, it was so nice to be notified when a package arrived and be able to either return home to retrieve it or ask a neighbor to collect the package for us so it didn't 'disappear'. On two occasions, we were able to interact with the delivery people and give them guidance on where to put the packages and one even let our interaction count as a signature so he could leave the package that would have otherwise been remitted back to the facility. 2) We've loved knowing who is at the door before opening it. It gives us piece of mind, especially knowing that if our younger children are at home alone they will know when to answer the door and when to not. Our youngest child pulls up the notification on his iPad and is no longer insecure about what to do when the bell rings. Incidentally, if we are away from home and a child does answer, we can see the whole interaction and talk to the visitor as well at the same time. 3) Similar to the above, we like having the ability to talk to the people at the door rather than just see who is there. This was one of the factors that influenced our decision to purchase Ring vs. its competition. We can let trusted visitors know that we aren't home but will be soon or we can address their needs remotely, and the camera image and quality are wonderful. Among the long list of smart products being built for homes right now, Ring is right at the top of the pecking order in terms of usefulness. It will endure at our home.",A Definite Keeper!

I have been able to witness a small number of issues on my front porch due to this product. I had UPS deliver a product in a box from Amazon, and then witnessed the USPS pick up the box and cart it away.  I was able to call the Postmaster General and inform them that a package was taken mistakenly by their delivery person.  15 minutes later the box was back at my door and all was good to go.  Without this doorbell, I would have had no idea what happened to the box and where it may have ended up. The only thing I have had an issue with was network issues when I tried using an Apple Airport Express Mac filtering to secure up my network a bit better.  I called tech support without even thinking about why it wasn't working and we were able to work through it and get me running again.

There was no issue and the diode was installed.  The whole installation took about 30 minutes because I had to build up area behind the Ring to provide a flat surface to mount the back plate.  Then, when I fitted the face plate over the backing, I found that it was difficult to have the face plate ""click"" into the back.  I questioned this with the help after I had installed the unit and was advised that it is tight, but becomes easier if you have to remove it to recharge the battery.  All in all, the installation was no difficulty and the help line was prompt and their advise was clear.  I did not have to wait long to see how the software worked via the internet.  I was out of town a day after installing the Ring and received the ring on my mobile phone.  I answered it and spoke to a neighbor who had come to ask a question.  The picture and voice quality was very good.  It works and is easy.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,2,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Jun-16,MiketheMusic,"I have mixed feelings about the Ring doorbell. I originally purchased it on a friends recommendation and received it on Jan 20 2016 I gave it a full charge and hardwired it into my existing doorbell power supply and at first it worked well. A lot of motion notifications, but I played with the settings and got them down quite a bit. Notifications for both motion and door rings came in a timely fashion and I was totally digging it! I also bought the one year subscription for cloud recording, felt it was worth it. Then I started having issues #1 I found that even though I had power to the Ring, it did not like the power because apparently my transformer for my hardwired doorbell was to old and after contacting customer support and going through a # of tests decided it didn't like the juice. - old doorbell never worked on the Ring from the get go, but I had purchased the wireless chime so I didn't worry about it and figured I could just run off the battery. #2 the battery started running down a bit fast, seems like I had to charge it every 2 weeks - was told because the weather in Indianapolis is too cold and I should hardwire it & I had excessive motion - no matter how I set it the Ring picks up cars that are way outside the 5' min motion sensitivity area. - I was willing to live with the excessive alerts, but the doorbell wasn't and my choices were no alerts or excessive #3 now I decide that I can live with charging the battery all the time until I can find the time to swap out my existing transformer - unit decides it will no longer take a full charge #4 we determined that the unit was bad with tech support - Customer service is very friendly but this is starting to eat a lot of my time that I don't have to spare - but they sent me a new one - Great!! Problems solved..... no :( #5 new unit has had numerous issues that I have been on the phone with customer service a lot more than I would prefer - again customer service people are nice - but my time is valuable and I don't have an hour a month to mess with my door bell not to mention the no doorbell time - new one lost wifi connection for what ever reason and I ended up having to re boot my network that was working for everything else but the Ring to get it to work again. #6 when we got the new unit, Ring cloud subscription did not remember that I had already subscribed which led to another phone call - this time with a somewhat surly rep who couldn't even figure out my subscription start date and acted like he was doing me a favor to get it started again??? seriously - waste my time to turn something back on that should have been automatic and then give me a tude?? #7 soldiering on but again with the problems - Ring quits ringing anything including the door bell chime that I bought from Ring - had to do a hard reset - more phone time (no idea what my total time on the phone is, but could likely document that - this is starting to get annoying. #8 after the reset, had to repair with 2 phones - again subscription service is lost - has totally kicked my phone off the Ring notification and I have to make yet another phone call, as of this minute problems not resolved (I don't have time to keep servicing their device that is not performing properly and am pretty sure that I have a 2nd bad device) #9 forgot to mention that new unit does not notify in a timely fashion like the old one did and I am sure that they are going to tell me it is a problem with my wifi, which is working fine for everything from streaming movies on Prime & Netflix to you name it. FTR - customer service has been very courteous to me (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CLOUD SUBSCRIPTION GUY) - but I have a very busy life and was hoping the Ring would help with that and not take away from my time like it has - almost 6 months down the road I will update this after my next phone call which may be a few days, but at this point I am very frustrated with the product.",I want to like this but I am disappointed :(

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,13-Aug-15,Judy Crosby,"This item is good in the fact that it lets the homeowner know of any activity at the front of the house (or rear) without having to open the door to a possible intruder. Complaint is:  Very slow, even with our fast internet to acknowledge the fact of motion and or ringing of the doorbell.  Sometimes the talk back and forth is very low and or garbled.  The motion sensor, should be able to disable or lower range on any one of them without all of them being disabled or put into lower range.  Annoying problem we are  having now is the fact when we try to answer either motion or ring, is that we gat a screen pop up that says (without us touching the screen) - motion sensor answered remotely.  We only have the answer app on my cell and my wifes cell,so how can it be answered remotely.  \\ Still a good product but does need some updating in areas and some easier user friendly apps. Thanks JR Crosby",This item is good in the fact that it lets the homeowner know ...
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,24-Feb-16,J Wilson,"We have had a Ring doorbell for a couple of months now. Installation is fairly easy - any difficulty I had was due to having to mount it to brick and re-route doorbell wiring. Where it lags is in the areas many other reviewers have mentioned: 1) It is slow to wake up and begin recording on ""motion"" alerts. We received a UPS package this afternoon and the video starts when the driver is half way back to the truck. 2) No way to ""activate"" it if you're too slow to respond to an alert, or simply to see what's up in your front yard. 3) Many false motion alarms, despite Ring's web site detailing how they use a combination of motion and heat. The plants in my yard are the same temperature as everything else, but when the wind blows hard, my Ring false-alarms a lot. Those are minor frustrations compared to Ring's ability to perform as a camera. It simply lacks the dynamic range for our front yard. Our front door is in a small alcove or stoop, about six-by-six feet. The door and Ring doorbell are always in the shade, while the yard and street are not. Even on a cloudy day the difference in brightness means our videos are full of people seeming to appear out of thin air when they enter the shadow of the house. A brown UPS truck parked at the curb in full sunlight is quite invisible to our Ring doorbell on our porch. This lack of dynamic range leads to frustration #2: The Ring help desk CAN somehow remotely adjust the contrast setting of my doorbell, but I cannot. So I have a camera attached to my house that someone else can adjust the image settings on, but I can't - there is something just ""not right"" about that. A very minor frustration: many people seem to think the camera dome is the push button, and push on the camera instead of the button. Granted it was helpful when I didn't want to talk to a solicitor, but it also kept us from buying Girl Scout Cookies! EDIT: Dropping it to one star after more difficulties. I had family over this weekend, and every time they rang my Ring doorbell, it took unacceptably long to get the notification on my phone. My Mom rang my Ring and it never notified me on my phone.  I have had this problem with sales people ringing it as well - by the time I get the notification on my phone, the person has turned and walked away. Also, if your wi-fi connection isn't rock-solid, you will lose videos, like the one that I just lost. Got a motion alert, watched a creepy van up and down the street, and when I hit ""end"" ... POOF, the video was gone from my history. I feel like Ring is more of a Beta product at this point. It needs on-demand video. It needs some onboard storage so it can deal with less than perfect wi-fi. It needs quicker notifications to the phone. It needs better dynamic range so you can see who's at your door in the shade AND who's on the sidewalk in the sun. The motion settings need to be tweaked. It has the potential to be a great product, but it's not there yet.  If I could return it to Amazon for a refund, I probably would, but it has been too long.","Okay product, but not great"

I'm getting the motion notification on my iPhone about 1.5 - 2 seconds after passing by, then get the option to connect and speak to someone even if they don't hit the doorbell button. It was a little difficult to get the mounting plate to stay flat on my stucco but I got it mounted ... don't over tighten the mount screws like I did. The motion range and zones also work very well in my installation.  I can turn the zone off that points toward the cul-de-sac and avoid having traffic there set it off.  Yet it covers my circular drive very well in the other zones. Halloween was a little daunting ... it was going off quite a bit.  The internal battery seems to have good charge life.  I fixed my doorbell transformer and so I expect never to have to remove it for charging again since it will use that to power / charge itself from now on. I highly recommend this device but you do need to consider your existing doorbell button placement if you're going to put it where that was originally for the wiring.  If not and you mount elsewhere for a better view, you'll need to pull this every few month to charge it via a USB port.",Works Very Well for Me

It has worked as stated form the day it was installed. after several months of being in use the battery life still shows 70% so it would appear that the battery life of a charge is also as good as stated. I is great to not miss delivery's, and it even lets me see what is going on at the house when i am at work and it is activated. I unserstand that in the future there may be a way to just enable the ring and see what is happening at the house without any motion or the doorbell being pushed.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Feb-17,David R. Voth,"Here are my initial observations after allowing my cats to bench-test the Ring indoors, and having it installed as my doorbell button for 24 hours. First, a few caveats: - Strong WiFi inside of your house is essential.  If you don't have that, either acquire it or don't buy this product.  EDIT - There are ways to improve it, such as relocating your router, reorienting its antennas.  I was having connection issues and ended up buying a Ring Chime Pro, which is a combination door chime and WiFi repeater.  Things are working MUCH better now. - For the mobile app to work acceptably, you must have good bandwidth end-to-end especially a strong signal at the mobile end.  Alerts may work but Live View will absolutely not if you are in a location with a weak signal. - The motion sensing configuration is not very granular.  As others have noted, I am getting a lot of hits from passing cars.  Better to have false alarms than misses, IMO. - The instructions don't say this explicitly, but configuration will go more smoothly if you fully charge the internal battery first.  That takes several hours (up to 12 or maybe 16) connected to USB. - There is a lag between the device detecting motion and starting to record.  I get the impression this has been improved - I have gotten many acceptable videos of delivery people and of myself coming and going. - If you don't ""answer"" a ring or motion event pretty quickly, you can't get to the live video (while the device is recording.) Now some happy points: - Configuration is not difficult if you follow the instructions (but charge the battery FIRST.) - The free Android mobile app is intuitive and easy to set up. - Physical installation is easy, with useful tools provided.  You may need to provide your own hand drill depending on the material you are attaching the back plate to. - I like the fact that the Ring is a straightforward replacement for a traditional doorbell button.  It is rated to work on anything from 8 to 24 volts AC, provided that there is a load in the circuit (e.g. your existing mechanical door chime.) - Having a video and audio recording of myself leaving the house in the morning provides positive assurance that I remembered to lock the front door (or that I forgot to and need to go back home.) - The camera provides decent resolution for such a small and wide-angle lens.  The view is close to 180 degrees. - The camera has infrared LEDs and works OK in the dark. - As I expected, I'm getting very good information about deliveries.  Should a package thief show up, that would be captured as well. I recommend subscribing to the cloud storage for $30 per year.  In the event someone comes up to your door and puts tape over the camera or rips it off of the wall, you will have some video of the event. I am going though a big security upgrade at home.  The Ring serves both as an adjunct to a security camera system, and a prompt alert system to notify me of people at or near my front door. No regrets so far.",Several minor flaws but still a very useful upgrade for my house

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,27-May-16,Julie Thorn,"Our ring has worked beautifully right out of the box. Setup and installation was easy. My wife's home office is located in the basement of our home where she cannot see it hear anyone approaching the house. After installing RING she not only can monitor motion, but can also communicate via the two-way talk function if need be. This has given us both great peace of mind. Additionally, it is fun answering a motion alert and saying hello to family or friends as they are coming or going. I love telling my daughter to have a great day at school in the mornings when I am able to answer the motion alert as she leaves the house! The motion settings can be a little finicky resulting in false alerts or alerts when the garbage truck drives by the house. We have had several false motion alerts showing absolutely nobody or thing within view of the camera. I'd love to see this feature fine tuned a bit to ensure only true motion is detected or motion worthy of an alert. Even adjusting the motion distance settings don't seem to correct this issue. All and all, this is a great product that works great and can offer some real peace of mind for those wanting a little more security and awareness related to who or what is approaching your home. My only complaint is the need for some fine tuning around the motion sensitivity. Highly recommended... And I have recommended to family members who have purchased and feel the same as I do.",Great product and functionality! Highly recommended!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,15-Sep-16,Anuj Patel,"The Ring doorbell will definitely change the way you interact with guests (if you are using a normal doorbell at the moment).  The best part about the Ring is the fact that you don't need any professional installer or have any hi-tech home automation / security systems.  The ease of use is incredible and supremely helpful.  I now know when the mailman shows up, a random person strolls through my yard, or when someone pulls up in my driveway - all without even ringing the doorbell. The fact that you can also talk and listen to people who show up is amazing, which helps in every possible scenario.  It would be nice if on-demand live view was incorporated even with the understanding that it would affect battery life. My ONLY gripe (if you can even call it that) is that there is an ever so slight delay between the moment someone pushes your doorbell or motion is detected and the time it travels through your wi-fi and onto your phone or Chime.  Same thing goes with motion detection.  By the time I click on my phone's notification and the ring app opens / initializes, it's been 10 seconds since the time of the event.  Of course, it's impossible to have video data travel instantaneously, but a little bit quicker would be nice!",The best part about the Ring is the fact that you ...

It would be nice if it could be tilted or the camera angled to capture a lower view (to more easily track packages left at the door).  The notifications are somewhat inconsistent at times and the app freezes up on occasion, but the video and audio quality are pretty good.

It is comforting to know who is at your door before you open it and also the people you missed while you were away.

Had a few kinks trying to get the monitor to operate on two phones and our settings to work - but Adam and the rest of the support staff are fantastic and were able to resolve our issues and get everything working correctly.  We could not attach the doorbell to our wired bell in the front as we have a stone façade - so we have ordered the stick up cam which is coming out in February for that location.  We attached this one to the back door to see what is going on out there and it works great - love the doorbell ring!  Picture quality is pretty good as well as sound, and we now have a wireless doorbell back there. Recorder is picking up voices from about 10 feet away.  You can set the bell to alert you just when it is rung or whenever there is motion - it captures picture and sound for both.  Also works at night even when there is no night light on.

(Battery life on low level about one month with one full charge).  The more frequent you set it, the more the battery will drain. You can pay an additional fee and it store video clips, I highly recommend this, the video imaging is awesome. There are different ranges for it to pick up motion at your door and you can log into your phone to see what is happening where your ring was placed.  I did have an issue, and they mailed me a new ring in a matter of days. No issues... I LOVE IT!","I love it, great way to answer the door when you are not home."

We also own many stick up cams offered by Ring. First off, everyone that comes to our house and realizes what it is loves it. They point at it and make faces into and say how cool it is (all the while being watched by us)! But it has come in handy many times. We left on vacation and on the 2nd day we were gone an unexpected package showed up at our door. Without this we would have had no idea and it would have sat there for a week. We were able to see who came to the door and ask the neighbors to take it to their house until we returned. We've also been able to communicate with the UPS driver for other deliveries and open our garage door remotely for him to leave the packages in the garage. Then he is able to ring the doorbell again letting us know he is finished and we then close the garage door. The video quality is solid as is the audio. The app has the ability to turn on or off motion notifications (although it can still continue to record the motion without blowing up your phone if it's a busy traffic area) and you can also set the areas and distance surrounding the camera that will trigger the motion. Great product, I would recommend it to anyone.",We love our Ring products!

First the doorbell would randomly ring and according to the Ring support, my chime was not compatible with Ring doorbell.  The next issue I had was the batter would continually die, even though I had the doorbell hard-wired.  According to support, the hardwire only supplies a trickle charge and the doorbell must still be charged every once in a while.  After further research I found that the cold weather (I live in Colorado) also impacts the batteries ability to retain a charge.  Finally, after charging and resetting the unit (per Ring Doorbells support) I reinstalled the Ring doorbell and my chime was constantly going off.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,3-Jan-17,JD,The Ring while appearing to be a good product has several glaring drawbacks. While the technology is quite innovative.  It has some limitation. The two most critical are: 1.  You have to buy a subscription either monthly or yearly in order to access video that has been recorded while you were away. 2.  Even if you hardwire the product you still have to periodically charge it with a battery. My understanding from the manufacturer is that if can only hold a charge for about 72 hours. While the hardline low voltage trickle charges the unit it is not enough to keep it charged. So if you go on vacation for a week .. don't expect to be able to see anything after 72 hours. The fact that you still have to charge the unit even if it is hardwired to me was a deal breaker. I did some additional research and am going with SkyBell .. a competitor that does not appear to have either the subscription expense or the issue with hardwiring the product and it not staying charged. This product in my opinion is not ready for the market yet as well as the company trying to feed off of residual subscription fees really bothers me. With so many other products out there to choose from that do not require a continual investment just to get historical recordings... you can do better than the Ring,Ring Ring Go Away Come Back Another Day

It's very easy to set up and use. You do need a smart phone in order to use it. So, if you have a ""dumb phone"" it will be time to upgrade. It's the perfect excuse to do so. The Ring Video Doorbell is one of the best inventions to come along in years! Tom Edison would be proud if he were alive today.",A Great Product! Absolute Winner!

If no one answers they either go around back or kick the door in. The ring doorbell made the most sense for being able to see what is happening and also speak to the person at the door even if you are not home.

We wired directly into our existing doorbell and added a chime (nice for warning of delivery people who leave packages without ringing the doorbell).  Exterior installation was easy, but we took our time with the WiFi integration and did not try to rush through the process.  We did notice that a few windy days set off the motion sensor because of the motion of the trees we have near the front door - but aside from that, we have not had any false alarms.  We watched a few YouTube videos for tips before installing and one video correctly stressed: Ring is really fun to have - especially when you have unsuspecting visitors.  We have warned some people before their visit to save them the embarrassment of saying something before ringing the doorbell - statements that they may later regret when we play them again and again (""I hope we don't have to eat their homemade vegan crap again ...."").  If you have trouble with the installation - be sure to use the online Ring ""chat"" to solve any problems or ask questions - the technicians or service reps seem very qualified.",Just as advertised - but more fun than expected.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,4-Aug-16,MerlynNY,"I've been wanting a video doorbell for a long time, and eventually I took a chance with Ring. I've had the doorbell for a total of six months, and I've gone through three of them in that short amount of time.  The first doorbell had issues with the motion detection.  The second doorbell had major battery issues, and the third doorbell had connectivity issues (my wireless router gets near 50/50 speeds on my cell phone). I constantly have to remove and re-set up the doorbell, and the battery life isn't anywhere near as advertised. The motion detection is so very bad.  I have the motion settings turned down to one zone, and a five foot distance from the doorbell.  I still get notifications every day of cars driving down my street, which is about 15 feet away from the doorbell. Just last night I was speaking to blink because my video was pixelated and lagging. I own the Blink wireless cameras as well, and they steam clear video all the time.  I don't know why Blink's video doorbell falls so very short of that. If you're considering buying one of these, I would caution against it, unless you like having to contact their customer service every few months with a new issue, or the same old one for that matter. Update:  I'd just like to let everyone know the ordeal I'm going through with Ring's chat tech support.  Over the past three days I've spent approximately 5 hours troubleshooting my video issue with the current doorbell I have.  Every time you log into the chat you wind up speaking to a different person.  If you do this long enough, the different people start asking you the same questions over and over again.  Also, if one person needs to leave the chat for whatever reason, they don't even bother letting you know.  They just logoff, and another people instantly comes in (and starts asking the same questions).  I once had three different people pop in in a five minute span.  So here is my issue.  My video looks like an 8 bit video game from the 80's.  I tested my wifi with my cellphone and I'm getting 44/44 speeds at the location of the doorbell.  That should be more than enough to stream a clear video.  But my video looks like a bad witness protection video. Here are the reasons why I believe the problem to be with the current Ring doorbell I have: 1.  The previous units I've had have a much better picture. 2.  My wifi signal is strong and consistent. 3.  I also have Blink Cameras that are outputting the same 720p that provide a crystal clear video. I've removed and reinstalled the app.  I've done speed tests.  I've removed, reset and reinstalled the Ring Doorbell.  It was getting to the point where the techs were asking me to repeat tests even though I've pointed out items 1-3 (above) to them. I had one rep finally agree to exchange the unit for me and even notated that under a ticket number she provided me.  I then processed to spend another two hours in chat today troubleshooting yet again and even now they have to review all the chat logs to process an exchange.  By process of elimination if you've taken away all the issues that could be hindering the doorbell and there's nothing left but the doorbell itself, then the problem is the doorbell. I don't know what's more frustrating.  The fact that I have a doorbell that produces horrible video, or the 3 days of conversation with 6 people asking the same questions and I still don't have an exchange. I originally said avoid this doorbell at all costs.  Let me revise.  Avoid this company at all costs.",Avoid this doorbell

You know I came here and read a ton of reviews on this product and paid most of my attention to the critics to see what flaws and problems existed with this product. What I heard mostly were the following; - It's too laggy or didn't take video in time and only caught the person moving away from the house. My response, well most of my videos are captured when the person was approaching my door or at my door. My internet speed is 50mps up and 50mps down and the device is not far away from my router. I have no problems. Yes there are some cases where I only got the person moving away but I imagine most of the reason has to do with the fact that these videos are stored on the cloud. If the service or your connection isn't able to perform well, this is likely the reason. For me personally, it's fine about 95% of the time. And I even use it on battery power. No issues whatsoever. - Video looks like it's looking out of a fisheye. My response, Uh....yeah....that's what gives you enough of a perspective to see from side to side of the unit in almost an 180 degree angle. But I am not shooting home movies with this product. I am trying to see who's at my door. Some recent reviews said the quality of the video wasn't clear. I have no idea what they are talking about. Mine is clear as can be in 720p. Don't blame poor internet connectivity on the product. - Motion sensor picks up cars that drive by. My response, you have to adjust the sensitivity to get to the happy medium. I had to play with this a bit to get it right and also had to move a flag in the front of my house that was setting it off. After that, all has been fine. I will say one thing, I think a lot of people forget that when they adjust the settings that you have to ring the bell afterwards for the settings to register. That could be part of their confusion. I will say this, I am pleasantly surprised at how well the audio is on this unit. I answer the bell from 35 miles away from my home and it's crystal clear on both sides. No one would ever know I am not in the house. This is a great tool for my kids as well. Now when they are home alone, they can answer the bell from the iPad and see who it is without opening the door. They feel much safer as a result. My only complaints so far; - I also bought the chime as well. I just wish that there were more options for the doorbell sound and that it could be a bit louder. - I wish I could access the camera upon request. If you are guessing whether this would be the right purchase for you and your home for the reasons I mentioned above, you won't be disappointed. And don't worry about the installation. It's a breeze as long as you are capable of drilling straight. ** Update ** I've attached a video of my mailman that came to my door today. If people are blaming the product for laggy video or it's unclear, just look at the video I snapped just today as an example. If your setup is done properly and you have good wifi strength and upload speeds, there are no issues. Keep in mind that my mailman doesn't walk up my path. He arrives from the left side and walks across my lawn so this snaps the video as he arrives at my mailbox. If he came from anywhere else, it would have started recording sooner.",Love it!

The Good: It was really easy to set up and operate.  I also like the overall design of the doorbell. The Bad: The sensor is very inconsistent. At times, it will pick up cars passing by the house, while other times it won't even pick up someone walking near the front steps. I purchased it on sale on Black Friday and paid $140 on Amazon so it's well worth the money. I just wish the sensor was more consistent. I also purchased three Chimes (one for each floor) and they aren't as loud as I thought they would be. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and plan on eventually adding a Camera for the backyard.","While it's a good product, I wouldn't say it's a great product"

I had 2 interactions. The first one was when I installed Chime, The support team quickly looked at  whats happening in my devices from remote,  and suggest testing again. Then it Chimes !!!! The second time was that they remotely tuned some latency related parameters when I complain long latency after motion detection to initiate chime sound and phone notification.  They send me an email and saying they have already tuned the parameters, and  asked me to try it out. I tested and it works much better!!.  Amazing, Hard work and friendly. Basically I really like Ring and Chime a lot, especially  the fact that Cloud recording applied only for the event basis. I also have Nest DropCam for another place in my property, but it is more expensive and useless recording of nothing happening most of the time. One improvement I wish would be adding on-demand video capture for a couple of sec. ( even still picture capture is fine ) even without motion detection. Thanks",Amazing Support.  Great cloud recording.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,23-Sep-16,T. Nelson,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. SUMMARY I love my Ring video doorbell.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty close and certainly a great product for the money.  The ring was easy to install and generally works as advertised.  There are occasional glitches, but nothing too serious.  The app works well on both Android and iPhone.  Video quality seems limited by wireless network signal. SETUP The Ring was easy to install.  In general, it was a simple swap with my existing hardwired doorbell.  The hardest part was drilling holes into my unexpectedly hard stucco wall.  (I think there was a metal plate just under the stucco.)  Once the holes were drilled, it was a simple matter to mount the included base plate to the wall with a few mounting screws.  The base is plastic and flexes a bit.  Since my stucco wall was not perfectly flat, it took a little fiddling to get the plate flat enough for the doorbell to snap on correctly.  It also took a fair amount of force to get the outer case to snap onto the plate.  At first, I was too gentle and thought something was broken.  Once I pushed a little harder, though, the case snapped on snugly. Connecting to the network was simple, but see my activation tip below. ACTIVATION TIP My Ring arrived with a totally dead battery.  Even when plugged into a charger, it behaved strangely and the activation instructions didn't work.  It needed to charge for some time before it would activate correctly.  So, make sure you get some charge into the battery before trying to activate.  Once charged, it immediately hooked to my network.  It's been great ever since with no connectivity issues. OPERATION The Ring generally works as advertised, with only an occasional hiccough.  I get an alert on my Android phone whenever anyone comes to the door.  I have it setup to alert my wife's iPhone as well.  That's a bit of overkill, but we wanted to be sure we wouldn't miss anything important.  It works fine on both Android and iPhone.  The video feed is good, although sometimes there is pixelation.  I blame that on my home wireless network which may have trouble getting a good signal to the outside of my home.  The video is usually plenty good enough to recognize someone and see what's going on.  With a porch light on, the video is also good at night.  I haven't tried it at night without the light. The field of view is great.  As you can see in the attached photos, I had to install the Ring perpendicular to my door, yet I still have a great view of people approaching on my sidewalk.  I've also attached a few photos showing the range of quality under different lighting conditions.  Sometimes we have severe backlighting due to the morning sun, but the picture is still fairly good even under those conditions. The Ring got a good workout recently when I was traveling out of the country for business.  I received an alert when my daughter arrived home from school every day.  I was able to chat with her as she was entering the house.  It was comforting to know she had arrived home safely.  Thanks, Ring. The Ring is also handy when I'm expecting a package, since most carriers no longer ring or knock.  [Sidebar:  I work at home and, until a few months ago, carriers always rang the bell when dropping off a package  Then, all at once, they stopped.  This includes UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL.  I'm not sure why, but all the carriers stopped at about the same time.  End of sidebar.] The Ring is reliable and rarely misses anyone at the door.  I say rarely because sometimes it DOES fail:  on occasion, there will be a flyer on the door but no alert and no video.  But it's pretty good; I'd say it works 90-95% of the time. Sometimes I'll get an alert, but the video starts recording a few seconds after the alert.  So when I look at the video, there's no one in the picture but I can hear someone walking away from the door.  This seems to be the case if someone quickly passes through the frame of view.  If there was a real issue, e.g., someone breaking into the house, they'd be in the frame plenty long enough to get captured, so it's not a concern. Because of the layout of our home, the doorbell also has a view of a neighbor's front door.  The Ring alerts whenever someone comes or goes at their house, causing a lot of unnecessary alerts.  This isn't the Ring's fault, it's just something to consider before you install.  I understand the newer version of the Ring lets you block out parts of the frame.  That might help alleviate the issue. CUSTOMER SERVICE One of the reasons I bought this was because it has ""live view"" so you can look at the door whether or not there is an alert.  I had read about this feature online, but there were no instructions on using it and the feature was not available in the phone app.  So, I sent an email to Ring.  It turns out that you have to ask Ring to activate this service for you.  Once I sent the email, they quickly activated the service and the feature appeared in the app.  Extra points to Ring for their quick response, although I'm not sure why this feature isn't activated by default. SUMMARY All in all, this is a great device.  It needs a little polishing around the edges, but it generally works the way it's supposed to.  I would recommend it to a friend and I plan on adding another to our back door.","It needs a little polishing, but overall a very good device"

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,27-Oct-15,Spencer Gibb,"So here is another one of my fairly lengthy reviews.... The Ring is actually one of my favorite new devices, and the only ""doorbell/camera/intercom"" that does EXACTLY what I needed it to do. I had done research for a while before I saw it advertized. Granted, some people are not in the unique situation that I am in (which I'm about to explain), but I think the details will be helpful regardless. So here's my story. Bear with me....I am a writer, so I'm naturally verbose... I live on a decently sized 7000 sq ft lot, with the main property set back far from the street, probably 200 ft or so. There is another smaller property (that I rent out) just in front of the main house. In front of that is a small office. Each of these buildings get closer to the street. Because everything is so far back from the street, and I essentially have no backyard, we put up a 6ft privacy fence and gate along the street, to enclose the property. We jokingly call it ""The Compound"". So you get the idea. There are also two large dogs, who not only love to explore and escape when possible, but intimidate strangers and package delivery people who show up to the gate. So, my problems were multiple. Because of the dogs, no one could open my gate and walk up the pathway to either the main house or the studio apartment to ring a doorbell or deliver a package. Because there are two living spaces with two separate people as well as an office building, it gets confusing as to who lives  where and who is in which building at any given time, so multiple doorbells seemed pointless. Because of the privacy fence, leaving packages without signatures on the street outside the gate (obviously there's no porch or private area) is impracticle, not to mention most carriers won't do it anyway. Then, there's the addional issue of security. If we had doorbells, then we wanted video. We knew that if we were going to have a doorbell, then it needed to be on the front gate, but also transmit wirelessly, ideally to a phone/tablet, but a computer at the very least. There is no electricity that far down the yard by the street, so hard wiring was not an option without a lot of work and money. Not to mention hardwired doorbells (unless you have a pre-existing unit) require step down transformers. So it seemed like we were pretty screwed. We had researched some units, I think Skybell was the name of one, and a couple of others, and while they offered WiFi transmission, they required hard wired electricity. Then we found Ring. Almost seemed too good to be true, because there were features that we hadn't even thought about that solved additional concerns. Ring HAS A BUILT IN RECHARGEABLE BATTERY. There's a no brainer. Amazing that someone hadn't done this before, but there you go... So naturally we bought it just based on that to give it a try. Obviously it can also be hardwired to an existing or new doorbell plate and all the tools are in the package. So here's why we love it, and why the extra features are so useful, and I've heard there are more to come. They just released Chime, and I'll discuss that in a second. These points are in no particular order.... A: Ring has a good, high resolution camera (bear in mind, that the further away from your WiFi router you are, the resolution will degrade. That's just science...), the night vision is impressive, and the wide angle of the lens is more than enough to see everything. The microphone is very good, as is the outdoor speaker. Honestly much clearer than expected. B: The WiFi power is solid. You set up the connection to your network through the Ring app on your phone (more on the app later). It's a very easy process, and the app walks you through it. Because of the massive distance of the yard I described, we did end up having to add a WiFi extender to the office (which was the closest building to the street), to make the camera connection more efficient. Bear this in mind if you're installing far away from your router. Once Ring is connected it shows up as a registered device, and you can add more later if necessary. Now here's the super cool part, and how it affects home security. I now know Ring advertises this as one of it's key features, but to see it in action really sells it. Much like the Belkin WeMo system, once the device is connected to your network, it is then routed through your phone, literally enabling you to answer your doorbell (and see who is there) from anywhere. I have answered the gate from 2000 miles away, asked for a package to be left there, and then had a friend (or roommate) go and pick it up. Nobody knew I wasn't home. Visit Ring's website for videos on this feature. C: Almost a continuation of B, Ring also features customizeable motion sensing. I don't really need to go into detail on this, because everyone will use it differently, but for us it's handy for package delivery when someone doesn't ring the bell (yes, I get a lot of packages....). It would also be useful of course if you suspected that someone was trying to break in or tamper with your stuff, or you have a crazy stalker, which leads us to.... D: Cloud recording!! Ring has a cloud recording service. It's fantastic. If you activate it (which I believe is about $3 a month), every time the bell rings or the motion sensor is triggered, it uploads the video to the cloud, and you can review it at any time through the app. So far we haven't had the misfortune of security issues, but it is really handy (and worth it in my opinion) to see who was at your gate if you miss a ""call"" from the Ring. E: Multiple users. A huge selling point (well we were already sold, but we discovered this later) is that you can add multiple users to the Ring device. My roommate/tenant downloaded the app, set up an account and then I added her to the list. When the gate rings, she is alerted at the same time I am, no matter where we are, and she also has access to all of the cloud recordings and features. This is a great feature if you live in a compound....;) Joke aside, we both travel a lot independantly for business, so having multiple users be able to access the features I've previously outlined, increases security and also allows each of us to take care of things at the house more efficiently. F: The app is very well designed. Simple, easy to use and intuitive. We're all Apple users here, so I've only seen it on iOS, but I have it installed on my phones and iPad and it works great. I actually use old, beat up iPhones and iPads as wall mounted ""light switches"" for home automation stuff, so my whole house rings when someone is at the gate. I can use any of the devices to see the camera. Also, when you login to your account on any iPhone/iPad, your registered Ring device(s) pop up. Aside from that, the app allows you to customize settings (mainly motion), add devices and look at cloud recordings. You can also monitor battery life if you are using the wireless rechargeable battery. Again, all done very intuitively. I was going to mention this separately, but this seems like a good place instead. While I am happy to have my whole house ""ring"", my tenant does not want hers to. She works from two phones and an iPad, has the Ring app installed on all of them, but mostly keeps her phone ringers off. As a result she misses a lot of doorbell rings. She also doesn't necessarily, as many people wouldn't, always want/need to get Ring notifications when she is out and knows I'm home. Amazingly, the Ring folks just launched Chime, which is pretty much for people like her. We will be installing one in her place. From what I understand it is essentially a stand alone, almost ""old school"" doorbell ringer (chime, i guess....), that you wall mount and rings in your house separately from your phone. It is connected through the Ring app and is customizeable (volume etc). I haven't played with it yet, but will soon and review it. G: One last note about the unit itself. It's very sturdy and weather resistant. We live in Central Texas and just went through a bashing from the edge of the hurricane weather. Ring is fine, just as they advertise. Once you mount it, there are two small security screws on the bottom that are designed to make stealing it a pain in the ass. Ring apparently has a replacement program for theft (see H) by the way. All installation tools needed to mount and set up are included in the package. Screws, screwdriver and bits, and any other accessories for hardwiring to electricity (mine had a diode included in the box). There was even a micro USB cable for re-charging the battery, which is very easy to do. Undo security screws with special bit, take Ring off the mount and then plug it in as you would a phone etc... Battery life is apparently 6 months or more before recharge with normal usage. For those of you that care, the packaging it arrives in is very elegant and frustration free. H: Customer service is impeccable. While in an ideal world you should never have to call them, I initially received a unit with a slightly defective battery (it wasn't holding a charge very long). They replaced it immediately (arrived in a couple of days) with virtually no questions asked. Also, the website is informative and answers most questions. If you have to call and the hold time is too long, they'll call you back without you losing your place in line. My only gripe about Ring so far is that there is no Mac OS desktop support/app. I work from my computer a lot. I am a musician, a photographer and a writer, so when knee deep in a project that requires concentration or silence (i.e. phone turned off), it would be nice for a doorbell alert to pop up on the computer screen and a little video window.

There is no way on the web interface to cancel this service, have a look- you can change the billing method- but there is no way to cancel.  I contacted Ring a year ago after the hardware/software problems I had with device to cancel the service and notified them that there was no way to cancel- to which they said they were having ""growing pains"" and hadn't implemented it yet (where's my tiny tissue box?).  They did however say that my account was now officially caceled and I would definitely not be billed again...Guess what?  Today a year later I received this email: Hi John, Your Cloud Video Recording subscription payment for $30.00 has failed. We'll try charging your account again tomorrow.

That's not what I was paying for- I don't want to know sometimes why doorbell rings- I want to know EVERY TIME why my doorbell is ringing! App constraints: I have iPads throughout the house mounted on the wall for whole home automation and of course they are mounted in landscape mode.  Unfortunately, the app forces portrait mode for the interface- which is bizarre.  When asked about getting that modified, I was put into the ""we'll get to that in some later release"" bucket (yeah sure you will). Oh well, didn't/doesn't seem to be a worthwhile doorbell device on the market, so I just installed a motion activated camera that has an incredible view of the area and works flawlessly- as I didn't really need the remote verbal communication of the Ring device anyway.

The fact that the charge lasts for about a year is amazing! We have the apps downloaded and it notifies us when there is motion at the front door as well as someone ringing the doorbell. You can change the settings and alerts, like how close you want it to pick up the motion, and if you want it to make a sound when there is motion or just ringing the doorbell. It pops up on all of my devices with notifications when there is motion and I can watch it on my phone. If I accept the call it also works as a two way radio which is awesome for shifty door to door people, as well as delivery drivers. We also had a blast having the ring doorbell for Halloween.

My daughter (just turned 5) has already picked up the habit of calling out ""it's just the wind""... I was really excited about the feature too... The screws that come with the mounting bracket are weak at best... with my home's thick siding, I managed to snap two of them... I had to use some better screws. I had trouble getting the it all connected to my phone, or my tablet, or to ANYTHING to get it setup initially... eventually I got it resolved, but it was really frustrating... seems their software is buggy (Android)... this was quite a few months back, so perhaps its better now. I think they could really make this a great product if they just worked on quality control a bit... 1. less delay between human at porch and ring on phone 2. better sensitivity and false positive detection... machine learning anyone? I mean... you do one thing... 3. use screws that don't break... 4. make software that works better... Once they solve those 4 things... this would be an unbelievable product... but until then... not sure it is worth it... though, the online backup is nice... but for the price of the doorbell, they should at least give you a free YEAR not a one month trial...","Ok, but not great..."

Not only can we do this, but we can also interact with them and talk to them as well.  We are also having a lot of fun among the family interacting with each other when we get a notification they are at the door.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,6-Sep-16,Kevin Wilson,"So far I must be in the minority I guess, because it seems as we become a more connected society, the things that are just supposed to work and get out of the way, are more of a nuisance than before we had them to begin with. The time spent on DEVICES is maddening. The Ring Doorbell ranks right up there.. So, a little back story, I live in a neighborhood thats more than 70 years old.  However we are connected well to Cable and Wifi throughout. We do have frequent thunderstorms as does anyone in Maryland, however because of the age of our housing, power outages or brownouts ( power off on,) happens sometimes a few times a year.. So you know, The Ring Doorbell does not do well here.. It loses it's connection entirely,, and unlike all of the other wifi devices in my home that simply reconnect automatically when the power comes back on,, this little, SECURITY device not only does not connect, but does not red flag or want you of it either???!!! I travel frequently,, (If you travel listen up, this could be an issue!!) this is more for my wife than myself, and frankly she has not the time more patience to dismount the device from the door, turn on the app, and reset it and take the steps to reset it up again!!! This seems like an issue that most companies had solved by 2005??  Not Ring!  And they should warn people of this in advance. So the device was down for several weeks and the only way I found out after being gone for a few weeks was notifications stopped happening.. I went through almost a 1 hour call with their tech support over this.. The person whom handled my disgruntled feelings was an excellent support person, but at the end of the day she got me set up. Last thing.. The video on this thing is abysmal!!! After going through tech support they had no solutions.  My neighborhood is certainly no brighter than anyone else Im quite certain, but the glare on the video is OBNOXIOUS! And frankly its hard to make out who is at the door unless they are right up against the Ring doorbell!! Ridiculous.. Im paying 10 a month for a service that can't make the video viewable regardless of night or day outside, and I have to take it off the door and go through a reset up every time the power blinks, and my wifi resets which essentially makes it useless for me from a security standpoint if Im away from home,,, kinda the point,, huh?? They tout being able to use this device from anywhere,, but if you have a power surge it becomes essentially useless until the user has to eat up more personal time to reset the device from scratch again.. Im sorry this is unacceptable, and RING needs to address this. This is not a cheap product nor cheap service, and I'm sorry we can;'t help you is the WRONG ANSWER... Yes, thank you for taking my money and providing a faulty, cumbersome product.. I think this could be a great tool, but using antiquated technology and poor video make it a waste.  Really a major disappointment. June 28 2017, so Im back again to add more disappointment. This has to be the 4th/5th time in now barely a year that Ive had to charge this thing.  Reconnect to wifi, over and again, and now I don't even get notified when the battery drains,,How secure is this?? If Im traveling my family depends on this tool, and I m feeling more and more like a slave to this ridiculous piece of hardware that should be staying out of the way, but is more and more a nuisance.  Yes, Im paying monthly for this headache too.. Dying to start looking into a better solution, but don't want to waste anymore time or money on something that should be WHAT THEY SAY IT IS! Now Im told it would work better if plugged in!! Why not say that right on the BOX in big bold letters!",Hidden MAJOR issues for me.

When it does load the image the delay is so long the person ringing the bell has already departed. Don't get too excited with this one. A bit oversold on television.,Not what it's cracked up to be

It took me an hour to get it to connect to the wifi. I had to reset my wifi networks a bunch of times, and even factory reset it once. The android app setup is terrible. It gives you no information on why it fails ever. It just says ""setup didn't complete"". Sometimes it disconnects from the wifi and doesn't tell you. Other products like Nest tell you they were down. I had live view on my door bell, but it disappeared from my account (what?). Had to go through several customer service reps to get it turned back on. Then the next day it stopped working all together, so I reset it. Of course the live view is gone again and now it doesn't even send notifications that any motion is detected even though setup says it's complete. I plan on returning it soon for either a Pro version (hope the software is better) or another product. If the setup works well, you're set, the product works fine, but as a security product, I can't have it randomly disconnecting while I'm away, defeats the purpose of the product.",Great if it would work.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,8-May-16,Carlos Spicyweiner,"I've had this two days, and it is the most frustrating, haphazard, and unreliable POS I've ever endured. Its sole job in the universe is to notify you when people come to your door. It doesn't do that--except every once in a while. It's like the designers were told ""make it just barely good enough not to throw away, but really push that line."" Around half of the times motion doesn't even trigger an alert at all, and when it does, it doesn't start recording until the person has left, so I don't get to see them anyway--and that's only when the video works. Most of the notifications that even make it to any device at all (and I've tried a variety, Windows 10 desktops and tablets, 2 ipads, 1 ipod, note 4 individually and collectively), The few that do, when they bring up the video screen way too late, the screen doesn't even show the video at all. The batter life is just a flat-out lie! One year? This isn't going to make it one week. One hour after I charged it to full capacity, it was down to 75%--that's 1/4 battery life gone in one hour! After 2 days, it's down to 50%, and likely because it doesn't do anything but sit on my door like an ornament. The common excuse I'm seeing on here is poor network signal, which is NOT the case in my house, since the doorbell is about 10 feet from my router, and I've clocked this router with several other devices at over 300mbps--and that's just my internet speed as well. Internally, it's much faster even at the edge of the property. What gives?",This is not a product. It's an abortion.

If someone rings the doorbell,it takes so much time for my phone to ring that the person who rang the doorbell has usually left.  If they are still actually in front of my door and I attempt to talk to them through the doorbell, the quality is so bad neither party can understand what the other is saying.  I have the motion detector feature set, but again, the product is so slow that when I try to watch a recording after the motion detector has been tripped, the video shows nothing - the person who tripped it is always gone by the time the product records.  I attempted to find a solution on Ring's website and there is almost nothing useful on the site.

Not a huge problem, I know, but an annoyance. Whenever it happens, I look at the video from the doorbell. When I first got it, the video would start when they rang the doorbell (not when motion was detected). It would have trouble focusing on them because their finger was so close, and by the time it regained focus they were across the street. I talked to their support about it, and they assured me it would be fixed in the next firmware upgrade, which conveniently came out just after my 30 days to return the doorbell expired. It did not fix the problem; in fact since then the problem has become even worse, with the video now starting a few seconds after the doorbell is rung. More recently, two packages were taken from my porch without it capturing any video of the event. For some reason, although it often triggers when cars drive by 30 feet away, it didn't turn on when someone came right up to the porch and took the packages. The packages could be seen in the camera on the videos before they were taken, and were gone in the one shortly after; both videos were triggered by someone driving by, of course. Anyway, my biggest problem with the company is how they've strung me along long enough that I can't get a refund with promises of fixes that never come. I should have returned it when I first had the problem.",We've got some kids in the neighborhood who like to doorbell ditch

Several times now  I have been able to see and answer my doorbell when not at home. One thing to be careful of is the hole in the wall where your previous doorbell was. If the hole is bigger than the new Ring, you will need to be creative in getting a cover in which to mount the Ring to. Also, keep the cable that comes with the Ring, even if it is hard wired to the old wires, you likely will need to recharge the batteries from time to time.",Very good but.......

Needless to say I purchased one the same day and it's been a great product ever since.  The installation instructions were easy to understand and besides a little issue with the mounting surface I had to work with (it was a relatively narrow door frame which was further hampered by my storm door frame) I had it wired in to my existing doorbell housing and connected up in short order. I have been an avid user of Windows Phone 10 for quite some time and my wife has an iphone and there is definitely much more development work done on that platform over the Windows Phone but for now it gets the job done.

With ring, whenever there is someone at the front door, our phones show alerts and with chime it's audible throughout the house. The camera works great day and night. The only issue I have found so far is that the audio starts recording later than the video. But the videos are still useful. And if you answer a call on your phone, conversations with the person at the door work fine. It would be great to have the option to start video and audio on demand from your phone.

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,12-Nov-16,JO is my Name-O,"So I must confess that I failed to realize what I was saying when I told her that bought a Ring.  She seemed very very excited and then crushed with disappointment when I showed her the actual Ring. As far as the product itself, it's pretty good.  Our doorbell decided 20+ years of work was too much so I decided to upgrade to a Ring.  I attempted to install it in the same place as our previous doorbell but that wasn't happening.  It's much larger and while my original thought was to connect it to the doorbell wiring, ultimately I decided a spot a little higher up the  wall would be better (door bell height produced more belly-button and crotch videos. Overall, I'm fairly pleased.  It's not perfect but about what I expected.  Since our house has aluminum siding and the wifi router is all the way in a back bedroom, the signal to the front door isn't the best.  I would recommend either moving your access point closer or buying a range extender. Next, the motion detection does trigger a number of false alarms.  It will take some trial and error to find the sweet spot.  Even set to a close range, school buses seem to generate enough heat to trigger an alarm.  Still, I'll take a few false alarms if it prevents someone from taking a package from the front porch. The pictures are clear and not too shabby at night.  It's not perfect but probably good enough to give to the cops if needed.  I'm hoping that the wifi extender helps this as well. Overall, I'm pleased.  I'm now one step closer to becoming a shut-in so that's worthy of at least 4 stars in my book.  I'm also considering expanding the system with stick-up cams for a better view of the driveway.",Your Girlfriend will be disappointed

I can see perfectly at night, and this one lets me know if anyone is at door, and I can better handle pesky sales persons etc, and it also wards off potential burglars. But see a lot of potential for further refinements. The infrared motion sensor is nice, but needs improvement.

We live in a country where security is very important. This product works very well in that many a time when we are away and the door bell rings, we can immediately look at the video and see who is at the door and also converse with the person. In fact one of our friends asked the question: are you guys at home or what? And they just found it awesome that we could communicate even though we are not home. The other feature we use extensively is to review the missed calls or accepted calls so we have a good idea who has been at our front door. The new big plus is the ability to go into live view so one can scan to area in real time. Setup was so easy and having hard wired the ringer, battery is no problem.

The motion alerts work fine, the doorbell notifies you when you have visitors and when someone rings your door bell. But try to load the camera or live view to respond to someone pressing the button and good luck. 9 times out of 10, the device and camera would not load fast enough for me to chat with the visitor. I wanted to be able to tell UPS to drop the package in my garage as I can remotely open the garage door. However, the 30 second+ time it takes for the Ring doorbell to load, the UPS driver has already walked away and either taken my package with them or just left it on the porch. As mentioned, the very slow load time is only when I really need it to show me a live view. Any other time when just randomly pulling up the live feed, it works fine. Seems to be an issue when motion or button is triggered. Then the doorbell just can't handle showing the live view. Extremely frustrating. The same goes for Ring's stick up cameras.

I liked mine so much that I purchased one for my parents as well.  The cloud recording is my favorite feature,  It is very affordable at $3 a month.  I use it to see when packages are delivered when my phone is on silent.  I am never home and ring allows me to see when people drop by my home.  If I were to make the product better, it would be through connectivity, sometimes my phone gives me an i/o error when connected to my company's WiFi and the person is gone before I have the opportunity to speak with them.  I counteract this by extending the motion range of the sensor, so it notifies me that someone is approaching before the doorbell is pressed.  This gives me a little more time to react.  I recommend having a very stable and fast internet connection for your home.  It also helps to have a router that has a solid signal distribution so the doorbell can connect quickly.

I take care of my elderly mother and I like to know who is coming and going while I am work or away.  This is a great way to help manage keeping an eye on the door. Pros: Sensitive enough to capture activity around my house. Good quality, Cons: Sometimes to sensitive to activity by the street, even after adjusting sensitivity. Difficult to install on a narrow trim.  The instruction video shows installing on trim that is narrow and then later in the video it shows that they changed the trim so they could install it properly.  They did not say anything about why they changed to the wider trim.  A little confusing since I was trying to install on a narrow trim and was following the video.  Be careful, the camera will not install properly on a narrow trim. The video is somewhat deceptive.",I take care of my elderly mother and I like to know who is coming and going while I ...

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,17-Jul-16,Steven Lee,"This product is pure crap. It's not out of alpha development, but it was released and sold as a finished product. There are so many things wrong with it, it's hard to know where to start. I guess the first thing is that without paying for the cloud account most of the functionality doesn't work, but they don't tell you this up front. Next, the video quality is abysmal at times. Sometimes it's good or OK, but other times you can't even make out anything in the blurred video. Sometimes all you get is a black screen with audio. Sometimes no audio either. Sensitivity: They completely failed at the detection algorithm. I have 3 of these devices. The one facing the street, which is about 35' away, will start recording when someone, or a car, or every bus or truck goes by. At the same time I've never seen a mailman, or delivery person come up to the door. I've been running that one for over 20 days. It misses entirely the most important events, and gets every insignificant one, such as me taking out the trash. I don't know how they managed to fail so badly in the motion detection algorithm. The 2nd one I put up at the back door, doesn't face a street, but a deck with trees in the background. It misses the first several, and most important seconds of every recording, but it's amazing at detecting me at 180 degrees, if I look out the door and my nose is too far forward. The first several seconds after it starts recording, may record a video, then it's a stop-screen image for the entire duration of the recording. Entirely worthless. Typically 40 seconds or more of an image  is a still image from 40 seconds ago. Battery life. The 6-12 months the battery is supposed to last is comical. The same back door one above, which had been charged to 100%, prior to installation, ran for 10 days before it was completely discharged. They really should provide a transformer, power plug, with extra wiring so you could snake a power supply to the device if you wanted to. It only accepts an AC output in a power supply and they don't even support that, except if you connect it to your existing wired door bell system. This is pathetic! It misses the first few seconds of what it should be recording! So, if you are lucky, you see that someone entered your place, but not who. You might manage to see the opened door, just prior to it closing. It's bizarre, almost like it a joke and taunting you. The next part isn't the devices fault, but rather something that never occurred to me. We currently have five people living here. Between 30 and 60 times a day, we walk in and/or out of the house, and do something, like take out recycling, or trash, or bring a dog outside, etc. After missing the first few seconds of each of these transactions, I get notified up to 60 times a day, with a video of the back of my head, etc. I might not have even tried this if I realized the massive pain in the butt it would be, which leads me to the interfaces. No time or date stamp on the videos. No preview of the first image. No deletion from within a video playback, except on a smartphone. Do deletion of a video from the list view on the smartphone. The control interfaces crash or fail to update correctly. This requires that you close them and then re-open them. This is buggy, early beta software. If this is the best of these types of things on the market, which it appears to be, you should wait a few years, until they work out the BS, that we shouldn't be exposed to. Don't get this product.",This product is pure crap. It's not out of alpha development

Just can’t figure out how to get the motion range right. Didn’t realize you had to buy a separate “chime” or it would just ring to your phone. But, that’s ok. It does much more than I thought it would for the price.",Cool
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,5,Reviewed in the United States ,29-Aug-18,Sugrue Family,"Very happy with our new Ring doorbell! Installation took only a few minutes, even hardwiring it to our old doorbell. It was very easy and comes with everything you need to install. Our only issue has been that our WiFi router is a bit far from the doorbell so we’ll be getting a WiFi signal booster too help, but that obviously isn’t a Ring issue. We love it!",Love our Ring Doorbell!

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,1,Reviewed in the United States ,1-Feb-17,Willie TEXAS,"Great concept, but the product is very 'buggy'.  I just returned my second one and I am giving up.  Like many other reviewers, I found that the motion detection has a delay.  I only saw the delivery man walking away...never saw their face.  Also, it didn't consistently alert me with motion.  Several times I would come home and find packages, door flyers, etc. but there was no detected events on my phone.  I have FIOS 150mbps internet speeds, with full bars, so this is not a latency issue. But the real problem is that both units caused my doorbell chime (hard wired) to go off repeatedly for no reason.  This happened after the unit had been installed for several days.  It didn't happen on day one.  The first time, I wasn't home, so there was no way to shut it off until I got there.  The transformer on the chime was very hot.  I thought it was a defective unit, so I returned it and got another one.  After 6 days, the new unit did the same thing.  Fortunately I was home and quickly disconnected the chime. I really wanted this to work, but after installing two different units (and now I have holes in the brick where it was installed), I am giving up.","Great concept, poor execution"

We would have purchased another type of system had we known. I know, read the instructions....but with all the craziness of the holidays, it was nearly impossible. I'd return this item if it still allowed me to. WARNING: you cannot return this item after the trial period; Amazon doesn't provide that option.",REQUIRES a subscription for full access

That's a nuisance. Wish there were another way to keep it charged longer.",needs frequent charging

"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,1-May-15,shaun,"so I installed the doorbell and came to a conclusion that it mostly works as advertised. Some of you will experience what I had: slow connections and inconsistent operation. I soon realized that the performance of the product is highly dependent upon your router's performance.. The product seems to have some compatibility issues and when it works well, if does so exceedingly well. What I suspect is happening is that the product only connects to the networks when pressed( this is probably how it maintains such a long battery life). As a result, if your router isn't up to snuff when it tries to connect, it will likely fail. I solved my problem by installing an extender(tplink) with an ability to transmit data consistently. I hope this helps you understand why some people have varying experiences. It works like a five star product now. I had to ding it cos it didn't explain its true limitations in the manual and expected people to figure it out.",Works with some caveats
"Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) – 720p HD video, motion activated alerts, easy installation – Satin Nickel",1,4,Reviewed in the United States ,22-Jun-15,carlos manz,I bought one of these doorbells for my home and I like it. I have a pretty good wifi connection and I get my ring notifications within 5 seconds. I see some people having trouble with notification time and that may have to do with wifi connection and speed. I don't have it connected to a doorbell so would love someway to hear the bell when inside the house when I don't have a phone or tablet next to me.,Like it a lot but will love when ringer is available
