No, the google mini it's loud and have a great sound, if you have more than one google home, you can stream music to all of them simultaneously and have that surround music effect.
Great buy, great deal, can't go wrong with the google home mini.","Practical, portable, great sound"
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 May 2020,Kris,This is my second Home mini. Bought another one because my dad wanted mine. The home mini is great for those who love to listen to music all the time. Would definitely recommend and easy to use.,Great for everyday use

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,19 Nov 2020,GreyFoxPancake,"Nice mini smart hub for Google Assistant uses. Also works ok as a music speaker and lower to mid volumes levels. But I would recommend two for music listening so you get stereo sound. The microphone on this thing is really good at picking up our voices, even through other noises. And if you take the time to set up your voice recognition on Google Assistant, it can even tell the difference between who exactly is speaking the command, allowing for functions to be limited to specific users on the account. All of this said, I would still recommend the newer Nest Mini. It does all of what I said, just better. And with a few extra features.",Great First Go
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,gadgetguy11,"Google Home Mini is a versatile miniature rendition of Google Home with a smaller, yet surprisingly good sounding speaker. Similar to it's larger sibling, simply call out ""OK Google"" or ""Hey Google"" and speak your request. 

The strong suit, not surprising, for this Google assistant, is to address a question that can be answered by Google search engine. That is where it really shines & blows away it's competition. For this reason I recommend owning at least one of these or one of the full sized Google Home, if you prefer. 

If you already own a competitive virtual assistant, I recommend you buy this Google Home Mini. Owning both one or more Google Home Mini's and a competitive assistant make perfect sense. Each has a specialty and can do specific tasks better than the other. Owning BOTH offers you the best of both worlds. 

In addition to voice controls (that I prefer), tap the top to pause or resume music playback, and you can tap and hold to activate the Assistant. To adjust the volume, you tap the sides of the device. Or best yet, simply SPEAK your command! 

I recommend the Google Home Mini!",Mini Minimalism
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,21 Nov 2020,Adam,"I bought these for my youngest son, he is on the spectrum.  I will always answer any questions from any child, yet this item has been a great help.  he has it tell him stories, play music, answer questions he has when other people are not available.  we keep it only in his room.  we have bought a few over the years, I like the lower cost when on sale, that its small. he has ruined a few I am not sure how.  but he loves it and we always keep an extra for accidents, he wont change brand he only wants this one, he has tried similar size cost products but did not like them he says this is better.",small and helpful
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Aug 2020,mlbk,"We got this free with purchase of a Nest thermometer. Prior to that we had an Amazon Echo (Alexa) for quite a while, I believe we got that shortly after they first came out. We set this up in the living room and the Alexa is in the kitchen. So we can talk to either on the first floor of our home, so sometimes for fun and out of curiosity we will ask them both the same thing to compare the responses. Most of the time they're pretty much the same, but there are times Alexa seems to know more. Once in a while the Home will be the winner. They can even talk to each other which is neat, and the kids get a kick out of that to be sure. What we use ours the most for is setting timers/alarms/reminders, asking about the weather, getting answers to math problems we don't feel like breaking out a calculator for, brief facts that come up during conversation (a celebrity's height, the definition of a word, what year something happened, etc - whatever you could Google!). The only thing we've incorporated is the Nest, we can ask the Home to adjust the temperature. I'm sure there are plenty of things we could be using it for that have not yet occured to us. These things freak some people out, but they're the precursor to the inevitable robot household helpers and I think they're pretty cool.",pretty good household helper
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 May 2020,Deemoney,"This was my first ever smart speaker, and while I wouldn't say it totally lives up to Google's hype commercials, I can't deny that the device is useful for certain things.

I primarily use the speaker as a way to play Spotify, and in that it excels.  For such a compact item, the speaker is powerful and the sound quality is good.  My only complaint is that, if the volume is sufficiently loud, it's hard for the voice recognition to pick up your ""Ok Google!"" or ""Hey Google!"" commands.

Google loves to hype their smart speakers as a planning tool, where you can just command the device to add things to a list or calendar or schedule without needing to whip out your phone.  This can DO that, however it requires that you are using the relevant Google apps on your smart phone.  Replace your phone's Calendar app with Google Calendar, for example, and you can set up future dates with the Smart Speaker.

The drawback is, this device LOVES to tell you what it can't do.  There are apparently ""routines"" you can set up with Google Assistant, such as a ""going to bed"" routine that silences your phone, reduces speaker volume, and prompts it to start playing the sound of ocean waves.  Trouble is, the smart speaker can't ACTUALLY silence your phone, and so when you tell it ""Ok Google I'm going to sleep,"" it reminds you to just pull out your phone and do it that way anyways.  Every.  Single.  Time.  It gets annoying.

Finally, the speaker is great for quick hands-free Google searches.  If I'm debating a point with someone and need to check something, I can say ""Hey Google, how to I calculate Celsius from Fahrenheit?""  However, you do need to be careful with how this is phrased, because this is a literal Google search: the device types your words verbatim into a virtual browser and reads you the top result.  To use the example above, it may, instead of giving me the equation I'm looking for, just read a quick blurb about the history of Celsius.  Interesting, certainly, but not what I'm looking for.  Or, more likely, the Speaker will simply respond ""I don't have any information about that,"" though this seems to happen more with complex subjects that aren't explained in the first paragraph of a Wikipedia article.

In all, I like the Google Home for the simple things, music and quick searches, but that's pretty much it.  The other bells and whistles are pretty hit-or-miss for me, but I imagine somebody more plugged into Google's whole ecosystem may appreciate them.",Useful Little Speaker
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Feb 2020,Mallory,"I love my google mini, it’s my little assistant for many things! I’m constantly talking to google, asking this and that! I definitely recommend this to all, there seems to be endless opportunities with this little gadget!",Handy Assistant
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Jan 2020,danny,"i was initially against the google home / alexis stuff but once i got one for my bedroom (along with smart lights), now I love these things.  I have one in my bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, office, and both kids rooms. 

Hooked up spotify to listen to music through this. I put the smart lights in the main living areas and these controls them all. 

A great feature is the broadcast message feature. If dinner is done, I can broadcast a message to all rooms ""dinner is done"" and everyone in the house hears it.  

Another good feature is that I can call one mini hub from another. I haven't mastered this yet because sometimes it tries to call one of my contacts instead. Actually that literally would be my only complaint. if I said call 'nates room speaker', and it decides to call a person from my contacts, I cant cancel in time... it will ring my contact before i get a chance to say ""ok google hang up"".  a solution would be an option where it repeats your call request and wants a yes /no reply...  i.e., hub will confirm like this: ""call nates room speaker? say yes if this is correct"".  
I actually should take a star away for that one issue because I don't call hub to hub anymore just because of that - but everything else is so good I will just leave it and figure out on my own what i can do to not call contacts.",I didnt think i would like it as much as i did

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Jun 2020,DSADAM,"Mine is the first-gen Home Mini. My gripes are two-fold:

1.) It's a pitiful bluetooth standalone speaker, and won't stay connected to any device I pair to it. (Including a Pixel phone.) Casting to the device works fine, but trying to connect to it as a bluetooth speaker just doesn't work reliably - it cuts out after a few seconds or minutes. They've released half a dozen updates since I've had the speaker, and none have resolved this.

2.) Voice Recognition on this first-gen unit isn't as fast/accurate as the newer devices, which perform V-R locally on the device as opposed to querying the net.

Otherwise, it's useful for controlling lights and setting timers/alarms, asking weather and traffic queries, and general information.","Good, but could improve."
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Bumgee,"First off, I have been using the Eco Dot for a while. I mainly use it to listen to podcasts and music while I am working around the house. It is an ok device for listening to music but the speaker is a bit tinny. The Google Home mini speaker is way better. It does not rival the big brother Google Home in terms of sound quality but it has a much richer sounding speaker compared to the Dot... more bass, clearer sound. The Google Home mini mic can have a hard time hearing the hot word if you have the sound up really loud but I am guessing that will be fixed with a software update.",Way better than the Eco Dot

So if my family is sitting in the living room and we had a question, this agreement, or just simply want a quick answer about anything, Google helps resolve it.

I'm still trying to figure it out so that I can make doctors appointments, phone calls, reservations at a restaurant, etc. it was an expensive item so I don't regret buying it. I am a little anxious and maybe even paranoid about all the talk of how google can and will record your conversations but honestly we're not the CIA, criminals or have deep secrets so let it record, I have gotten in the habit of unplugging it at night or if I want to have a private conversation.

I have basic connectivity with home automation and it's nice to be able to perform actions from a different room. I've had no problem with the Mini hearing me. For some reason when I'm closer to the Google Home the Mini will pick up sometimes.

One knock is that it uses Micro USB instead of USB-C. It doesn't bother me that much now since I practically never move it.

My frustration is mostly with the Google Assistant. When I try natural queries it doesn't understand what I'm asking. I suspect it'll get better over time. Another minor frustration is tapping the sides to change the volume is awkward.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Batlacit,"I have perhaps too many smart devices in my household.  I don't really use light switches anymore - I have an app for that.  The same goes for running the vacuum, mopping the kitchen, and choosing what to watch on Netflix.

Pretty much the only way my home functions at all is thanks to smart speakers and personal assistants like this one - and I have quite a few.  From massive electric monoliths to wearables to smart screens, I've tried just about every variant of the Google home you can get.  And so far I don't think I've found any that can beat the Home Mini.

Yes, there are some areas where it's underwhelming.  The built in speakers are just okay.  It doesn't have a screen to watch videos on, or a clock.  And you can't stick batteries in it and take it camping with you.  But you also can't just stick any of the devices that do have all those on a wall behind a desk and pretend like you're Captain Picard as you turn off the lights with your voice.

While those more complex Home devices all have their purposes, the mini is the only one cheap enough and versatile enough to fill your house with.  They are essentially the backbone that enables my home automation system, and I rarely ever find that I miss the better speakers or colorful touchscreens.

One of the unexpected features I didn't realize it was capable of is how funny it is to be in one room and then you hear it answering questions nobody asked it or when you randomly walk past it and hear it whisper little sweet nothings from time to time. As soon as I realized it was listening to us and became self aware I decided to add a few more to the house so I could really speed up it's learning curve and utilize it's neural net processor. Now that I have multiple units sprawled across the house, I rarely ask it to do trivial things like turn on the lights for me. It's an insult to the tech. Now I consistently ask Google to broadcast flatulence across all devices. I can't begin to tell you how awesome it is to hear Google Rip Wet AF Alabama Mud Clumps in sync all over the house. It's like I'm engulfed in a Stank Symphony of sorts. It's not for everyone, especially my wife but I suggest you look up other reviews to see how others might utilize it's features but all in all I can't rave about it enough.",Great Tech for any Smart Home or Skynet Supporter

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,emptystreets130,"I was a bit hesitant on picking up another assistance device. I have 2 Echo Dot and was kind of disappointed that it could not go out to the internet and look up answers to my questions. 

I've done my research on the Home mini and bit the bullet. Got home, set it up and was pretty amazed at how straightforward it is to set up the device. Connect it to your wifi, say ""Ok, Google,"" ""Hey Google"" a few times and bam! All Done. I also connected my Philips Hue device to the Home app.

I'm amazed at how well it picks up sounds. Even in a noisy environment. My Echo Dot couldn't even pick up my voice; even in multiple locations. 

I put the Mini through my test. Asked it a few questions that the Echo couldn't answer and the Mini didn't break a sweat. The mini answered all my questions. Initially, this is what I was looking for. I'll be replacing my existing solution shortly!

The speakers on the Google Home MIni is so much better than the Dot. You can actually play some music with better clarity than the Dot. Bass is lacking but it's doable. I'm very surprised. 

If you want a Home Assistance device, pick this up over the Echo Dot. It's so much better and you can do so much more than the Echo lineup.",Miles better than the Echo Dot

I would highly recommend it, especially if you live alone or leave town a lot because after adding a couple small excessories you can turn your lights, tv, or even control your security system with a simple app on your phone and people will think someone is home and hopefully deter the burglars away.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,TechGuy,"There are other smart speakers on the market, but none comes close to the google home.  It crushes the competition in voice recognition and understanding your sentences (artificial intelligence).  Google's deep mind AI system is light years ahead of the crowd.  

This little guy sits in the sweet spot of price and function.  Want to hear your music on better quality speaker?  You can actually have google home forward all music to any network speaker or any speaker connected to a google chromecast speaker or device.  I have mine forward to my Sony SRS-ZR7 speakers which are network connected.  Works like a charm.  The non-mini google home costs substantially more and doesn't sound much better.

I use my google home mini speakers in almost every room of my home.  They control my smart lights (hue), my thermostat (nest), my home automation devices (samsung smarthings) which controls things like my motions sensors and my locks.  I also control my home theater system through my logitech harmony hub.  Just sit down and tell my system what movie to play.  It turns down the lights and starts up my entertainment system and begins the movie requested.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,psibrone,"So, I bought this because it was on sale and I figured, ""Eh, why not?""

It is the first ""home"" product I have, so it doesn't really do a whole lot, but it can be quiet convenient when you have a dumb question and everyone is sitting in the living room arguing over the fact and who is right and who is stupid... and then... you all feel stupid because there's your cellphone in your hand and you go, ""Hey Google,"" only to have the Home respond.

That's when you remember the thing is in the house.

That, or when you just want to fill a room with music from your Pandora account (yeah, I use Pandora, don't judge).

Oh, and the last thing you can do with this is open the Google app on your phone and send messages to the device in your own voice. I just wish it didn't announce who was sending the message and just, like, had the message play. I mean, that would be super hilarious. 

What? It would be.",Giving this a shot...

My sister got this thing and I just thought it was a speaker you can command to do stuff. It was neat for that but I did a little more research and if you kind of use all the apps google have i.e., the calendar and such, makes a whole like more useful then just telling it to play music.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JUMA,"We have had this google mini installed in our kitchen. Firstly to set the google mini you need to download the google home app and follow the setup instructions, this is common of many electrical products. The set up did seem to take a long time but this could of been down to my internet connectivity rather than the app itself. The google mini needs to be plugged in at all times, It would of been nice if the cable colour matched the device to blend it in more as the white cable stands out on our black worktops and the actual plug is bulky but this is personal preference and doesn't affect the product. We have been very impressed with the google minis 'understanding' it never fails to answer or perform the task requested regardless of who has asked it, woman, man, or child. As a speaker I don't think the sound quality is as good as other speakers on the market but that said other speakers don't remind you to make a packed lunch or tell you how long to cook roast parsnips for. We haven't got Spotify or googleplay which are the main music platforms supported by the voice activation but it is simple to pair your phone or table via Bluetooth to play music. You can request it plays radio stations for you without the need for a secondary device nearby if you don't use the above mentioned platforms. There is so much this device can do and we haven't even begun to fully utilise it yet, what we have done is; -Stored shopping lists on it so when you've got dirty hands cooking and use the last of something you can add it to the shopping list straight away without forgetting - Kitchen timer, you can ask it how long is left on the timer too - New and weather updates specific to you're local area or wherever else you request - Recipes - Radio - TImer My 9 year old has particularly enjoyed some of the fun features like beat boxing, trivia games and getting the answer to his maths homework. This is a fun family gadget.","Fun Gadget, Great product"
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Will,"I've bought four of these devices in both black and white cloth cover, they came free with the Nest thermostats. It was an easy setup when you link your google account to it. 
There is a hardware button to mute the microphone. I've accepted devices listening all the time and pray that google isn't an evil corporation ;-) Besides it's just like carrying around my cell phone around all the time that has a better microphone and is both wifi and cellular. I would recommend using a separate router/switch for your IOT devices so they are on a different network than your main network. You can use your speakers together as a group for casting to multiple speakers, but I don't think with just two speakers it will play in stereo. I believe there is a dev way to set it up that I will try later some time. It does recognize different voices and you can link up to three different google accounts, my wife and I did setup multiple accounts and it does recognize which account to use by our voices after you do voice setup and link it to the specific account. I can also control my Nest devices from any of the four mini devices
CONS: you can accidentally press the sensitive side buttons for volume when picking up the device. 
I don't know if they have a bracket to hang it on the wall or stand it up on stand, I have some on a higher shelf and can't see the lights respond to my voice commands, but you can turn on the settings to play a sound note for either start/end of a voice command response.
Wish you can you use amazon prime music like pandora premium, I don't know if this was done on purpose being google?
Sometimes when we use the free Pandora music service the music will stop randomly, I believe because Pandora is asking if you are still listening and you have to click online that yes you are still listening. We don't have this issue with the premium spotify services.",Great IOT device

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Stephen,"I already had one Google Home mini in my bedroom when I bought this one. I loved being able to play and control music (I use Spotify) using my voice, and I wanted one for my bathroom, specifically for when I'm taking a shower. I was a little concerned whether the Home mini would be able to understand voice commands over the sound of the shower, but so far it's worked perfectly. The volume is excellent, and I sometimes think I have it on too loud. I live in an apartment and I don't want to be an annoying neighbor, so I have to remember to say ""Hey Google, volume 50%"". I paid $30 when it was on sale. I would definitely recommend having this unit in one or more rooms. 

I like being able to play music on both my bedroom and bathroom Home minis at the same time, which I did by setting up a group in the Google Home app. I'm planning on buying a house soon, and when I do I will probably buy a couple more of these to have in my living room and kitchen.",Excellent for music

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Eboyer,"I had purchased Google Home last year when it came out. I simply couldn't figure out why I needed it since I had my Pixel phone with me all the time anyway. So I returned it. A year later, it's a different story. Google has made some compelling changes. The most important is that GH now recognizes the voices of different family members and provides personal help and music. The second big change is much better support for Home Automation. I have just got into it this month. It's great to be able to turn on lights, control temperature, arm alarm systems using ""Hey Google"". I went for a vacation and was able to control my lights and temperature giving an impression that someone was home. Now all of that can be individually controlled by various apps. But it's just more convenient to do it through GH. I have one main GH and a bunch of minis scattered around the house. Over Black Friday, they were going for $20 a pop. For the size, they have pretty good volume and they work really well. I have only 2 complaints about them. There is no wired aux port. So I had to buy a Google Chromecast Audio. I shouldn't have had to do that. Secondly, there is no way to connect a better quality BT speaker so music can be played on them instead but controlled via the Mini. The latter I hope is something Google can fix via a software update. At $50, I may have bought one mini. At its current price of $30, I'd say, it's a pretty good price especially if you don't have a Google Home.",Great price

All you have to do is make sure you've set up your devices on their respective host services (i.e. Samsung Smart Things and Insignia Smart Plugs), then you just add those services as 'devices' to Google Home/Home Control. Once done, devices will be controllable with Google Home Mini. At a minimum, these are nice internet connected speakers. For me, this serves as the means to verbally control some lights/devices and get some background noise/entertainment/info when hands are busy cooking... Sound quality is good (but I had low expectations coming in).

But I am expecting Google to continually enhance functionality (please allow hotwords to be customizable - 'hey google' does not roll off the tongue easily - too many syllables).",Plays well with Samsung SmartThings and Insignia
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,tafwt,"I started out with an Echo and when it seemed to malfunction constantly, they exchanged it for the new Echo Plus. Not much of an improvement, but I like having voice control of my smart home, Then, I decided to try an Echo dot, (for another floor of my home) which is about the same level as this Google Mini. However, after going through 2 of them, neither of which I could hear (nor could it hear me), I returned them and decided to try Google Mini instead. WOW, what a difference, not just in the sound, but in the quality of response from the device. It almost seems to have a personality...lol, which I think is adorable. But it also is more interactive. It responds better and more often. I do not hear ""I'm not sure about that"", near as often. None of these devices are where they eventually will get to, but between the 2 of these companies, I would definitely say that the Google product is better than Amazon's. And considering Google started two years later creating their product and seem to be better than Amazon already, I am sure this is the product that will win the AI race. The only thing Google still needs is to put a HUB inside one of their products, so you don't need to buy that separately also, like Amazon did with their Echo. If they do that, then I will go completely with the Google products. However, as I need a HUB, I still have my Echo Plus along with my Google Mini. But I do recommend the Google Mini and if you don't have any smart devices that require a HUB, then definitely go with the Google products.",Great product...my new best friend

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Lucia0471,"I bought this speaker for my daughter who was going away to college. While setting it up we realized that if you don't have your own wifi with an accessible password, then you will have to go through the hassle of connecting the device and your phone to the same hotspot and then connecting your phone's bluetooth to the speaker. Of course this isn't a problem for those who have access to a router and private wifi, but for those who don't, for example typically college students living on campus since its mostly public wifi, then you might want to consider whether or not you want to purchase this. The upside is a college student won't be living on campus forever, so it would be smart to invest in this device either way because overall it truly is a great speaker. It resonates extremely well and listens to you!!",Great speaker!!!...if you have wifi
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Robert,"First experience with smart home devices and wasn't sure what to expect. Was given one as a gift and liked it so I decided to get a couple more. It is great for playing music in a room by saying hey Google, play jazz or similar. It will only play a specific song if you have it on a device or you subscribe to a particular U tube service, that's a little annoying. You can control lights etc. but you have to purchase other smart devices like light bulbs which are not cheap. Telling it to turn on or off the light is handy and not just a cool trick. You can broadcast from one device to another which means you can say a message and it will relay it to another device and ask if the person listening wants to respond. That's great if you want to tell someone something in another room but of course, there has to be another device there. If you're willing to invest it can have a lot of useful functions beyond lights and music. Eventually houses will come with all of this stuff built in but until then we'll have to buy them one piece at a time.",Fun and useful device

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Dec 2019,mnapier,"I already provided a glowing review of a black home mini because it's much better than its competition in terms of virtual assistants. SIRI is useless (for good reason, Apple's user privacy is more robust, meaning their machine learning spies less and therefore learns less), and Alexa doesn't have the advantage of Google's search query data to train its machine learning.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,January5th1986,"I absolutely love my google home and mini! I've been wanting to buy one of these babies for a long time, and when it went on sale for $79 during the holidays, I knew I had to get one- plus a few more as gifts lol (the mini was only $29). 
Since, I've had the google home, I've been obsessed, completely entertained. I ask it random questions, ask it to play music, command it to do certain tasks (such as alarm or to turn on the coffee maker/lights). I also sync certain apps to make my daily tasks easier. 
I have both the google home and mini; the home definitely provides better surround sound, but the mini isn't bad at all. The mini may be best for a slightly smaller area. Both are extremely sensitive to sound. I can say a command and it can hear me from any room of the house lol. It also responds to voices. So, it's very personal. For example, if I ask, ""Hey Google, add my friend's birthday dinner November 3rd 7 p.m. in my calendar,"" and it'll add it to MY calendar as opposed to if my brother asks it (if he commands google to add an event, then it'll add it to HIS calendar). 
It does sooo much more. And I'm sure as the years pass, it'll get smarter, more personalized, and overall soo much better. 
If you're hesitant on getting the google home (or mini), just take my word and buy it. Just dooo ett. I promise you won't regret it.",Buy it!!!
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,jikhead,"I picked up two Home Mini's on Black Friday when I had no intentions of buying one. But since they were at the very front when I walked by and saw them on sale for $30 plus w/$10 gift card, I said what the heck and bought two. I'm using one side-by-side my Echo Dot in the living room, and another one in my bedroom. I'd say that the Google units work equally as well if not better than the Amazon products. I do like that the Google Assistance on the Mini's will work in conjunction with my Pixel 2XL. So I can get more usage out of it because of that. I also use it with my Harmony Hub. It works and completes commands as good as my Echo Dot; however I do tend to have to be more specific on my commands for them to work. I have to include ""Hey Google, tell Harmony..."" before my command. With my Echo Dot, I only have to say ""Alexa,...."".","Better Than Elexa in Some Areas, Others So Better"

It's been so easy for both of us to use voice commands that we bought a second one for the bedroom. There is also a group functions where the music can play from both devices at the same time or not. It was difficult trying to set us both up for the first one we purchased since one has an Android phone and the other an Apple.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Lchase78,"Ok, so i bought this because a guy at work had one and i thought it was pretty cool that he was checking on sports scores and weather reports and playing his spotify on etc.. i downloaded the app on my phone which was quick and painless then synced it with my gmail and spotify account while checking and adjusting settings for the device. About using the google mini, I like that you can check the weather, time, set a timer, ask simple questions and do mad libs etc.. I dont like that a long question gets a ""i can not answer that right now, I am still learning"" answer from the device. Also i didn;t like that another android user can pause or start the song you were playing via their phone. Hopefully just a missed setting on my part. Hopefully that will change in time. It seems to answer basic math questions easily and can answer info on places around town like hours of operation etc. We were sitting around one night just talking and all of a sudden the google home mini just said ""Cool"" out of the blue which was pretty odd so i unplug mine when not using it. The kids like asking it to play songs which i am kind of confused about. I was under the impression it only answered to the owners voice but maybe this is a setting i missed somewhere. All in all its a pretty cool device and i am still figuring things out about it so i would recommend this item to a friend. Hoping in the future it can answer longer questions like talking to google on your phone does. If not i will just use it to play spotify on at work and check simple answers like i originally intended it to be used for. There is quite a bit you can do like chrome casts and lighting in your house settings but they require other adapters etc which i just havent got to explore as of yet...",Heres my honest unbiased review of the mini...

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,MizuNoHane,"The Google Home Mini is not what I would consider a ""quality speaker"". It's got a slightly louder, deeper sound than the Echo Dot but it's not something I would use to listen to music for long periods of time - think of it more as a podcast engine rather than for high-fidelity sound. 
The real reason you should buy this, and without question I would recommend this, is for what it really offers: a window into all the amazing tasks the Google Assistant has to offer. It can do all the things Siri and Alexa can, but it also does so much more - its natural language processing makes it so much more flexible to make requests and queries, and it taps into the biggest knowledge base available - Google! This means it answers questions so much more readily than the other two major voice assistants can. Today I asked, very poorly, ""Hey Google - how long does it go between World Cups?"" Despite the fact that this sentence literally makes no sense, Google understood I was asking what the timeframe was between World Cups and told me the answer. It's brilliant, and it gets smarter every single day. At the time of my review, it makes great speakerphone calls, it sends broadcast messages to all your other Google devices, and it can understand up to three commands given in a single sentence. That's pretty amazing. And when you buy multiple Google Home products - we have two Minis and a normal Home - they all play music or news simultaneously in a sort of surround sound mode. And we use our Google Homes to control our home devices like our TV entirely by voice! An incredible device, and definitely an accessible gateway into the smart home future.","Sound not the greatest, but brains are everything"

I have 3 such devices as I have placed one device in each of my 3 bedrooms. The primary use for the Home Mini is listening to music at bedtime, and for listening to the latest news. I can also utilize the Home Mini as an intercom unit between the rooms. The Home Mini can send 3 - 5 second messages between each unit. I can also make telehone calls from the Home Mini which can be an useful feature. The Home Mini can also answer above average questions, it can also tell the time, weather, traffic, set alarms and timers and interact with some smarthome devices.

In fact my wife and I have gotten emotionally upset at the DOT numerous times LOL because the DOT made so many mistakes, or was unable to answer some basic questions, or refered us to the ALEXA HELP APP, or asked us to repeat the request, or would play the wrong requested song, and would stop working altogether at times for days. Now we have never ever ever ever experiences these same types of problems with our Google Home or our two Google Home Mini devices. In conclusion, the Google Home Mini is an outstanding device for 29.99.",GOOGLE HOME MINI

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Brady,"I was one of the early adopters of Alexa when Amazon first launched their smart product line.  I used it religiously for about 2 years... until I tried Google's smart products.

I started out just adding this in our bathroom so I could voice-activate some music in the shower, hoping the sound quality was good enough to carry over the glass.  This thing packs a punch for the price and was a cinch to set up.

Now I've fully migrated from Alexa/Ring products to Google/Nest because of how intuitive everything is and how well-supported the products are.",Migrated from being an avid Alexa user

Being able to ask about my commute to work or a particular location is really convenient because i can gauge how much time i need to get there, and the Google Home takes it a step further by sending directions to my iPhone. I also found the integration process for various smart-home devices extremely painless. I've managed to integrate smart outlets from what seemed like a no-name brand with my Samsung SmartThings hub (and water leak sensors, plus one more power outlet) and finally, my ADT security system. Everything works flawlessly. I was actually so pleased by my experience with this Google Mini i bought two more.

I got this Google mini free with my wife's new Google pixelbook. I set it up and was surprised it answers questions better than the echo dot. In the last two days, Amazon must have updated their software and the Logitech hub is not working with my echo dots. But the Google mini works fine for controlling my TV and home entertainment system. The Google mini is also good for being able to turn on lights before I enter the house. Since my car has Android Auto, I can turn on lights before entering the house since Android Auto supports Google Assistant. Also, on the Google pixelbook, there is a keyboard button for Google assistant. Overall, I am very impressed with the Google mini. The only things I do not like is that it doesn't support Amazon music, iHeart radio, and other functions that are available on my Amazon echo dots.",Works better than Amazon Echo Dot

I set this up for fun, and so far seemed to be pleased with it.  The microphones don't seem to work as well as Alexa (e.g. my voice from family room to where this Home Mini and a Dot live in may not register against the Mini).   However, the search results seem to be better - Home Mini directly answers most of my questions whereas Alexa might return ""According to Wikipedia...does this answer your question?""  Also things like getting weather seems more precise on the Mini - returning date and time it might start raining, whereas Alexa just says ""yes, there's a 60% chance of rain.""",Great alternative to Echo

I have always wanted one but the price was never in my price range but for the whole month of December in 2017, the Google Home devices were on sale. Before buying this item, I read a lot of reviews on the original Google Home and the Google Home Mini because I did not want to buy it without other buyers’ opinion on both of the items. I am so glad I read reviews because I would have bought the original Google Home because ‘bigger is better’ but in this case the Google Home Mini would meet my needs. The Google Home Mini is much cheaper than the original and I feel as if the Google Home Mini is much easier to access. It is so much smaller than the original so it is much easier to make space for it throughout your home.",Great Addition to my House

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,KevinR,"I've had this for about a year now and ran into some early integration issues. I had about 4 scattered across the house, but some would respond to commands and some wouldn't. I basically had to reset all of them and start from scratch to get my wemo switches to talk to all of them reliably. Since then, with software updates and app updates, the system is more reliable. The addition of routines allow one to string together multiple commands. For example, I have a single goodnight command that sets the alarm, reassures me the garage door is closed, tells me the inside temperature, and plays some crashing ocean waves for white noise for 45 minutes as I drop off to sleep.

If you don't need google voice calling, look for the insignia units on sale. They are a great alternative for half the price.","a little rocky at first, but great now"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Kevin,"I had Amazon Echo for a while, and I wanted to try Google Home Mini. 

In some way, it's better than Echo for example, it recognizes voice far better than Echo Dot. When there is a schedule in Korean, Google home reads in Korean, in my voice!!! While Echo does not know if there is something on my calendar.

In some ways, Echo is better than Google Home. Google home mini's bluetooth is terrible. It keeps being interrupted often so I cannot play music on a bluetooth speaker. To connect a bluetooth speaker, I have to change default speaker on Google home app. But for Echo Dot, I can just say ""connect my speaker"" then it connect to the one connected last.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Expatriated3,"I bought this on a great deal because I was curious about Google Home. I have an Amazon Echo and really love it's versatility and smart home controls, but I wanted to see how well Google Home integrates with my android smart phone. The answer is it works amazingly well, accessing my music and calendar flawlessly. There are devices that Google Home controls better than the Echo and vice versa. It is interesting to see the differences in the ecosystems between the two devices. So far though, I am having a lot of fun exploring the mini and all it can do. As far as cons, the speaker gets louder than I expected for its size but it sounds canned when playing music loudly with no real bass to speak of. Also, the music options are more limited than Amazon's offering without paying for a subscription. This is generally not a concern for me because I have a lot of music on Google play but I find that every other song I want to hear is only available on subscription.",Inexpensive way to enter the Google Home system

I can ask it for the time, for a rundown of my calendar when I wake up, I can ask it what the forecast is going to be so that I'll know how to dress that morning. You can even ask it to tell you a joke if you need a little laugh. If you also have things like Chrome Cast, you can operate them through the Google Home Mini as well, once you've synced them up in the Google Home Assistant app.",Don't Call Me Mini

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,rtbestbuy,"Decided to try the Google Home Mini this Christmas when it went on sale. Have been using the Amazon Dot for a while now, mostly for home automation. From a hardware perspective, the Google Mini is a much better speaker than the Dot and can function as a bluetooth speaker for other devices. The Dot can use an external speaker. The Dot has a better (more sensitive, better distance) than the Mini.

The bigger difference between the two is in the backend processing. The Mini is much more adept at language processing than the Dot. With the Dot, you select the skills that you want and link them to your device. With Google, it's all hidden, the phone app will search for any compatible devices, which is much more limited than the Alexa skills list. One big issue with the Mini are the permissions that the Google Home app requires, which are much more invasive than the Alexa app.

That having been said, the Mini is now a fixture in my office, using it for reminders, music, and as a speakerphone. All of which work pretty well.",Different than the Dot
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Alan,"I have no real need for a voice-activated assistant in my house.  But for $30 I figured it might be fun to have one around.  There are countless reviews of Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri out there, so I won't get into the pros and cons of each.  But suffice it to say, I'm more invested into the Google ecosystem than the others.  Also I value Google's better AI and its better understanding of natural language above all other considerations.  However if you're already knee-deep in Amazon services, then Alexa should be a better choice.  But I digress.  While the true differentiator in this category is the software, I'll focus on the hardware.

The hardware design is very clean.  A series of lights flashing through the speaker provides visual feedback.  There are no physical buttons, but volume can be adjusted by tapping the device on the left and right sides.  All other settings are controlled by an app.  The sound quality is adequate.  But when it comes to music, it's probably best suited for background listening.  There are other Google-branded devices that offer better sound quality and features.  But the main advantage of the Google Mini Home is that it's small, cute, unobtrusive, and inexpensive.  There are a few different colors to choose from.

The initial setup was relatively easy as the app walks you through the process.  It does require ""AP isolation"" on your router to be disabled, and if it isn't the setup process cannot be completed.  AP isolation may not be possible to adjust on some routers especially low-end ones.  If it's not possible then you're out of luck.  At that point you either need to return the Google Home Mini or upgrade your router.  Also a Google account is required to activate the speaker.

The trigger phrase to wake Google Assistant is ""Ok Google"" or ""Hey Google""--phrases that don't exactly roll off the tip of your tongue compared to the competition.  Currently there is no way to change the trigger phrase.  This is a minor but noticeable deficiency.  But I suppose that's the case with all voice assistants.  So your dream of pretending to be Captain Picard barking out ""Computer"" will have to wait for another day.","For the low cost, why not have one?"

GAH!"" and then have to get out of your comfy cocoon of blankets just to do it? This comes in handy. It sometimes doesn't pick up all of my commands. But otherwise I really enjoy it.","Works well, sometimes confused"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Mike7,"is a little device that’s intended to live in your house or apartment, providing an access point to all of Google’s services whenever you need them, even if your hands are full or you’re not in front of a phone or computer. It can play music, answer questions, tell you the weather, wake you up in the morning, control smart home gadgets, and do other tricks.
Everything the Google Home is designed to do can also be done with Amazon’s wildly popular Echo, which launched two years ago. The similarities between the two are near-endless: like Google Home, the Echo is a screenless, connected speaker that’s always listening for a voice command and can play music, answer questions, turn your smart lights on or off, and more. There’s a lot of overlap between these products, and for most intents and purposes, they are all but identical in use.
But Home has something that the Echo doesn’t: a wealth of knowledge about the world, my personal preferences, and my habits. In other words, it has Google.

 I would recommend this to a friend",First time user

I do not like Amazon for more than an online marketplace (so I do not want Alexa products).

Can set alarms and listen to music (not a lot of bass reproduction). We have multiples in our house and love the functionality. I cannot wait to expand my home automation.",So fast and fun

I reached out to a support tech and found out it was a known issue and they were working on a bug fix for it and would let me know when it was released. I ended up returning the unit but never heard about the bug fix. I have since then purchased another one and it worked great with all of my smart devices. I actually prefer using it over using HomeKit with Siri. My son loves talking to google too!,Great once Google Fixed some Bugs
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Elvin,"Does what it should do. If you use google assistant on your phone, you should know it is pretty help.
But, couple things that it could be improved: 1) you can use your phone's assistant to ask it send messages to people, but you can't on this (unless you install IFTTT on your phone and that doesn't work as well as the phone's assistant); 2) now that I have both the phone and google home, sometimes it gets confusing. I want to talk to my phone to set an alarm, but it sets it on the home device. Now, I wake up in the bedroom and need to turn off my alarm, I need to go to the living room to turn off on the home device.",Works pretty well but could be improved

I was so pleased that now I have 3 Google Home devices , 2 of them google minis. Silly but I ask for the time, date and temperature several times a day. It's just easy.

It's my alarm in the morning due to my spouse not liking an alarm clock with blinding light. So I tell Google to set an alarm at a certain time and low and behold itll be ringing.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Premjani,"This Google home surprised me. I didn't do my research beforehand to find out that they permanently disabled the top touch pad which takes away the only physical way to stop music/prompt the assistant in the first place. Seems like a manufacturing defect had a few of them constantly activating on their own so Google had to disable the top touch pad through a software update. Other than that it's what you'd expect, you can get the assistant to do various tasks, such as streaming music or casting to a chromecast, etc. The speaker it has isn't the best obviously but it's good enough considering the price and form factor. If you wanted to have access Google's assistant for a low price, this is your best bet.",Google Mini Rocks

The device is cool for family gatherings, cool for listening to music while cooking and cleaning or bbqing on the deck, even cool for helping with research and homework.

It's extremely helpful, from setting alarms to timers, to reminders or checking weather before getting ready. Or if you put it in your bathroom, like we do, you can have it play music while you shower or take a nice relaxing bath. Even make phone calls. And because we have it in every room, we can play one song simultaneously throughout the house all at once as a group. Buy it now, and buy many!",The best for any smart home!

I often find it getting in the way more than resolving things. If something I need and expect a visual cue or response,  I ask my phone. However,  if it's not done quietly,  the mini takes over. I wish you could assign slave - master relationships. For more,  I just try to remember to use click the mic button instead of calling out Okay Google. Also,  I think Hey Google and Okay Google are too similar.  It's good to control certain devices,  play music late at night, check the weather and my schedule.  I also like the intercom function.",Nosey

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Zander,"The Google Mini is in most ways similar to Amazon's Echo Dot. It is intended to anchor you to Google's Ecosystem. It works with the Google Assistant to provide responses to inquiries, and as a hub for such tasks as thermostat and light controls. In my experience, it is faster in responding to inquiries than is Alexa. The speaker is also of better quality than the comparable Echo Dot. Unlike the Echo Dot, however, it lacks the ability to be connected via Blue Tooth to superior speaker systems. If you want to use Google's ecosystem on superior speakers, you will have to purchase the Chromecast, or one of its derivatives. The Google Ecosystem remains somewhat less developed than Amazon's in terms of the availability of third party products through what Amazon calls skills. But if you are happy with Google's own services -- and they are quite numerous -- the Google Mini is an excellent introduction.",Google's answer to Amazon's Echo Dot

Google on the other hand will give you stores based on how far away they are from you, and even send directions to your phone. You can even ask about how long it will take to get there with current traffic. Alex does have more tie-ins with 3rd party apps, but the main ones I use like harmony remotes, nest thermostat, hue lights, LIFX lights and my smart things hub.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,HaywoodJablomee,"Positives:
1) decent voice recognition - I use this in tandem with another Google Home (the mini is supporting my downstairs and is used with my home theater)
2) Google is adding features and doing more with its Assistant each week
3) love the home control with my August Smart Lock, Phillips Hue bulbs, Logitech Harmony Elite and Chromecast
4) since we already had a Google Home, everything with our profiles came over - sync up was easy
Negatives:
1) the speaker is not that great for music and only ok for podcasts/general audio
2) i bought it for $29, but at $50 with a Google Home going for $79, the Home is a better deal",great deal @ $29

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,rahrah12,I have this and an Echo Dot. Had the Echo Dot which is located in a better location and gets more use and already tied in to rest of the house so its a bit unfair. This is a bit more responsive but not enough  to swap out for the Echo Dot. ONe thing I like about this is that it ties in to the Roku but I really wish it had more functionality with the TV and Roku where I could get  it to swap channels and things. Works well though. I believe my opinion would be a bit different if I got it first.,Not Bad

I think it the long run this will be a far better echo system than Amazon's simply due to the all the products google can integrate. What really sold me on this was the combatability with Chromecast and Youtube TV. I can tell the Google home to put on NBC on my TV and it works really well. It also works really well with Google Photos. 

I think Echo's have some advantages I think that fact that Google is way more open makes it a better investment in the long run and my only gripe is my wife struggles to get it to activate sometimes.",Good product

I have the Echo between the kitchen and family room, but the Mini is in my bedroom. I initially placed it on the dresser below the wall mounted Roku TV. The problem was it couldn't hear me when the TV was on. I had to pause or mute, which defeated the purpose of the Mini controlling my Roku TV. So I moved it to my night stand next to the bed and it works much better.

If you are set up with Google you will love it, we returned it due to convenience for the Echo’s. I did prefer the sound on the Google mini to the echo, but the #1 decider was the functionality of the broadcast functions/intercom. Google Maps no only works by broadcasting to every unit (we have 6 for use as an intercom) which Was annoying, and you had to broadcast a new message from each side of the conversation as a new broadcast (slow and annoying). The Echo however, you can drop in from another Echo or cell phone remotely and the feature works like a phone on speaker phone, Awesome!

Because it's smaller the speaker is smaller and just doesn't have the bass or clarity of the larger one. So if you use your google home for music you're better off paying $50 more and getting the larger one.... if music is no issue to you this does exactly what the large one does.,Nice.. but....

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Caitlyn,"I recommend the google mini to everyone. It's small and can be concealed anywhere but the speaker packs a punch. Being able to work my Phillips hue lights with the speaker as well as Spotify/YouTube is convenient. I love being able to tell Google I'm going to bed and have her ask what time to set the alarm for before she plays an hour of calming sounds.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,droyer26,"I love the Google mini. I purchased it on Black Friday for $25. A great buy. The Google Home app integration needs a bit of work. I wanted to set a routine to turn on my TV and light when I announced ""I'm home."" Both of the devices showed up in the ""room"", but only one would add to the routine. Customer support walked me through a workaround, but it was clearly a workaround. Should have been easier.",Love the mini. Interface needs work.
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,MidasTouch3,"I received the Google Home as a free gift with a Nest purchase.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Dimi,"I'm very happy about the Google home assistant.
I linked it to a smart-plug that allows me to turn a bedside lamp on and off by voice, it controls my TV via a Chromecast and it even wakes me up in the morning with news recaps I chose and interesting facts.
It gets updated pretty often. I thought it was missing a feature to create custom commands to trigger several actions, it has been added few days after I bought it! I can now say ""Hey google, I'm going to sleep"" and the assistant will stop playing movie/music, shutdown the TV and turn the lights off!",Assistant that never stops learning

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,mpayne2k,"I thought this would be a great addition to my Google Home I got for Christmas last year and has resided in my kitchen. I got this for my bedside with intention of minor music streaming, some podcast listening and an alarm clock. Main issue I have is sound quality really suffers above about the 40% level. Way too tinny and ear drum piercing. Also doesn’t work well as an alarm clock as the top button has been disabled by google due to privacy concerns. So the only way to stop an alarm early in the morning is to say “OK Google, stop alarm” which proved too tough for this device to handle when I was still waking from my stupor. I heard they dialed it in so you can push and hold the volume side of device to deactivate alarms but I have yet to try the update.",Good addition with some minor issues.
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Exia91,Google home mini works great and is very customizable for smart home stuff.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Raju,"have been playing around with both the google home mini and the Amazon echo dot for a while. about the only thing I preferred the echo over the mini was that the echo picks up you voice better and at greater distance than the mini. probably due to the 7 mic array of the echo vs the 2 of the mini.

My kids love it...",I prefer over the Amazon echo

Still needs a lot of development but the basics are there with promising potential and transparent software upgrades as enhancements roll out continruously. We have 2 Homes, 3 Mini's, and 3 Chromes throughout the house (paired with Android phones and other home automation products). The Mini's have surprisingly good volume but get the Home if you want quality music playback.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,MPT1,"Having owned multiple Echo devices for several years I wanted to give Google Home a try.

But then I connected them to the bluetooth bulbs for handsfree light control. It's great when coming in the house with hands full of groceries and tell Google to turn on the light. I talk to this thing all of the time now. You can create phrases that string together commands.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,DSOB,"While it works well, it is sometimes confusing. I have two of these, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Sometimes I will give a command in the living room and the reply comes from the bedroom speaker. Sometimes I will ask it to play music while in the bedroom and all of a sudden the sound bar on my television starts playing. Loudly. In the middle of the night. Still, it just teaches me that I need to give further instructions, noting that it should play the music on the bedroom speaker, on the living room speaker or on the sound bar. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason for why the replies come from different speakers, however. That still does not really affect the usefulness of the device.",It works well
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JD11,"I purchased the Google Home Mini to compare it to the existing Amazon products I have (Echo, Tap, Dot). Overall the functionality has been the same between the two ecosystems. 

I use Amazon Music Unlimited, Amazon FireTV, Amazon Shopping, and Prime Video, so it makes more sense to use Amazon products rather than Google. 

The Home Mini seems to accept a wider range of questions/comments phrased in different ways, sometimes you have to say things a very specific way with Amazon devices. The Home Mini also has a more natural sounding AI voice.",Comparing to Amazon Products

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,merv775,The Google Home Mini follows conversation better than my Amazon Echo Alexa. We have had the Amazon Alexa in our house for over two years. It does not always understands what you are saying and you have to repeat yourself on several time but the Google Home Mini understands my question or commands. I haven’t had to repeat myself with Mini I now ask my questions from my Google Home Mini instead of my Amazon Alexa. The only thing better about my Alexa is all my home automation devices are compatible with Alexa but not all with Google Home Mini. Until Google improves integration with third party smart home devices; I will have both Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini next to each other.,Follows conversations better than Alexa
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,silverhaw7777,"This was a welcome addition to an existing group of Google Minis and Lenovo 10"" Smart Display. Pleased with the network that has been established in the home along with the capability that it allows us to use it as an intercom system. The sound has been really good and the unit has performed quite well. I've already been recommending it to friends!",Addition to existing Google home system
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,MadisonDad,"We purchased a Google Home Mini for a blind friend. I help her with her tech and can attest to her frustration at trying to use Web sites with a screen reader. (Imagine something reading every link and ad and heading on a Web page when you are trying to get to certain content!) She was wary of getting yet another device at first, and I made sure she knew we were happy to return this product if she didn't like it. But she has really taken to it.

The Google Home Mini is the size of a donut and is really a speaker with smart capabilities when set up with your home Wi-Fi network. It has a microphone on/off switch and a USB cord output that connects to a power plug because it needs to be powered from a wall outlet.

My friend put her Google Home Mini on her dining room table. It has great sound for such a small device, and can give her the time, weather, and look up local businesses' operating hours and telephone numbers (and make calls over Wi-Fi -- although the call quality isn't that great when I tested it with her). She can have it set a timer or search for a recipe from the Internet, for say, a cake or something and then read her the directions one by one when she is ready. You can say, Hey Google, play KCBS-AM San Francisco or WBBM-AM Chicago or WCBS-AM New York, or many other stations nationwide, and it will do it! It will play podcasts, such as cooking podcasts or Spanish podcasts. We are still finding out all that it can do!

Two complaints: 1) You cannot setup the Google Home Mini out of the box using a computer. You need a tablet or smart phone and have to download the Google Home App to that first in order to set up the Google Home Mini. My friend doesn't have a smart phone or tablet. As a work around, I downloaded the Google Home App to my smart phone, added her Google account to my phone, and set up her Google Home Mini and chose her default news outlets and other settings. After a week or two, I deleted the app and her account from my smart phone so that her contacts and information would not be on my phone. But I really wish you could set up Google Home Mini without doing this. 2) As of this writing, Google Home Mini would not simply play audio from a YouTube clip over its speaker. It can send a YouTube clip to a TV that has a Chromecast device attached, but it'd be better if it could also just play the audio portion on the Google Home Mini speaker without having to connect to another device.

But overall, I think the Google Home Mini (and the Amazon Echo) have great potential for blind and visually impaired people. Any of the features I mentioned can also be helpful to a sighted person, of course, but for a blind person or a busy parent in a house with children (little time to sit and type on a keyboard), I can really see the Google Home Mini being extra useful.",Many uses for blind person and sighted people too
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Jan 2020,AuntLovie,Have bought 3 of these for gifts and use one myself. Love being able to ask it questions if I am not on line. Everyone I have given them to loves them,Great tool for asking questions
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,MisterK,"I bought this before Christmas when it was on sale for $29. I also own an Echo Show and a regular Echo (1st Generation). Having Chromecast, the Home Mini really shines. Being able to call up Youtube videos and Netfix by voice is incredibly convenient. The Mini is also better at answering general questions. However, I give the nod to the Echo Show for playing music (especially as an Amazon Prime member), recipes, pictures, timers and lists. Having a relatively non-smart home, I can't comment one way or another on that aspect.

I would definitely be more inclined to buy the Home Mini at the sale price.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2019,pentzy,"We have always had Echo Dot units in our house. I got this Google Mini free with a purchase so I had no issues testing it out.

Cons:  clunky app - the app doesn’t work very smoothly and seems to be restricted unless you have pay for services to add on. The buttons are not as clear and usable as the Echo Dot. I find myself using the app to turn down volume or use other features. I feel the voice recognition is more difficult and often doesn’t hear my voice over the highest volume setting. The music seems to have more treble than basic you don’t get a clear, solid sound from speaker. 

Pros:  while I don’t use the features, I feel it is much more expandable to house devices and connected devices. 

I originally gave it 4 stars, but the cons were much more than the pros - so I changed to a 3. 

I prefer Echo Dot, but it is great for my man cave. Maybe even for music in the shower.",Google or Alexa - I tested it out!

(especially when cooking and your hands are full). I appreciate how fast the answers are, there is practically no load time in between asking and it talking back to you. I enjoy the start my day feature where i can listen to news or add things to my shopping list set an alarm etc... however there are many things that I feel that I have asked it that should be so simple and it gives me an error message. like ""take this off my shopping list"" and it will tell me to go into the app tod= do it or tell me that it doesn't understated",Great product with A LOT of room for improvement

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,sriksv,I bought this out of curiosity more than anything. That being said the voice recognition works well even with my non-standard accent. It also has several integrations with smart home products like smart plugs etc. I use it to turn off and on the lights in our bedroom. You can also use it to stream music to Chromecast enabled devices. I am streaming music to our chrome cast enabled home theater system. Spotify seems to require premier membership but you can stream google play radio stations for free. It is also better at answering generic questions than Alexa. Overall I would say it is not a necessity yet but I can definitely see it being very useful once I add smart switches to my home.,Something to try

First, it's an excellent speaker. For the $20 I paid effectively, this alone is good enough a reason to buy. My most common use cases for me are for the timer, calendar, and weather.

They do several things well, but nothing that there aren't other avenues to do the same thing. I fell for the hype that because this device was part of the Google network it would be so much better at answering questions.

The only negative I see is that the two devices are not synced up. I have to setup them up individually.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,psyclopps,"I really wanted to love this. I have a regular size Google Home, Amazon Echo, Echo dot and a H/K Invoke as I love trying these things out. I think I put the Home mini at the bottom of the list for all of these. 

On the top end of things, it is cheap, looks great and has the power of Google behind it. These are all great selling points by themselves, especially if you use lots of Google services such as calendar, play music and more.

Now, for the downside of things... it doesn't ""hear"" as well as competitors. I find my self repeating myself a lot more than other units. Audio quality is meh but this is to be expected by a small device... but you can not connect it to a larger speaker system unless it has chromecast functionality. I had my old Echo Dot connected to my stereo via line in and sometimes via bluetooth. The google home does neither. It has bluetooth but it is for streaming to the device, not for streaming to speakers (I have read rumors it will come in a future update). There is no line in to speak of. This kind of makes it useless to me. 

Overall it is a good device with some issues but if you really like Google I recommend getting a full size Google Home or a difference device.",Not bad but not the best

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,snapperheadjoe,"Google has several things going for this tiny smart speaker. The sound quality is much better than on the Alexa mini devices however it doesn't have the ability to connect an external speaker via a plug or Bluetooth which is a big detraction. There is also no comparison between the Smart's of Google Assistant versus Alexa's very limited responses and knowledge when it comes to answering questions. However the Alexa assistant, in my opinion, is better at controlling smart home devices. Give Google a little time and they will catch up and probably surpass Amazon. For now if you want a better sounding mini smart speaker that can answer your random questions more accurately stick with the Google mini but if your main concern is controlling your smart home then the Alexa Mini is it better return on your investment. As a side note I own six Alexa Minis and two Google Minis and have put them head-to-head so my assessment is accurate.",Good smart speaker but not perfect

I set up this Google mini according to instructions, all went well, but when it got to allowing it to have all my personal information and to track me, I said no. It had my Google email address, so it had some of my information, it had it’s location/exact address, and time zone. Yet it couldn’t even give me the current weather. All this Google mini would do is basic internet functions. I linked it with my smart plugs and switches in the app, and it worked. I could control things through the app but not with the Google mini so I could use voice commands. This is ridiculous. There is no reason it could not do more with the information it had. As soon as I allowed it to have my location on my mobile phone with the Google app it could, all of a sudden, do everything. Everything was linked via my WiFi and could communicate, and used with the app, without the app knowing where I was all the time. Using the link to Google’s privacy policy online was a huge eye opener.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,BK78,"After owning the full size Google Home, I was interested in the Google Home Mini for my nightstand to use as a Bluetooth speaker and alarm clock. When Black Friday came around and the price dropped to $29 I had to pick it up. Set up is a breeze with the Google Home Mini functioning in a few taps of the app. 

For my purposes this works perfect. A small speaker that can get reasonably loud in my bedroom. The sound isn't great, but at low volumes it's pleasant and clear. I purchased the Chromecast Audio to stream over wifi to my bedroom stereo for better sound. The voice integration works great. Now when I walk in my room I have the ability to start up the music on either the Google Home Mini or my bedroom stereo all by voice or by smart phone or tablet. I also have a Chromecast which can be operated by voice, but I think it's much better to use your smart phone or tablet. Easy to set the alarm by just telling it to set an alarm. I'm debating adding a Wemo switch to make my lights voice activated like I've done in my living room. All the other Google Assistant stuff is just an added bonus. 

One thing that makes the Google Home Products stand out in my mind is the ability to ask more complex questions. With Alexa I can ask fairly simple questions and she can't understand what I'm trying to ask. Google is much better with this. Another great thing is that Google regularly updates the product to add new features. Since I've had my Google Home they've added Bluetooth streaming, equalizer, new games and activities. 

At this price point, this product is awesome and will get better with time. What would make it better is a 3.5mm jack so I don't have to buy an additional Google product to connect it to my stereo.",Makes a great nightstand speaker/alarm

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,BestBuyBuddy,I bought this and an Echo dot to see if either one was easy to use for conversational language translation. Neither smart speaker did as good a job as using Google Translate on a smart phone. The way you needed to phrase your commands was awkward and time consuming compared to using a smartphone. I am not interested in home automation so that part of the device was not tested. I think Google Home did a better job at answering my questions than the Echo dot. Once in awhile the Echo would give the better answer. I will need to play with both some more and explore their other capabilities before I can make a final determination as to their usefulness.,Does not do translation well

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,2,23 Nov 2018,bbjunky,"The Google Home mini is a product in direct response to the Amazon Echo dot. It is tied to your Google account and relies on that. I would have preferred it to have a more standard usb charger instead of the one that comes with (one-piece with non-detachable outlet plug), and the on/off switch is inconveniently positioned making it difficult to switch on/off at a moments notice, and the microphone is generally less reliable/sensitive than the Echo Dot, also there is no source input which cripples your ability to play anything other than what Google wants you to. The sound of the speaker is just about the same as the Echo Dot. All in all, you'll want to purchase this if you rely on Google Assistant as opposed to Amazon's limited Alexa. Despite Google's crippling closed-source implementation of the product, it's not bad for $30.",Limited Use

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,2,23 Nov 2018,Pk24,"The search feature leaves more to be desired. It recognizes voice commands well, but falls short when conducting searches. I feel that Amazon's Echo Dot does a better job. 

I will ask to search for an item or receipe. Some of the responses are ""I am not sure how to do that now"" or something similar. 

What it is good for is the news and weather. Don't pay more than $30 for this. The speaker volume is louder than Amazon Echo Dot which is a plus.",It's OK

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Flynt,"I stated with original series and then when minis came out, before they lowers price of originals I bought some of these for my work office, my home office and my bedroom. 

They do everything the original does. The only thing different that I don’t fancy is that sometimes it not quite as responsive as the originals. But still i plan to buy 3’more of these at their new price point for various locations at home and 1’for my truck. Yup, for my truck. 


Read the below review I posted about the Systems overall and see just how much value and dependence this tool has brought to our home. 



####%%%%%%%

I have tried so many things and returned a few companies products i this learning curve. 

The HUE lights are highly addictive. At first their point seemed too high for my hobby project that my wife would not accept right off the bat. They’ve lowered the prices and a still pumping out great new products. They are very reliable and very customizable. I love them. I love them I love them. 

See below for another review I placed about the Google Assistant see just how well the lighting has melded into my wife’s Psyche!!!!!

=============••=

Yes, “them”. 

At first I bought one and I bought an Echo also. I kept my Google Home Assistant Speaker and returned the Exho. 

I have bought 2 of the original style and two of the minis for my home. Couple with my smart switches, outlets and bulbs and with both chromecast to 1 tv and the other to anextra monitor and then 2 of the audiocast to two diffferent high output audio speakers in larger rooms and without an Assistant in those particular my house is coming alive. 

It’s funny, at first my wife kind of put off and frustrated with me doing this. Now she’s fully onboard, so much that other morning after just awakening she hurting the living to fold some cloths she left on the couch the night beforehand. I was still I bed and I heard her say “Turn Living Room” af few moment later I head her say it again. And then I heard her say “Turn everything on” and I could tell by her voice she was frustrated and I could tell by looking the cracked door that no lights were so. So. I said, the ‘mini’ speaker in my bedroom, “Ok Google, Turn Everything On” and voila the living room, dining room, bed room, kitchen, breakfast, many lamps and the Christmas tree all lit up to the preintendes brightness values. 


I get up an go toward her and say “Whats Up?” I then say, you gotta say Hey Google or Ok Google first. She said well they came on and I told her I heard and and did it for her from the room. She was irritated that her voice sauce was not tuning on the Lights. I have slowly building my system for about 4 months now. During the period she has become so used to the Speakers and talking to command them that she even thought to just go and Flick a switch or button for any light. She’s used to bossing these rooms around I guess. It was truly very cute and funny. 

BUT the best part is the feedback. ALL the MUSIC from google play. We have a very extensive Apple iTunes Music Library I have compiled from about 4000 CD and then the stuff we purchase through Intunes. I was actually waiting for the new Apple speaker to show up and that why I don’t have one of the larger model Googles. Apple has not delivered I’m just stick to my Google. Any back to the music. Our purchased library is huge. GOOGLE PLAY is exponentially larger and it rocks. I can come home and say Hey Google play some cool Jazz from the 50 and she will begin to fill the room with all kinds of music and artist I would never even think of. I can ask her to Play Contemporay Christian and she’ll plank all out favorites and a bunch of new songs my local radio stations have not let me hear yet. Wi H google play mynacccount in Yourube is upgraded to Red status. That means no stupid you tube ads and I think higher quality definition. She’ll play YouTube to the assistant and Cast devices in audio and replay the contest on my monitors (better that that echo display) and she’ll play my Netflix, news cast and a ton of other stuff on to my chrome cast. In the morning she tell me about the weather, my travel time and my agenda and reads to me the top headlines. 

We use the one in the kitchen the most. It is usable from Kitchen Living Breakfast ans Dining room areas with how my house it laid out and where I placed it. A great resource she pull up recipes, set times, and does so much. 

And now, she able to make phone calls too. The call come from my number so my contact know to answer and still I can use her to call MY phone on those occasions it has misplaced itself. My wife, it know her voice from mine and she can do all the above for her preferences. 

What I really really really want and am waiting in creating calendar events that tie into my Gmail ( and Apple and Outlook) Account’s and the ability to send voice to text messages from her. And real large on my wants to read and create emails. 

She say something like, “i’m Sorry I can’t help with that yet”. Come on google. Give it to me. 

My family came for thanksgiving. They fell in love. On Black Friday I bought a bunch of products to get them for Christmas. They’ll be hooked.",I have minis and the original models - I love em

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Jun 2020,OOhana,"In December 2019 one of our children received an Amazon Echo Dot for Christmas. After plugging it in and setting it up which was easy enough we realize there’s not very much kid friendly content that actually works. There’s lots of glitches in their content which is 90% third-party applications with some sketchy policies. The Eco is not able to understand anyone in our family on the first go no matter what we say. Being a military family we all have different accents. One adult from New York City, one adult from West Virginia and, one child who grew up in Washington state. We are constantly repeating ourselves to Alexa and she is constantly opening the wrong app, Music, or order. Nothing is more frustrating than asking Alexa to open a book and the only book she opens over and over is peter rabbit even the most patient child or adult will become quickly annoyed.

When it came time to buy smart speakers for the rest of our home I was convinced they must all be this bad but thought I would give Google home mini a chance since it’s conversational speech recognition and AI have good ratings. I could not be more pleased with the devices we purchased. The sound quality is excellent and they only phrase you have to learn is “Hey Google” as opposed Alexa’s many commands that even she doesn’t recognize. Well Amazon does both being able to place your orders I can do that from my phone in a few seconds which is usually faster than Alexa is able to recognize what it is I’m ordering anyway. Amazon is linked to audible obviously but Alexa frequently open the wrong box so it’s easier to broadcast over my Google home mini. Well Amazon does both being able to place your orders I can do that from my phone in a few seconds which is usually faster than Alexa is able to recognize what it is I’m ordering anyway. Amazon is linked to audible obviously but Alexa frequently open the wrong box so it’s easier to broadcast over my Google home mini. Google Home mini is also better able to help my grade schooler look things up or spell them. It was a breeze thinking with our smart TV and I’m assuming just as easy to connect other smart devices. We will very likely be adding to the two that we currently have. Well Google home mini has volume that can be controlled using your voice you can also touch the sides of the device itself to turn the volume up and down there are no visible buttons but it is sensitive to touch. I find the sound quality in general to be much better than Alexa on the Echo Dot. Alexa sounds muffled a lot of the time and the Google home mini is clear enough that we are able to use them as speakers throughout our home during parties/relaxed with quality sound. Google home mini also allows you to customize alarm sounds and set up morning/bedtime routines. Example: My morning routine starts with my alarm which I’ve sent to the sound of relaxing music a few minutes later google will play the news for me from my selective news stations and tell me about traffic on the way to work. At night Google will confirm what time I’d like my alarm set for, play meditation for me, and any other task I program it to do.

Privacy: Both Amazon Echo Dot and Google home mini have options to physically turn off the microphone. Echo Dot will glow red when the microphone is turned off and Google mini will show 4 orange dots. With Google Mini you can unplug it if you don’t trust the button. Once you plug it back in it picks up right where it left off with no need to setup. Amazon Echo Dot can do the same thing but takes longer to load.

Overall if you’re looking for something that you use every day for more than just weather the google home mini is the better option.",Love our Google home mini skip echo dot!

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Argus9,"I've owned several Amazon Echo devices and a Google Home and can say they're both useful additions to the home - having access to information and utilities like setting timers is incredibly useful in everyday life, in the kitchen, etc. I like the Home mini's aesthetics more than the Echo Dot - the fabric cover looks and feels nice, and the four LEDs to display status are nice and subdued.

The speaker on the device is decent, but not great. You'll want one of the full-size versions (Google Home or Amazon Echo gen. 2) if you'd like to listen to any music on the speaker with any real fidelity. However, for listening to voice responses, podcasts, or audiobooks, the Home Mini's speaker works just fine.

The size is convenient and lets you install it just about anywhere in the home. You can even get some command strips and hang it on a wall easily. That said, it's pretty stylish and you'll probably want to display it somewhere openly to add to a room.

The Home Mini is backed by Google's AI technology, so it's superior to the Echo (and, likely, the upcoming Apple HomePod speaker using Siri) for answering questions and queries, but currently, the Echo has a wider range of third-party services it supports through its ""Skills"" system. Google will probably catch up eventually, but for now, its main use is answering simple questions, starting timers and setting reminders, and helping you with connected google services like Google Calendar.

You can also use the speaker as a Google Cast device to cast audio to its speaker, and even connect it with other Google Cast-compatible speakers to set up a multi-room audio solution. Again, the speaker isn't great, but it'll get the job done.

Overall this is a nice showing from Google, and it's good to see these smart assistant devices starting to become more affordable than ever.",A solid smart assistant for Google service users
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,duchess,"The Google Assistant is definitely the best voice assistant available today. I have both this and an Amazon Echo Dot in my house and this is the one I almost always use. Whether it be Google Maps, Google's Knowledge Graph, recipes, reminders or calendar events Google just does it better. Responses are, on average, more accurate and relevant. I love how I can have the Google Assistant installed on my Android phone and Apple iPad, set a reminder on my Google home, and then remind me on all my other devices. The integration is really good, not to mention the direct tie in to Google Calendar (the most capable calendar I've used). As far as the hardware, the speaker on the Home Mini is leaps and bounds better than the one on the Echo Dot in sound quality, volume and dispersion (Seriously, it sounds really good). Google also just has a nicer voice, a lot less robotic. Also - if you have a Chromecast device this is THE assistant to get because they can seamlessly talk with each other. Bottom line, this is just a nice thing to have that can make your life just a little bit easier.",Amazing!

Sound quality is exceptional considering the price and features packed into it, but don't expect to be blown away by strong a bass or clear highs. This device was not designed to perform in this area. The AI assistant is amazing and captures the interest of children and adults alike. It understand most questions, but this will be less of an issue later on as the AI is constantly being developed. The voice recognition is also great, the device failed to identify my voice in only the most extreme of cases but otherwise very reliable. As an entry point into AI assistants I don't think there is a better option and the thought and quality put into this device desires a full five stars with the expectation that the AI will improve with years to come.",Great tech with a lot of potential for the future!

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,PervisStoop,"Relatively easy setup (I'm an IT professional, so easy for me)
LIKE: Recognizes voice as mine, Amazon's Echo Dot recognizes any without distinction. *DING* plus a star . . . 
LIKE: Form factor is nice & like the mostly hidden lights behind the material.
LIKE: Speaker is better than Amazon's Echo Dot (volume & bass, anyway) although really, if you want good sound, you're not going to use the device by itself anyway . . . ah well, *DING* plus a star.
LIKE: Connected immediately to YouTube (I pay for red) when signing in with my existing google account and it immediately picked up my preferences. *DING, DING* plus 2 stars! (Amazon Music has proven fairly restrictive & often shifted prime songs in and out of their basic Prime inclusion: trying to force an additional prime music subscription, which I refuse to do, considering I already pay for Prime. So YouTube has been my go-to for the last year or so & glad it's already on board.)
LIKE: Had light bulbs and plug switches connected to Kasa's TP-Link and already controlling them with Amazon's Echo Dot . . . with sign in connection established between Google Home & Kasa's TP-Link, all were immediately available for control . . . plus I could rename each device specific to Google Home. *DING* plus a star.
DISLIKE: Can't change the wake phrase. You're stuck with OK Google or Hey Google. *DING* minus 1/2 star. (Echo has 4 options, one of them is ""computer"" . . . which is what I like)
DISLIKE: AI voice limited to male & female with no real variations: I don't particularly like or dislike either voice.
DISLIKE: ABSOLUTELY HAD to install Google Home on my phone or iPad (would rather I didn't HAVE to do that, no option for Windows 10, but oh well *DING* minus 1/2 star).
SUMMARY: If you're big into Amazon, stick with Echo, it's roughly equivalent in ability. If you're not really into Amazon, Google Home is probably your better bet. For either, if you're new to the whole AI automation thing, you should start with the Home Mini (or Echo Dot) & a few outlet plugs and/or controllable light bulbs in the bedroom. Set up a morning routine & go from there . . . a LOT of really great stuff. Certainly more to come, as this whole AI thing is just getting started. Remember this thing is sitting there listening to everything 24/7 . . . so if you're into conspiracy theories or nefarious activities . . . you might want to think twice about providing an audio channel into your home space. I'm not personally worried at this point, but am definitely going to keep my ears open for what is going on in the home consumer AI space . . .",Comparable to Amazon's Echo Dot (Alexa) . . .

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,VideoSavant,"Bought two of the Google Home Minis for my father with the idea that he would use them as speakerphones, as he's hard of hearing. They work great for that purpose and the speaker sound quality is much better than I would have expected in such a small size. The only problem is that Google Home does not yet allow for the Home service to receive incoming calls, despite the fact that he has a Google Voice account/number. So, one star docked for lack of functionality that should be standard.

Bought these for $29 each during Black Friday sale, and also received two $10 Best Buy gift cards. So, net price was $19 each. Used the cards to buy the new, heavily advertised Philips One Blade electric razor, which is a winner.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Java1044,"I wasn't sure if this would be a great product to purchase originally. I had heard many ""iffy"" reviews on the Amazon Echo and was scared to try something different. I decided to watch a few review videos online and went on a whim to buy the Google Home Mini. To my surprise, the product is amazing, especially for the price. I have it in my bedroom and it is plenty loud and the microphone can hear me clear as day even in the lowest speaking tone. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a small, affordable, smart hub.",Great Product!
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,MultiTaskingGenius,"We have Google Home and these Google Minis are absolutely perfect for other rooms in the house where we want something a little smaller! We use it so often to check the weather and ask it other random questions that we didn't want to constantly have to be near the main unit to use it. We placed a Mini in our master bedroom upstairs and we use it every morning and every night at the very least. We also use it frequently to play music while we sort laundry on our bed with our 5 kids (that takes a while and the music makes it seem like a little less of a chore.) The sound quality has been excellent and we have had zero issues with it since we bought them. We even bought another one to give one of our daughters for her basement bedroom. She chooses her school clothes each day based on the weather forecast and we don't allow smartphone or tablets in bedrooms (for social media purposes and because our kids would probably hide away in their rooms), so this is the only way she can check the weather without having to come upstairs to ask the main Google Home about the weather forecast. I have the one in our bedroom set up to my own voice so that when I say ""Good Morning"" to it, it tells me the current temperature, the forecast for the day, and what's on my calendar. I can also opt (through the app) to have it tell me about news stories, my work commute and traffic, the stock market, and other options that I can't remember because I don't use them. (I work from home so I have no traffic commute but I bet that would be a helpful feature for those that do!) I prefer Google Home over Amazon's Alexa, but do hope Google will start coming out with more products that are compatible with Google Home. I see a LOT of products as being compatible with Alexa but Google seems to be falling a little short in that category. It's not importatn enough to me to warrant buying an Alexa as we really love playing games on our Google Home and enjoy the many features, but something to consider if you're wanting a lot of add-ons that are compatible with your smarthome product.",Love so much we bought more!
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,gdubs,"This little device does everything the Google Home speaker does... but comes in a small soace savimg design. The only drawback is the sound quality. This device is lacking in bass, but exceeds other devices at this price point. Good for casual listening, but won't impress audiophiles. If rich bass is what you want, spend more money on something that was designed for it. Volume is great and microphone picks up well in a small to medium sized room. You may have to speak up a little louder in larger rooms with a fair amount of ambient noise. As Google Home assistant adds more skills, you will not be disappointed... and at the holiday price oount of $29, why not buy one for every room in the house?",Great Add-on to Google Home
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,DarkoA,Having a smart home device is great. Having multiple is even better. These mini's allow me to have one in every room basically. They capture sound commands well and playback sound at a decent decibel for being so compact. My one complaint would be the touch controls. They aren't as fluent as in the larger Google products. Voice works fantastic and controls many devices with ease.,Great for a simple smart home device
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,PeachBlender,"The Google Home mini does more and better than I expected. But there are still things you'd expect it to understand that it doesn't. Google is saying that it will get smarter and more features over time.
Sound is good for its size and price, but its small and cheap. It worked well setup near the couch with a Chromecast Audio across the room connected to a standard television soundbar.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,PBXMAN,"Love this thing!

I bought it while it was on sale for $35 which is a pretty good price, normally $55.

Comes with one GE light bulb which is already paired in the Home Google app.  Nothing additional to download to make it work.  Other brand name bulbs you'll have to download apps to make them work.

The setup process was very easy. Install the smart bulb and plug in the Google Home Mini in the same room. Since the bulb is Bluetooth-based, it will only work a short distance from the Google Home Mini. 1. Download the Google Home app to your iPhone, iPad  or Android device. Upon opening the app, I saw a banner asking me to ""Setup 1 Device"". 2. The app walked me through setting up the Google Home Mini first. 3. The app then automatically asked me if I wanted to setup the bulb.  It quickly found the bulb and added it to my Google Home profile.

Because I liked this so much I bought 3 more combo units (Home Mini & GE Bulb) and have them all over.

One of my favorite things is when I go to bed I tell the Home Google Mini ""good night"" and I have it set to tell me my reminders and weather for the next day.  Then it asks what time I would like the alarm set for.  I haven't been over sleeping since I put one of these in my bedroom.

Recommend to everyone.",Black Google Home Mini

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Scarymungus,"I bought a Google Home Mini and was excited to compare it to the Echo Dot. Google Home outperformed the Echo in a couple ways.
1. The sound quality was significantly better.
2. Google Assistant is simply smarter, and produces better information.

BUT, the Google Home Mini cannot currently connect to external speakers via bluetooth. This was a deal breaker for me, and it broke my heart to have to return it. Why does this matter? Well, the Google Home is stationary as it plugs into the wall. So, I had it plugged into my bedroom. I frequently connect my Echo to an external speaker and take the speaker into the bathroom as I shower or get ready for the day. It works wonderfully. But Google doesn't let you do this. It was annoying enough for me that I couldn't justify keeping it, as I use it in that scenario so often. 

So for now I'm back to my Echo Dot - which does connect to my bluetooth speaker.",Great...with one exception

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,TheMaxxx,"I had the echo dot for over a year before I bought the google home mini. I bought it because sometimes I'll ask Alexa questions that I'll have to google because it doesn't know the answer. But as time went on Alexa has been improved and can answer a whole lot more than when I originally bought it. I ask both of them the same questions and they pretty much give me the same answers. Maybe google will give a little more details but so far there has only been a couple of questions that google knew over Alexa. But if you have prime Alexa is the choice hands down. They have tons of free music and if you have a fire stick or tv tons of free movies as well. So if you don't have prime, google is the way to go. It can connect to bluetooth devices, control smart devices, deliver custom news feeds, set up calendars, make lists, tell jokes, sing songs and play games just the same as the echo dot. I like the Alexa app and the google home app is pretty good also. The big difference is amazon prime. I don't subscribe to any google services other than gmail and youtube but it seems like you can utilize the google drive to upload music and play it through the google mini. I have done this with Alexa. I have bought albums on Amazon and some have digital mp3's of the album that you can stream at anytime off of the dot. You can favorite playlists on Amazon and both can play from pandora and spotify just the same. So there you go if you have prime the Amazon devices are for you if not google will allow you to do all the same things as the Alexa devices.",google home mini vs alexa echo dot

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,CarlosL,"I never thought this could be that useful especially having an iPhone with Siri that I thought would do the same thing. Well, I was so wrong! Granted, Siri can do similar things. But it's a game changer when you can give instructions from anywhere across the room and Google Mini would listen. Simple things like ""What's the temperature"", ""What time is it"", ""Give me the news"", ""Play Music""... ah Play Music... the volume and sound quality is GREAT for such a tiny device! 
I decided to add a 2nd one in my bedroom and, since I have Nest thermostats, at night I can simply say ""Hey Google, turn the temperature down"" (or up). Amazing!
I then added some smart lights and it's awesome to just say ""Turn the lights on"" (or off). Or ""Set the brightness to 30%"". Or ""Set the Kitchen lights to red"".
My toddler LOVES THAT! And he's now so used to it that when we are in a restaurant or somewhere else, he starts saying ""OK Google, turn the lights off"" thinking that's how all lights everywhere work (he's 2 years old)! So cute!
Highly recommended!",Highly recommended!

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Gzsquad,"Google's Home Mini was a no brainer for me. I like Google's products and ecosystem. Their voice recognition is the best out. Siri is horrible and Alexa is good, but not like Google. I will list the things I use the most and will demonstrate how Google's products and ecosystem tie in together.

Turn on TV --> Google Chrome Cast Dongle
Turn on lights --> Random outlet smart switch or smart light
Turn on AC/Heater --> Google Nest Thermostat
Play Song/Playlist from Spotify, Youtube, Youtube Music
Play ""name of Netflix show"" on TV (name of Google Chromecast)
Add reminder or calendar event --> Google Calendar
Ask a question --> Google Search

These are just a few examples of commands and how they connect with other hardware and programs. Chromecast and Google smart speakers are amazing as they allow you to control your tv. Asking Google to play my ""Vibe Time"" playlist on Spotify during a gathering is sweet. Since this is a piece of technology, it will sometimes lag, be unresponsive, or lose internet connection. Unplugging and plugging back in is a simple resolution.",My Quick and Accurate Thoughts

Owning a Chromecast is definitely something worth purchasing by the way. Not only does it enable the Home Mini to turn your tv on and off for you (cheesy, I know; mind you, I do not own a smart tv!), it can cast anything from Netflix and Youtube by the usage of your voice.

If you're feeling like you're not gaining enough control of the devices, everything you ever need to know is IN YOUR GOOGE HOME settings (both on iOS and Google Play stores). 

Setup is incredibly easy, and the device itself is lightweight, portable, and affordable. Teaching adults how to use this device is also very simple (trust me, I would know). Lastly, the volume, is quite incredible and very powerful. adjustments to the volume are easy to control as well. 

The ONE thing I would want the Google Home Mini to accomplish is to play the volume from Chromecast when it's enabled on to my television. Even with it's bluetooth capability, it doesn't, but it does with my AppleTV 4th Gen. So please do keep that in mind.


Otherwise, I see a lot of improvements with Google Home Mini in the near future and it's a stellar investment.",If you love all things Google...

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Courage808,"For anyone looking to get a smart home speaker, I would highly recommend the Google Home mini to start. Normally retailing for $49.99, it's usually on sale or part of some promotion going on, so the buy in is very affordable. The real fun comes in when you have multiple Google Homr devices (Google Home Mini, Google Home, Google Home Max, etc.) and multiple Google Home compatible devices to use them with (Phillips Hue lights, Google Chromecast, etc.). You can play the same music in sync around the entire house, relay messages from one Google Home to another, set alarms, control your lights, and much more and you don't have to buy a smart speaker more expensive than the Google Home Mini. It's very user friendly so even if you aren't tech savvy setup is quick and easy. Even if you're only getting one of these and have no other Google Home compatible devices this is great for music, although the sound quality on the mini isn't the best. Anyway, I highly recommend that if you don't already own a smart speaker in your home and if you're curious about getting one, start with this.

But if you can be patient, don't buy it at $49.99. Wait for a promotion or sale if you can because there's usually one on Best Buy.",Always on Sale
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,traveler02760,"Bought 2 during the special, which came with 2 sets of c by GE bulbs, all for $60! Could not miss this as I like the idea of using bulbs that work with Google assistant and do not require a separate hub. Personally I think the idea of having a separate hub is ridiculous, but due to the lack of standardization in the industry. It lacks the innovation that led to Harmony remote replacing sex other remotes in my home! And contrary to what the BB tech told me when he said Philips Hue is better (most likely true) and unlike Philips hue which all communicate with the Philips Hub whereas c by GE bulbs all communicate over wifi and drain your bandwidth...this is not true. They use Bluetooth and if they are within 30 ft of each other, they form a comms mesh and relay between each other - genius! Now, the google mini is not much of a speaker, but then I don't need them as speakers - I need them to get me information, carry out my instructions and play night sounds or babbling brook sounds when I go to bed, and wake me up with a gentle alarm - perfect!

For being as small as it is the speaker is pretty good. I have the Google Home as well and the thing the mini is lacking when playing music is bass. If you are looking for this to be your main music speaker in the room you are putting it in I would definitely consider getting the Google Home instead. However if you already have one of those this is a great extension to expand in to other rooms of your house at a reasonable cost.

Also if you have multiple you can use them to broadcast messages throughout your home similar to a intercom. For example you can say ""Hey Google, broadcast It is time for dinner"" It will then play that message on all your Google Home / mini devices.

To note the functionality of the Google mini is identical to the Google Home. They both use the same app on your phone and both can process all of the same commands. The major difference is the speaker.",Great addition to the Google Home line

I honestly feel like the mini is the best step forward to see where this device fits in your life. And I can say its the best useful device to be added to my lifestyle.

How so? 
Examples:
1) was hungry and it was late, wanted to know what was currently open and it not only told me the top places, it also included if they were almost closing and how much time left. That little extra info of knowing it was going to close in 15 mins helps a lot whether to rush, or not be tricked to go there thinking it was still open. 

2) was busy with my hands, phone away from me, asked my gf what time it was but she was looking for her phone, and I forgot I had google home, and it quickly responded with the time even when Im across the room.

2.5) I can be listening to loud music from it too, and it can still pick up on my voice no matter where I am in the room.

3) I can set actual multiple alarms just by feeding it more specific times I want to wake up since Im a heavy sleeper.

4) asking it funny, weird, and curious questions as I always do on google, and it pretty much always responds with a good answer. 

5) asking it the traffic to school and it lets me know if its usual or if there is another route I should take and it goes ahead and explains it.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Zack50,"We already own an Amazon Echo & Dot, so I wanted a Google Home Mini on another floor to control Hue lights, and to compare with the Echo. They are basically the same and all work well. The speaker on the Mini is better than the speaker on the Dot, and the microphone on the Mini seems to be better at picking up voice in a noisy room. 

Where the Home Mini excels is with questions you would ask Google search engine, including questions about traffic and distance, and general trivia, etc. It often takes Echo several tries, asking in different ways until a question is clear enough for the machine to understand. But the Home Mini usually gets it right away, and responds quicker (probably due to Google's experience with search engine and voice recognition technology.) For stuff like this, the Google product is great.

Initial integration with my Philips Hue lights and my Logitech Harmony was easier on the Amazon devices, and as I recall, Amazon didn't ask for as much personal info as the Google Home setup requires. I eventually figured out how to integrate Hue & Harmony with my Home Mini, but it wasn't nearly as intuitive as integration with the Amazon devices was. The Home Mini does seem quicker to change my lights (on/off, colors, dimming), than the Echo or Dot, though.

Having devices like this makes normal everyday mundane (and yes, easy) tasks like turning lights and TV on/off, changing TV channels and light colors, and setting timers/alarms even EASIER.",Life is getting better with assistants

I don't have much trouble finding music I like and I can cast anything. I love the black color, it blends into the background on my backer's rack, you don't even know it's there.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,ravenmad1,"I was skeptical about bringing in a smart assistant into the house, but when a set of Phillips Hue lights came bundled with a free Google Home Mini, I was compelled to give it a try. The charcoal Home Mini represents my second one. I enjoyed the first one so much, I needed to expand the range into the bedroom so I could yell out ""Ok Google, turn off all the lights"" from the comfort of my bed. I find myself asking Google to do all sorts of things, from setting alarms and timers, telling me how long it will take to drive somewhere, or telling me how long to cook a baked potato in an Instant Pot. I've even directed her to play music, but this isn't the best sounding speaker out there (it's good for prioritizing laziness over sonic quality). If you're steeped in the Google ecosystem, she can even make calls and send messages on your behalf (I'm in the Apple world so I haven't tried this). Overall, this little gadget balances convenience and price and becomes so addictive, you'll want to sprinkle multiple Mini's all over your house.",The friend I never knew I wanted
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,TonyMSP,"I started with the regular Google Home and I absolutely feel in love on how it works. The google home sounded great and was very responsive to my voice commands. This mini just came out and I thought it would be neat to have this smaller version in my bedroom as the regular google home sat in my living room. While its nice that its small, it's not where near the sound quality of the regular sized google home. It does sound good for a small speaker but don't expect to replace the higher priced google home. 

The mini is a good way to add more speakers and stay connected in each room as its small enough to sit on my night stand without taking up too much real estate. A recent update allows for ""google broadcast"". This is a neat feature where you are able to use your google speakers as a PA system. I can now ""broadcast"" that dinner is ready to all the rooms with the speaker. 

A bonus feature that I recently discovered is the ability to play music throughout the house. Very cool if your hosting a party!

I recommend this mini as an addition to your system but not be the primary google home speaker. The regular google home speaker isn't that much larger and sounds 10x better.",Great addition to the google ecosystem
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,DilipB,"We really enjoy our Google Home Max set up, and the Minis are also great. A lot of sound from a tiny device. They work with Google Assistant to activate timers, answer questions, play music and connect to Bluetooth devices. I love being able to say, ""OK, Google, play 'This Song' by that artist"". They also can act as an intercom system. Someday I will also have smart appliances to use with them also.

The only downside is that they needs\ a WiFi signal and electric cord to operate, so no remote camping trips with these. We have used them in multiple places indoors and outdoors at our home.","Very Happy... Good sound, portability"
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JacobA,"Just like the Echo Dot, the Google Home Mini is an excellent home assistant. It can do everything the Alexa line can do- such as weather and news reports, reminders and timers, control smart home accessories, answer questions, play music, and more.

Like the Echo Dot, the sound quality won’t be amazing, but you shouldn’t expect it to be. It’ll get the job done in smaller rooms though.

One thing I enjoy over the Echo line is that Google Mini is much better at answering random questions. And it should be, as it’s powered by... well, Google.

Another benefit is that I’ve found Google Home Mini to control the Chromecast quite well. Alexa can control a Fire TV, but the implementation there feels a bit shoehorned and doesn’t always work the way i want. Google’s is more streamlined and can increase the volume or turn off the TV altogether with ease.

If you’re a Prime member, go with the Alexa. If you have a Chromecast or will get more use out of question-asking, go with the Google Home Mini.",Great home assistant for the price
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Milind,"I had purchased Google Home last year when it came out. I simply couldn't figure out why I needed it since I had my Pixel phone with me all the time anyway. So I returned it.

A year later, it's a different story. Google has made some compelling changes. The most important is that GH now recognizes the voices of different family members and provides personal help and music. The second big change is much better support for Home Automation. I have just got into it this month. It's great to be able to turn on lights, control temperature, arm alarm systems using ""Hey Google"". I went for a vacation and was able to control my lights and temperature giving an impression that someone was home.

Now all of that can be individually controlled by various apps. But it's just more convenient to do it through GH. I have one main GH and a bunch of minis scattered around the house. Over Black Friday, they were going for $20 a pop.

For the size, they have pretty good volume and they work really well. I have only 2 complaints about them. There is no wired aux port. So I had to buy a Google Chromecast Audio. I shouldn't have had to do that. Secondly, there is no way to connect a better quality BT speaker so music can be played on them instead but controlled via the Mini. The latter I hope is something Google can fix via a software update.

At $50, I may have bought one mini. At its current price of $30, I'd say, it's a pretty good price especially if you don't have a Google Home.",Excellent bang for the buck

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,SamG,"I've had the original Google Home since it came out and have loved it since we got it. As we've gotten more smart devices in our home I've had more and more reasons to use it, so I was excited to get the Google Home Mini. At the normal $50 price this is a good deal, but at the $30 it's being offered at for the holidays it's a steal. You get every feature of the original Google Home in a smaller size and the speaker sounds really good for it's size. It doesn't beat the original in terms of sound quality, but music is still decent on it and the Google Home voice sounds just as good as it does on the full size speaker.

I do have two issues with the Mini. The first is it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack to connect to an external speaker - in order to do that you need to connect it to a Chromecast Audio. This isn't a deal breaker for me since I use it mainly for the assistant functions in a small room, but it's still disappointing. The second issue I have is I find the touch controls on the top of the speaker a lot more difficult to use than those on the Google Home; you have to tap the sides to adjust volume and that tends to move the speaker around.

I don't think you can go wrong with this if you're trying to get started on a voice assistant or already have a Google Home and want to add one to another room. There are the minor issues I mentioned above, but it's just too good of a deal for what you get.",Half the Price and Almost as Good as Google Home

It's amazing how fast she is to respond to our questions (even from a long way across the room Mini can catch our voice). My youngest has a speech impairment yet Mini can make out generally everything he is asking. It makes us have a good sense of humor to his impairment sometimes when Mini gets his question a bit misunderstood, innocent little giggles from time to time. On the other hand it helps him to stop then use his speech therapy skills to enunciate better. I think some days that is why he is using it... so he can keep improving. There's very few questions that are unanswerable that we've asked so far. Pretty easy and straightforward to set up. I definitely recommend getting the product. We lucked out and bought it on Black Friday for a great price. Also bought several more for my siblings. I can't wait to find out how their families are enjoying them.

It does pretty much what you'd expect- talk to you, answer your questions, control your devices. Sound quality is also good enough for easy listening purposes.

There are two main things that bug me about the speaker. One is the fact that you can only say ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google."" Google's not an easy word to say. Try saying it 3 times fast (clearly enough for the speaker to understand you, of course). I think that you should have another option or two. In contrast, ""Alexa"" is much easier for me to say. The second thing that bugs me is the Google Home app. That thing is a disaster. Options, settings, and features are buried under non-intuitive menus. I hate navigating it because it takes me way too long to find the way to manipulate certain settings.

There are also issues with syncing the speaker to my Google calendar and personalized settings that I don't really use anyway, but could be a problem if that's what you want it to do.

Currently, I mainly use it to play background music during dinner or podcasts while lounging around. Device is very responsive to voice commands, can be set up for multiple users, and works especially well if you have an account with a music service like Spotify.

There are countless write-ups on the various cool things that the Google Home can do, although realistically, I'm doubtful of the practical, everyday uses for most of these functions. 

Nevertheless, even if you are just going to use this most basic of features (i.e. as a voice-controlled speaker that can play content on-demand), I think that this device would be a good buy.",Worth it even as just a simple smart speaker

I've set it up with my Google Home App and its connected to some other ""smart"" things in my home.  Its nice to be able to turn the lights out by calling out to Google or play a video on my chromecast/tv by asking it to play Netflix.

The sounds when I have it play music is just fine and the volume is more than enough.  I like that it has a USB-C(?) connector rather than its own propietary power cord that they have on the Gen2 so I can connect my own longer 10ft USB power cord to it in my kitchen.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,CoKroSays,"I bought 3 Google Mini's, one for each floor, to voice control our lights, thermostat and entertainment. It leaves a lot to be desired on those fronts, being limited which partner companies it will work with. There are also some undocumented ""limitations"" to how it works with those systems. 

For example, if you have two groups of lights designated on a floor, the Mini (and Google) will not recognize them separately. Similarly with Harmony Remotes. If you have a ""livingroom"" hub and a ""basement"" hub, you can only control one of them with your voice. Seems ridiculous that you can't say ""turn on the livingroom TV"" without sacrificing any control over the basement TV. 

As far as working with the standard services, it is very responsive and fun for listening to music with the family, or getting a news update, or asking for a joke or to sing happy birthday. 

For the price, its pretty good. But there's a lot of work to be done before it can do all of the things they claim it will do smoothly.",Fun device thats not quite prime time

I have found it to be more useful than the Echo products. I already subscribe to Google Play Music, so this makes it super easy to listen to my playlists (or anything, really). 

The answers to general questions have been more reliable (I.e., it didn't add diapers to my shopping cart when I asked who the 14th President was like my Echo did). And it seems to understand a lot more ""human speak"" like ""Play Metallica in the Living Room for 20 minutes"".

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Apr 2020,TruerReviewer,"The two most popular options for home control are generally Google and Amazon. I recommend the Google home platform versus the Amazon devices, as Google seems to have much better/variety of product integrations with non-Google products. I've used both, but now use Google home exclusively for devices.  I do use Amazon's streaming and free shipping services though (Amazon Prime subscription, etc.) It sometimes takes a little work to set the devices up through Google home, though. I've found the Google speaker quality on these to be okay, but what do you expect from a little disk? You'd want to step up to the more expensive, larger Google speaker for better sound. I typically listen to my music through a hi-fidelity sound system and speakers, so while not my go to for music, I find these are practical to have around the house to say ""Hey Google, turn on/off"" and... whatever; turn things off and on, like my lights, TV, Stereo, answer random questions and provide alarms or reminders.

I put this on my nightstand so I can ask it what the weather is like and whats on my calendar for the day. It does a ton of stuff and I'm still learning. But so far I'm pretty impressed by it.
The bigger version is probably the one you want if you want to listen to music. The mini sounds ok for what I want it for. 
If they're still on sale I'm going to pick up a few more.","Nice,compact info center"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,SRJa,"Set-up was as easy as my Full size Google Homes. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality once I tweaked the bass and treble controls. We are using the mini in our kitchen and it has had no problem hearing us. The only thing that I find awkward is having to touch the sides of the mini to adjust the volume unless you use voice control to do it. The mini has plenty of weight and a nice rubber bottom so it stays put. If your tied into the Google ecosystem, I would not hesitate to purchase the mini.","Easy Set-up, Surprising sound"
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Jan 2020,JimBob,You can't beat this for the price.  I've used the larger models and they do sound louder but in my opinion not worth the extra dough.  I got mine for $20.,Very easy to set up and use

I've had zero problems either in setup or operation; have never had to force a reboot by power cycling (though a few storm power losses have). The sound quality for voice (its primary use) is more than adequate. The music sound quality is good - not great - but I'd never expect great sound from such a tiny speaker.

What I was surprised about was that the speaker is very good quality and music sounds fantastic.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Apr 2020,katH,"I chose the mini because my husband has an Alexa clock on his side of the bed. I didn't want another clock on my side. I wanted a sleek, non-intrusive device where I could set my wake up time, listen to nature sounds, music or white noise falling asleep and be able to control my smart Hue lights. It can even tell bedtime stories and I can get my morning news update, time and weather from my Google mini. I find that changing the volume is easier by voice than using it's touch control.  But, that's a minor issue. All in all, I would highly recommend this product. Another reason I chose the mini over a clock is that I have heard stories about people hacking into the camera and invading your privacy.

Google Home recognizes my voice really well but there are some limitations to what it can do. I'm not able to customize what I call the device so I'm stuck saying Hey Google.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,akaTwoSheds,"Take this with a grain of salt because I'm pretty heavily invested in the Amazon Alexa system. 

I picked the Home Mini up when it was on sale over the Thanksgiving weekend so it was $30 and Best Buy tossed in a $10 gift card. Call it an extremely nerdy impulse buy :)

The setup was easy as could be and as compared to when I set up my Alexas, the Home is much easier. It only took a minute or so and I didn't have to change the WiFi on my phone which is always nice.

My first complaint is ""Ok Google"". Say it out loud. My tongue fumbles over it every time. I don't use it on my Samsung phone for that very reason. The Alexa has a few alert word options - Alexa, Echo, and Computer, all of which are much easier to say.

My house is also overflowing with Philips Hue lights, all of which I can control through the various Alexas I've got. I tried setting up home automation with the Home and things sort of ground to a halt. To date I haven't had any luck with it but to be fair it's the pre-holidays so things have been hectic and I haven't really given it any additional time.

I'd say that if you're already an Alexa user that the Home may be too late for you. If you're dipping your toes into smart speakers and home automation it's worth a look.

Especially if they let you change it from ""Ok Google"" :)",So this is probably me...

These guys are amazing, especially once you get the wall mounts! They go anywhere, have amazing voice recognition, super easy to use as whole home speaker system (even with as many zones as you want), low price point, and work with almost everything these days. Overall, the whole family is happy with them, and prefer the VA to Alexia which we were using for about a year. The family had very limited adoption of Alexia due to the voice recognition, it was good but just not good enough to make it quick and easy to use. 

However, now with Google Home the whole family is using them for everything from Turing lights on and off, to music & speakers, to playing games. It's been a great change and great utility for our a home.",Standardized on Google Home

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,CTReader,"This mini was purchased for my 86 year old mother who lives in a retirement community.  Her neighbor fell in the tub and could not reach the emergency pull cord.  She lay there for hours before being found and rescued.  After her experience she and my mother both got dedicated minis for their bathrooms.  Now, if my mother had a fall in the bath (statistically the most dangerous place in your home) as long as she could use her voice she could use her mini to make a phone call and get help.  Got a wall mount to keep it tidy, off the counter and away from water.  Of course it does all those fun things she enjoys (she has a full-size Home in her bedroom) but knowing she can get help in an emergency, especially in the bath, is very meaningful to her.  So, along with everything else that makes the mini worth the price, add ""great investment in personal safety"".",Mini for fun and SAFETY

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Fobbie16,"We have had this google mini installed in our kitchen. Firstly to set the google mini you need to download the google home app and follow the setup instructions, this is common of many electrical products. The set up did seem to take a long time but this could of been down to my internet connectivity rather than the app itself. The google mini needs to be plugged in at all times, It would of been nice if the cable colour matched the device to blend it in more as the white cable stands out on our black worktops and the actual plug is bulky but this is personal preference and doesn't affect the product. We have been very impressed with the google minis 'understanding' it never fails to answer or perform the task requested regardless of who has asked it, woman, man, or child. As a speaker I don't think the sound quality is as good as other speakers on the market but that said other speakers don't remind you to make a packed lunch or tell you how long to cook roast parsnips for. We haven't got Spotify or googleplay which are the main music platforms supported by the voice activation but it is simple to pair your phone or table via Bluetooth to play music. You can request it plays radio stations for you without the need for a secondary device nearby if you don't use the above mentioned platforms. There is so much this device can do and we haven't even begun to fully utilise it yet, what we have done is; -Stored shopping lists on it so when you've got dirty hands cooking and use the last of something you can add it to the shopping list straight away without forgetting - Kitchen timer, you can ask it how long is left on the timer too - New and weather updates specific to you're local area or wherever else you request - Recipes - Radio - TImer My 9 year old has particularly enjoyed some of the fun features like beat boxing, trivia games and getting the answer to his maths homework.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,nopking,"I'm pretty invested in the Google Home/Assistant ecosystem - I've already got a couple of Minis and a couple of Homes and a Lenovo Smart Display and a Home Hub and also an Insignia. Throw in a couple of headsets that include assistant and I've got Google everywhere.

No, there's a reason, I'm not just Google crazy, I write about these in my spare time.

I didn't know when I ordered the my Nest doorbell a Mini was getting tacked on. I'd have preferred literally any other Google Assistant product, but let's address my issues with the Mini.

It's ok. Of the products out there I've tried I can't say much more than it works and works ok. You want to dip your toes in the Assistant pool, you're not going to go wrong.

What I don't like about these is the pickup on all Minis I've ever run into seems to not be as robust as the others. It works, it'll be fine but I'm ""OK Google""ing much more than on other devices.

The next is since these have been relegated to kid's rooms (nighttime music, story norey, couple of kid things) getting the volume adjusted via voice is harder on these than any I've used. The others hear the OK Google when the music is too loud, these I generally have to come and whack and I always manage to turn it up even more.

Good, not the best, but being the lowest price entry models can't complain. I'd rather get the Insignia on sale when it's $20 or a Lenovo when it's 90 or so. But then again, they're an entirely different class and different base price model.

So can't complain excessively about the mini - it works, or works better than anything we could have imagined four years ago, yadda yadda",Of the Google Assistant speakers it's... ok

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Dexture1,"Hey Google?  Alexa?  Truthfully they both work great.  What stands out is that I am a Google lover.  I have Youtube Red and Google Music and I have to say this is the reason why I prefer Google over Alexa.  Sound quality is much better on the Google Home Mini vs the Alexa Dot 1st gen.   The voice of the AI is less robotic and you get the option of changing to different voice types.  Home automation works as expected.  The one thing I wish you could change on the Google Home Mini is that when you have it shut off your lights it doesn't announce that 2 lights were turned off.  Alexa will just ding which I prefer.  Also I wish you could control the volume level of the AI voice so that when you have the volume set for music it didn't inherit the same level.  Want to scare your partner, tell Google to shut off the lights and have it announce at level 7 the light is now off.
In summary, AI is here to stay.  Is it the best?  Probably not.  Is it good for what we need?  Yes.  Especially if you subscribe to the Google Universe and get Google Music and Youtube.",Hey Google...not bad.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,ecscatalyst,"I bought this item to experience Google Assistant as a dedicated device for my home. Sound quality is substantial and Google's responses are fairly adequate. It controls my lights and chromecast connected to my TV. Anytime I want to watch something on Netflix, Youtube or Youtube TV, I'll tell Google to set it up for me. I even set up timers for cooking, which has been surprisingly helpful. I even inform Google Home Mini to wake me up for naps in which it has been handy as well. The only thing that irks me is the learning curve of what other things that I can tell Google Assistant to do. If I try something new to say, I usually get ""I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that yet."" I had to go online to find what other commands or feedback Google Assistant can respond to. By the way, if the sound volume is way too high and it's playing music, you would need talk louder or probably scream at Google to hear you for the next request / command. Other than that, it works fairly well.",Please Understand What I'm Saying!

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2019,GadgetGirl,"Let me start by saying that I have a number of Alexa devices, including 3 of the 1st gen Echo, and couple of 1st gen of the Dot, a couple of 2d gen Dot, and a Spot. I’ve been pretty happy with them as we’ve built our Smart Home capabilities, but was interested in trying out the Google Home Mini after getting a recommendation from someone in the family. When the right sale price came along, we took the opportunity to pick one up at Best Buy. 

The Google Home Mini is an attractive, small smart speaker; it is really much nicer looking than both the 1st and 2d gen Echo Dot (I don’t have a 3d gen, so can’t do a side-by-side). It is very responsive; in fact, I’d say it is slightly more responsive than any of the Echo products. It “speaks” clearly, but I think the voice sounds a little more artificial than that of the Echo. In the “smarts” department, I haven’t asked it anything it stumbled over yet. I wouldn’t recommend it as a primary means to listen to music, but then I don’t find playing music on the Echo devices to be very appealing, either. They’re both fine for short periods of listening.

Overall, I’m glad to have had the opportunity to try the Google Home Mini, but I don’t find enough value added to want to abandon our Echo devices. Honestly, if Google had been first out of the gate with a smart speaker, I would probably feel the same way about abandoning their products. It’s good to have choices, and I think you just have to decide which “universe” you’re most comfortable in - Google’s or Amazon’s. I don’t think you can go wrong with either at this point.","Good product, but it won’t make me leave the Echo"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,BMI4,"I have been looking at this mini smart speaker for quite a long time for use in my bedroom. The weekend of Father's day I bought it and tried it out and really liked it, playing music it sounded very nice at half volume and late at night using very low volume it sounded very thin like an AM radio on a station that is just on the edge of being received, kind of squeaky and irritating. But while I had been looking up the Google speakers here on Best Buy I saw their bundling offers so the next day I went back to the store and tried out some of the competitors that still used Google Assistant that were in stock on display and ended up buying the Google Home and this Google Mini. It has worked very nicely, I use the mini in my home gym where I can use it at half volume and the Google Home sounds great at any volume for placement wherever you'd like as long as the room isn't too large and you can connect them together to use somewhat like an intercom and a lot of other useful things, a seemingly endless list and often growing list. It listens very well, I haven't had to repeat myself or had a request misunderstood yet. I'm glad I finally bought these. I previously used Window's smart system and either I wasn't smart enough or it didn't do what I needed it to do.",Great even as a mini.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,AZITGuy,"So much you can do with the Google Home Minis.  I currently have 12 installed, with plans to add at least 2 more.  I have multiple routines setup to control Philips Hue LED lights.  Three speaker groups: one upstairs, one downstairs, and one for the entire house.  I stream Pandora to as many as all 12 minis at the same time and have not noticed any sync issues, although on occasion there may be a few seconds where one will play gibberish, but returns to normal by itself in a few seconds.  I also have one connected to a mobile battery pack so I can use it where it is not practical to run a power cord and it's mobile anywhere in the house.  I'm probably going to do that with one or two others where cords can be a problem.  I'll even be adding one in the garage to play music and allow me to broadcast messages to the entire house.",12 and counting...

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,Goodbuy,"Google Home Mini is so easy to use. It really does make life easier and we don’t even use all the potential functions it has. We only have one lamp in the bedroom so once I’m comfy I can tell it to turn off the light. I didn’t even have to set it up to my phone or download the app for it to connect seemlessly to my iPhone Spotify, and even continues playing if I accidentally let my phone dies. I can even ask it to play a certain genre without selecting it on my phone and it does it. It tells me my local weather when I’m deciding what to wear in the morning and answers a lot of questions much better than Siri does. Never had an issue and we also use it with our Nest Thermostat. This is our second one, we originally just had one in the kitchen and could still give it commands all the way from the bedroom. You can adjust the volume as well so it’s not too loud in the bedroom, but can get it loud enough to jam out while doing chores. :)",Extremely convenient

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Nighteditor,"It’s the latest thing - speaking to artificial intelligence to seek a response. Some would say we’ve been doing it for years with friends and family, but electronically, Google, Amazon and shortly, Apple, are bringing the world’s knowledge to your home with a simple command. 
Google Home is great for those all-important questions like “what time is it in Tokyo?” or “how do I boil an egg”. Speak nicely to him or her (you choose) and they may just respond with a friendly comment to make your day. The mini version is just as good and doesn’t take up as much space as its big brother/sister. 
Google Home mini can be linked to other Wi-fi gadgets in your home - we control our Wemo switches and Honeywell thermostat with ours - and you can even ask it to play Netflix on your TV via chromecast should you so desire. 
There is much much more to it, but the lack of a manual means you’re in the dark as to how much it can - and often can’t - do. Like all technology, however, it will improve with age. In the meantime, just sit back and enjoy what Google Home mini can do.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,bhl1966,"I started out looking for an inexpensive way to add auto-on/auto-sleep Chromecast Audio speakers around the house so I wouldn't have listening gaps when I moved away from my usual listening location. Sound quality didn't need to be super good, just ""good enough"" - I wanted continuity without pain, not enhanced pleasure. Voice input started out as a disqualifier in my searching; I have Android Auto in my car, and found voice input there to be mostly pain and little gain. But in the twists and turns of my researches, I found that I wasn't going to be paying extra for it, and decided to give it a try. To my immediate and ever growing delight. The sound quality is better than I had hoped for. Google Assistant is much better than what I had in the car (full Google Assistant just came with a recent upgrade, and in-home is a better environment for exploring intelligent assistants). So much so that I now have an Echo Dot as well. The Mini is a much better device than the Dot. In function, there is a lot of overlap, but also some useful differences. I wouldn't want Alexa instead of Google Assistant, but Echo complements Google Home nicely. In the long run, I expect that Google Home Minis will spread themselves throughout the house, accompanied by one, or maybe two, Echo Dots.",Very good - better than Echo Dot for me.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,edunham,"These are really great for the price. They get reasonably loud, don't sound terrible (they won't please any audiophiles, but they also don't cost like audiophile products do), and are snappy and responsive. The mic is really impressive, able to distinguish your voice in crazy bad conditions (like when I'm across the room, shouting over the soundbar sitting right next to it).

If you are an Android / Windows OS user, this smart speaker is made for you. It works very similar to the Amazon Echo (Alexa) devices but I think it is even better especially if one is an Android / Windows OS / Google fan. There is a free smart phone app that may be downloaded which enables users of this device to customize it to one's environment. It also have some funny responses to certain commands and inquiries. The only drawback, of course, is that it has an open mic (which may be manually shut off easily) that MAY enable a hacker to listen to conversations / activities that take place near this device.

Anyway, it has actually great sound. It's a tiny speaker, and it plays well. You can listen to music from it easily, set timers, and it links to other smart stuff, which I don't have.

I like to use it for timers in the kitchen so I don't have to touch stuff with my gross meaty hands. You understand that, right?

I also jimmy rigged it up to play my audible books through it. It's not convenient, but it works, and is a nice way to project stuff from my phone for a *slightly* better speaker.

But I'm still paranoid that it listens to everything I say. So...yeah.","Pretty good, but creepy!"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Kangaroo77,"I'm a big-time fan of internet radio - and I've got a few Squeezebox Radios in my collection - but as of late, IHeart Radio stations have blocked their streams via Squeezebox - and IHeart streams a substantial number of stations I listen to. 

I searched for alternatives to the Squeezebox so I could listen to as much as possible that's being streamed out there - they're becoming more difficult to find - and in my search I came across the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini. They both allowed access to services such as IHeart - TuneIn - Pandora - and more. And at a much more affordable price than any of the alternate internet radios on the market. 

My Squeezebox has a 6-station memory - while the Home Mini allows pretty much a limitless memory - based on how much my own memory can recall when asking it to 'Hey, Google, play ..... ' 

Beyond the radio capabilities, the other features it offers to answer questions and all the rest - it's a pretty amazing little item. 

Sounds quite nice - offers plenty of features - and tunes in a ton of stations - if you want an internet radio that keeps up with the advance of where radio conglomerates are to be found, this is a very sound choice.",Radio fans should love this!

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,verawr,"We were both surprised by how well this Google Home Mini works. Granted, we haven't used it much, yet, but so far we are very impressed. If you use Android phones that have Google Assistant on them, both devices may respond, which is both amusing and mildly annoying. Perhaps it's possible to tell the Mini to take precedence over your phone, but if it is I haven't figured it out yet.
My husband set it up, so I can't say how difficult it was, but it didn't seem to take very long. You have to teach it your voice at first, which he did, but I was surprised when it listened to me, too. 
(I love how it responds to unexpected commands, such as, ""Hey Google, thank you"". [I always feel like 'she' deserves thanks!])
Things, like setting a timer and changing the thermostat (with Nest), are extremely helpful. Granted, our phones can do this, too, but it's a lot easier to just tell Assistant to take care of it, especially while cooking. 
We bought two for our home and one as a gift. We hope the recipient will be impressed by it, as well.
Also, in our opinion, ""Hey Google"" rolls off the tongue better than ""OK Google"", so it's great that they implemented that.","So Far, Amazing!"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,politidroid,"I have a few of these around the house and I love them! They can hear your voice quite easily (even better than the bigger Google Home that comes at more than twice the cost of this one) and there are new features every couple of weeks to play with. The speaker does get extremely loud however, what it lacks is any substantial bass, especially when listening to music. This is not a deal breaker by any means. It still outperforms speakers I have used in this price range and I find my self using it more than anything to listen to music. The great part is, if you have more than one, you can set up a home group and have music playing throughout your home. I've also invested in making my apartment smart home friendly and it's been fantastic.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,OldSkool7Four,"I purchased a few of the Google Home Minis as Christmas gifts but was a bit skeptical due to the ridiculously low price. We already have a full-size Google Home unit and absolutely love it, but didn't think it was possible to pack all of the features into such a small package and for only $29. I was wrong. Setup takes a little bit of time and you'll need to download the Google Home app, but it is very simple. The Google Home Mini is very attractive and looks nice sitting on a sofa table. The sound quality isn't nearly as good as the full size Google Home though. The Google Mini has very good ""ears"" and can hear you from very far away, but this can be an issue if you have more than one Google Home in your house. For example, my son set an alarm on the Google Home in his bedroom and the Google Home in our bedroom set an alarm as well. You'll also hear Google Home echoing through the house when you ask it a question and all of the units provide an answer. I'm currently trying to figure out if there's a way for only the closest unit to respond to commands or questions.",Personal assistant for $29

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,GodTM,"I primarily use Siri/Homekit for my home automation needs, but my wife wanted something I could put in the kitchen to easily turn on/off lights with her voice (without resorting to using her phone/watch which she wouldn't have on her at all times). The google home mini is quite versatile and augments my setup nicely.

It connects to most of my home automation devices without interfering with that setup (as all my devices are paired with homekit). This includes Lifx, and iDevices bulbs/switches.

It's also nice I can stream music to this easily, but this device is quite small so the sound quality isn't the greatest for music. They can be paired with Chromecast Audio devices to fix this naturally.

I've been using airport express devices for streaming sound throughout the home, but I might switch to Google Chromecast Audio devices in the future (there are pros and cons to each so I'm not rushing to make that switch).

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,newbies,"THE REASON WHY I SAY 'A LITTLE' IS BCUS GOOGLE HOME MINI SOMETIMES FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO HEAR MY VOICE - I HAVE TO SCREAM OUT LOUD SOMETIMES.
ECHO DOT IS MORE EFFECTIVE WITH VOICES. BUT GOOGLE HOME MINI IS MORE EFFECTIVE ALL ROUND. THAT IS WHY I WOULD KEEP THE DEVICE.
 SOMETIMES I WILL CALL OUT A NUMBER OF TIMES, BUT MINI WOULD NOT ANSWER, THEN AFTER A FEW SECONDS - EVEN WITHOUT ME TALKING, SHE WOULD RESPOND ""HI, HOW CAN I HELP YOU""... GIRL PLEASE!!!
ANYWAY, I AM AN ANDRIOD PHONE USER, I SUPPORT ANDRIOD PRODUCTS AND GOOGLE BASICALLY CONTROLS THE WEB- SO WHY NOT GET A GOOGLE HOME MINI FOR A DECENT PRICE. THERE IS NO EXCUSE.

ALSO, MINI OCCATIONALLY REASONS TO OTHER WORD OR PHRASES OTHER THAN 'OK OR HEY GOOGLE'. WHAATT!!! SHE'S CRAZY LIKE THAT. 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO GET AN ANDRIOD TV TO GET THE FULL USE OF THE GOOGLE HOME MINI - CHROMECAST IS NOT THAT EFFECTIVE UNLESS TO HAVE THE HDMI CHANNEL ON. THAT SUCKS.

Setup is fairly quick and easy with the Mini and it learns your voice pretty quick. As long as you have a good internet connection the Mini will respond to your questions a lot faster than Siri would on Apple devices. You can set alarms, tell it reminders for the day, add stuff to your shopping list, and a bunch more! I had a chromecast already so all I had to do was link my Netflix and Hulu accounts to the Google Home app and now all I have to say is ""Hey Google play "" and it'll start off the show on the last episode you watched. I also bought 3 TP-Link Smart LED light bulbs and they work flawlessly with it. Overall i'm very impressed with the Mini and especially cause I got a deal on it. Somethings aren't possible yet like sending text and a couple of other commands that the mini has trouble processing, but with future updates coming i'm sure it'll only make this device even better.",Quick and Responsive

I can now control lights around the house. I can turn off my tv with a simple voice command. To truly get the most out of the Google home mini you have to download a app called ifft on the Google play store or the Apple store. It lets customize actions for the Google home to recognize. Oh, and the speaker is always getting better, Google is updating the mini all the time. Honestly, I was not sold on the Google home mini at first. But with a little time invested; it is now integrated in my daily life. Once you set everything up with the basics like me, you looking at the possibilities like smart door bells, security cameras, thermostats, and etc.",Wow

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,1,23 Nov 2019,DSmith,"I purchased this item about a month or so ago from Best Buy. Previous this last week, I would give this item 4 stars. It played my owned music on Google Play Music, and would play playlists on YouTube. You couldn't ask for specific songs unless you pay for a YouTube Premium subscription, but you could cast from your YouTube phone app onto the mini. I didn't like that restriction, as the home hub has no restrictions like that, but considering the cost, I understand their marketing choice. They do want people to subscribe on their YouTube premium service after all. I could still cast to the mini in those specific instances where I wanted a specific song playing. The audio was good, with a good balanced sound across the spectrum. Overall, not bad considering the price. 

After the recent update, however, I would rate it 1 star. They added a new restriction through the YouTube and YouTube Music app in relation to this product. You can no longer cast to the mini from your phone or other device unless you subscribe to YouTube premium.  I could live with their previous restrictions on non-subscribers. With their new restriction, however, I find this product worthless. There are times where my son wants a specific song in the bathroom, and I can no longer play him that song thanks to their update. 

I'm not gonna pay 10 bucks a month just for 1 or 2 songs a few times a week. I should still have the option to cast to the device in those sparse instances. If they don't remove the restriction, then I will likely switch to their competitor's products. The latest restriction additions actually drop their products value and usefulness to well below their main competitors. I recommend not buying, go with another product.","Used to be great, not after recent update"

I ended up purchasing these for my wife and I as well as more for our extended family on Black Friday when they were $30 with a $10 gift card. I wish I would have picked up a few more for our house as they have good great sound quality for the size, but do lack any crispness when turned up too loud. Having a few more throughout the house would allow for more speakers to play at once, 
without needing to turn the volume so high. However at regular volume they sound great and the microphone on my end sounds great according to people I speak with using the built-in calling feature, which is awesome!

Just a year later it is completely different. Google Home understands 80% of what we ask and can tell diffferent voices apart. The app also continues to improve and add more features. We decided to add the mini to reach into another room and the mini is just as great. You do have to use your voice to turn off sound on the mini rather than tapping like the Google Home.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Awalker,"When home automation started to get popular I was the first person to say it's a waste of money, why would I talk to turn on lights or the tv when I could just manually turn them on. Well I was wrong, it's awesome, itll sing you songs and tell you bedtime stories and play games with you. It's learning new things every day and if you want to know all of what it can do look it up on youtube. Google will do that stuff, just as long as you buy the right lights and you either have a tv with Chromecast or have a Chromecast, with out that though it's just Google, so you have to pay to play to a degree. So go into this knowing you need to purchase the proper lights and Chromecast, it's an additional expense that adds up quick. If you have all the right products it's wonderful.","Great product, great price"

We love just to be able to ask what we normally would google and for the price you can't go wrong. A couple of other real nice things are the fact the weather is simple unless you ask for more detail and when asking for detailed information like recipes it will walk you through allowing you to say next or go back. Alexa just sends it to your app. If your serious about a smart home you need both, if you want home automation go with alexa (also she has a better sense of humor) but if you want information and a better speaker and a small profile you must have google mini.",Why type when you can ask?

I have 4 Alexas and I bought the mini to compare it. The integration with other devices is easy in both speakers. I think that Google gives you better answers as an assistant, but lacks some features that Alexa has integrating other automation devices. The google mini has better integration with my Samsung phone and Sony TV. It is hard to decide which one is better.

I wish the description of my commute was a little more detailed (i.e. google only tells me which route to take and approx how long it will take. It doesn't give locations of road accidents or other relevant info). And I don't use pandora or spotify. So it will play a specific song or artist in my library or Google Play, but if I ask for a playlist (say most popular pop songs), it's often stumped if a playlist with that specific name doesn't already exist in Google Play. I assume its AI will improve over time. Still very pleased with it for $30.",Surprisingly loud

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,JoelJhnsn,"This device replaced the Amazon Echo dot my wife and I had in our bedroom. I like it better for several reasons:
- The ability to set and change alarms is easier on the Google interface
- Ability to set music as an alarm
- Google can call people in my cell phone without any addition (Echo needs an addon)
- It's more fun; before going to bed we go on a riddle adventure or a gameshow quiz with Google

I've enjoyed this product, and the flexibility it has compared with the Amazon Echo dot. It just feels more like a finished product, while the Echo dot feels like another way to spend money at Amazon. It was always asking me if I wanted to hear about an Amazon service or buy something, which I never did.",A great bedroom speaker

It’s so much easier to control my lights now with just my voice. I can control many of my chrome cast ready devices and speakers. Everything just seems to work. You do have to play around with the google home app and get to know the ecosystem to get the most out of it. I will definitely be gettting another one in the future. One negative thing I’d say is that there Is only one speaker and when I’m playing fairly loud music on my sound system, the google home mini just won’t hear me.

Since having it I added three more throughout the house. Highly customizable, I use it everyday from getting the news, the weather, my commute and reminders. I have it working with all the TVs in the house and I added a few smart lights that work wonders with this smart speaker. The sound quality is decent for a speaker its size. From the Home app you can adjust the bass and the treble. We're a family of four and we each have our accounts registered and it never fails to recognize the right person. So far, I'm sold on this technology and liking it and discovering more everyday.",Smart Little Assistant
Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,AlxOrl,"If you want an assistant at home and have a lot of Google integration in your daily life (Gmail, Hangouts, etc), the Google Home Mini can supplement and make things a bit easier. It's great to be able to verbally tell it to add peanut butter to my shopping list or have it read to me my calendar for the day as I'm preparing breakfast. You can indeed have a semi fluid conversation with it where as the Amazon Echo most of the time requires you to say its wake word. It works great with home automation (smart plugs/switches, smart thermostat, etc).

There are a couple of bugs in it though. Sometimes it will just turn on even though nobody remotely said ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google."" If you turn the volume all the way up and are streaming music to it, it has a tendency to reboot. The device does get fairly warm, so it's a bit of a concern to me since the Echo stays cool to touch. But this is the first generation, so we can only hope it'll get better.",Pretty Nifty

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2019,krazygreekguy,"This speaker is great for the price and Google Assistant. It’s definitely loud, but really no bass at all. These mini assistant speakers are really for people that take advantage of Google Assitant’s features and other smart home products. Keep in mind that the reason Google Assistant works so well is because you are trading a varying degree of your privacy, not to say that’s a bad thing, but just to acknowledge before buying this product and using it. Same can be said for any Amazon Alexa speaker.",Great buy!

Everyone liked the Google Home so much I thought this was a good expansion of the Google Assistant into other rooms in the house. I bought one for myself to try out and again expand Google Assistant into other parts of the house. It's fantastic. Well constructed. Not cheaply made at all. Works just like the Google Home and so far I'm not dissappointed with the sound quality. I would definitely recommend to others. I would have preferred that Google retained the multi-colored lights on the mini when interacting with someone. It just blinks white, but It doesn't detract from the overall quality of the product.",Good companion for the home

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Hamncheese44,"Nice packaging . The product looked exactly as described and performs very well. Setup was super easy. I'm a previous Amazon echo ( alexa) owner ang got the Google home to compare. I would have to say that the Google home is much more versatile. The big kicker is the ability to do a simple Google search via your voice ( which the echo can not). It controls the same devices and set up is just as easy. Both are amazing pieces of tech. As a consumer and heavy usrr of both Amazon and Google products , it's hard to tell a rookie which to buy. I would have to say to go with the company that you eptimarily use for music as that will be the deciding factor . Great product would highly recommend","Great product , well made, nice design"

I will definitely say that this has been one of the best value purchase I have ever made. It was very helpful around our bedroom and it is very entertaining. Sound is better than your phone and laptop speaker but don't expect high end quality sound. I use it listening to radio through TuneIn and if you have a Spotify account, you can connect it and the Google Mini will play any song.

I have this in the Master Bedroom. It is a good alternative to Echo. All my home automation is set with the Echo and I haven’t set it up with the Mini yet. As far as functionality, it does well. I like the alarm to wake up to. It is gentle sounding compared to Alexa. It has fun games that the kids and wife play. I did try controlling Chromecast which my bedroom TV has that Alexa can’t control. It works well. I can say Hey Google, show trending videos. And the top videos play. I can skip and pause hands free. Petty neat. Google does a better job with inquiries. Echo is better with home automation and has a huge lead start on skills/apps. I don’t think it will replace my Echo. Just complement it. You can’t go wrong with either, but stick to one brand if you plan to put one in every room.",I have 2 Echoes and now a Google Home

It's visually very appealing, and the sound quality is decent. It responds to and in multiple languages (I tested out English and Japanese with no problems). It also has a decent mic since it picks up my voice from any part of my room really well. My only complaints are the ways you adjust the volume (picking it up around the sides will mess with the volume) and the fact that it doesn't seem to have a few features that I would think a device like this could handle.

The best thing about the google mini is that the speakers sound extremely clear and crisp and can reach VERY high volume levels when streaming music via Spotify or whatnot.

If I try to delete a reminder it goes through the list, then ask which one. It would be great just to tell it what one to delete. Love that it tells me how long the commute is to work when asked.

All corporates will not let their employees sync their work calendars to personal calendars for data privacy issues, and rightly so. It does not yet work completely with android TVs. It will play from YouTube on your tv however it will not be able to access your Netflix if you are using an android tv. The voice quality on the phone for the receiver of he call is choppy at times.

If there is a problem I have with it, it would be that you have to think about what you want to say before you say ""hey google"" otherwise youll keep trying to figure out how to word what you want it to do (if that makes sense). You learn and/or get used to it after a little bit though and is handy when you have random questions or thoughts you want an answer to.",Great start for Smart home beginners

I have Alexa in the same room, and right after she tells me she doesn't know, I'll ask Google the same one, and get an answer. And the answers from Google are more in-depth.

After just a few minutes of asking Alexa questions and then asking Google Home the same questions, I found that the Home provided better, more relevant information which is no doubt because of its access to the Google search engine.

When the mini came out, I was that much closer. Then I finally committed. Set it up and have been really happy with the features.

I have been satisfied with its responses and how it can accurately follow my voice instructions. I am impressed by the number of functions you can accomplish.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,4,23 Nov 2018,UrAverageGoogler,"I ordered my Google Home Mini on Black Friday and while I've had fun with it, it has its limitations. It does everything Google says it can: play music from streaming services, hands-free calls, give you your morning news brief, answer random questions, etc. 

However, it often feels more like a hands-free Google engine than a true AI assistant. It can answer some emotion-based questions such as ""Hey Google, help me relax"" (proceeds to play soothing music) but not others (""Hey Google, do you have any dating advice?""). Also keep in mind that it needs to stay plugged in to work. 

Overall, I really like this, especially for the price. I'm just looking forward to more updates and AI improvements (and eventually a wireless model).","Works as Advertised, But Won't Blow You Away"

I wanted a small speaker I could plug in and not worry about having to keep it charged. I've had too many little bluetooth speakers that stop charging or pairing after just a few weeks of use. I use it to play music and podcasts for which it has been working very well. It achieves very high volume and clear sound for such a tiny speaker. The google assistant is more of an extra since I don't have an automated home and I basically only ever ask it the weather aside from music requests. I may hook it up to chromecast eventually, but it was worth the sale price for just the speaker functionality.",A lot of sound for a little speaker

When the price on the Home Mini dropped, I figured I'd try it out and see.

After using it for a couple weeks, it does some things better than Alexa (smart home integration is easier to manage for one, searching the web for things is MUCH better), and some things worse (sound quality with music, staying connected to my wireless network).

The only issue with that is I can't adjust the source volume from the Home mini. I've still got some things to explore for this device, but I love being lazy so I'll figure it out in time.

The Dot is better if you're looking to use it for home automation. It supports more devices and is easier to setup connections. 
The Google speaker is slightly easier to setup initially. It does most of the work itself. It can also answer a wider range of informational questions, and the integration with Chromcast for casting Netflix and other services to your TV is nice.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,clizzabeth,"I have a full sized google home in the kitchen, and I got this little guy for my bed side table. The look of it is sleek, and it works exactly like the big one does. The speaker isn’t as good as the big one, but it’s a quarter of the size, so that’s understandable. 

What I’m not happy about is the defect on the top touch pad of the device. One of the main pieces of functionality of this tech is to be able to touch the top of the device to pause, play, stop alarms, and generally interact. From the research I’ve done, before these even released, when they were giving a few out to lucky winners as promos, there was an issue with a “ghost touch.” It was causing the google to think that the top was being touched, so you’d have it saying weird things to you all day, and pretty much listening to you all day. From what I’ve read online, there were not a lot of people affected by this defect, but google went ahead with the launch instead of recalling the affected devices. They then issued a software update for ALL users that completely disabled the ability to use the top as an interaction button (you can still tap on either side to change the volume). This forces the user to use all voice commands to interact with the device. Which can be a pain in the butt sometimes. 

So the first day I got this product, I set it as my alarm clock, and you can imagine what I looked like at 6 am, trying to beat this thing until it turned off. I finally had to use voice control to get it turned off. But I was used to my full sized google home and I was expecting it to turn off when I touched the top pad. 

I’ve heard word that they might recall all of these devices, but I really hope not. 

Outside of that, it’s great. I just really hope google figures out something soon.","Really awesome, sad about the defect"

The mini is great overall, it can get the job done and do everything the larger speaker can. The only reasons I take off a star are:
- Weaker speaker quality, somewhat expected but it is pretty bad
- No USB C, seemed like an obvious omission given Google's USB C push
- When playing music the speaker seems to have more trouble picking up my commands than an Echo Dot at a similar volume

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,1,23 Mar 2020,television,"I once thought these were the coolest thing around, then I purchased google play music subscription and then I had to deal with support. What a nightmare. 


The speaker is nice, good sound, good quality, crisp, clean, impressive. I used these for about four months and then decided I would upgrade to the music plan. the nightmare began. I was offered three months free trial, great, what is there to lose? This will destroy your nerves, you will need a Xanax subscription to get on in life after this experience. STOP, do not buy this product if you intend to listen to music. This is good to ask the temperate or time but that is it because of the google play subscription experience. 

I have two of the original full devices, six mini devices, and one that has the small screen on it like a tablet. I do not have any of the new giant devices even though I looked at them at best buy and like the sound yet thought I would get one if I ever resolved the google home google play music problems but I now realize that is only a dream, these things are a huge nightmare and I should have opted for amazon Alexa devices in the beginning. 

When I did not subscribe to a google play subscription everything was really fine. I would say ""hey google, play a Nancy Wilson play list"" or ""okay google, play some Nancy Wilson"" and it would play Nancy Wilson various songs. I would also say 'Hey google, play Nancy Wilson I’m always drunk in San Francisco"" and the google device would say you need a subscription to play that song but here is a Nancy Wilson play list, typically the song requested would play second or third in the play list. This was okay, I had no issue with it but then...

Well, then google tempted me with three months free, three months that didn't happen but then did happen full of frustration and then in the end didn't happen and made me wish I was drunk in San Francisco and drove off of the Golden Gate Bridge due to what I will describe below. 

Google tempts you with an offer for three months google play music trial. I thought, well, it would be nice to hear ""I'm always drunk in San Francisco"" before I heard additional Nancy Wilson songs, yeah, that would be nice. I also thought there must be more benefits to it that I would discover in a three month trial, then I would fall in love with it and then I would subscribe. 

The problem began as soon as I signed up. having several of these devices at my house and working from home, and having a garage, a bedroom, another bedroom, an office, a studio, a pavilion, a guest room, a family room, an outdoor patio that all have devices was great until the plan took effect. once the plan took effect and I was listening to music in the office, then went to the studio to work, the studio would interrupt the office when it was playing. It was like the play took hold and the devices began blocking one another. It appears google is afraid a couple of junior high students are going to share music so they build in this huge frustrating system to block and interrupt. 

I dealt with this for about two weeks and then decided to call support. Support said I needed to have the family plan and it would solve the problem, great, throw a few dollars at it and it would be resolved, whew. 

That did not work. The free three month trial disappeared (there was supposed to be three months one each of the ten devices I had, all gone). SO no big deal if it worked as described, but that was only a dream at the beginning of this huge nightmare. 

After calming down for a few months and dealing with family plan interruptions for that time I decided to call support again. That time I explained that I upgraded to family plan and it was ten times worse than the free service. 

I was told by support that I needed to set up family members in the play music app, that would solve the problem. The did set up the play family plan, and then I lost the free months service of the basic plan as family plan offers nothing free. I was willing to live with that since it was to solve my issue. So after a few hours on the phone with google support I was left to my own to make up email addresses and set up a five member family. I added my partners and sons and an alternate email and got five in the family. The problem was not solved. All of the devices are on the same property and still interrupt from room to room place to place, only allowed to play music on one device. So, the family plan means google makes more money and does not honor the free three months of anything, there is no advantage to the family plan. 

But that doesn’t make sense does it? Why would they call it family plan if it doesn’t serve the family to listen to music. I got up the nerve this afternoon, six hours ago, to try to tackle this again and started a text chat with support.  After hours and hours of trying to explain to Andrew at chat he began to tell me he was going to end the chat because of my offensive language. Read below to learn about that. I asked Andrew for his supervisor and after waiting he came back with his supervisor can call me tomorrow, not tonight, not now, but tomorrow when I will be working. That’s right, it will be convenient for google support to call me during my work day and interrupt that but not when I need the assistance now.  I advised I would stand by and wait for his supervisor and called the phone support line for google play music. Andrew was with google play home. 

Google Play music phone support tried to help but they wanted to transfer me to google home support, Andrew was with google home support. Google play music was saying that you sign up family member emails and then they have to have a device assigned to them so that the device recognizes their voice. So I cannot have two devices playing under my voice recognition playing two different songs. I can only broadcast music to a two devices. They also said that if I have a guest stay in the guest room I need to assign that device to them and then make them do their voice set up and email set up. 

This sounds insane and like the technicians who developed this were sent to work for google to sabotage them. How insane is this, seriously google, you have jumped the shark on this and I am now using BING, and will get Amazon Alexa devices to try them out because obviously your too worried about some junior high students sharing music than to make it a logical and effective system. I could sign up for several google play music accounts and have it work that way but that is not what was promised to me when I purchased these devices. 

As a recap I provide the following:

You see I thought family plan meant that I could use my google devices in my home with a limit of five at a time but it does not mean anything like that. I thought it meant that I could have one of these devices in the guest room for a night time white sound noise use for guests or for guests to use to listen to music but nope, not at all. Or maybe play Nancy Wilson in my office and Metallica in my pavilion, no, can’t do that either. 

If you need to contact support you will be sent to the Philippines South East Asia, take a cup of hot tea and a Xanax or other relaxer, before contacting support and be ready to throw the google device through the window, even in your relaxed state. This is truly an experience that you will want to avoid. You will need to take things like Xanax for this google home, google play music experience. Seriously, get ready to get your blood pressure up and become so frustrated that you will need to decompress after the contact with support. 

The help centers are in the Philippines with people who pretend to comprehend but really do not. They have scrips and they tend to stick to repeating the same line ""our service does not offer that yet"". Keep in mind, when you tell them that they are not understanding or that they do not comprehend your situation (not using any profanity, only the words comprehend or understand) they tell you they will need to end the call or end the chat because of your language, then when you question what language offended them they tell you that you are insulting them by telling them that they are not comprehending what you are saying. The chat cannot be copied from the chat system, I tried to copy and paste it and it only pastes the heading ""Google Support"". I asked to speak to America and was not given that option, only that supervisor will call me tomorrow. 

Please do not award google for this bad system and bad service. I will mess with your nerves once you realize what your into you will feel so far in that you must continue. I am throwing it all in at ten devices and will go to Alexa as I have seen it work at my friends house and it does exactly what I am wanting google home devices to do.","NO! suport is poor, play music subsc. is confusing"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,BradleyUfgoodlykins,"I have amazon echos and dots around my house and an iPhone and iPad so I wanted to try out google's assistant. The google assistant is a bit easier to work with than alexa and definitely behind apple's siri. But according to my research, google is always listening and sending everything to the 'cloud'. Amazon is always listening but will only send what it hears after you say your key word ('alexa', etc). Apple will only process what you say to it and send the translated information to the 'cloud' (I ask 'what is the weather?', it sends 'weather request' to the server, no recordings, nothing I say is stored on the device).

But there is no way apple will sell me a home pod for $500. I'll probably stick with my echos and dots I probably spent less than $500 altogether that are in every room of the house now. Google home seems interesting but the privacy concerns don't make me want to replace the amazon devices I already have.","Google home mini works well, but privacy concerns"

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,dudeinco,"So I own three Echo Dots, and three Home Minis. They are comparable, but there are some important differences. 

First of all, I'm a Google Music subscriber, so the mini was a necessity, if I wanted to listen to my music on one of these devices. The sound is just OK, but better than the Echo Dot. It definitely isn't a replacement for a good music device, but in a pinch, it works. Unfortunately, unlike the Dot, it won't connect to external Bluetooth speakers, without owning a Google music dongle. Even then, you'd have to plug in the BT speaker, AND the dongle, so...

Also, when it comes to hearing you, over the background noise of its own music, or over the TV, or really over anything, the Mini fails miserably, in comparison to the Dot. 

For home devices, this, like the Dot, supported everything I had. For some things, like my thermostat, I can ask this what the temperature on the main floor is, and it will know, where my Dot doesn't seem to understand, but pound for pound, it's about equivalent. The Dot gives you, seemingly, a little more leeway on how you describe what you want it to do.

Some of the features on the mini, like reading my appointments, etc., doesn't work, because I have a pro/business account for my gmail/calendar/etc. (you pay for their services, so you get less features, and less compatibility, right?)

I don't know what to say. I was underwhelmed, overall, but your mileage may vary. I already had Dots, so this was just gravy, and under-performed on expectations in some areas.",It's OK

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Latinoheat08rv,The Google home mini is excellent in controlling your smart home and answering questions.

To manually adjust the volume on the device you have to tap either the left or right side of the device, you don't get an idea of at what level the current volume is set at so then you have to get it to speak to test the volume. With Amazon Alexa, there is a ring you turn to left or right and a light gets longer or shorter depending on the volume level you set. Alexa wins.

I have some WEMO devices in my home. With Alexa you just need to say ""Alexa, find my connected devices"". Then it automatically recognizes them. With the Google Home you need to go into the app, and find the setting for it to recognize new devices. Alexa Wins.

if you want to mute these devices so they won't spy on you or listen to what you are saying they have that ability. With the Google Home Mini you have to move a switch on the back and hold the device at the same time or you won't be able to move the switch. With Alexa, you just press a button, that also has a visual indicator letting you know the device has been muted. Google Home mini also has a visual indicator. Alexa Wins.

I have a 5yo and a 10mo old and always have my hands full doing something or another. The Home has been great for playing music and asking very simple questions, but I really thought that it would allow me to ask things I would ask Google on my phone. I was wrong. So often the response is, ""Sorry, I am not yet able to do that"" or something along those lines. Even for relatively simple questions.

I managed to get it to give me some news updates and NPR top news, but I had to be specific in how I asked for these things. It can tell me the weather as well.

I will like the Google Home more when they expand its capabilities some more.

And I'm gonna keep both. Because they both serve different purpose. I'm using Echo to listen to the music using external Bluetooth speaker and to control my smart home devices. Google is good answering questiond. Because it's Google. In my opinion Google screwed up two things. First, inability to connect to external speaker without any additional hardware like Chromecast. We can admit that speakers on both Echo Dot and Google Home Mini suck. And second, inability to change the wake word on Home Mini.

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2018,livinon2wheels,"You can ask google any question you want to and thats great. Thats the good news. The not so good news, is it isnt smart enough to do anything more than a very simple search online for information. Its very easy to ask it questions that it cannot answer. I frequently end up going to the computer and doing a manual search for the information I want the old fashioned way which sort of negates the point of having this little gadget. But its fun to play with and it may get better with time as it downloads better software and learns how to do more. Time will tell. Didnt cost a ton of money, but as it currently stands, I dont really feel like I got what I paid for. Your mileage may vary. :)",well...doesnt live up to the hype

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,3,23 Nov 2017,Gusbear2017,"This is somewhat of a glorified extension mic for my other two Google Home units. I took away one star for poor audio quality and one star for no 3.5mm audio out. BUT I needed Google Home to hear me in the basement/garage to control Philip Hue bulbs down there and also so I could still hear my music while dealing with the laundry. It handles both tasks just fine. No, the audio is not great but it beats not being able to hear the music at all. Would like to see this priced at $25 rather than $30 but as it handles voice commands as well as my larger Home units, the $30 is not unreasonable. The power cord is nice and long and I find the device aesthetically attractive (would like to see more color options too).",Good 1st Effort

Home Mini (1st Generation) - Smart Speaker with Google Assistant - Chalk,1,1,23 Nov 2019,Darren,"Google Home Mini is basically a glorified speaker that can use limited Google Assist to answer trivial questions. But when it comes to the Smart side of the product, if you have a SONY Smart TV, there is a problem right now that Google Home Mini won't connect to the TV to do what it's supposed to do. I called the help desk, and apparently Google and SONY are working to make the fixes. However, since the reason I bought the product is to start making my home SMART, then the product has failed in that department. It was funny to hear the rep ask me if I'd tried the Smart Lights or Smart Thermostat, and I told him, why would I invest in other Smart products, when the Google Assist can't even run my TV.  Also, if you're not subscribed to a premium music service, you cannot directly request a specific song by a specific artist...you will only be able to request playing a generic genre of music, like Top 40 music. For $25, Google Home Mini is a great little toy for my son to play around with, but until the fixes are made to control the SONY TVs, I'm not a big fan right now.",DOES NOT WORK with some SONY Smart TVs
