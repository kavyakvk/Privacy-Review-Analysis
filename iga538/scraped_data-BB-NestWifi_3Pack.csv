Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jun 2020,scotriani,"House is a ranch, 2700 sq. feet on the first floor, additional 1800 sq. feet of finished basement. Wifi router is on the north side of the house in the basement, south side of the house upstairs had sketchy connections. Put the router in the basement, one access point upstairs in the middle of the house and another one in a southerly bedroom and the whole house is rockin' full speed. Might add another access point to the garage area or nearer the pool but just to get a better connection - it still reaches out pretty far! Only complaint is that the access points are super expensive on their own.","So easy, so cool..."

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Jul 2020,Dutch,Overall I’m very pleased with the Nest WiFi AC2200 System.  It was very easy to set up and it gives me great coverage in our home and in the backyard.  The only issue I had was making it work with our 5 year old Bose SoundTouch WiFi radio.  The Bose radio will only work off the 5g router and not the points since they are 2.4 ghz.  Had to consult Bose to solve the problem.  It works great now but if I have a power failure the Bose SoundTouch tries to connect with one of the points.  To rectify I have to unplug the points which forces the SoundTouch to connect to the router.  After it connects I can plug the points back in and the system works as advertised.  Had I known this I may have purchased 2 routers instead of the Nest system.,Excellent product overall.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 May 2020,Primetek,"The new mesh network from Google adds speakers and voice control to every access point. It is more of a value proposition with the built in speakers, you might not need to position the access points where you want to position speakers but hey, is there, use it if you want or switch it off if you do not. From the point of view of strictly network devices, they have better connectivity than the original Google WiFi mesh nodes but the add-on points are missing the ethernet connections. That was a very useful feature to create wireless bridges to insular wired networks with the Google WiFi mesh. 
I suspect the power supplies modules are better and will last longer specially if not abused in speaker mode.",Better mesh plus voice control

After a lot of research and trying cheaper options we decided to the bite the bullet and spend the money. What a great buy. Our download and uploads are in the 120+ range all the time throughout our 2-story house. The set up was a little tricky, but I think that was more operator error than anything else. I would highly recommend it. One thing to keep in mind, and I just didn’t think about it, but this system creates a completely new network in your environment. So, anything you have connected to your existing network, will need to be moved to the new network. Not a deal breaker, just something to keep in mind.",Great Product-Well worth the money

We have had a problem having good WiFi service throughout the house and w the Covid lockdown we have spent a lot of time on our screen porch streaming shows.

3 weeks ago, I noticed the price had dropped to around $350 for a router and 2 points so I bought it.  Installation was simple by scanning a QVC code and it self installs on Google Home app. Router in family room next to cable modem, point upstairs and on the porch.  450 mbps family room, 160 upstairs and porch.  I put a point out in my office about 40 yards from the upstairs point and was able to bridge my office to the house at 65 mbps.  I was able to cut my cable modem for my office and save $50 a month which pays for the additional point in 3 months.

The router I have in the living room and the points are in the far bedroom and the garage. I get great coverage throughout the house and it also covers my entire 3/4 lot.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,3,23 Nov 2018,4to25characters,"It's a router and two access points that really act like extenders. Wifi coverage spreads out but speed does not. Speed actually slows with each additional access point. 

The two access points this system comes with have built-in speakers, which sound nice. The system is also tied into Google, although getting notifications and calendar readings are better with Amazon Echo. After it's set up and the end user visits YouTube, a trial YouTube Premium may be offered, as it was in our case. So: Big Google knows all.

The end user controls the erected gateway via an Android app, which has a nice, smooth GUI and readily adds a user's Google Nest Thermostat...but not its associated temperature sensors, very oddly. There also isn't a web interface, which would be really helpful during COVID, with many working with displays larger than those offered by phones and tablets. So this is like Quibi before it was available for TV.

Tech support is very nice but its resources are pretty small. You just feel for them. So far the impression given is that, true to form, Google is working on the cheap with this offering of a pretty router and extenders with decent speakers and only fair Echo-wannabe IoT functionality.

So...time to return for an eero?",Just okay for the price

I bumped up to their highest internet package but it still wasn’t enough to cover the whole house. I started to lose my patience and I was told about this system. This system has been absolutely amazing. I’ve used WiFi extenders in the past but not like this. This helps triangúlate the connection throughout your house and provide WiFi no matter where you are in the parameters at the same speed.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,3,23 Aug 2020,MrsT,"This is a nice system but I couldn’t get it to consistently work with my Xfinity Xfi system. 

Pros: Nice looking system that doesn’t take up much space. Google has awesome support. Although they were unable to help me get it consistently working, they were very thorough with their support. This system comes with built in speakers and Google voice. It also has a light on it with a dimmer so you can adjust the lighting at night.

Cons: The setup process can be cumbersome. If you lose connection you may have to uninstall/reinstall  the app, change the address location , reset it, or turn the cloud off and on, etc. There were quite a few troubleshooting steps that Google had me go through. It was a bit much and I wasted way too much time trying to get it to consistently work. I just wanted something that enabled me to have WiFi with a consistent signal throughout my home.

Each home setup, network and internet provider are all different. So this unit may work just fine for others, it just didn’t work for me. I ended up getting a NETGEAR Orbi and the set up was super simple. The system connected right away and I’ve had zero issues. I felt the Google Nest WiFi offered way more features than the Orbi and took up less space, but it simply didn’t work for me",Didn’t work for me

Great router for gaming, but doesn't cover the 5,000 sq ft that it advertises. Maybe it does, but my walls are insulated with foam and I was hardly getting a bar in my garage area (2900sq) to connect my 2 garage doors to wifi. I made a decision to buy another Asus router to mesh. I bought the AC 2900 and it really changed the game, but now I was about $500-600 invested. The routers didn't look attractive at all since we moved to a newer modern home so I invested in these tiny Google routers and boy are they a game changer.

I was bringing in gigabyte speed from the curb to a combo modem/router box provided by my ISP, but the signal would drop from time to time across the house. Enter the Google Mesh, and this changed the game. Having the router alone was a boost, simply because the ISP-provided 'network box' was way too dated, but the two extra access points were the difference.

Set up is super easy, and I was able to go from out-of-the-box to a full set up in under 45 minutes. Simple, right? Yeesh...and then I did something wrong, but a factory reset and setting up the network again was fast and easy.

We have a 2 story house on 14+ acres with a shop building that is at least 50 yards from the house. The wifi hub is in our upstairs office in the house. We placed the points in our 1st floor living room and in the shop building where the extender had been. The system was super easy to set up - literally plug and play. It is very easy to control the network and devices with the Google Home and Google Wifi apps (for DNS adjustments, etc.) on our cell phones. The Google Home app allows devices on the network to be sorted by which room they are in, placed in speaker groups, etc. Other devices can be added such as Roku, but not Ring (competitor). But the biggest bonus by far has been the range. My husband wears noise cancelling headphones to stream music while mowing our large yard. He was stunned when he did not lose the signal even when nearly a quarter of mile from the hub! Things that Google needs to improve: integration with other smart devices (including competitors), improved integration (two devices should never answer at the same time), add a microphone and speaker to the hub unit (this is just gouging to get you to purchase another speaker), and stop making the big doofy outlet plugs that take up two spaces on an outlet or power strip.",Covers a large area

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jun 2020,Qleonmaster,"I upgraded from a cable company provided (Frontier) NVG468MQ router located in the family room. I have 150 Mbps internet, and even 5 feet from the router I was getting average speeds (30 - 60 Mbps). My WIRED devices even had poor performance, making it a frustrating experience.

I switched to the Nest Wifi Router 2-pack and placed the first router in place of the old router. Immediately before setting up the mesh network speeds were immensely improved. I ran multiple speed tests with the old router in different parts of my first floor and every location was faster and more consistent coverage. The speed on the wired PS4 (picture above) also improved drastically.

I placed the second router on the second floor of the house in an office / bedroom. It is on the opposite side of the house and more toward the front, so it balanced out the locations. The mesh network set up quickly with excellent strength. Upon testing devices throughout the house, front door (Ring), garage (workouts on phone or computer), the speeds were all 120-150 Mbps. This is an incredible amount compared to the 10-30 Mbps I was seeing before.

Additionally the much simpler network (single SSID), management, and the asthetics of the devices makes this an easy choice for your first mesh system. For simplicity, the Google Home app is sufficient for management, but I preferred to see more details so I also installed the Google Wifi app. It is also very simple to use but provides very clear network status and features to manage or prioritize devices.

Overall I am extremely pleased and this is very highly recommended.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 Nov 2019,pault,"A rate this device a complete disappointment. I bought this system hoping to use with a new Fios installation. I spent probably 4 hours with a very patient support team at Google only to learn a number of fatal flaws. 

First of all, the speed of the network slows each time you add a mesh point. I can't believe that Google sells a product that works this way. Seems to be a very common problem, based on my discussion with their team. 

Second, normal devices that may sit next to a router, like a TV speaker can cause interference and slow the router. 

However, the nail in the coffin was the gated speed. The Fios router that I eventually rented gives me wifi speeds of 500 up/500 down. Google Nest wifi would maybe give me 300 down and less than 200 up. The direct connection on the Fios router gives 900/900 speeds. I struggled with Google to get more than 700-800 down and 300 down plugged. This totally defeated my reason for getting Fios.

Oh, but the mesh points will actually listen to you and give you facts from Internet. I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT. I WANTED A ROUTER THAT PROVIDES FAST SPEEDS.

Unfortunately, it took me more than a month between buying the router and connecting to Fios to figure all of this out. So, I can't return to Best Buy. Oh, but can I return to Google? Yes, but the insist on me monitoring my network for at least a day while I work. And only then will they provide me with an identical router. 

If anyone reading this wants a barely used Google Nest Wifi router, please check eBay. I will be holding an auction in the next few days for anyone who wants a wifi router that slows their connection.",Don't buy this product

For weeks he complained about not having wifi or having slow wifi or wifi dropping. I'd read that the Google Nest was more reliable than other Mesh wifi systems. Testing at his home was slow, very slow so I brought the system to my home. After setting up the system with just 1 access point I had nothing but troubles in the first hour. The access point dropped from the base station 3-4 times within an hour. It would usually reconnect but it took 15-30 seconds to do so. Going to be sending this back - hopefully.

Having upgraded from an wifi extender system, this product represents a substantial improvement.  I haven't had any issues with signal or wifi drops.
The speeds were also tripled over my previous system, so we are able to fully realize our internet speeds and stream multiple devices.  Further a lot of our hassles with connecting with our Sonos system, streaming quality, etc have all seemed to vanish.
It was a WFH upgrade that has paid for itself already.
Managing the devices through the app on your phone is pretty straightforward, not that you really need to spend much time worrying about the system to begin with.

The only real drawback I have found thus far is that you will need to buy a separate switch if you still have a lot of ethernet based devices, i.e Sonos, MyCloud.  The router here only has one port connection.

I tried Google's Nest WiFi after a friend recommended it. The setup was simple and was done in minutes.

I have one point on each floor of our house, and I get 3 bars everywhere I stand in our house, which is about 4000 sq. ft.

Easy setup, great WiFi speeds and coverage.  I have a 200/10 connection and full speed across all nodes of this package.  With that said, the single reason I have for only giving it 2 stars is the LAN port on the router node will not exceed 20MB or so even though it's rated at 100MB.  Having that capability was a major reason why I wanted this set in the first place and to have something so basic,  so poorly implemented is very disappointing to say the least.  I have seen multiple other posts online about this issue that has existed since the beginning yet nothing is being done to fix it yet.  I have tried multiple devices, multiple CAT 5e and 6 cables known to be good in other connections, etc. and the results are the same.  So if your looking for a robust WiFi only mesh setup, the Nest WiFi is hard to beat but if your looking to use the LAN port on the router node, make sure to test it out first to make sure yours is giving you what your paying for.  It's too late now for me to return this setup but my plans to spend a couple hundred more to add a couple more router nodes to take advantage of the LAN Ethernet connectivity is not going to happen now.  I will probably just give this away to my grandson, who needs a good Wifi setup and get something else.","WiFi is great, LAN port on router is disappointing"

I bought this nest system in July and it solved my connection problems. No more getting booted off Zoom calls. No more download slowdowns. Then four months later the router broke. It seems it's a defective router. It loses connection over and over and over again. It's still under warranty but the process of getting a replacement from Google is absurd. 

I have had three chats with Google customer service. I've filled out three forms. I've downloaded three or four diagnostic tests for them. I've had to grant them access to my connection for a day. I've allowed them to place a $180 hold on my credit card. I've filled out an order for a replacement. And they still have not shipped it. Making matters worse, every email Google sends gets filtered into Gmail's junk folder. You'd think since they invented the email they could figure out how to use it so that their own product recognized their email. I almost never write reviews, but I  feel like it's a public service for me to warn you guys away from this product.

Set up was straightforward and reasonably quick with the smartphone app.  System reflected excellent mesh connections between the nodes.  Overall coverage was very good throughout the house.

However, there were some bothersome limitations.  I could not get over 120-130 mbs on an ethernet connection through these routers (I have 1 gb service from Xfinity).  Additionally, the maximum speed seen at any device connected via WiFi was around 300 mbs.   I also have an ethernet connected high performance desktop and an older SmartThings hub that requires a wired connection, so an unmanaged switch was required.  
After trying for several days to resolve the speed throttling issues, I returned the system and purchased a different mesh system.  I am now seeing 980mbs on etherent connected devices and up to 500mbs on capable WiFi connected devices.

Even when standing in front of the router I can only manage to get 600 mbps max. This is way below the AC1700 that is advertised. It gets even worse when you are connected to the wifi extenders. I can't get more than 200mbps. This tells me that the backhaul on this system is taxing. A drop when connected to the extenders is expected, but you may want to look elsewhere if you have 1 gigabit.

It was very easily to install, and the increased coverage that a mesh network provides has been excellent. The mesh network means no more dead spots and the UI on the app is everything you expect from Google.

It is a bonus that the add-on points have the google assistant built into them, so they work the same as a Google Home, with the added benefit of being able to turn of the mic if you want.

Only the base has an Ethernet connection and I would have liked additional connections, but that has not been an issue.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jul 2020,NetworkJunkie,"I was hesitant to buy this mesh system while sitting in the car in the parking lot, walking into store, and walking the isles just to avoid any regrets. I went from a netgear nighthawk x6 to an Asus 5300 to an UniFi USG with 2 access points and 2 Poe switches.  I even tried the mesh network with Asus. That was no good. Wasted money.  I was hoping to maximize my 1GB internet speed.  For some reason though, even with bypassing the modem, I could still not get over 200-300mb on a good day for speed tests.  So my goal was to buy another ubiquity product to replace my prosumer setup and increase my speed.  I have about 20+ devices so I figured ubiquity would handle my network the best.  So I spent a few days researching and knowing I wasn’t getting the Google Nest WiFi because... just no.  After my research I looked at the Orbi, the new Asus Line, and anything with mesh network connectivity.  I was looking for that gotcha in each product line.  After a few speed test videos, most said the Google Nest WiFi is what I needed since I don’t have devices with WiFi 6.  

So I made the purchase reluctantly but I am super glad. The speed and coverage is just what I need. Each and every device I tested gets great speeds and coverage (4200+ sq home).  The speakers on the WiFi points are an added bonus.  The music sounds surprisingly great. I have a switch connected to the router to give me additional wired devices. I even put my phone on airplane mode to test the coverage while cutting the grass.  Even up to 20+ ft away through walls from the nearest access point, the coverage and speeds were excellent. I have to say, this has been the best wireless router system I have had in over 10 years. Best decision ever made when I told myself don’t buy it.","If you’re on the fence, let me help you"

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2016,TimHappy,"I have been having trouble with my FiOS wireless router's weak signal now that my granddaughter is attending school remotely 3 days a week. I tried everything I could to increase the signal by using a larger antenna and moving the router but that really didn't help. I went to Best Buy to purchase a ""repeater OR booster"" device but realized thru my own experiences as an IT System Engineer that these devices would have just pulled the signal to that booster and it would have affected the Wi-Fi in the rest of the house. I knew my next step would be to buy a ""nest Wi-Fi mesh"" system which can be very expensive. I talked to a tech specialist and we discussed all my options and he advised me to purchase the Google AC2200 system which was NOT the most expensive system in the store. It had the quality I wanted, the number of devices that were perfect for my house and it could be expanded easily if I needed to add more devices. I was able to install the system in about 20 minutes and my whole house now has excellent Wi-Fi signal no matter where you are in the house OR outside in the yard. My granddaughter's school given CHROMEBOOK laptop now works perfectly as it should and my granddaughter is getting her work done with ease and no interruptions or loss of signal.

I have had Orbi (1 router and 2 satellites) at my parents house.  Orbi is good but size is relatively big and has a bit less coverage area wise. Also, not a big thing but doesnt play music. Eero - one of my friend has it and I too have experienced it, range is not as powerful and rarely it has shown lag in video calls despite of 1 GBPS connection.
So far (though I am not pro in reviewing tech part of wifi-mesh), I have a 2350 sqft home divided in 3 floors. I also wanted coverage in backyard and frontyard too; hence I added those many sqft to my overall area. I went to google website  / store to research if I am good with 3 or 4 (router + satellite) and result was 3. I have a 1 GBPS internet speed.
So, far I havent experienced any delays / glitches in any part of the house (during regular work, calls, video calls etc)  including front yard + back yard.  Hence I totally recommend it.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jul 2020,FrostArc,"After spending months searching for a solution to my wifi problem, Google Nest WiFi came through with a major win.

To start, we moved apartments to a newer 2 story place. Nothing new and my Netgear Nighthawk had always served me well in the past for single and 2-story apartments. However, this place was insulated to the 9's and we had terrible wifi signal in the upstairs office and bedroom. 1-2 bars of signal strength and speeds that barely rivaled the old 3G networks. I tried to get a Netgear mesh router and after 4 fruitless hours I ended up returning it. Nothing fit what I wanted which was just a wifi booster. I wanted to keep my old network name, password, etc. and just have the signal be stronger. Nothing worked.

After buying this (my poor wallet) and spending the 10 min putting the hardware in, another 15 min setting up the network and the 2 wifi points, I had EXACTLY what I wanted. Just one single network that I was able to set up sooooo easy with the app and had solid wifi strength for my devices all over the house. I wanted to cry and leap for joy at how well this worked. 

The price is scary yes, so if you see a sale don't hesitate to purchase. It has a lot of extra google assistant, music, and streaming connections (think Alexa but Google) that I could have probably done without for a much cheaper version.....but they are neat little features to have, and to be honest, after all that searching and wasted time with other products, I think the price is easily worth it. 

The only downside I can see, is that the main modem has only 1 Ethernet connection for 1 hardwired device. To be fair, I only used 2 of the 6 on my Netgear Nighthawk for my game systems, but it would've been nice to have at least 2-4 connections. If you prefer some hardwired connections, you may be disappointed. However, the wifi speed using test software provided the same results as the hardwired devices, so I don't think I am missing out much.",Just What I Needed!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Dec 2019,mu1234567,At least the first day I connected this router and the two points---they are simply amazing!!! The houses on my street have very poor wifi connection from the other end of the house to a router for some reason and most of them are 2-4 stories apartments. I have been suffering from poor wifi and switching between main wifi and extension for more them 1.5 years. And I saw this new gen google wifi one day in news---what a perfect combo--wifi point and smart speaker!! I also need smart speakers in two rooms. The setup is so simple. I followed a blog online and turned off my fios gateway night before. And the connection to new router and point is wayyyyy simpler than verizon fios and netgar extender setup. Plus the nest point is way better than echo dot as smart speaker. Signal is strong and fast! Cannot be happier! I only hope this can last.,great!!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Jan 2020,Derek,"This system is super easy to setup through the google home app. The wireless access points are also google assistants which means they are voice activated. I did however have to turn off the voice activation because it did not seem to work well with all my google home minis I have. They seemed to not be able to decide who was going to do the action I requested so they kind of cancelled each other. Turning the mic off on these units has fixed that. You may not have this issue though if you don’t have other voice powered google devices. Using the google Wifi app, you can see what devices are connected to which access point. The one downfall is if you want anything hardwired there is only one LAN Ethernet plug on the base hub, so you will need to get a cheap switch if you want things plugged in via Ethernet. I have had no problems with connections. They are in three separate rooms with no direct view and are getting a “great” mesh connection, which is the best you can get. I consistently am getting my full internet speeds from all access points when testing. You will definitely want your streaming devices over 5ghz, so if you have the option to pick on your device, please set it to 5ghz. I usually keep all my smart devices on the 2ghz. Keep in mind that google WiFi app does not give you the option of picking what frequency or what access point your devices connect to or with. There are a ton of family features, guest WiFi, etc. overall, I’ve had no problems with this at all and it works very well across my 30+ devices.",Better than I thought

I have to say that it is totally worth whole price if I had to purchase again. The points with the built in speakers are a lot more useful than I would have imagined. I had a really wifi setup and then an extender but I always ran into problems. Also since I stream almost everything there were times when some of my devices didn't show up because they were running on the 5ghz network and other were on 2.4ghz network. This is one signal that joins all your devices regardless of which type of signal it supports and it has completely eliminated this issue in my home. All my connected devices just seem to communicate effortlessly now.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Ercw,"Bought this for my parent’s house. They have their router in the office on one side of the house and the WIFI wouldn’t reach to the other side in their tv room. Had to go through the kitchen so a lot of interference.  I got the 3 pack since their house is 3 stories (3rd floor is an attic my mom likes to use for sewing room) and I wanted to make sure there was ample coverage. I might have even been fine with just the two pack but it might not have reached the attic so I didn’t take the chance. 
I was definitely satisfied with how easy it was to setup.  Downloaded the Google home app and followed instructions. No extra cables or fuss. The devices are fairly small and didn’t get in the way and I like the modern and simplistic design. 
After setup the whole family of 5 noticed a difference right away. We all have iPhones and iPads and some had a few laptops. Coverage was great!  Could reach outside the house on the front porch and in the backyard as well when that wasn’t even a consideration before with their Google fiber router.
Also was able to get their Ring doorbells setup again since those barely could reach the existing network before.

I returned it and went with the nest (what I should have done in the first place).  I am shocked at the amazing coverage of a 2800 sq ft house.

I live in a 5,000 square foot ranch model home (2500 upstairs / 2500 in basement). Home is 3 years old. Have been dealing with internet issues since day one. Constantly taking my phone on and off wifi, can't watch shows in bed on iPad, smart tv's having bad connection, slow speeds, etc. I was about to change internet providers but thought I should look into purchasing a mesh wifi system before making the change. The reasons I chose google over eero was I have a google home as well as the nest doorbell and I wanted to have everything running on the same system and the price was a little cheaper than the eero (i believe $50 cheaper but the eero system does come with security protection for web browsing). As soon as I installed the google nest wifi system (super easy to do) my results were IMMEDIATELY noticed. It was literally night and day!! This system supports two adults, three kids, 3 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 smart tv's, playstation as well as a peloton bike AND WORKS FLAWLESSLY. It even INCREASED MY INTERNET SPEED! I am a HUGGGGGGGE believer in this product. My wifi works as it should and I don't get upset anymore paying for service that doesn't work like it should. I set up this system in my home about a month ago and have never even had to shut off the modem and turn it back on. Everything in my home works flawlessly.

This arrangement was sufficient to provide strong Wi-Fi in every part of my home and gave me enough bandwidth to stream 4K video wherever I had a signal. It also handily managed the 50-plus devices that are connected to my Wi-Fi network at any given time and didn’t have any trouble “hopping” devices from the router to the Point when I moved about my home.

The Nest Wifi consistently provided faster speeds to my devices that were connected to the primary router and not the Point. But where the Point lacks in Wi-Fi capabilities, it makes up for by the fact that pulls double duty as a voice-activated smart speaker. Essentially, it’s a Nest Mini speaker mashed into an original Google Wifi puck. It sounds very similar to the Nest Mini, which isn’t a bad thing, and there’s a glowing ring at its base that illuminates white when you speak to it and orange when the mic is muted. It even has the same touch controls as the Nest Mini for adjusting the volume or pausing playback. Google intends the Point to be placed out in the open, which provides the best wireless and smart speaker performance, so it designed it to look nicer than the typical router. It also comes in three colors — white, pale blue, or pale pink — while the main router is only available in white.

The Point supports all of the same voice controls for the Google Assistant as the Nest Mini, but it also adds a couple of router-specific voice commands, such as running speed tests or pausing connections to groups of devices managed in the Google Home app. If you have a Nest Hub or Hub Max, you can also run speed tests from there or display the credentials to a guest network.",Love it!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Oct 2020,HelloBob,"1. This is an excellent product from google. 
2. Installation process was really simple, as long as you have google home installed in your phone. 
3. Signal coverage is as stated. We have a large two-storied house with a basement, but receive uninterrupted signals everywhere with 3 packs (one router + two extenders/pointers).
4. Moreover, those extenders also work as google home i.e. you can interact with google search and other features of google assistant through them. Plus they can also work as speakers through casting.
5. But... but not sure if google is monitoring the device - usage and pattern of data transferred through these devices

Only draw back is that there's no inbuilt mechanism to hand or fix them on the wall. You need to buy wall-hangers separately, and the hangers are different for the main router device and the extenders.",Excellent product from google... however..

My kids' Chromebooks were getting a ""poor"" WiFi signal from their bedrooms and one in particular would be disconnected from his classes regularly.

So it was time for me to look into improving our WiFi network.  I could have looked into simple extenders, but the idea of mesh was compelling to me.

The setup was easy and all my devices around the house connected to the new network seamlessly.  Through the Google Home app I seem to have the ability to control the features that I'm used to with my previous WiFi router.

My house is two stories and there were a couple dead spots. I’d never heard of mesh routers and just figured I needed an expander but learned that they can reduce overall internet speed, or at least, perform Lesser than expected. 

But I walked into Best Buy and noticed all these beautifully designed mesh routers that I’d never known about. A bunch of companies I hadn’t heard but they had really nice products. I finally did my research and saw that mesh was right for me. I chose Google because the design is nice but not too fancy, and I already had a google home and chrome cast.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Jan 2020,Greg,"I have had a few different routers over the years, most recently the Netgear R7000. I have a difficult house to cover due to where the cable line comes into the house (basement under HVAC ducts), walls in the way, and large house. I have the R7000 centrally located in the house using a CAT5 line originally there for phone. I have never had consistent coverage or consistent speed.

I finally bought this Google Nest mesh system and kick myself for not doing it earlier. My cable provider gives me ~ 230MBs down and I never got that from the Netgear R7000 - it would be inconsistent, as high as 170 MBs and often as low as 10MBs. I assumed this was just the house and walls, etc. 

When I installed the Nest mesh, I actually wired it into the R700 so it was going through the Netgear to the cable modem - I did this to maintain my old wifi while converting and intended to switch to have the Nest directly wired. Once I plugged the Nest in, I have consistently gotten ~230MBs down which is even faster than I was getting from the R7000. I realized the Netgear was my problem.

I bought the 3 pack of the Nest mesh as I assumed I needed it for the house. I could have gotten by with only 1 but there would have been some corners of the house that were slow. With a second on, I had full coverage everywhere in a 3 story 7,000 sq foot house. I installed the third because i had it but honestly did not need it. 

Easy to set up, amazing speed, and I have consistently tested the speed and it has consistently been 200-230 MBs down which I never got before.",Awesome for problematic house coverage

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,4,23 Jun 2020,Lindavidf,"We like these, but had major problems setting it up. We tried to use our old internet name and password in order to not re-link all devices. Google only has text support with intermittent un-useful replies, so it basically took 2 days of frustration to figure this out myself. I had to reset with using a new internet name and then was able to set the old name for the guest network. It doesn't work with our Amazon devices. The mesh network seems much better than our prior router from the cable company. You can ask Google questions, call between rooms and play music on two of the units.

So we decided to try out a mesh network with Google WiFi and it has done wonders! The entire house is covered with great signal with the 3 pack and devices transition seamlessly to the best point as you move around the house. No more dropping WiFi on our main router and having to reconnect manual to extender, etc. the Google WiFi and Google Home app make it SO easy to setup the mesh network and offer really neat features and information about your network too. I love it! The only single downside is the Google WiFi is a tiny bit more expensive than other mesh networks, but I think being backed by Google, their reliable and customer service,  is worth it.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 Nov 2017,SavingUTime,"Me and a friend separately purchased both of our own individual google mesh systems and had multiple issues. When you search for reviews on this nest mesh router everything is fine and dandy, but go on googles support forum (https://support.google.com/googlenest/search?q=Google%20WiFi%20router%20slow) and there is literally hundreds of people complaining about throttled and slow speeds from the beginning of 2020 up until today the date I’m posting this, with no support or solution on the issue. I spent 15 hours in total changing settings on my modem, changing DNS settings on my router, which worked for about two days until it got throttled back to exactly 90mbs. Literally everyone with this system is complaining about the same issue which is being throttled to 90mbs. And as I said before me and a friend bought this at the same time and had the exact same issue. Finally after wasting 15 hours I call support spend more time with them and nothing, was a lost cause. I mean I give them a plus that they were nice, but they have absolutely no solution to this issue. Other than changing dns settings, changing your modem settings if your using one, and factory resetting it to death. Oh and let me tell you about bridge mode! First of all it doesn’t fix the throttling issue but second of all if you bought this mesh system you know to use the mesh system and you own a modem like most people do, you’ll have to enable this into bridge mode which disables the ability to use the mesh system lol? No where on the box or documentation does it say this. You kind of just find out after spending all most 400 dollars to buy this paper weight. Oh, your probably saying oh that’s ok I just need to use AP mode(bleep) wrong, that mode exist no where on this 400 dollar router... and last thing on like the 1 and a half days I got this thing to actually pushed out the right speed, the mesh system, which said had very good connection, was putting out about 90% less speed than the router was actually getting. And again friend who got the same set up tested the same exact issues with the mesh access point speeds. In conclusion I’m not saying don’t buy this, but I am saying if your paying for speeds over 90mbs your definitely going to want to look for a better solution. And if your paying for speeds that are 90mbs or less, why are you even looking at this 400 dollar router to begin with?",Not a viable WiFi solution for high speed internet

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 May 2020,GaryA,"I recently made the decision to upgrade the Google WiFi setup in my house to the new Nest WiFi router and access points. Unfortunately my experience has been nothing but frustrating. With my Google WiFi set up, everything worked perfectly. I had solid speeds across my house, with very few connection drops or issues. My experience with the Nest WiFi has been the complete opposite. Since day 1, I have experienced several connection drops, with various devices constantly losing connections at random times. On several occasions, I lost access to the internet all together, going for hours before the devices start connecting again. In these situations, I could connect directly to my FiOS router via the LAN port, which worked flawlessly. All of these issues were specifically tied to the Nest WiFi units.

Several of my connected devices that worked perfectly before no longer worked. I was unable to connect my Brother wireless printer. My Nest Protect and thermostat would lose connections regularly. Gaming devices would disconnect every 30 mins or so. It was just ridiculous. I tried every troubleshooting step available and had no luck resolving these issues. I even tried a second set of Nest WiFi devices and experienced the same issues.
In addition to this, the shift to setting up and managing the devices through the Home app, as opposed to the dedicated Google WiFi ap is a big step in the wrong direction. Google’s WiFi products have always been criticized for their simplicity and a lack of access to advanced features found on other routers. With the Nest WiFi, it seems like there are even less features available than with eh Google WiFi, plus a cluttered, less well-organized user experience through the Home app.

After suffering through a month + of issues, I just purchased Verizon's new WiFi 6 router and extenders. Everything works perfectly with my new setup, with no connection issues. All in all, a very disappointing experience with the Nest WiFi.",Extremely Disappointed in Nest WiFi

My wife and I have one at our home, and once my dad finally gave up his old internet company, I helped him set up his internet with these bad boys. Honestly, I don't remember the last time I've seem him so happy with a purchase. He said he would've spent $500 on a set like this knowing it'd work this well. If you already have the Google Home app, it's even easier. With Google's wifi app you can check your wifi speeds, how strong a signal each device in your home receives, and prioritize certain devices' signals if you choose to. There may be other mesh systems that are as fast, maybe even with a setup that's this breezy, but I have bought this one twice, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.","So nice, we bought it twice!"

I have the router in the main room, a satellite in another living area and the second satallite in the hallway between my kids' bedrooms. It works amazing.  Good coverage everywhere. The Google home app is easy to use. I wish it had the ability to only have the guest wifi on during certain times, rather than having it on all the time. Small issue that is not a deal breaker. Love this and would recommend. It's also cool because they have a speaker built in so you can stream music and have the equivalent to an Alexa in each room.  Definitely worth the extra money in the price.

I currently have 2 routers and 2 nodes and only 1 node gets a ""Good"" connection in the mesh test, so I am ordering another router (not cheap).

Thanks to my geek squad protection plan, I was able to return old equipment and upgrade the entire system to the newer 2200 system by paying difference in original cost and newer price ($90).  I noticed major improvements in coverage right off the bat, I now only needed two access point setup versus three; I have a large multi-story home.  I know even have coverage in my back yard/patio area.  The upgrades to the access points are also cool and now have speakers for play music, voice calling and intercom functionality.  Another great benefit is Google’s customer service, they helped diagnose my issues with previous equipment by reviewing error codes and even offered to replace the router after they determined it was part of a lot that had been determined to be malfunctioning.

It has been a few weeks and it’s working great! We have AT&T fiber internet and pay a lot for it, however it has never worked properly in over 3 years. AT&T is of no help stating there was no problems, but the WiFi was extremely slow and we never received the speed we should have gotten. After research- found out their routers are not capable of distributing the high speed but you cannot just replace their router, you HAVE to have it. So using their router as a bridge and using Google’s router solely as my WiFi it has worked extremely well!

I had no idea mesh systems existed - mainly because I worked in an office that has our network WiFi easily available and of course - its a business so the strength is good. I started working from home since the end of April 2020 (thanks pandemic) and I noticed a slight lag while I worked. I dismissed it. Since the beginning of August our signal was significantly slower (most likely due to all schools being taught remotely). We initially had the Apple AirPort Extreme - which was now extremely slow - and obsolete after I researched it. Found the Google Nest and skeptically ordered it. Once it arrived, the set up was incredibly easy and the WiFi is amazing!!! Definitely suggest this product! Oh, my work computer is a 10zig, and now it works as it should!!

I have 2 acres of land, and not only does this cover the entire house with full wifi, it also covers most of the back yard with full wifi, and a small part (further away) with medium wifi. This is super beneficial for a large home, and I am extremely impressed that with two points, it does not compromise the network speed. I highly recommend this to anyone!

Then I  had another powerline adapter which acted as another access point.

With this, no matter how I placed these items, I couldn't get proper coverage for my property. House is 1750sqft, lot 9000sqft. I have a nest doorbell, 2 outdoor cams, guard, thermostat, 3 temp sensors, 6 wyze cams, and various tablets, phones, laptops, desktop, smart TVs, chromecast and nest hubs. These devices kept having random disconnects, weak wifi signals, slow speeds. I figured the devices kept switching between the different access points / router.

I decided to upgrade to a mesh network. I picked up the router w/2 points and couldn't be happier. I recommend anyone to just get the package with 2 points, the price difference isn't much for the extra point compared to buying one separately. Plus the points are also google assistants.

I setup my frontier modem to only act as a modem, set the nest router next to it, replaced the 2 old access points with these and everything is behaving as it should, all my problems are gone.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,5,23 Dec 2019,KWAK1526,"Ive got a L Shaped, Mid-century Modern ranch home (2000sq ft) here in south florida......which means concrete/ cinderblock walls. Its a NIGHTMARE for Wifi. Unfortunately for most homes, you cant centrally place your Modem where you want, its where the cable comes into your home, which is at the very bottom right of our L shaped home. ANYWAYS, I have one of the best modem/ router combos best buy offers, bought it 5 months ago. It works if you're next to it, but the things connected to Wifi in the front of my home are very spotty at best. I bought a Netgear extender. It works well with my camera but rather than that, same thing. SPOTTY.  I have a new Sonos system throughout my home (10 speakers + Subwoofer), its never worked right with the router/ extender, speakers constantly fall off the network and thats IF they show up on it in the first place. 

A friend of mine mentioned the Google Mesh System. Packaged beautifully like most new aged things, this thing comes user friendly right out of the box. Set up took about 15 minutes for all 3 items. 

WOW, just WOW. The speeds that read off the access points are the same as what reads when sitting in front of the router. Haven't dropped a single connection, ALL my speakers are SUPER responsive. I was ready to throw in the towel with Sonos. Well worth the 300+ price, you wont be disappointed. I also love that the access points are also GoogleHome devices. Ive never used one before, but Its two rooms I dont need an Alexa I guess. 

If you've got a wireless speaker system/ security cameras/ tvs/ wireless switches/ WHATEVER, these almost seem like a necessity.",You WONT be disappointed!

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,2,23 Jan 2020,bearbear,"I was extremely excited about this product. However, this Nest Wifi is very slow (I get less than 200 mbps) which is way worse than my 2012 router. The speakers really are terrible, which is worse than the Nest mini. The microphones for google assistant is atrocious (when the music is playing, Google Assistant has troubles hearing you) - way worse than the Nest mini. Moreover, the paint finish is terrible- got a slight chip after just a small bump on my counter. 

The concept and idea is awesome - router and points that have Google Assistant. The router is extremely easy to setup, but you need to download the Google Home app (but you also need to download Google Nest app... and need to download Google Wifi app...), which makes the whole experience completely fragmented and confusing. For the price, the execution needs a lot of work. I recommend just getting a faster router/mesh system then buy a few mini's. This is extremely unfortunate, but I had to return them due to the slow internet and annoyance of using the Google assistant.","slow internet, terrible speakers and microphones"

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Mesh System Router and 2 Add-On Points (3-Pack) - Snow,1,1,23 Jun 2020,MarkM,"""Upgraded"" from Google Wifi, to Nest Wifi to get faster connection.  App shows a weak connection all through the house that half the time isn't even usable. I've spent a couple hours on the phone with Google trying to fix the issue, and tried to bolster the signal quality by adding some of the old Google Wifi points and still can't get anything better than ""weak"" connection.

Setup was relatively easy as long as you're setting it up as a new network. It is easy to add to an existing network as well, but be prepared to not get the speed increase if adding it to your old network. Then you run into the issue of having to factory reset everything to start over.

I would not recommend this at all.  I will add I am a big fan of the rest of Google's ecosystem am deeply invested in their smart home products.  This item is just a complete let down in comparison to all their other stuff.",Waste of money.

I also researched several mesh systems with expert reviews and thought this one was the best. But my experience has been terrible. The main router seems to work good enough, but the mesh satellite points are very unstable, they disconnect frequently and once they do the mesh extension doesn’t operate. Most of the advice you get from Google support is to reset the system. All I have to say to that is, I have used several routers in the past that never needed to reset at all. I’m talking years of operation without needing to do anything. So just the fact that this does need to be reset makes it an inferior system. I am outside the Best Buy return window, which really sucks because I would like a refund and the ability to go in a different direction. But I’m kind of locked in now. I definitely recommend looking elsewhere.  Hopefully somebody reads this and it helps them to avoid the disappointing experience that I have had.",Unstable and low coverage

Should have read the fine print.  
""²This is based on only using connected devices at a data rate of 1 Mbps each. ""

The instructions evenstate that the accesspoints should not be more than 1 room away from the router location.  huh?

I found the range no better than a single comcast router but the speeds from the access points were horrible.  20MB down .5MB up.  Connecting the same device directly to my Comcast wifi router gave me 70MB down and 30MB up.

I woujld not waste money on this.  The only true mesh system is one where the APs are hardwired to the router.  The better solution was a NetGear NightHawk AC1900 USB->Wifi for the PC. ($125)
