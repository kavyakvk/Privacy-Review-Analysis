It might make more sense to review the ""Initial Review"" and then the ""Update"". Update:  After submitting this review on Amazon yesterday, I forwarded it to various emails at Netgear (Arlo is made by Netgear).  I received three phone calls and two emails attempting to help me with my situation.  Two new complete add-on camera kits were shipped to me as RMAs along with a postage paid return label.  All this arrived her within 24 hour of this original post.  Customer service really stepped up once I was able to get beyond the first level of support. The BATTERY CHARGE RESOLUTION... The source of the charging problem was the Arlo power adapter (white rectangular box)... both the one that came with the original cameras and the replacement power adapter were bad.  The original cables, camera and battery are all fine.  The new power adapter that came with the RMA add-on camera charge the new cameras as well as my original cameras.  I mentioned below that others suggested using a standard micro USB cable in place of the Arlo charging cable. I was told by a senior level Netgear support person that using a standard micro USB rather than the cable provided would not resolve any issue and in fact will not work.  I believe this to be the case. I am leaving this reviewed as a one star in hopes that it may draw attention to my experience and help others.  Having said that, I do really like the functionality of the cameras and software and I like the value of having no cloud storage fee.  Now that Netgear stepped up and my issues are resolved, I would recommend this product with the caveat that customer service is lacking.  I would give this product 4 stars. Initial Review: I loved this camera system for the first few months... until the batteries needed to be charged.  I am now more than a month into this and a dozen calls into Netgear's Philipine's-based call center and still no resolution.  After basic trouble shooting, I was told they would send a new USB charging cable and power supply.  A week later, the cable came... still no charge to battery.  After another call and another week, the power supply finally arrived... still no charge to battery.  After another call, I was told that the cameras would be swapped out... a week later and no cameras, no email indicating that the cameras would be shipped.  Several days later ANOTHER cable arrived (not sure why).  Another call and I was told that no camera replacements were authorized and that I needed to further troubleshoot.  We then upgraded the firmware... still no charge to battery.  I was then told that one last step was to replace the batteries (two cameras = two batteries).  A week later, ONE new battery arrived... new battery won't charge with new firmware, new cable and new power supply.  At this point, it doesn't take a genius to determine that the issue is the camera hardware.  Don't get me wrong, the steps seem logical but this should not take a month and a dozen calls.  Yet another call to Netgear support and I was told that we needed to upgrade the firmware of the second camera before customer support could authorize and escalation of the case... so that it could be FURTHER reviewed by a more senior level support group to determine IF new camera's could be authorized.  I was told I could not personally speak to anyone with the authority to order a replacement.  I now have a month of frustration into this and the best I can hope for are RMA cameras and the cost to ship back all the stuff they sent me along with the faulty cameras.  Hope you don't need support.  I see that others had similar charging issues and were able to resolve by using a standard USB cable.  That did not resolve my issue.",BEWARE - Battery charging issues and very poor support - Original Post Updated with Resolution

I put it above the front door and the picture shows what it sees.  I've been playing with the motion sensor sensitivity for a while now and was unable to find the sweet spot. (Perhaps there's no sweet spot for my case). I have the base station sensitivity set to 100% and the camera set to 95%.  Below is when I'll get an alert. YES = Motion detected and I got an alert. NO = No motion detected and no alert. - Someone walks on the walkway and approaches the front door.  YES - Someone walks on the sidewalk on the far right, from either direction, day or night.  YES - Any activities happen on the lawn on the right.  YES - A bug flys by the camera.  YES - I back the car (a white minivan) out of the garage.  (Grey car is facing the garage).  NO - I walk to the grey car from garage, get in, and drive away.  NO - I pull the car up from the street to the driveway, get out, and walk to the garage.  NO - I should say, ANY ACTIVITIES happen on the asphalt driveway.  NO - Cars drive by on street.  NO - Garbage truck picks up my garbage by the curb.  NO - Mail carrier deliver mail into curbside mailbox.  NO I know the ideal distance is less than 20ft. The camera is about 18ft from the grey car and from the sidewalk. Not sure why it wouldn't pick up anyone or anything in the driveway but would pick up anything on the side walk. I deemed this useless if it can't even capture anything on the driveway which is not that far away and nothing is obstructing its view. Night vision is limited to objects near the camera. It can't see anything far away.  If someone is really trying to break into our cars at night, the camera won't do anything.  This is a very pricey camera and I expected much more.  I'm returning it. Update 10/29 : I didn’t return it but moved it above the garage door. With the sensitivity set to 100%, it wouldn’t be even detect when my car backs out of the garage or pull in to the garage. It’s literally 4 ft from my car and it does not detect it. I deemed this camera useless.",Unreliable motion detection

The biggest issue is it only records when it detects motion but the motion detection is really bad. For example I set one up in my garage to alert me when the door is opened thinking it would start recording right when the door moves, however it doesn't start recording the clip until maybe a second after the garage door is completely up. The other cameras I can very easily just walk past without being recorded. *If* they offered a continuous recording option for these wireless cameras they would be amazing. The hardware is really nice and the wireless is fantastic. Without continuous recording they're nearly useless for security though. I'd even worry they make my house more of a target than they would be a deterrent just because anyone familiar with them would know they could run up and pull them off. I would recommend avoiding these until they make improvements.",Really poor motion detection
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jun 2017,Alex,"I used to have 2 cameras of the Arlo Wire-Free and migrated them to the new Arlo Pro base station and added 6 additional cameras to put them around the house. If I leave the system armed all the time so it records motion to the cloud, batteries on the cameras last 2-3 days at the most as there is always movement triggering the camera's recording. If I leave all cameras streaming on the app or website so I can watch the feed live, after a few minutes the app on iOS (iPad and iPhone) simply closes by itself and the website just stops the live feeds. And if you're watching the live feed, the camera isn't recording the motion to the cloud (defeats the purpose!). I use it with Samsung's SmartThings Hub, but I've had a few alarm triggers because I forgot to disarm it before walking into the house and some of the Arlo cameras failed to record when called by SmartThings. SmartThings native sensors work great so far (motion, open/close, etc.), but Arlo cameras are disappointing. I also have an Arlo Q setup with Arlo's Continuous Video Recording plan and have the same issues on the app and website for live streaming. It just stops and closes the app/website. Accessing the history form the continuous video recording feed is a pain, slow and it doesn't always record. I tried using the Arlo Q for baby monitoring, but because the app/website can't sustain live streaming for more than a few minutes, I gave up and bought a Nest Cam. Totally different experience, the Nest's live streaming is real-time (Arlo's has at least a 3 second delay) and it's totally seamless to rewind/fast-forward on the Nest app or website. Nest also has a live streaming URL that you can share with anyone. The downside is that Nest charges you the subscription if you want to record anything in the cloud (Arlo's advantage is the wireless factor and the free recording to the cloud when a camera captures motion/sound). The quality of the image in all Arlos is great, the app is great, the website live feed is great (despite the 3 second delay). But the system itself is not reliable. So if you're looking for occasional peeking, not continuous live streaming, and a reliable security video system, this is not the right option. Although I'm fully committed to Arlo by now with the current investment, I'm looking for wireless, battery-powered cameras that I could use to replace Arlo Pro because I can't really put up a 6ft ladder every 3 days to take the cameras down, recharge and put them back up. The whole point of wireless was because I didn't want to run the wires through tough spots, but convenience backfired on my case. If anyone knows of better alternatives to the Arlo wireless cameras, please let me know!","Not a reliable security system, battery doesn't last"

The Arlo Pro is a new and improved version of the original Arlo System. It is 100% Wire-Free as the cameras run on battery power and communicate wirelessly to the included Base Station. The base station must be wired directly to your router but connects wirelessly to the cameras. The base station supports up to 5 cameras and has a built-in 100db siren. The Arlo Pro system isn't perfect but it works really well and I would recommend it to to someone who can't run wires for a more traditional security camera system. Pros: 100% Wireless Cameras Super Easy Setup Lots of options and settings Weather Resistant Cons: Highly compressed HD video. (Not always clear) Batteries only last 3-6 months and even less at Best Video Quality Limited to 5 cameras total Recordings are limited to 2 minutes,Great wireless camera solution but not perfect

Main issues: 1) motion detection is slow by quite a few seconds missing important footage (even with latest firmware), 2) I set it to continuously record yet most of my clips are only 16, 18, 21 seconds long. It stops recording when there is activity going on and doesn't even start recording again missing important details, 3) arlo.netgear.com is flash only...its 2017!! this needs to be updated to HTML5 ASAP!! Real world battery life TBD. Again, great concept, but poor performance. Adding: 4) the battery only lasts a couple days in a high traffic area and, 5) they don't even provide you with a weatherproof usb cable for continuous charging! Adding: 6) image quality is not HD. 7) recordings some times are distorted and have artifacts, 8) one of my cameras appears to have died just at the 30 day mark. Looks like I will be returning this junk and trying Nest. Adding: 9) One thing I noticed is that when the lens got wet, it would take hours for it to dry to be able to see. The nest some how can see through a rainstorm. Is the Arlo missing some protective coating or something?","Junk JUNK JUNK!!! Great concept, poor performance"
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Feb 2017,Really!?!,"So close but yet so far from being the right choice. I bought this unit because we didn't want wires running down our tree where we could set it up. Finally we found Arlo. It seems like the right solution and it is but not without its own issues. I wish I could have given this a 2.5 star rating. Hooking up the unit to the existing wifi turned out to be a giant issue which took me hours. I couldn't get the camera to work even though it was hooked up to the base station. In comes Netgear support. By the time I was done with them, they had ""joined"" my computer, went through my internet settings and told me that I had unwanted users on my network which is the reason why the secure camera won't work. Then they wanted close to $400 to fix the issue. Ah... No. There were no unwanted users on my network. But just in case and considering Netgear was on my computer, I decided to reset my router and change the password. Once I did that here's what I did: Syncing to Wifi: Reset Router and only connected my personal Macbook Pro laptop. Reset and synced the Arlo Base Station and Camera - VIOLA!! It worked. Proceeded to reconnect all other devices one by one and Arlo stayed connected. Installing the camera: Installation was a breeze. I have it hanging from a tree in the front of my house. The downside is access, which I need a ladder to get to. It comes with a half round metal adapter that the Arlo Pro camera connects to either on top of the camera for ceiling mount or on the back for wall mount. The camera has a very strong magnetic for the mount which is great. Picture quality: There are 3 settings. Even on the ""lowest quality"" setting that's suppose to save battery life, it's not bad. Battery Life:*UPDATE Here's the downside. Arlo Pro has its own battery, meaning this unit is not powered by off the shelf batteries. I live in a high traffic area, which is a HUGE issue with Arlo's battery. The battery comes fully charged and after installing it lasted about 5 days. Now, I have to recharge it daily. It takes 1 hour to charge, but that isn't enough to adequately charge it. Netgear offers individual batteries, but here's the catch - a battery charger is not available as of this posting.  This means that I must climb a ladder daily to recharge. *UPDATE - I have a ""workaround"" for the battery life. Since my camera is up in a tree which I need a ladder to access it, I hooked up the USB cord and let it rest on the limb. When I need to charge, I hook up the plug and run an extension cord to it. I let it charge for a few hours and now my camera has power for about 3 to 4 days. Software Interface: Everything is cloud base, which I like for the most part. Getting to the camera settings to adjust length of recording and picture quality is a bit confusing the first few times simply because it doesn't feel intuitive. But once you figure it out, it's fine. Recording: Here's another issue. Length of recording and sensitivity of the camera to start recording. The default length is :10 seconds. You can change this up to 2 minutes. Once that time length is reached, the recording stops, even if there's still movement going on. I've had a few times where I wanted to see what was happening past the end. I need to do a little more trial and error for best results. Recording Storage: Netgear has a free, 1gb, 7 day storage. You can view your library online and download the videos you want to keep. There are other option to keep the storage longer and more storage space. There is an USB option, which I haven't tried yet which allows me to backup my videos in real time as they're being recorded on Netgears cloud servers. Reviewing the videos is easy on your Arlo interface. Infrared at night: Works great with a clear picture. Will I keep it? Yes. Could it be better? Yes. Pros: Nice look. Good picture and decent sound quality Storage of videos and review process USB backup of videos in real time. Get's the job done Cons: Not completely plug and play Cloud based interface of camera settings not intuitive Battery life for high traffic area is 1 day Battery replacement is horrendous No external battery charger for extra battery available yet. *UPDATE - The way it records is an issue. You can only choose blocks of time to record from :05 seconds to 2:00 minutes. Because the camera is motion or sound sensitive it chooses when something is moving. But it won't start recording again immediately after it stops recording even if something is moving. Also there's no way of recording constantly such as a few frames every :05 seconds.","It has all the right parts, but it's not quite there - yet."
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2017,Kevin Duffey,"Having tried several different types of cameras over the years, the Arlo Pro system has just about everything you need for a security camera, especially when you factor in the free 7 days of cloud storage as well as the ability to record to a local USB thumb drive. I say just about because the one issue as many have pointed out is in high traffic areas, the battery will run down pretty quickly... though I have not personally tested this. To circumvent this, specifically as an outdoors camera, I feel that every Arlo Pro camera should make use of an external power source to keep the battery always charged. I opted for the somewhat expensive but hopefully reliable solar panels that run about $70 each. If mounted along side the camera (and at a distance high enough up or hard enough to get to to avoid someone unplugging it and/or taking them), assuming you get a bit of sun from time to time, the camera should not require a hard wired power source. I can not however back up that claim in areas that rain a lot or have a lot of cloud cover.. as I have read that that will result in the solar chargers barely putting out much juice. That said, lets hope most owners have a little bit of sunlight at least once every few weeks so that the charger can replenish the battery on the camera enough to keep it going continuously. The other thing, which many reviews have indicated is the magnetic mount that the camera comes with leaves a bit of doubt as to someone pulling the camera off of it and taking it. If the camera is mounted high enough, it will be less of a problem, but even so, as strong as the magnet is, I still have my doubts if it will withstand strong windy gusts.. or someone trying to hit it with a ball to knock it down. Therefore, the screw in mount seems like the option that should come with every camera, and given they are an additional $15 or so, and the price of these cameras, I would suggest buying them (and possibly the Arlo cameras coming with them in the future). The quality of video is fantastic, even with a 2 to 3 second lag. The Wifi range is pretty good from what I can tell. I havent had it long enough to determine if there are a lot of false triggers, but Arlo just announced a new AI that will supposedly figure out humans, animals and vehicles that should reduce that... though I am hoping it is not an extra cost to take advantage of that on a monthly basis... hoping its a firmware/software update that doesnt cost anything.",Fantastic Camera for Security

The ""CHAT"" icon in the web-based program just takes you to an open window with the word ""CHAT"" in it. You think that someone will soon log on to speak with you but my advice is don't wait too long because nothing is going to happen. In light of this, I called several times and was .... best case ..... 5 in the queue. When it took 20 minutes to become #4, I figure it best to call at night. I call this morning at 3:00 AM and was #3 in the queue. It was 1 hr and 10 minutes before the agent picked up. Very nice gentlemen but wasn't really trained with working knowledge of the system. All he could offer was the same troubleshooting steps that I could get on the website. I have 7 cameras on my system... all configured the same. One of them is not responding to motion at any sensitivity at any range. The only way I can get it to record is a manual trigger. You would think that just shear logic would tell you that it's a malfunctioning piece of equipment but yet the agent put me through the painful process of the troubleshooting steps that got us nowhere. One step was a complete wipe and re-configuration of the entire setup. Frustrating to say the least but it got me to the next step which is an email telling me that my situation was being elevated to the next step and that I'd be hearing from an ""expert"" in the near future. I can't wait to waste more time talking to him about this. Now let's talk about design- in theory B+ - in reality C-. It's a completely wireless system which is every enthusiasts dream..... but.... the battery depletes over time and the higher demand and desired functions selected, that time decreases exponentially. So you want high resolution at maximum sensitivity and all the notifications etc.... be prepared to charge those batteries quite a bit. Is that a big deal you ask.... take the time to situate your cameras exactly how you want them and then you can write your own review about the goat rope you just went through. The exterior mounts are pure garbage. Just when you have the camera set exactly the way you want.... you torque down on the set feature and the whole camera begins to turn so now you have to calculate how much your camera is going to move as you set the torque so they both end up where you want when the torque finally sets. Do this while you're on a ladder overlooking your driveway or your front door. Play a little circus music in the background too. It's fun. The interior mounts don't trail too far behind. Magnetic- easy/peasy but the person that designed these must have slept through Physics 101. They are round and mount to the wall similar to a picture frame. Put the screw in, find the hole, and slide it down. If your camera is attached perfect to the centerline of the slide, you're in business.... but.... if you want to offset it to the right or the left, go find that circus music and start it again. Any deviation from the centerline of the mount causes the camera to tilt in the opposite direction... and other than putting a stop pin along side the mount, there is no way to stop this rotation unless you use glue. I elected not to use glue because this setup is going in the trash just like my last one did. Now let's talk features....I'm not even going to grade this because they are all a joke. They have this Arlo Smart feature - let's take at look at each one. Package detection - misleading. it doesn't detect packages, it detects the person delivering the package. You're not going to get a message that you have a package. I don't really need to activate this feature because the system already inherently does that. You can, however, manually log into that camera to see if that motion alarm was in fact a package delivery or just simply stream the camera video live and see for yourself. E911 - will call the 911 region where your system is based. A nice feature but I can also call the police station directly from my phone speed dial. Ill give them this one though. It has its merits. Activity Zones - complete nonsense. Unless your surveilling a parking lot you don't need zones. When you actually set these up and try to use them, you're going to realize that in most rooms, theres no way to avoid stepping into a zone (or avoiding one) you set up. If your rooms are that big where you need to set up zones..... you'll have the resources to buy a much better system than this and not be the one fussing with it. Then let's get to the cherry on the cake. If you keep your system to 5 cameras or less, you get free iCloud recording for 7 days. Wow.... generous....thats enough storage to go on vacation and come back to overwrite the burglars that broke into your house 6 days ago. You can buy a hard drive and attach it to avoid this and I highly recommend it. You're going to love this system so much that you going to want to go out and buy another camera. Well, congrats! You just became a premium member because your free service ends at 5 cameras. All the hard disk space in the world isn't going to get you out of paying this fee. Well, alas..... Im stuck because I bought all this garbage at just under a cool G spot and now I have to wait until it to finds its place in the eternal landscape at the county grounds. Would I make this mistake again? NO FREAKING WAY! It is easy to set up and start using. I liked that. I hope everything works. If not, return it for another. You'll get a quicker turn on a functioning product. Edit added 12/09/18 I just went through the painful process of convincing Arlo that the camera was defective. Unbelievably ridiculous! To add to the frustration, 12 days after I signed up for Premium Service they emailed me an offer for 4 months free. I contacted Customer Service in the same painful manner and they denied extending me the offer stating that I was a previous customer and the offer didn't apply. I signed up 12 days ago. This will be the last Netgear product I will ever purchase. They have no concept of customer service. Very disappointed I invested in this nonsense.",Think Again - WAY overpriced and absolutely the worst Product Support in the business.
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jun 2017,NY person,"This product is a very good concept, but the execution of the software is terrible, and compounding this is that it's been this way for a long time. The hardware itself is decent, as the camera works well and works the way it's supposed to.  Video quality is good.  Motion detection seems to work pretty well too.  However, it's the software that enables this system to work as a security device, and it's horrible.  The app takes a very long time to log in, and over time it's actually gotten worse.  It used to be that only logging in was slow, but now it often hangs when I'm trying to access the mode screen to change modes.  When a video is sent via email, the link to view the video does not work--you have to go into the app itself. The geofencing feature would be a very cool feature--if it worked.  It had been in beta for a long time, but even after beta ended, it still doesn't work properly--worse even.  The geofencing no longer properly detects when you are at home or away, and can randomly just go on away mode when you're in the house.  Of course it will then start taking videos of you and emailing them to you, which you might not realize until 20 emails later. In short, this system is infuriating.  Taking a long time log in might not seem like a big deal in concept, but keep in mind you are often trying to configure this thing on the run, on your way out, etc.  And if you use this as a security system, imagine getting an unexpected notification that your cameras have detected motion at home--then not being able to access the video to see what's going on (fire?  burglar?). Since this system is fairly innovative, I would give them a free pass for initial buggy systems if they eventually fixed them.  Or if they were continually adding more and more cool features, thus giving them an excuse for breaking other aspects of the software.  Unfortunately, the bugs that existed are still unfixed, new ones are being introduced, and there doesn't seem to be any expansion of functionality (although this Arlo pro camera, is new). I bought this along with a 2 camera set around the same time.  Now, I'm regretting it and afraid to expand to more cameras given Arlo's inexplicable inability to fix anything.  Try looking up some of the issues you experience, and you'll see them being discussed in forums years ago.  What kind of company ignores these basic functionality defects?",Very bad software and app offsets decent hardware

Smith,"10/31/2017 Update:  Down to 1 star for continuing to waste my time and I still do not have a working base station.  I have received a call and several emails promising that while the company's normal policy is that customers must pay packing and postage to return defective products during the warranty period, they will waive that policy.  I have been repeatedly promised a prepaid label, but have never received it.  Instead, I receive similar emails telling me to fill out a standard form in which I have to choose whether to pay for shipping up front or pay my own postage. 10/20/2017 Update:  Decreased stars from 3 to 2.  1 year warranty requires customer to pay to ship defective product back and then wait for replacement.  I appreciate the response from the company to this review; however, customer service remains very difficult.  The ""experts"" just don't have an appropriate script to follow.  The new one I talked to -- who was much more helpful than the first one -- did not seem to know the process and put me on hold several times, only to come back with more questions.  In total I was on the phone for about 40 minutes and was told it would take another 20 minutes to finish.  I said I did not have the time and I was told I could hang up an the process would finish without me.  As to the ""expert"" trying to help me with a base station that would not turn on, sometimes the questions related to the camera, the internet connection, etc -- even though the only issue was that the base station would not turn on.  When she finally agreed to replace my unit, she sent me an email to confirm.  For the first time the email noted that I, the customer that received a defective unit, would have to (a) pay shipping to return the unit and (b) package the unit up in my own packaging.  Other, more customer friendly companies, send you prepaid packaging to return defective products. Original:  The camera is fantastic -- the base station has a problem and customer service is a disaster.  The camera has a great picture and the battery lasted 5 months before charging.  Oddly, the battery showed that it was low about 3 months in but I just left it on and it has not run out yet.  The problem is the base station and customer service.  The base station stopped powering on.  From reviewing various help forums this seems to be a common problem.  I am in the U.S. but Netgear/Arlo seems to claim this is only an int'l issue.  I did all of the things suggested on the website support and nothing worked.  So I called customer service.  The representative (euphemistically called an ""expert"") had no idea what she was talking about.  She fundamentally did not understand that there was a difference between the camera and the base station.  She repeatedly asked me the exact same question and kept putting me on hold, coming back and asking the same questions again.  She asked me for a serial number 3 separate times.  When I asked to speak to someone else, she merely kept reading a script that appeared to be for a different product than mine.  My base station is still not working.","Failed base station, incompetent customer service, warranty of limited use."

My battery lasted just over a year before it stopped accepting a charge.  This is not uncommon and many others report much shorter life spans for the battery.  The replacement battery is $48.

However, one camera stopped working, and after charging both batteries, it was evident that one of the cameras was defective. Both batteries worked in the second camera. I called tech support. First, it was difficult to understand the technician's English. Second, the background noise of other technicians was very loud, making it challenging to hear the technician's words. After being on the phone for more than an hour, trying this and that, the technician first told me that my network was infected and I needed to purchase either a one/two/year plan. I opted for the $99 one year plan (not fully understanding what it was I was purchasing, and I get that was foolish of me).  After next paying that sum, the technician determined that the camera was indeed defective, and that I was eligible for a replacement.  He forwarded me to ""hardware"" support and asked that I charge both batteries and call back his number. I spoke with hardware support, gave all the details to receive an RMA order, and then called back technical support. This time I got a different technician.  I gave him my CASE #, and I was told the problem was the battery.  I do not want to bore everyone with the details, but suffice it to say, after waiting online and then speaking to a supervisor, it was agreed that the problem was the camera. The email with the RMA that I completed was poorly connected.  I will shipo out the defective camera to TN. Who knows if and when I will get a replacement. Terrible, disconnected, misleading service.

Installing them into place is really simple. However getting the cameras to pair with the hub was a challenge. Both sets would have a period of time where it didnt wanna connect(if you follow the app prompts) it would just simply sit there giving no indication on what the hell it was doing. So skip the steps on the app for pairing just hold the sync button on the hub then once that gives the wink do the same with the camera and......money!! Once that headaches over, then you have to wait for the cameras to update ( cameras do nothing this entire time) seriously wtf cameras have to update out the box for. Anyway the cameras have never had to update since initial setup. However the app seems like it needs updating every couple days. Also I might add that once the cameras are updated which in my case it didnt really notify me it was done, you will need to log out of the account and log back in. I learned alot of these little quirks on the fly. Im for the most part tech savy. I would not recommend having tech challenged people set this up, go get someone with a PHD to fire this up for you. Lol Once all that is completely out of the way the camera views are wide angle, night vision works very well. You really need to consider position where you put the cameras. Motion is picked up from the sides of the cameras. So for example dont put a camera at an opposite wall facing a door, the camera may or may not pick it up in time. The cameras have maybe a 10-15 sec delay, its not instant. So when I use the live feature and try to speak through the camera the response from the other end takes a few. Having a few houses hooked up is a breeze to manage from 1 account. I set up 2 diff accounts, 1 for each house then just invited 1 to the other. I have all the cameras in 1 laundry list to choose from. I can arm 1 full time and geo arm the other for when my family leaves the house. Battery life is very good. I havent charged 1 set for about 3 months so far, even with curious birds flapping at them to see what it is. Even bees will set these dudes off until you adjust the sensitivity. That being said final thought, its an awesome package that doesnt require a monthly service. It will not notify authorities but there are other features you can purchase for monthly service they may include this feature, what I use it for works for me ( the volume of the alarm will definitely hurry along intruders). Battery life is superb, its wireless doesnt use much internet usage, or even require incredibly fast speeds. The app is extremely user friendly and easy to check cameras or arm or just mess with family when your bored at work. I hated the setup both times, I would rather jump in the ring with a professional fighter for the length of time it took to set these dudes up. I appologize for the lengthy review hopefully it helps clearify a few things, now go have a cold 1 before you engage in the purchase.",Awesome once its running.

I also purchased solar panels to help with the time I would need to climb up there to recharge the batteries. Early this year, I noticed some of the cameras (then all of them) stopped working, because they were disconnected from the hub. I called customer service and they weren’t helpful at all. Basically the response was, reconnect them, without actually addressing why they disconnected in the first place. They all got reconnected but I noticed they had much less range for some reason. They only picked up motion around 25%-30% of the time. Fairly recently, they stopped working all together. One disconnected again, while the others don’t pick up motion at all. I honestly can’t think of the last time I got a notification for motion. These cameras are great for the first year, but after that, they’re garbage.

There are constant connectivity issues even though the camera is close (line of sight) to the base station. The battery drain is also fairly quick.  There was also a recently introduced bug (after a firmware update) where the highly crucial (at least for me) Push-to-Talk feature no longer works.  When you connect to ""talk"" through the camera's speaker, the camera's microphone is permanently shut off (even after you stop holding the talk button), so there is no way to have a two-way conversation, for example with a delivery person at your door, etc.  This feature used to work fine before the firmware update.  We contacted Arlo on their support website (where several other folks reported the same exact issue) but no response from Arlo, yet another reason for the low rating.

While the quality is okay when it works, and I like the free 7 days of recordings,  my home is in an area where there are occasional power outages. When the power comes back on, the base station fails to re-connect to the router 100 percent of the time, and thus I lose my security camera! Apparently, the problem is that my fiber modem/router takes about 60 seconds to boot up after the power comes back on, and the Arlo base station boots up much faster and thus never gets an IP address. It tries early, but then never again. Arlo troubleshooting  documents say ”router must be up and available before Arlo. To fix, reboot your base station.” Which, of course, is impossible when you are 6000 miles away. There’s nobody in my house to reboot the base station. This is totally lame design. I do not have this problem with the Arlo WiFi cameras, by the way. They all connect no matter what order router/camera is ready. This base station is thus not for serious security use in a home that you leave unoccupied for months at a time. Essentially it’s just a “security toy”.",Useless if installed in an area with occasional power outages

It was working fine at 9am. I go plug in a camera (cause the battery life is terrible) and a few minutes later I notice all cameras have no connection.  I look and they are all powered off and the base unit has no connectivity! All other internet devices are still working in the house.  I will be returning this system if an immediate fix is not identified. New Edit: What trash! I set this up on Aug 9th. It is now Aug 30th and after having to charge all of the cameras at least once, one of them is completely dead. It just stopped working a couple days after being fully charged. It wont even turn on, and does nothing when connected to a power cord. What total trash this system is now! Excellent sound, decent video, poor motion detection.  It barely detects 15 feet in front of a camera. The outdoor cameras randomly get some sort of light flare and record the motion, and miss actual motion such as a car driving by. The delay on recording when there is motion is a little sad. The Pro 2 has fixed this however a software update could probably do the same for these. The app is a little difficult to navigate at times. I got this on a ""Deal of the Day"" for $550 for the 5 camera system so price wise it is not bad. The motion detection leaves a lot to be desired.  The sound quality is excellent.  It picks up a lot and very clearly. The video quality is ok, zooming in is almost a worthless feature as it gets incredibly grainy at the slightest zoom.  It is designed for outdoor use but only comes with 1 mount for outside? Had to buy more to use outside if you dont want to use the magnet mounts that are 10x easier to steal the camera off of.","Poor motion detection,  good video, great sound"

Espinoza,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. September 26th 2018 Update: So as I mentioned in my original review (you can scroll down to read it), I mentioned how that was just a temporary review. That I would return to write a full review. Well here I am. Now, my original review, is still very accurate. I've just now have had this product for just a tad bit over a month. I'm still loving this system. In the month I've had this, I had a couple of hiccups. Mainly they were just two times when the camera wasn't connecting to the Arlo Base. I'm not sure why exactly. The first time was most likely because the base station was a little far and kind of out of view, but that original spot was never meant to be a permanent area for it. I was going to move the Arlo base station to the kitchen, on top of the cabinets. Which basically puts it central to our apartment, in terms of location. That increased the signal nicely, but the second time the camera was having an issue connecting to the base, I'm not exactly sure why. But all I did to fix it was to resync the camera to the base and it worked fine. I can manually record a live stream just fine. I can snap a photo just fine. I'm able to download videos to my device just fine. I'm able to access the camera from my desktop just fine. Mind you, I still have the original set up for the camera. Which is i used gorilla tape that can hold up to 30 pounds to the wall frame just adjacent to my apartment door, which is aluminum. I used the magnetic knob that comes with the arlo camera system so that I can easily remove the camera so that I can charge it when it needs to be charged. Now that brings me to the battery usage. I'm not really in a high traffic area, i think. I live on the fifth floor in a Queens NYC apartment building. I have one neighbor that lives adjacent to our apartment. So the camera faces away from our door towards the stairwell. So obviously it would catch recordings when they enter and leave their apartment, when i and my husband enter and leave the apartment and if anyone uses the stairwell which really isnt all that much. So in the month i've had this camera, it caught a lot of us and our neighbors entering and exiting our apartments. I'm not sure if thats really a whole lot, but the cameras battery only lasted a month. The setting i had it on was prioritize the battery and pretty much record in low quality. The quality recorded looked like dvd quality so i was happy with that. As long as i can see faces, i'm good, so i was happy with the setting i chose because i wanted to prioritize the battery life. Even choosing that setting, the battery did not last the 6 months it was advertised as on the website. Now, is this an issue? Personally no, because the last security camera i had wouldn't even give me 3 weeks, let alone a full month. Would I have liked a full 6 months out of the battery? sure! Will others have issues with the battery life? most likely. I dont have a setup where i could leave the camera plugged into an outlet, so i have to remove the camera each time i need to charge the battery. Since i'm in an apt, it's not a big issue for me personally. Also, if your gonna charge the battery and remove it from whatever setup you have, your gonna have to go into the settings and literally turn off the camera before starting your charging. since if it remains on, it'll take forever and a year to really charge. So make a note, turn off the camera and charge it up! Thats all I've used the camera for really. Just to monitor who's in front of our apt. It's worked just fine so far. I really do recommend this for apartment dwellers. I know that my sister who owns a home on Long Island has a 5 camera system and she has had no issues either with her setup. But if you feel you need that extra layer of security, I highly recommend this one camera system. Don't bother leveling up the paid services. I still use the free 7 day cloud service. It records to the cloud easily, and as long as i can review the videos within the 7 day period, I'm good to go. Remember, you can also connect a portable hard drive to the back of the arlo base to keep all the videos your camera records, so if you have like a small portable 1 terabyte harddrive connected to it, you really would't need to pay for any subscription service. This really is recommended for apartment dwellers, my suggestion. if you live in a home and depending on the setup, you may need to pay for some sort of service, but I sure dont and am happy with the free cloud service and the great option to plug in my own external drive to save all the videos. I think thats all for me now. If i see i need to make another update, i will. Original review August 24th 2018 below: The reason for my headline is because i've only had this product for about a day now. I just wanted to let you all know how this product is doing after just the first day. The setup was extremely simple. Unbox everything, connect the base station to your router via ethernet cable in a central location to where you will be placing your cameras, connect the power adaptor to the base station, install rechargeable battery into the camera (battery is already pre-charged for you before it leaves the factory), wait till you see the two left green lights on the base station, install the arlo app onto your mobile device, hit sync on the base station and arlo camera, and after a couple of updates, one for the station, and one for the cameras...your all set! this process took about 10 minutes or less. now, my personal reason for buying this one camera system is because i live in new york city and obviously i rent an apartment. i've had some issues with people leaving trash in front of my apartment door, and stealing my doormat. so i went around looking for a camera system that could work well with someone like me who lives in an apartment. a rental no less. i did find one other camera but due to an upgrade in software, it rendered it useless, so i had to return it for a refund. so i was on the search for something else i can use. this arlo pro camera system beat out a lot of the security cameras out there that pretty much are more for homes then apartments. i say this because the other cameras out there require a hardwire line to power said camera. since i live in a rental apartment, i can't go drilling holes in the door or wall. so i needed something that worked via a rechargeable battery that i can pull out and charge away from the camera. this particular setup comes with a magnetic base where the camera can attach to easily. now the base is why i chose this particular security camera, you can either install the base to the wall via screws, which i can't cuz i'd be damaging my rental...OR if you use heavy duty gorilla double sided tape that can hold items that are at least 6 pounds or greater on the wall, you can use the gorilla tape to attach the magnetic small base to the wall and than attach the camera. this was a huge game changer with security camera's available that can do those. like i said, most need to be wired, while just a select few of other cameras just need a magnetic base, but dont come with the same features like what arlo packs in. so now we're here with my setup, and once again i'll update this fully after i've installed it exactly where i wanted to. because i'm still waiting on my gorilla tape to arrive so i haven't as of yet attached it to the outside door frame of my apartment. but what i did learn is that i can have the camera pretty far from the base station. according to the manual, each camera you sync can not be more than 300 feet away from the base station, otherwise it wont connect. which means no feed cuz its too far from the base station. my apartment has a pretty crappy issue with wifi, but this base station allowed me to place the arlo pro camera two rooms away from it and still get a great feed! mind you i live in a two bedroom apartment with the base station in the living room which is the room closest to the apartment door but furthers from the other two bedrooms. i was very pleased with the connectivity it was able to reach. so basically, the cameras only connect to the arlo base station, NOT to your home wifi, thats why arlo has you connect the base station to your router wired. so if your router is too far from where you'd need to place the base station, i suggest getting a long ethernet cable so you can place the base station in a central location with ease. now since my setup isn't complete, i did leave the arlo pro camera in my living room on a shelf just so i can test the notifications i get and live feed and the event history of videos that are stored. i haven't subscribed to any of the paid tiers available, heres why. according to arlo, the free cloud service is probably fine for someone like me who lives in an apartment. it stores videos it's recorded to the cloud for the last 7 days, which is about 1 gig of storage your allotted to have free. that amount of storage is completely fine, because as it stated, i'm allowed to download any of the videos its recorded over the course of 7 days, i can share said videos to anyone as well. BUT there's another bonus for those who dont upgrade to the paid tiers, you can attach to the base station any usb external drive and tell arlo to write to the external drive you connect! i haven't had a chance to test it out, but i will do so this weekend by first simply connecting a 16GB usb stick. in the settings you have the option to allow all the videos to be recorded onto the usb stick and after it fills up, you can choose to have the base station start overwriting from the oldest video. i'll write more on this after i've had a chance to really test it out. but that feature kind of makes some of the paid tier levels moot. especially for us apartment dwellers. i mean sure some of the paid levels have some features like smart notifications and emergency 911, but with the free level, if you see someone trying to break in, you can hit the alarm which will sound a 100 decibal alarm, which i hear is very loud. may make the robbers back away, but could potentially give you enough time to call 911 on your own. of course for the camera features, there's a two way mic, so you can talk to the person on the other side. the only downside is that once you start speaking, you need to quickly toggle off the button so you can hear the other person talking....at least thats how it is on my testing. like i said i haven't been able to really test this fully. so when i make a new review i'll be sure to let you all know. i did learn that the motion sensors work the best when they pick up motion on the periphery of the sensors. rather then being activated as someone is coming head on to the camera, they work best if they see motion come from the sides of the camera. thats something i noticed that i'm sure will help some of you properly set up the camera. all in all, i'm getting the notifications nicely and so far no issues, but i'll definitely update this down the road with more details!",Updated Review for NYC apartment dwellers! 9/26/18

Over 90% of the time is due to the wind, a wandering cat, or a bug passing through the camera. The remaining time is when the postal worker arrives, a neighbor knocks on your door, or some suspicious. Given this, customers should not be required to review the Arlo App every time we get 10+ emails. We should be able to open our emails, quickly review and delete when appropriate. Unfortunately, Arlo has stripped this functionality and I caution all new users.",Changes in July 2020 brought down to 1 star

For example, the Q series cameras cannot connect to the base and trigger the alarm. They are set up using the same app, but you cannot just connect them. The Arlo forum says they are ""expanding the functionality"". Them the alarm scheduling only schedules start and end dates over the same day, so there is no way to schedule an alarm over midnight! The response in the Arlo forum is ludicrous. Don't be fooled by nice looks, the software quality is below cheap Chinese equivalents. Also, beware that besides some cameras, with horrendous limitations, there are no other options in peripherals, there is no door/window open sensors and such. All in all, no reason to buy.",Very disappointing bare bones software

The Arlo cameras work great. This one, however came with a completely dead battery. It did charge fast, but it now has half the battery life left as the other cameras that were installed 3 weeks earlier. Update: As I feared, the battery that arrived dead IS a bad battery. As I mentioned, I bought this add on camera 3 weeks after installing he rest of the system that came with 4 cameras. While 2 of the original cameras have never been charged, I’ve had to charge this camera 3 times. I fully understand that battery life may depend on how often the camera is activated, but I have 2 other cameras that get activated far more than this one, and I’ve only charged the other 2 one time each. I called Arlo customer support, and it was horrific. First, try to find their number on their website. Talk about hidden! Finally found it and called. I could barely understand the person I was talking to. She had to repeat every sentence 2 or 3 times due to a heavy accent. Finally she told me I had to change the battery setting from “optimized” to “best battery life” and if that made the battery last longer than problem solved. Of course it will make the battery last longer, but at the expense of camera quality, and by the way, it is currently set up the same way as my other 4 cameras and they don’t die like this one does! I was getting nowhere, and requesting a supervisor resulted in there were none available. There was no way Arlo was going to stand behind their product. I called Amazon support and thanks to their phenomenal support, they agreed to let me return it. Besides this glitch, I like my Arlo camera system. If I had known they do not stand behind their product, however, I would have chosen a different system.",Battery seems to be bad - update: the battery IS bad
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2018,Anon,"I purchased the Arlo Pro 5 camera system on Dec 22 2017 and requested a refund on 1/12/2018. Before trying the Arlo Pro system, I also tried out the Ring security system and the Lorextechnology.com / FLIR security system. Out of the three systems I would have to say that the Arlo Pro system was by far the worst.  Was it a surveillance system, yeah sure, but was it a security system, I would say no. In addition to purchasing the 5-camera system, I also bought 3 NETGEAR solar panels, multiple camouflage and ghillie suit skins, different length charging / connection cords and an array of different styles / angles camera mounts. I have to say that look and feel of the cameras were nice, I loved the sleek aesthetic design and I really enjoyed the strong magnet on the back of the cameras, you could easily put it on anything metal and it stayed firmly.  I also loved the ability to run anything wirelessly, wired, or through solar panels. ½ of the extra items I bought were through Wasserstein or something of that sort.  A lot of these extras were not compatible with the cameras such as extended micro USB cords, which was completely asinine, even though they were the same exact model and fit, the camera app said not compatible because it wasn’t a NETGEAR cord. My favorite feature of the entire system was the ability to trigger an audible alarm by the housing station. It was also incredibly easy to set up and link the cameras, only one camera gave me constant problems with being able to do a firmware update.  Arlo Pro was also great because they offered a 7 day free cloud recording service. 5 cameras were free and if you wanted to add more then 5, you had to pay. The phone app offered some great features that both Ring and Lorex did not such as geo-fencing, the ability to turn on and off the entire alarm system, scheduled alarm times,  but other then that the app was garbage. The app took way to long to both login and connect with the devices. If you wanted to view an immediate notification, it took at least 20 seconds before you were able to start live viewing if even at all. Now the phone app delay was just a minor issue compared to the delay of movement capturing by the camera. I spent around 15-20 hours, a few hours each day for a week comparing different angles, installing different mounts, and adjusting zones, and heights. There were a few instances such as the FEDEX guy or UPS guy delivering packages to my house, only one of the three cameras facing the front of the house captured the delivery and it was only the very tail end of a person walking out of my drive way. The only reason I knew it was a delivery guy was because the camera caught the tail end of the delivery FEDEX truck pulling in my driveway. There were also several instances of family members pulling in and out of the driveway or walking up to the front door, which either caught only a few seconds exiting the view of the camera or did not capture it at all. One of the cameras view a side of my house and partially shows my neighbor’s driveway, it is a vacation property, which is rarely ever used, and my neighbor has asked me to keep an eye on it for suspicious activity. He has a bi weekly lawn service which comes, the cameras did not even capture a huge landscaping truck with 4 guys working in the yard until one of them was leaf blowing about ½ in my yard … wtf. This is totally unacceptable as a security camera system and was the main reason I returned them… well because they don’t work. The night vision and IR lights on the camera are extremely terrible; it was basically pointless to even check notifications or live views on the camera at night. Every night for the week I went outside with my ladder to mess with different angles. The IR emitted such a strong reflection that it drowned out a lot of the images. The only way night vision was even somewhat effective was in an open view with no trees, walls, cars, or anything to reflect. Even while I was walking up to the cameras you could barely make out any distinguishing features to tell people apart. It was just a huge white blur, even worse, right on top of the camera; it looked as if you were a ghost.  If you wanted to look at multiple cameras at night time, you also better not have them pointed in the same facing direction because the night vision emitted an incredibly powerful white blur to the other cameras. The NETGEAR solar panels were also not very good, it never registered on the app as being connected unless there was an absolute direct sun light beaming on it, not even partially, as the batteries continued to lose percentage. If you live in a densely wooded property as I do, this could be a problem. Overall I felt this entire system was incredibly expensive for what it offered, it was basically a toy camera system. There was no practical application for the entire system unless you are happy with just viewing your property during the day from time to time. Notifications rarely prompted immediate viewing and capturing events rarely happened period.  Nighttime use was… useless. I would not recommend the Arlo Pro system to anyone. However even though I have gone through Ring and Lorex systems too, I cannot justify trying out the Nest system based on their absurd cloud recording fees. Ring has been the best experience I’ve had so far and they have reached out to me several times for a bad review / experience that I had with them.  Even though there was some technical oversight, I will be giving Ring another try as their entire system was overall much better. I took off one star for the expensive price, the 2nd star for the inability to properly detect motion, 3rd star for the useless night vision, and the 4th star for a terrible phone app and the ability to use third party accessories. There is a lot of potential and the idea of the system is great, but it should've never been released as is. It needs a ton of improvements for it to be worth the price they ask.","The Good, the Bad, and the UGLY!!! Basically a TOY camera system, Day time surveillance use only."

I was really hoping the camera would perform better given some of the stellar reviews online and the fact that the compact wireless camera appeared to fit our needs perfectly!!! While the camera design is sleek we were disappointed by performance right from the jump.  First off having a cumbersome base station was inconvenient to say the least! In addition, at first boot the firmware on both the camera and base station required updating and the camera was worthless for an hour as it could not re-connect to the base station.  This prevented any 'live' content feeds and prevented setup.  Once it was up and running there was no indication of poor connectivity, but the latency to record was ridiculous! I was able to take camera from proposed placement location and walk all the way through the house to bedroom prior to camera being able to initiate recording feature. This rendered the camera effectively useless! It could easily be taken from premises and miss any important content! I eventually returned it the same day. Never got a handle on battery life as the camera was not performing long enough before return. I will say the quality of the picture was as expected for a 720p.  We ended up with a nest outdoor and are much happier.",Great Design but performance was a painful disappointment!!!!
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Feb 2017,Grover517,"Intended use - Outside driveway/front entry monitor. Edit:  Fast forward about a year from original purchase and although the hardware review below remains basically the same, I have lowered my star rating from 2 to 1 solely based on the most recent direction Arlo has taken in regards to their smartphone apps functionality.  Arlo has basically let it's existing user base know that they view the Arlo system more as a ""baby monitor"" setup than a true security system by rolling out a software update that is so drastic of a change, it has cripiled a system that used to be pretty darn good.  The latest update is probably the most drastic and bug ridden user interfaces I personally have ever seen from ANY company and even in the face of thousands of critical reviews from their existing user base on their own community board, Arlo not only refuses to roll back the update but also is basically ignoring those same customers concerns.  Basically, Arlo has said, ""Take it or leave it"".  Critical info that used to be available ""at a glance"" now is buried within menus requiring a LOT more user interaction and time to find what you need.  Video streaming and playback used to be basically ""auto play"" but now requires multiple touches as well to play back and stop.  Notifications now are much slower, sometimes 15-20 minutes behind the detected activity and just configuring the system in general is much more difficult due to the shifting of numerous settings among different menus.  So if your plans are to depend on an Arlo system to either be your primary or a supplement to an existing security system, I can no longer recommend Arlo as a good choice. The setup was easy, and the optional wall/ceiling mount installation was as well.  I mounted the camera about 15 ft above the entry and have it pointing down at the front yard/driveway/front walkway to get as wide a view as possible.  It was also mounted that high to keep it from being stolen or otherwise tampered with.  And although the specs say it should work from that distance, it has major issues, at least in our setup. Upon first installation, the video/audio from the camera was impressive (first picture below) and was very encouraged that I had found my solution.  Motion detection at default settings were excellent and worked up to 30 ft away.  So much so, that I needed to turn down the sensitivity a bit to keep from getting a lot of false detections.  However, once it got dark I was extremely disappointed.  Although the motion detection still worked at the same distances, the IR illumination/low light performance of the camera in an outside setting was utterly useless. We live in a city with street lights, and one sits in front of our next door neighbor.  With just available light from that street light,  which is more than enough to see things on the ground in our yard and driveway, I got an all black picture.  I am reading online that the IR distance on these cameras are 20 ft +/- but I am not getting anywhere near that outside. Not until I climbed back up on the ladder and got within about 5 ft of the camera, did I see ANYTHING.  Since we also have a 100w front porch LED as well as a 300w motion sensing flood mounted approx. 10 ft. below the camera placement and when on, basically light up the entire front property to almost daylight proportions.  You would think that turning them on would help immensely, right?  Sadly, no.  With both the front porch light and floods on, I could barely make out a ghostly glow from those lights along the lower porch roofline.  (picture 2 below).  So even adding 400w of light to the area being monitored did basically nothing to improve the results. So in an attempt to troubleshoot, I took the camera down and placed it inside the house on a shelf at the end of a 15' hallway.  With the hallway lights on,  the picture was just the same as it was outside.  In color, clear, and more than acceptable.  When turned out all the lights to create a totally dark environment, the ""night vision"" functionality, to my surprise, had a decent, infrared, black and white picture.  If the hallway was twice that long, I expect I would have gotten much more than I ever got outside.  Had I gotten even close to these results outside, my rating would not be so low.  So why does it work so well inside and not outside?  Only Netgear can answer that and I have a trouble ticket in to find out.  Regardless, since this setup was purchased to be used in an outdoor setting,  the indoor results are irrevelent to me and at this point, is just not going to work in our environment. I have also read where one can add an IR emitter that is much stronger than what the camera has and should also help immensely, but I feel that why should I have to spend more money just to get this to work as it is advertised to. I have a trouble ticket open with Netgear and if anything changes, I will update with the results. Otherwise, if no update is seen, it means Netgear had no answers and I have returned the unit. 2 year update - system is still bug ridden beyond belief and Arlo support is worthless.  Month after month, issues new and old go unresolved with nothing more from support than ""We are working on it"".  The only reason my Arlo stuff isn't in the trash yet is I am not dishonest enough to sell it to anyone else.",Moving to something else

I bought the base station with two cameras back on May and it looked awesome. I decided to add on two more cameras at Amazon and bought the Arlo Q later on. The Arlo Q has been fenomena. The Arlo pro not so good. I purchased the extended warranty for the base but not for the extra cameras. Not buying the extended warranty for the add on cameras was a big mistake. The product works good when it works.  The problem is that the batteries only last like only 3-4 weeks,  and despite having a 150mbps internet connection and a signal booster the base station keep getting disconnected from the internet or the cameras disconnected form the base. A constant issue. The worst was the system won’t us know when it was disconnected. Our car was broken into over night. When we checked the video, the base was disconnected AGAIN! Since I bought the extended warranty for the Base with a local retailer I returned it one las time and got store credit. I had exanged the base twice before. Now I still have the two additional cameras collecting dust. A waist of $358.00, without including the tax.  If you are going to take the risk of buying this cameras I surest you to buy the extended warranty.","Great when it works, but it rarely does."

I live alone in a mobile home community my yard has only a 5 foot decorative wall which separates it from a fairly busy business parking lot and a major street beyond no other fencing. The homeless are using this area to congregate at night do to access to water, electricity and seclusion. The property owner is doing little to nothing to stop the situation and police have their hands tied with lack of owner support... My home and lot area are small about 2000sqft  with the 3 wi-fi camera system I have been able to cover over the fence into the parking lot, my most exposed backyard area, a portion of my neighbors backyard and over the fence adjacent to her lot, along with my large deck and front door I am considering a 4th camera to cover the long side and parking area of my property. I would say you have to have some knowledge of internet setup ie hardware connections and installing apps and web access which I do so it was very easy to plug in the Arlo main base, install the lithium batteries, and sync the cameras. Then download the app into my android phone, a tablet and desktop Note: one monitoring device overrides the other when in use not an issue for me.  You can give limited access to anyone to one or all of the cameras through separate email address and password logon you approve this is nice for my elderly neighbor who spotted the trespasser in my yard and now has access to one of the cameras  without leaving her house. Installation of the cameras only took a ladder, screwdriver, drill and the app on my cell phone to get a visual to where they were pointing! I am using the screw-on extended mount in all location (a way to lock the camera on would be beneficial) but so far so good. once installed and positioned I haven't touched the cameras since... After 7 days in the high traffic areas they're at 92% battery life I'm good with that! I don't want to climb a ladder to take them down to charge so with good reviews I purchased waterproof 20 ft charging cables you can plug into the cameras and stretch to a power source works for me! All in All so far I am very Satisfied with the Arlo Pro Camera system and the app that has a ton of adjustment features to how the cameras work for your situation! I would recommend this system to anyone! Oh and it was recommended to me by a friend already using it and a friend in law enforcement! If Arlo fixes the ability to lock the cameras to their bases and the Desktop Chrome and Adobe Flash player issue on Win7 (I have to use IE8 to see live video) and I would give it 5 stars",I Recommend the Arlo Pro system

It worked fine for a couple weeks and then it got glitchy and doesn't want to maintain connections with all of the cameras. I currently tried to have it work two cameras and they weren't even armed and they lost connection. One was no more than 30 foot away, others was maybe 80. Spending too much time checking if they are working! Not worth the money at all. Buy a real security system. After almost one year my review is worse. The batteries don't last 24 hours. I am using two cameras to keep charge in the house to supply the other 3 with batteries.  They take forever to connect and rarely have anything more than a shot of the tail of the vehicle.

The two of cameras, mounted on the outside window molding did very poorly.  These failed after about 7 months.  I used the standard charging cable with these two.  Failed meaning the batteries gave out then after removing the battery, they worked for a bit then completely failed.  The third camera, mounted outside but under cover, where the front door is offset 18 inches from the exterior, lasted about 9 months.

Worked straight out of the box. Monitors everywhere I need it to and feeds the video to my phone or tablet. It takes a little while to figure out the sensitivity settings for each camera and also which one's to have alert you (otherwise you will get ""pinged"" every 30 seconds!). Once you've figured out the settings over the first few days of use, it's a great system. The video quality is awesome. Provided you're willing to go and delete videos off the dashboard each week, there's no need to purchase the extra storage space from Netgear (I wish someone had warned ME of that!). The standard storage provided is more than adequate for most homes. If there's a video you want to keep - you can download it. Other than that - it's a great product. One other (creepy?) ""benefit"" is that if you have a camera indoors - you can watch what the family do in the house while you're out! Be sure to buy the recharging station that recharges 2 batteries at a time (link below). Arlo Pro Charging Station - Designed for Arlo Pro Wire-Free Cameras (VMA4400C) The batteries on my set up last about 8 weeks between charges. I've actually got them ""staggered"" so that I change 1 camera battery a week and then get a month off before the next cycle starts. I have read other reviews that state that the batteries don't last long enough. I can only presume that they must have their cameras in high traffic areas or they've got the sensitivity set too high - it's critical in reducing the number of false-positive camera activation's and/or battery depletion.. Arlo Pro Security System with Siren - 5 Rechargeable Wire-Free HD Cameras with Audio, Night Vision, White (VMS4530-100NAS) Update: 3 months on.... still working perfectly. I had to reduce the sensitivity on a couple of the cameras to stop ""false/positive"" recordings taking place when wind moved a bush in the picture. Apart from that, the original batteries are still 40% charged on 3 of the 5 cameras (the other 2 cameras were the one's which I adjusted the sensitivity on - because they kept recording). It alerts me every time that a delivery is made to the front door, and even alerted me when someone was snooping down the side of the house - so I called the sheriff. The perp had gone by the time they arrived, but I was able to download and show them a picture. He's a known local who burgles for money for his fix - so they went and had a ""chat"" with him. Already saved me money and proved invaluable.",Better than the standard video with the alarm company

They captured motion well, playback was pretty quick and the video quality was good. With each software update the video playback and getting ""live"" video takes a very, very long time. The current update is terrible with regards to video playback and ""live"" video. If the camera is in the middle of a motion capture you cannot bring up live video.  You have to wait until the camera has finished recording and saving it to their cloud, and depending how you adjust your settings it could take a very long time. I set my recording to 25 sec.  If I see that it's recording, I have to wait 25 sec. and whatever time it takes to save it to the cloud before I could even bring up a live video.  With the lastest update I've been waiting about 5 minutes to be able to either get a live feed or view the video that was recorded 5 minutes ago.  In that time, if there is something going on, it would have passed and it would be too late to do anything. Also, for some reason, it seems the camera is constantly recording or doing something that it's draining the battery very quickly.  For one of my cameras, which is also connected to a solar panel and I've been using for over a year, I wouldn't need to change the battery for a month to six weeks.  Now (August 11, 2020), I've had to change the battery every week.  That means EVERY WEEK I have to climb a ladder to replace the battery. WHAT THE HECK, ARLO?!

I wish there was a bit more control over the motion sensitivity. The wired cameras apparently allow you to create a ""frame"" within the image and the frame becomes the target for motion detection. It would be handy to have something like that for the wireless cameras as well. When in night vision mode their range becomes much more limited, but that's understandable. All in all, quite pleased. Updated 5/11/18 - I checked my Arlo cameras remotely to discover that half of them were nonfunctional and required a firmware update.  I attempted the update several times remotely just to receive an error.  I finally unplugged and replugged the Arlo hub and retried the update and it worked.

I wanted a system that had two-way communications, was battery operated, had wifi capability, easy to install and not have to pay huge fees for a cloud backup system. After ready MANY different reviews independently from, and on, Amazon I settle for the Arlo Pro with Siren. I installed a Netgear Orbi mesh router a few months ago and also wanted a surveillance system that would integrate well with my Orbi and ISP without picture lag. I was set up and running in 30 minutes which included mounting the camera outside. The Basic cloud system gives you 10 seconds on each video for a 7-day span. The videos are downloadable. If you set up to receive notifications via email, expect to receive many emails so set up an email rule to drop them in its own email folder. I haven't touched the Arlo much since installation a few weeks ago, so I could be wrong here, but this is what need works: I have the geofencing enabled, but when I'm home I still receive notifications every time I walk into and out the house such as when I go walk the dog; would love to have the ability to create visual notification zones (like how Ring does) and better integration for app notifications (other than hearing a sound on my tablet or phone I haven't seen any way for the app to provide a visual on-screen notification like Canary does.) What works well: Night vision (the user has the ability to lighten/darken the screen); screen resolution; camera battery life; and setting up. Could be better: other than what I already mentioned about zoning and geofencing, the lag for picking up video is okay but would like it to pick up video quicker as someone is approaching the door (I stated that with the Basic cloud service, you only get a 10-second video - most people have rung the bell and are already walking away by the time the video captured it.) I would love if Netgear came out with their own doorbell system that can integrate into the Arlo system. Cons: none really. I plan on purchasing one or two more cameras.",Would buy it again.

I have also (unfortunately) recommended the system online and amongst friends/acquaintances. My most recent system has had two major failures: one of the cameras stopped working (I replaced it via warranty and  RMA process) and now the base station has failed. I am quite tech-savvy and have done everything recommended to resolve the issue, but to no avail. I just spent a frustrating 90 minutes on the phone with Arlo customer support - their only solution (after much arguing from my side) was to send me a replacement base station unit and, if they did not receive the faulty unit back within 10 days, they would charge my credit card for the full cost of the replacement base station. I get that this is Arlo policy, but seriously, my faulty base station is in a remote location that I will need to arrange separate travel to in order to do the new installation. Arlo refused to give me the courtesy of a flexible return to replace a faulty device (due to what I expect is poor Arlo design/quality control). Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this product - if your's stops working like mine did, you will be endlessly frustrated by a customer service organization/warranty process/RMA policy that is non-customer friendly. Arlo does not seem to understand that consumers have a lot of choices for camera systems - and their technology and support is not up to par. There are better options out there - please do your research and choose wisely. I completely regret that I installed these systems in 3 locations... If you can't count on your camera system to be reliable, you shouldn't have that brand...

It has worked as intended for about 2 months now and I am satisfied with the system. The camera picture is as expected for a 720p system and shows what I need to see. The battery life is very dependent upon how much activity there is for the camera to ""see"". One of my cameras, due to its placement, gets activated by almost every car that drives down the street. That camera sends 75+ notifications every day and the battery needs to be recharged every 2 weeks or so. The other camera ""sees"" much less activity and thus only needs to be charged every 4-5 weeks. Certainly the best feature of the Arlo system is the no-charge archiving of all videos on a rolling 7-day schedule. You pay no money and have access to any video recorded from up to 5 cameras for 7 days, which is plenty. The Arlo Pro system was a good investment for me.",A Good Wireless Solution At A Reasonable Price

This is an inane and insane design flaw built into the Arlo units as the user has no control and the Arlo Base stations will follow your wireless router on its channels as you attempt to move it.  Their support forum cracks me up when they try to defend this behavior and I am having to change all my other wireless devices to use only the 5Ghz band to work around this.

It is however perfect for the average home owner who wants some peace of mind. Setup and operation is easy for just about anyone who isn't tech savvy. On the other hand, there are plenty of settings and features for advanced users to dive into. Lithium Ion rechargeable battery is the way to go. The one down side it the steep price tag, but you get what you pay for. (build quality and software are excellent) UPDATE: 5/29/17 I got two more add on cameras to mount them outside, a total of 5 cameras costing me about $830. Mounted a few outside, and that's when I started to notice how poor the quality was. At about 10 feet off the ground, there is absolutely no detail. They looked fine when they were setup inside and everything was up close. Also, I started noticing a lot of compression artifacts in the video footage. (All cameras have full WiFi strength, ISP is 5-up 100-down) I ended up returning the whole set. Changed from 5 to 3 stars. For less then what this setup cost me, I was able to get five wired bullet cams with 2K resolution and one PTZ camera at 1080P resolution with a 3TB hard drive. I understand the benefits of having a wire free system (renting a place where you cant drill or run wires, or having the ability to move the camera when ever you want). This is just not the system for me. I would have kept it if it didn't cost so much or if it had a slightly higher bit rate which would result in a lot more detail.","For the price, it should have way better video quality."

Pros: Easy to install, setup, administer Easy to charge batteries and swap out Lots of mounting options 2 way audio App is easy to use Scheduled recording times Audible alarm External drive option Cons: Motion trigger is done on camera and not in software. This means the trigger is only good up to about 20 feet so motion further from the camera won't be recorded. It would be better if it could detect pixel changes in software to trigger a motion alert anywhere in the field of view with zones to control motion triggers. Website cannot show Live View on cameras when accessing through a computer. I've used multiple browsers, installed the latest Flash plugin, reset everything, allowed all Flash content, tried multiple computers, etc. I could not get the Live View to work at all. It always shows a connection problem. It works great on my phone and tablets but I would prefer it on my computer screen. I hope they convert the system to HTML5 as Flash will be unsupported by all browsers soon. Easy to steel. The cameras I put in more accessible locations are screwed into a mounting base but anyone can steel it if they wanted to. Recording delay. Recording starts a few seconds after motion is triggered. This causes me to lose some valuable recording time. I've positioned the cameras to account for this as much as possible but the combination of motion triggers only happening within 20 feet and a recording delay mean I sometimes get the top of people's heads as they are passing below instead of a good shot of their face. Overall, they are good cameras for what they do but they could be great cameras if they were able to fix the problems.",Good Cameras but Could be Better

Video quality:  Even in good lighting conditions, the video quality is not good enough to make out a license plate on a car. 2. Motion detection: a. Sensitivity:  My arlo pro with the sensitivity cranked to 100% cannot detect people 15 feet away.  It does detect trees swaying in the wind and moving cars on the road. b.  Video recording lag:  There is a lag of many seconds and the event that triggered motion (has to be as big as a car moving) would have already passed.

I decided that I needed at least one more camera, so I purchased a single Arlo Pro camera with a Pro base station, removed the older base station, and connected my three original Arlo cameras to the new base station, along with the Pro Camera. I then stuck a 128 GB flash drive into the new base station after syncing the cameras and firing up the system. My first observations are that the new camera, with its rechargeable battery is going to last a long time between recharges; not to mention that the siren, the audio features, and the video quality are pretty amazing. But what really surprised me was that the batteries in my older Arlo cameras seem to be having a greatly extended battery life relative to previously. I can only assume that the Pro base station connectivity is far more efficient regarding battery life. Additionally, the whole system seems to be much faster at picking up movement and recording it.

Hundreds of customers have reported batteries draining to 0% after just 3 weeks, instead of the advertised 3-4 months.  This battery drain occurs even when cameras are in off or standby modes, or when only a few seconds of video are being recorded each day.  Most customers report their cameras were working fine for months or years prior to the May software update and that they made no changes to their setup that would cause the batteries to drain so rapidly.  Note, the software update coincided with Netgear launching a new optional service (for purchase) which is supposed to make managing your alerts more convenient.  Unfortunately, it has resulted in ruining service for existing customers.  Netgear responded to the thread of complaints on the Arlo user community site stating they were working on a solution---that was June.  There have been no status updates since.  Arlo did release a new firmware version in July, stating it implemented improved battery management, but it has not solved the problem.  I own 5 of these cameras, and have invested about $800 in this product.  I, like the hundreds of others, are waiting for Arlo/Netgear to do something about this.  Having to recharge every 3 weeks is extremely cumbersome, greatly diminishing the utility of this product.  Netgear customer service is horrible--call center personnel are difficult to understand and not very knowledgeable, and resolving an issue takes multiple service calls (hours).  If you are considering buying this product, I would advise you to either buy something else or wait until Netgear has solved this issue.

Unless they get solar charging working and improve the way they handle motion this is basically a useless product as far as security. If you set the motion sensitivity high enough to detect people walking across the camera then any gust of wind will set it off. If you set it lower then it doesn't detect anything and never records anything. I have two cameras and basically any time its remotely windy I'll lose 20-30% battery life in 1 day.

I purchased this camera to help protect against rampant package theft. During the time I owned this camera, three packages were stolen literally right from under the Arlo cam and I was unable to recover video for various reasons. The first problem is that the notification system for when the battery is about to die doesn't work. While I was away from home for 4 days, I received a message that there was 15% battery left, but within minutes of that message the camera died right away. This is the batteries first charge - it was brand new. The second time, the base station went out and I wasn't notified, so the recording never saved.

I am not impressed at all with the support for such an expensive product. Purchased this product and received it quickly.  Right out of the box I had no problems connecting it to my phone and connecting all five cameras.  The process took less than 30 minutes to initially set up.  I was thrilled.  I then updated the firmware on the base station and all 5 cameras.  Before setting the cameras up outside in their permanent locations, I wanted to play a little with them so I left them in my office.  About an hour later, I checked my app again to see how it was working and all cameras were showing offline.  I didn't think much of it at the time knowing I wouldn't be able to play around with them again for a few days. When I did get back to them, they were still showing offline.  I tried connecting them, reinstalling them, completely disconnecting the system from my app...all to no avail.  I then read through as many forums as I could find on similar problems and tried every fix.  Hours later, I finally gave up and called customer service.  It didn't take long for me to talk with a live person who had me go through pretty much everything I had already tried.  His response was, ""hmmm, that's weird.  It shouldn't be doing that.""  Then he says that I likely have a faulty base station, the cameras are working fine and that I'll need a replacement.  He said I could return it to the store, or they can ship me a new one.  I chose the latter option since I was already dealing with them.  Apparently this wasn't the answer he was hoping I would say.  He then puts me on hold for several minutes and finally comes back with ""new ideas"" that his team said might work.  Fine...I'll keep trying.  Nothing worked.  Puts me on hold again.  Several minutes later he comes back and says that my case has been elevated to a higher level, whatever that means.  Says I'll receive a phone call back in 24 hours.

I *would* give these 5 stars if it weren't for this problem.  The setup is extremely easy, video quality is adequate and the sound is fine - though not needed a whole bunch. I also have accessories such as covers, more permanent mounts and even the security lights and all are great products.  But trying to have these hooked up to power outlets or the solar panels (those are a HUGE waste at $70+ a pop) and 95% of the time they don't work.  It displays ""Incompatible charger has been detected"" on all of the cameras that are plugged in/on solar.  WTF?  Hey Netgear - this is all your sh*t, how can it be incompatible? In my case, I added an arlo pro 2 (1080p), and had 1 extra camera - so I cycle the batteries through that and it is one of the few that has the ability to charge.  In fact, there is only ONE of the Arlo chargers that works with it. The other (that came with the set) gives the same Incompatible message. So, I have to change batteries on some of these once every few weeks, others every few months, depending on the weather and how many times they go on.  Not a big deal, but some of these require a ladder and moving plants and sh*t out of the way. I cannot recommend these at all for the charging problem.  It's highly stupid and their support instantly blames the customer (not me directly but I see it all over the forums) of A.) not being able to insert the micro-USB into the camera correctly or B.) there is dirt/dust in the receptacle and there isn't a good connection.  I test using my phone with the exact same cable by taking it out of the camera and plugging into my phone - every single one of them works.  The problem, actually, is that their software is absolute crap and is determining if the voltage is ""appropriate"" and if it's not within some asinine range it just sh*ts itself and decides not to charge at all. And to make matters even more fun, sometimes they work.  If you leave them plugged in, they just randomly charge every now and then - though you can't tell from the app how much battery life is left (even if it isn't charging) - but if you catch it at the right time, you will see the camera charging and you don't get the error message.

Initial setup experience was fast, easy, and awesome.  4 of the 5 cameras worked without issues. One camera, however, has given me 3 issues within the first week. Issue #1 - Upon initial battery installation, when I tried to connect the camera to the base station - pushing the top button did not cause the blue lights to come on. I removed/reinstalled the battery and then it worked normally. Issue #2 - The same camera, approximately 3 days later, just went offline. I tried re-linking it, but again got no blue lights.  I removed and replaced the battery once again, then re-joined it to the base station.  Then it came back online. Battery level was at 97%. Issue #3 - a repeat of issue #2.  This seems to be an unreliable camera. I checked the battery terminal and the contacts inside and they appear the same as in the other 3 cameras. All normal, none bent, none blocked. Also note, it was located indoors at all times. I contacted netgear support, and they're on the other side of the planet somewhere.  Guy kept me on the phone re-setting system for 30 mins, seemed to think it was a distance issue with the camera that kept going offline.  The camera was between 30 and 35 feet of the base station.  He said that was far and that I should bring it within 20 feet.  20 feet, really?  Kills the advantage of the entire system.  I then pressed him and asked - what is the maximum distance that a camera can be located from the base station according to your specs?  He answered that indoors under the proper conditions (yada,yada, yada) the range could be up to 300 feet. 30-35 feet is a lot closer than 300'.  I told him I suspected it to be a hardware issue due to my problems with the power/linking button.  He said to give it a few more days and see if it comes offline again, he again pointed out possible interference and distance issues.  On the app and desktop, the reception strength reads 100%.  I once again reminded him about the issues I had with the linking and power button as well as with the need to remove and re-insert the battery 3 times already in order to enable linking.  He still did nothing and said he'd comment on my support request and we'd have to wait to see if the camera comes offline again.  So now I'm waiting.  A security system needs to be reliable.  Strike 1.  Other issues are resolution and night vision.  The resolution of these cameras as well as the sharpness of their focus is greatly lacking.  Night vision is ok but not better than some other cameras I've seen.  So far I am not thrilled with the system.  It is absolutely no fun purchasing a brand new, and expensive system - just to be stuck dealing with customer service a week later.  So now I'm waiting on them with an already unreliable brand new security camera system that cost a considerable amount of money.  Had I not thrown out the packaging immediately, everything would be going back.","Issues with Hardware, Resolution, Night Vision, Motion Detection, and Customer Service"

Great picture and sound. Easy install. Note: remove the nut tightener on the screw on wall mount or pain to hook up for powered use outside. Update: got in july...died in August. Troubleshooting..hmm no app for that....camera gives no information..will update as it stopped day ago...update. did it again this September. So the pro is not as good as the standard arlo...but only one of them is working. Also..zero support from netgear . So..advice..i have none. Get ripped off by big service companies or deal with this. They need to cost less than 1/4 the price. Two fails in year...way too many out of three. Update..based on all three hassle I cannot recommend all to anyone. The pro sounded good but does not work as advertised. The battery version runs through batteries faster than rabbit through lettuce. Sad you can't rate a zero. Update July 2018..camera took no video from 3rd to the 5th...wow...had domestic dispute in from of our house..camera picked up nothing. And to top it off when I finely logged in..offer of another service to buy but since these do not work when you need them. Skip this company ..go with something else. update...it finally died after Arlo updated it's camera's after anther outage...to boot the access to the app dies at random when they update...they do not answer your questions and look for contact # lol so what used to be great system with ac power cable fixes they killed after update $500 of my money wasted on system that now tries to force you into pay for use...no pay...kill your cameras. after $100's of dollars in batteries and bad tech support and updates that kill cameras about $700 in cameras….you need to buy ring system. Arlo now is a boat anchor with customers attached to it. I would give you a picture but that would involve too much work for system I paid too much for.,Make sure you get this with extender weathproof cable update(get ring)

It's incredible how easy it is to install and set this up. I especially like the position mode and motion detection test you use when first mounting and aiming the cameras. This helped immensely to find the best location and angle for installation. When you get this, be sure to surf through the controls for each camera and the modes and settings for the system. You'll be amazed how many features and functions you'll find to customize this to your exact needs. Four of our five cameras are mounted outside and I tweaked the settings for each one to go with their particular purpose and environment. The picture quality is excellent, even in hard dark. Both of us have it set up to manage and view video from the system on our iphones and ipads, from anywhere you have a cell signal. In the options you can opt to get iphone on-screen notifications and/or emails when the system alerts, and the Arlo app icon shows a number indicating new alerts/videos, similar to the number on your message app icon that shows number of new texts. You can also opt whether or not any individual camera's alerts will set off the base station siren. The motion detection can be very sensitive if you want. One of our cameras sensed the motion of a squirrel about 20 feet away from the camera! I reduced the motion sensitivity of that camera and now it will only alert for larger things. The audio detection is also very sensitive and adjustable, as well. After three weeks out in the cold, the camera with the lowest battery level is at 90%! I could go on and on with how cool this system is. We're having lots of fun with the cameras just looking at replays of animals (and ourselves!) caught on camera. And we're confident this system will do it's real job of providing security. I only have a couple gripes. I wish the base station had better signal range and didn't need to be ethernet wired to the router. I got a wireless range extender and have the Arlo base station plugged into it and centrally located in the house, but one camera out by the garage door still barely gets a signal, but it's good enough. To be fair, my home is large and has composite fire retardant siding that probably inhibits signal range through it. Also, the speaker on the camera is not very loud, even on the loudest setting. We can talk using the camera, but the person by the camera has to stand pretty close to it. Don't expect to be yelling at kids out on your lawn - they won't hear it. However, the cameras microphones are very sensitive and pick up sounds clearly from far away if you set the sensitivity to 80-100% All-in-all, this system is nothing short of amazing. We'll probably buy more cameras.",Simply Amazing - and fun!

I've now had this camera operating for about a week.  The first thing to note is that the battery power is still reading at 100% so I expect to go a long time without having to recharge it. I got the Arlo Pro because I wanted something completely wireless that I could put anywhere.  I keep it in my living room and the wide angle 130 degree lens captures the entire room.  The picture is true HD and very clear and the night vision works well. The motion sensor does pick up my dog walking around (see video), but I was able to adjust the sensitivity so it only records and sends a notification when he actually walks around. I got this camera in part so I could keep an eye on my aging dog, so it's actually doing its job. The other great feature of this camera is the free 7 day cloud storage which for most people removes the need for any kind of subscription like other cameras have. The iPhone and AppleTV apps work well.  However, since I never plan to use the alarm/siren, I wish there was some way to completely remove it from the list of devices, but there is currently not. I did have some interference trouble with my wifi, which was curiously particular to my iPhone (no other wireless devices where affected), but once I plugged the Arlo's ethernet into the cable modem instead of the AirPort, it solved the problem.  Others have moved the Arlo base away from their wireless base station and that seems to help them.",Great if you're looking for no wires at all.  Long battery life. Great picture quality.

Well actually it did when I set it up, but when I went to look at a recording of an event, the camera was removed and I had no recordings.

My mother wanted one at her front door and at the rear, so for her birthday, I got her the Arlo Pro Camera and base station to try, if we liked it I was going to buy the Arlo Pro 2 camera as an addition. After we loaded the Arlo App and spent 30 mins searching for updates then spent 3 hours trying to get the base station to connect to Cable internet WiFi and the camera to connect to the base station, once the base station connected to the WiFi. During all of this time I was following the troubleshooting guide from Arlo, restting the Internet modem, unplugging and plugging the cable in, power on the base station, I was at wit's end. I was at the point of boxing it all back up and sending it back, it connected. Once it was set up, the video lags terribly, recording lags, jumps all over the place, I have spoke with tech support and all they can do is blame the App and tell me it's being reviewed. Then to top it off, my mother calls and says, my TV upstairs with Roku does not work, says it can't connect to the internet. I had her unplug the Arlo base station and bam, the TV WiFi Roku goes back to working.  Arlo is on the way back to where it came from. Sorry, Arlo that it didn't work out.",Very Disappointed

My only regret is that I didn't get a second camera with it. I plan on buying an add-on camera as soon as I am able! It's worth every penny for the peace of mind and fantastic, fast service of the Arlo system! I witnessed a lot of people accusing others of leaving false/fake feedback while leaving a negative review for the Arlo but I'm glad I threw caution to the wind and bought it anyway (based on the majority of positive feedback). Admittedly, I received my Arlo Pro just today and set it up myself; but the worst part of about the whole process -  thus far - is that I had no ladder to use to mount it above my garage, so I used a bar stool. That was clearly my fault for lack of tools needed. I tested the delay several times throughout the course of the day and there was never more than a .5 - 1 second delay in motion detection. I think my only concern is the temperature at which it functions (up to 113 degrees) may be a problem here in San Joaquin Valley with this week's temps reaching upwards of 115. The video quality can be set to optimized, which will help with battery life yet it still maintains a decent picture/video. I can't speak to how long battery life lasts as mine has only been set up for a few hours and still says 100%. With all of that being said, I will update my review if I run into any problems.

You will find that for many owners the quality of video has seriously degraded in a number of ways since the last firmware update in April and Arlo has neither acknowledged the problem nor offered any solutions.  Video does not continue for the duration of motion but arbitrarily stops at about 20 seconds.  It might freeze midstream with audio continuing, subjects might ghost or suddenly disappear, or the video might be so horribly pixelated with drifting movement that there is no way to determine what you are looking at.  The small percentage of videos that do work are nowhere near the promised--and previous--1080p HD quality.  While customer service is responsive, walking people through possible solutions and sending replacement products, the solutions are useless and the same problems appear immediately on the replacement product.  Once in a while an Arlo moderator will say that they are aware and working on a solution, and updates will be provided soon.  This has been said over and over for 7 months. I can only conclude that Arlo does not support their product. I use this security camera on a bird spa to see migrating birds during spring and fall, and for the first 12 months or so it was wonderful.  The features are great--I could zoom in and get quite clear and up-close videos of bird behavior, identify unusual birds etc.  I had had no idea the array of wildlife who visited the spa at night, so that was a wonderful revelation.  The camera withstood being tossed around by a fox who bit off and chewed up pieces of the silicone skin, as well as 18 months of all kinds of weather.  And best of all you didn't have to pay for a subscription to download your videos! I am terribly disappointed because it is such a terrific product.  But my patience has run out and I will be going today to buy a Nest camera to replace it.  What a shame, Arlo!  Support your product!",Read up and think twice before you buy!!

I just replaced their batteries when I charged the arlo pro battery. Communicating with tech support via email is a joke. To talk on phone you have to pay money if you have had longer than 90 days. They basically refer you to their arlo community where everyone else has the same issues with no resolutions. One of my cameras recorded video for 6 hours and their was nothing found on any of the video. My security lights on my property were not even activated. I tried a new base station, different battery brands, and a new rechargeable battery for pro, still these cameras don’t  function consistently. Update: have had this about 11 months.

The signal is a little finicky but I managed to find a spot that both cameras are getting a Good signal The Picture quality is great and the battery life is really good! Had them up for 45 days b4 I had to recharge them. Theres a bunch of custom settings for ea camera and preset modes for recording or u can do a custome mode. The best part is theyre Completely Wireless!! Which is great! No running wires from the outside of ur house into the Dvr and monitor! With their app I can pull up the cameras from anywhere! U can talk thru the camera but there is a bit of a delay so its not the greatest But u can hear whats being said. The video has a delay so when ur trying to talk to someone they might have walked up and left b4 u can speak. Other than that Ive not had any issues! It was a little pricey but for Completely Wireless its worth it! Update 6/21/19 So after 7 months of using these cameras I have no complaints! Picture quality is still great, Batteries still last more than 30 days (Depending on Use) If its constantly recording the battery will need to be charged more Frequently but Its so easy to do its not that big of a deal. They're on a Magnetic mount so just pull them down bring them in and charge, usually charges up with 60 mins then just take it back out and put it on the mount. Only drawback is u cant just set it to record for say 30 mins bc as soon as u go out of the app it stops recording and goes back to ur settings. Ive gone on my PC and done it and it did record a few times for more than 15 mins but Doesnt always work. Unfortunately Its not meant to do that. Its still a great product to have, It picks up anyone coming up my Driveway or anyone or anything in my Backyard. Easy to use and Set up.

Warkman,Would not recommend to anyone who would need to rely on this set up for security or feeling safe purposes. This system stops recording on motion almost everyday. I have to restart the basestation everyday because it just refuses to record on motion consistently. After a basestation restart it will work and record on motion as it is supposed to but then for a reason not known it will stop recording within half a day or full day and not record anymore. Then have to go in and restart the basestation again to resume recording on motion. This in totally unacceptable for this system is supposed to be a security system. I tried removing the camera from the basestation and account and then reinstalling the camera and it works for a day or two then back to the same crap of not recording on motion. I have 3 other Arlo cameras the non pro versions and they work. This pro model is the one that keeps not recording on motion. The weird thing is if I hit the camera to play live it works so therefore the wifi connection is good and working. It's the recording on motion that just keeps failing. So basically it's a useless system because what I foresee happening is when something unfortunate happens that I will need a recording for surveillance purposes this thing probably will miss it because it didn't record. So don't invest your money into this half baked system. Go elsewhere.,Not a reliable security camera AT ALL!

I checked Apple supported products as we’re a HomeKit house, not Alexa.  Apple only do wired products.  The Arlo range comes out best of the wireless. I only wanted one camera at this stage but we may add more later.  Very hi-def was not needed.  I decided on an Arlo Pro as opposed to a Pro2.  There are many packs containing multiple cameras and a bridge, but you have to search for a single camera and bridge pack obviously as both the manufacturer and Amazon want to keep the purchase price high. The quality of the product appears to be good.  The installation instructions are pretty clear but could have more information. The app is also good and has improved with a recent app upgrade. Note that there is no Ethernet cable in the box to connect the bridge to your router, so plan ahead! Positioning of the bridge is critical.  Our camera is outside above our front door of our 2500sq ft stand alone house.  Our router is probably 30’ away and the camera could not acquire a signal at that distance through walls. I ended up getting a 25’ Ethernet cable and locating the bridge high in one corner of the room where the router is located. Then I got a one or two bar signal which is adequate. If I wanted to locate another camera further from the bridge, I would have problems. Arlo need to look at producing a signal extender or repeater. However, once that was sorted out the system still didn’t work ‘out of the box’ as it constantly put itself in positioning mode and stalling.  After rebooting a number of times, it sorted itself out. I also ordered a permanent mount from Arlo as the included magnetic mount is not suitable outside. It would be too easy to just remove the camera!  The mount is ok although it should have come with a template for locating the screw holes on the wall.  An indication of what drill size would be suitable to drill the holes would also be useful. All in all it’s a good system but it’s not a installation job for someone who knows nothing about simple home maintenance or indeed about WiFi signals. I’d buy it again, but I’m waiting for the signal extender.  You can tell why Apple don’t support it (besides not being HomeKit compatable) as it doesnt ‘just work’, it needs knowledge and more than average home maintenance skills unless you’re planning a very, very simple installation. In operation it’s good. The picture quality is good and I assume the Arlo Pro2 is even better. Sound is pretty good too.  Anyone approaching the front door prompts an alert to my cell phone and iPad. So, it does exactly what it says on the box.",Pretty good but not perfect.

Up until a couple of months ago, I was happy with the product and it was performing as expected. Then one time, the alarm decided to go off while my wife and I were having dinner at home and the alarm was disarmed.  None of us were using our devices to trigger the ear-piercing siren coming from the Arlo Pro Base Station.  I contacted support immediately after who had no explanation for what happened. Two months later, the arlo pro cameras decided to drop off the system.  Despite repeated attempts to de-register and re-register the system on my Arlo account (multiple factory resets), the discovery of the base station would fail and/or register briefly but then drop off the network as being 'offline'. After a lengthy call with Netgear support, it was deemed to be a fault with the base station and they issued an RMA. Here's where my terrible experience begins. After submitting the RMA request, it clearly says that follow-up instructions will be emailed to me.  No such instructions arrived, so I was not given a return address.  I had to contact support again to get this, and they gave me an address which was wrong. I had the unit sent back to me after a few weeks of trying to figure out why the RMA had taken so long, and I contacted support again who advised me a completely different address this time, without any explanation as to why I was given the wrong address the first time. Whilst I was chatting with this rep I decided to google the address which happened to me 5 mins away from where I live.  Google maps showed that there was no business registered there and it was a logistics warehouse that had nothing to do with security/netgear/arlo products.  I asked the rep to confirm that this was the address, and she advised me that it was and issued me with a new RMA number. When I typed the RMA number into the system it says RMA not found, which was different from the first RMA where I could actually verify that it was a real RMA number and verify the status at all times.  2 weeks later, the RMA number is still saying is invalid (despite copy and pasting what the chat agent gave me) and they gave me a lame excuse that there 'system is down for maintenance at the moment, but will be back up later'. I drove to the address, and there is NO business there.  This was evident by using streetview on google maps, which is why I challenged the chat agent about the validity of the address in the first place. It's been two months, and I still have a defective unit in my hand and nowhere to get a replacement.  Arlo - YOU SUCK.  Stay away from this poor product.",Died after 12 months and terrible support experience

The site constantly kicks you out and does this weird thing with acting like you need to install Flash over and over again. It's been brought up in Arlo support forums online yet never gets resolved. You can use it with an Amazon Firestick but that functionality could also be a lot better. It times out pretty quickly and there isn't any option for picture in picture, which would be nice so you didn't have to entirely interrupt what you're watching. They also don't have an app for Roku which has been requested in the forum for years and still hasn't been listened to.. frustrating!","Good camera, not great interface"

Seale,"I've just had this device up and running for a short time, so will update my review after it's got some months under its electronic ""belt.""  But my first impressions follow... The Arlo Pro is really easy to set up -- you'll need a wired network drop and power nearby, and you definitely need fast broadband.  The Arlo mobile app is helpful but can wait (I set up my system using my desktop computer).  The stills and video meet my needs (keeping an eye on the front of my house), others may want / need higher resolution. Pros: * Good video and still quality (good enough for me, anyway) * Free online account will store 7 days of video; you can store more locally on a USB drive attached to the base station * Lots of mounting options, particularly if you make use of the 1/4"" screw mount on the camera * Battery-powered camera, completely wireless, other reviews indicate it doesn't need charging often (but I'll update this once I have more experience of my own...) Cons: * Completely unusable if you've got a slow broadband connection (i.e., DSL).  The base station and camera can't even update their firmware via a slow connection.  And the device has no local-only video storage option (!?!).  Good thing we were scheduled for an upgrade to faster broadband within days of our Arlo Pro's arrival -- 2 Mbps wasn't fast enough for it, 40 is plenty. * Netgear customer support is awful -- as other reviewers have pointed out, if you have a problem with your base station or camera, they will do little more than tell you to power cycle things or let them sit overnight.  If your problem goes deeper, good luck! As you may have guessed, my first Arlo Pro camera & base station had an issue that power cycling and ""let them sit"" didn't fix.  Lacking any help from Netgear, all I can say is thank heaven for Amazon customer service!  The first Arlo Pro kit is on its way back, its replacement is working beautifully.","Excellent product, iffy manufacturer support"

The setup was very simple. The video quality is very good. I also purchased the Alro outdoor security mounts because they are more secure. They screw into the unit, whereas the mounts that come with it are magnetic. Also the battery life is amazing! I've had my camera's for nearly a month now and they have both made 100's of recordings and they still have tons of battery life left. I expect these batteries will last 2-3 months before they need recharging (charger included) If there are videos you want to save you can download them right to your phone from the app. It also has live video, and microphone and speaker, so you can speak through the camera as well as listen live. The way is unit works is, you set up an account online and download the app, plug the base unit into your internet router and turn on the cameras.  When the camera picks up motion it will record for 10 seconds. You will then get a notification on your phone and/or email depending on the settings you choose on the Arlo app or website. If you are putting these in high traffic areas expect to get a lot of notifications. I set mine up to only get notifications on my phone because it was filling up my email.

Do your research and look elsewhere.  I’ve never been able to get it to work flawlessly and it’s not from lack of trying or knowledge.  I have other wifi cameras with way better resolution and functionality with snapier performance and cost me a fraction of what these cameras cost. No included international storage and charging the cameras can only be done with the charger it brings. Motion detection is usually lagging by a lot.  For example lets say someone is running towards your front door, you won’t get a notification until its too late.  If you amp up the motion detection it will detect the smallest flicker but again too late. Smart home integration is worse than dealing with their app.  When Alexa tries to open the camera feed it loads the audio and the video just loads and loads.

Arlo Pro does a great job capturing Amazon tossing your packages at your door with total disregard! Overall these cameras are worth it. I live in a crappy neighborhood right now and Ive caught plenty of sketchy stuff on my cameras which has helped law enforcement find some bad guys and also helped me to also catch people who did stuff on my property that caused damaged or transients trying to steal stuff. I wish the motion detection was pixel-based on the Arlo Pros when theyre plugged into power and not just a PIR motion sensors with zones, but with correct camera placement these cameras still do an excellent job capturing video that is good enough for the price. I have one camera placed in a high-traffic area and hard-wired with power, and Im very pleased with how well the recordings make it up to the cloud without ever skipping a beat...and I am talking VERY high traffic areas with a new recording every couple minutes for hours and hours on end and Netgear/Arlo has yet to complain to me for storing too much free video or anything like that. These Arlo Pro cameras, along with the Arlo Q cameras that I use indoors, all provide exceptional value in my opinion. Watch the video I caught today of an Amazon delivery driver tossing a 4 pound box at my door and waking me up from a nap, leaving me worried that someone was breaking into my house. I quickly reviewed my Arlo cameras outside and I caught the Amazon-branded delivery driver treating my expensive Amazon purchases like cheap garbage. Amazon didnt seem to care too much about the incident, if you were curious (and this isnt the first time its happened with the lazy package tossing by Amazon delivery drivers)...Amazon apologized and that was it. If I needed to use this camera as evidence to prove how a new delivery item is broken or how it somehow becomes faulty in the near future, these Arlo cameras have saved the day! :) Thank you Netgear for these amazing Arlo cameras and free cloud recording features; I am very grateful. For outdoor use I recommend getting some silicon protective skins to put on these cameras which are very affordable and can be found on Amazon. The battery in these cameras in a semi-high traffic area would last me about 1 month and in a very high traffic area the battery would last 5 days...this led me to finally hard-wiring the power to all of my Arlo cameras outside. If hard-wiring power to your cameras isnt an option I would still say that the battery life is excellent for what you are getting and recharging the batteries isnt the end of the world as long as you remember to charge the batteries when they need it and get the battery back into the camera before you miss a recording opportunity. I also own Blink XT cameras outside and while the Blink XT battery life is superior to the Arlo Pro cameras in the same areas; the Arlo's motion sensors and capture distance and quality is far better than the Blink XT cameras. Blink XT missed motion recording opportunities that the Arlo Pro cameras caught with ease even when I had my Blink XT cameras right next to the Arlo Pros with identical side-by-side placement. There is a place for the more affordable Blink XT cameras and I use my Blink cameras in less traffic areas and the Blink is closer to the distance of whatever Im trying to capture. My Arlo Pros do the heavy lifting for outdoor recordings though, where I can capture most (but not all) motion out to the alley behind my apartment building with cars and people walking side to side on the camera about 20 feet away which I consider to be excellent for the price and technology available here. I hope this review helps.",Arlo Pro does a great job capturing Amazon Delivery tossing your packages at your door!

With the power plug, it blocks the bottom of the camera so you cant angle it down when you attach it to the wall.

Unfortunately, the cameras frequently fail to detect humans walking directly into the frame to deliver packages. On the other hand, they notice leaves rustling in the distance, which means we'll often get alerts and accompanying video clips that we have to scrutinize for any indication of actual movement—but in the clips, giant boxes will have magically appeared on our doorstep with no alert or recording of that event. I.e., the cameras are failing at the one task we bought them to perform. (See attached images for an example of a double failure: 1) a box was delivered to the middle of one camera's field of view, with no alert or recording, and 2) a carseat was retrieved by someone who must have walked right into the middle of the field of view, again with no alert or recording.) I waded through the morass of customer-service-defense lines to find a telephone number to discuss this problem with a human (with images and videos to illustrate the failures), and the customer-service reps proved (a) unwilling to depart from their scripts (e.g., asking me questions whose answers I'd just given, because those questions were part of their required scripts) and (b) unwilling to actually address the root problem, which is a poor motion-detection algorithm. They claimed that because our cameras are behind glass and use passive infrared (PIR) detection, they won't ever detect human movement. However, I have (and showed them) several clips in which the cameras *have* detected and recorded human movement. Detecting something *sometimes* means that the detection algorithm hasn't been given sufficient training data. When I offered to help the team fix the problem (I use machine-learning algorithms at work), they weren't interested: They simply told me to mount the cameras higher, which would not solve the problem. Now we're stuck with a few essentially useless cameras, and Arlo has our money and no interest in supporting us as customers or improving their own product line. If I could do it over again, I'd look elsewhere. I'm hopeful that this review will help someone else avoid our situation.",TERRIBLE at motion detection

Not sure why I’d need that. Reasons I chose this system over other models: - No subscription! Stores videos for a week for free. You can subscribe to store longer, but why would I need that? - Wireless, light-weight cameras makes it easy to put them wherever I want. The battery life is fantastic. I’ve had these for 2 weeks and they’re still at 100% - Motion sensor isn’t overly sensitive. I haven’t had anything trigger them other than people walking past. A lot of reviews on other models said people got a lot of false alarms for passing shadows or a fan blowing. - Super easy set up and use. My Aunt recommended this set saying “even your uncle can use it” and he’s notoriously not tech savvy. I found the step by step instructions in the app to be super clear. - Video quality is great - Cheaper models seem to have some weird privacy issues - I haven’t used the wall mounts, but the magnetic feature is great. They would be very easy to take down and put back up. Downsides: - As others have described, there’s about a 5 second lag in receiving the video. Makes talking through the speaker almost useless. But it still captures video of the entire event. I don’t actually lose the first 5 seconds of what happened, just takes some extra time to get to me.",Works great

I needed at least a 3 camera system that would work in an outdoor setting. I also needed them to be battery powered because they are no where near any outlets. I knew I didn't want to run wires all over the place and wanted free cloud storage. The Arlo fit the bill on all needs. The setup is ridiculously simple, insert the batteries in the camera, plug in the base station, sync the cameras and then mount them. Download the app for your phone and you're ready to go. I had read others complain about some lag time on the cameras and I did experience a slight lag on one of my cameras that was farthest away from the base station, but I just switched it to recognize a range extender and after that I had zero lag. The picture quality is good for 720. I would have preferred 1080 but I don't have any problems recognizing faces which was what I was after anyway. Viewing the shots on my 42"" monitor is great with lots of flexibility with what you need for each camera. You must go to each camera and untick boxes if you don't want notifications on your phone or email alerts. I didn't on certain views and it was blowing my phone up. Hint: go into the mode tab. The only problems that I have had so far are getting live feeds when I'm using my VPN and sometimes camera requests are timed out on the first request. I don't use the VPN that often so it's not a big deal and the time outs could be the app or my ancient phone. Still not a big problem. All in all, I'm real happy with this system. Captures faces with good quality and audio, easy setup and viewing properties, free cloud storage and add on capabilities for future cameras. Can't go wrong with this system.",Super Easy Setup

Everything was great until I decided to sign up for the ""Upgrade"" and add 4 more cameras. Almost immediately I began to experience problems with faulty motion activation, notification alerts and battery life. The battery life may have been coincidental since the first charge lasted a full 6 mos. then struggled to achieve 2 mos. on the next full charge, and even shorter thereafter. Two of the added cameras filters turned purple; called customer support, which was an overseas CSR with poor English / communication... could barely make out what was being said. What we figured out was that she wanted me to reboot the system and sync cameras, which I explained several times that I had already tried this without success, but insisted I keep repeating the process. No thanks. In short, buyer beware, especially at $1000. Hopefully your luck is better than mine, but lesson learned on this side of the purchase. I was able to return the added cameras, but unfortunately am stuck with this $1000 bag of rocks.",FAIL !!!

The picture quality is great! There are a few flaws though... 1) motion detection is only 80% of the full camera view because it uses a PIR (heat) sensor instead of pixel detection. 2) the way motion detected recording works causes multiple very short video clips since the recording stops almost immediately after motion stops instead of trailing. If you walk into frame and stop moving for a couple seconds, the video clip will end and start a new one as soon as you start moving again... 3) setting up actions for what happens with motion detection is very time consuming. Especially if you want one camera triggered to record on all cameras. You have to edit that one action as many times as cameras you want to start recording... 4) this is probably one of the biggest flaws. The 2way talk is horrible. The people on camera can barely hear you if you use a phone. This is due to their application coding. They won’t admit it no matter how many people complain. 5) when recording and using 2way talk at the same time, the recording on captures the camera side so it seems like they are talking to thin air.","Great camera, great picture, not so great motion capture..."

I have a great support system and could get a house sitter, but the added comfort of having these cameras is worth the money.  You will not get the top of the market quality image, but you can manipulate the image and zoom from your mobile app, and you can even talk through the camera if you want.  I would agree that there is a definite and unfortunate delay in the recording and the app notification.  It is anywhere from 3-5 seconds which is enough for an important moment to be missed.  This is something ARLO should fix either with a back record time of 5 seconds or however. I did capture a police officer on my property within 15 hours of me mounting my cameras which was a comfort and a stress.  I was glad that the cameras captured their movement, and if they had spent any time at the door, or at the window, the camera would have captured the action well . All in all, I think these will serve my needs to give myself some comfort when away from my property.  I will keep experimenting with the placement which takes some practice.

You can send alerts (email,text) to more than one person, however if they each attempt to login and view cameras, they will log out whoever was logged in. - Phone app has less functionality and different controls than the PC application. For example, you cannot change password via the phone app though it would appear you could. - There is no notification when the Arlo server (cloud) is down. Be aware if your internet or the Arlo cloud server is down, you have no access to cameras or base system even if you are home. This has happened 3 or 4 times in the past month; my internet was not the problem. - Delay, I have had notification and mode setup delays as long as 5 minutes. ""Try again"" messages are common. Camera video clips are 90 to 120 secs so Arlo may miss recording the bad guys in a quick snatch break-in. Meanwhile no issues with other apps or devices with my home network. -  I have been periodically logged out for no apparent reason. - Email notification should in the subject header specify the device/camera. At present you have to open email to find out if it was the Basement or Kitchen camera. Though if you remembered your device order, you would know the first email is from the first device. - Camera speakers are not loud enough. Camera mikes seem ok. - Alarm is not loud but the skreeeech is annoying enough. - Tech support needs major work. Chatting and community blogs are not sufficient.  Search for a ""bug reporting"" and at most you will get replies about bugs on camera lenses. Search will also direct you across unrelated Netgear product line. Ugh. Likes: - Easy to setup especially wireless cameras. - After a month, one camera battery (the most used for detection and recording) is half discharged.

No, for now I use it as a secondary system.",Great idea but needs more development and support infrastructure

I bought the 5 pack to put around a 3,000 SF Victorian built in 1891 and the connection was no problem from the front of the house to the detached garage in back.  I was a little worried because I figured all the lath and plaster would eat up the signal, but no problems at all.  Setup literally took 15 seconds per camera to pair and it was super easy.  I have 4 cameras mounted on exterior portions of the house and 1 ""free camera"" to move between the interior and the garage. I wish there were 2 things handled better.  1) If more then 1 person can log into the account to view the cameras simultaneously.  I share it with my Fiancee and when we get a notification we both log in to see the activity, meaning only one person can view while the other is consistently getting logged out.  2) Speakers could be louder.  I have them all set at 100%, but sound really gets eaten up outdoors.  It's like someone talking with an inside voice with the speaker.  It's fine to communicate if someone is listening for it.  Otherwise, you'll just blank on it. I like that they're battery operated so I can keep them anywhere without worrying about cable management wires.

If I had known what I know now, I would've gone a different route. First of all, I bought Arlo because it didn't require a subscription. Then, to get the more advanced features, it did start requiring a subscription. It's cheaper than others though, so OK fine, I'll subscribe. Person detection, vehicle detection, package detection, they all work fine. Zones? No way. Good luck getting those to work. Smart notifications? Sure, they kind of work, but if you tap the notification on your phone, you don't actually get the see the video you were notified of - it's still processing in the cloud. Not very helpful when you're trying to see who is at the door (you have to go into the app and livestream for that). Homekit integration did come eventually, but I haven't played with it enough to say whether or not it's any good. Here's the big kicker form me. Cameras must link to a Base Station for connection. That's OK, I get it. It saves battery on the camera itself. The range on the base station isn't all that great. I have a Netgear Orbi setup in my home, with great Wifi coverage at all corners, I should be able to use that to connect to the base station, right? WRONG. No integration with other Netgear products (tsk tsk). Back to the notifications. Not having a ""Camera Offline"" notification is simply inexcusable. I had a camera go offline after changing a battery and I never noticed. ~1 week later, without any input on my part, it came back online. Only then did I notice that I was missing a full week's worth of recordings on the front of my house. Since I'm already into the Arlo ecosystem for so much money I'm probably just going to order another Base Station to put near the back of the house. They're down under $100 at this point, so it's not worth ripping everything out and starting over with another system. It's unfortunate, but I'm pretty well shackled to Arlo at this point.","If I had known, I would've gone a different route..."

This camera will not detect anything smaller than a large dog.  In the instructions it says to position the camera so it is at an angle to since the motion sensor works best across the field of view so I tried that and it made no difference at all.  If the camera is in the a shadow it will white was out so bad when the sun is up that you can not see anything through it.  So the bottom line is this, why on earth would I want a security camera that only detects motion from a max of 10 feet away, have such a horrific video lag that they intruder will be inside my house by the time I know he is there and can not be used in the daytime since it white washes out so bad?",How can so many people be wrong?

Mason,"I'm still working out a few bugs; but so far, I'm rather disappointed with my new Arlo Pro system.  Overall, it's a neat TOY; but that's about the best thing I can say about it. Pros & Cons: I love the idea that this system is totally wireless.  That enables me to easily move my  cameras anywhere I may want them. I also love the fact that Netgear includes 7 days of free cloud storage.  I did encounter problems when I tried to download videos onto my PC, via the Netgear website; but I was able to download them on my smartphone, via the Arlo app. As for accessing my Arlo account, Netgear only allows one login at a time.  If I'm already logged on, and my husband decides to log on, it will kick me off.  No advanced warning... just ""so long Charley"". Setting up the base station, and syncing the cameras, was almost effortless.  I say almost since both required an immediate firmware upgrade.  My first attempt to upgrade the base station failed; so I had to repeat that process. I purchased the 720p  Arlo Pro, as opposed to the 1080p Arlo Pro 2.  Numerous reviewer have claimed the Pro 2 cameras will frequently go offline automatically; and I certainly didn't want that. The 720p resolution on the Arlo Pro is decent; but definitely not great.  The night vision mode is awful.  By the time someone gets close enough to see who he/she is, the camera washes out the person's features to almost totally white.  BTW, this happens regardless of whether infrared night vision mode is turned on or off. Ideally, I would like to leave live monitoring turned on and displayed on my Android tablet all the time; but that just isn't practical.  Even when video is not being recorded to the cloud, the camera's battery power is still used to stream the live view to the base station.  In the end, constant live monitoring would require recharging the camera batteries entirely too frequently. For serious home security, I simply don't trust the Arlo system either.  I have two cameras set to record video whenever motion is detected.  Furthermore, I have the sensitivity level set rather high.  On numerous occasions, both cameras have failed to record a video, when I walked directly in front of them.  Other times, they have recorded a bird flying by.  If I were to have an actual intruder, I have zero confidence that the Arlo would record the event.  The recording is just too inconstant to be taken seriously as a home security system.  (Note: I am positive that the failure to record the videos was not due to my network connection being down.) When the cameras do manage to detect motions, there is a considerable lag between the time motion first occurs, and when the camera starts recording it.  One of my videos captured a person walking down my driveway, to my front door.  The video didn't even start recording until the person was about 10 feet from the camera. My system is too new to know how long the batteries will last.  I'm talking about the actually battery life, not the time between having to recharge it.  Replacement batteries  cost $50 each.  That might not be too bad if the battery lasted a year or two; but from what I've read the batteries have to be replaced about every 4-6 months.",Disappointing

Briefly, here is why: Positive: 1. Excellent day and night picture quality 2. Simple configuration and UI. 3. Free storage up to limit. 4. Rugged construction 5. Integration with Smarthings and other IoT. 6. Easy setup. Ensure you buy the condoms and mounting brackets for outside. Negative: (Relative to price point) 1. Battery life is marginal. If you never have motion in an area great. But, think about that front yard where you have people walking by or cars parked just on the edge of your property. With roughly 10-15 activation per day, the battery drains quickly. I feel I would be better off with a perm. powered device. 2. While it has a standard micro usb port similar to virtually any android smart phone. You still require the Arlo  plug to charge. Not a deal breaker, but painful. 2. App load times/camera viewing is slow. I have a 100 mb Xfinity internet connection with Netgear Orbi Mesh setup within 15 ft of the front camera. Connection in my house is not the issue. I have a Samsung S7 device.  Be prepared to wait upwards of 30 seconds before  authentication, app loads AND THEN the camera activates to see who is at the front door. It needs to be faster. 3. The absolute worst aspect of the camera is that recording does not start fast enough. Roughly 30 seconds of an event (or more) go by before capture begins.  This is not acceptable. I have tried playing with various settings but unable to resolve. Overall, I regret purchasing now. I should have invested the time and installed a fixed camera setup. 12-Jul-17  - I have lowered the stars on this product because of the incredibly poor support provided for both this product and in particular the ORBI which I also have. The warranty on both products which are similarly priced make zero sense.  Stay away from NETGEAR until they get their act together. 17-Aug-17 - Finally heard back from NETGEAR and received confirmation in their user forums that the original screw adapter on the VMA1000 mount for the solar panel is too big. (gee thanks..I knew that) I was sent new screws that now allow the solar cable to be plugged in along with the VMA1000 mount.  Why these are not highlighted everywhere and why there is no update to the Amazon listing as a bulletin or something to look for when buying the solar panel, I don't know.  Overall, I would say NETGEAR is completely lost on any form of cohesive support and sincerely hope my product continues to work as I do not want to ever have to call or email again.. June 2020 I am done with Arlo. The product is over-priced and unreliable.  Here is why: I added the doorbells 2 yes ago and 2 of 2 have been rma'd. 2 of the cameras have been rma'd. 1 of the 2 solar panels has apparently died as not properly charging. This after less than 2 years. I only realized recently that some Einstein at Arlo decided to have the wifi channel operate on the exact channel my mesh is on. There are clearly issues. The camera has good and bad days from an access perspective. Some days they come up in about 30 seconds. Some they don't load.. The delay of 5 seconds before motion activates recording is brutal. You can completely someone moving fast. Arlo support has become poor after being fantastic initially. This product will be going the way of my Orbi soon. I am done with Netgear ( or formerly Netgear) products...",Marginal ROI relative to lower cost fix camera setups / Incredibly bad customer service

We never saw the kids anywhere near our house again.

Most of my negative experience has been with the configuration of the geofencing, the modes, the schedules and even the integration challenges with SmartThings.  Just not flexible and not intuitive enough to truly provide the types of customizations needed to prevent false positives. The final nail in the coffin is that the company changed the geofencing mode notifications to be mandatory.  There is no way to keep alert notifications enabled but disable geofencing has changed the mode.  They admit this in the forum, that they made this decision FOR us.

I wanted to put it outside, but my house to the street is greater than 23' so, I'm afraid that might not work how I want. The picture quality is nice, not the greatest.

I like that I can have 5 cameras and can save the footage for a few days all for free. I have been testing the magnetic mounts, and ultimately I think I would prefer to not use the whole ""wireless"" as that means I have to keep the camera in a  reachable range so as to take it down and charge again. But, I will say, the current battery has been going for over 1 month and its been triggered daily as its inside within range of where my kids play (you can easily understand how often the motion detection might go off now).

The notification service is slow.  The live interaction to the camera is slow.  Activating two-way voice is ""slow"". What this means is it takes 15 or more seconds before I'm notified of someone at my door.  Then another 10-20 seconds for the camera to activate in my app and then another 10-20 seconds before I can speak to the person.  This is between 30 seconds and a minute not including the time it takes for me to check the notification and the time for the app to load on my phone. By the time I can say ""hello"" the person has already left making the two-way feature utterly pointless. I have 4 non-pro cameras as well. Overall the cameras have a good picture and good night vision which is heavily let down by the fact that the actual service leaves a lot to be desired. The whole system is great for seeing what went on when there's a notification rather than what's going on.  I'm sure if someone was casing my home I would be able to get the notifications and alert authorities in a timely manner but paying extra for this ""pro"" version of the camera is just pointless.

No email has been sent as of now the issue has not been fixed. So altogether I am out $250 for the additional camera and to upgrade the system. I did not ask for a refund I just want my camera to work. I will update this review if the issue is taken care of.",If you upgrade your Arlo system and have an issue their support absolutely sucks.

Set it up relatively easily and it worked, though I was not happy about the sometimes up to ten second delay in notifying you of motion detection. It almost defeated the purpose for me, since I had bought it as an early notification system of someone walking up our driveway so I would know before they got to the house. However, it was nice to have for security purposes and to occasionally capture Pepe Le Pew the skunk waddling around at night in our front yard. Then, a few days ago I turned it off and back on again, and I couldn't get it to connect. After trying for thirty minutes, it seemed to just go dead. I called customer service and was told I was the 25th person in line and I could get a callback when an agent was available. Left my number, waited an hour, no call back. The next day, I called back to just wait in line. I waited an hour. An hour! Finally got someone on the phone who walked me through the steps of trying to fix it, and to no avail. They told me they would send me a return authorization via email. I went to go fill it out, and the options were 1) Send in the broken camera and pay for shipping, wait for Netgear (Arlo) to inspect it, and then wait for them to send me a new camera. Free of charge, except for the cost of me shipping it out. 2) Have them send me a camera now. $20 plus cost of me covering shipping 3) Have them send me a camera next day shipping. $30, plus cost of me covering shipping Seriously?! I cannot believe that I have to pay for shipping and then wait around for weeks without our security system for them to send me the camera and that if I obviously don't want to wait around for that, they charge me. Just another way to make a buck off of you when this is their problem in creating a defective item. And it's truly shameful that they make you pay for shipping their defective device that you paid $200 for. What awful customer service. I brought this up to a customer service representative on their online chat and asked to have my shipping covered and have a new one sent to me free of charge because why in the world would I have to pay to have my $200 new defective device fixed in a timely manner. The agent was extremely rude and told me that if I didn't like their customer service, I should just return it to amazon. I have never had a customer service representative a) talk to me like that b) tell me that I should just return their product where I purchased it, and b) not even recognize my complaint or make any kind of attempt at a resolution. This company feels like a complete scam in sending defective merchandise and then refusing to resolve the issue and actually trying to charge you more money to fix it. I will never purchase anything from Netgear or Arlo again and strongly warn my fellow amazon customers against doing the same.",Received defective item and then was charged to have it fixed

For some reason the cameras are constantly losing sync. I have bought housings for one that I hope will solve the issue on that camera above the garage door. The one on our porch I removed the battery and plugged it in to a power source. The battery constantly needed to be charged. You can run the camera without the battery, kbut plugged into AC, folks. However, between the pain of charging the battery and loss of sync, I don’t  think the  Arlo is well designed. The alarm function is a joke. It is very loud and not easy to use. I am reluctant to use it. It should be set on low as the default. Instead us set to ear piercing. I bought the Arlo bell at Best Buy on sale. I didn’t have low voltage wires. Instead I used the alternative wireless connection. The resulting delay is ludicrous slow speed. Between the depressing of the bell and the activation of the wireless chime it is absurd. Why wouldn’t Arlo use Bluetooth  between the bell and chime. It appears that the signal goes to the cloud then back. I purchased 25$  Wyze cameras for in the house, since we are selling and thought having recorded movement, when the agent is showing the house would be a good idea. That way we can see what is happening. The Wyze are very much easier to install with no hub. They have super resolution. They have no battery. I have not had one go down yet. When we sell we might leave the Arlo and adopt the Wyze as our standard. You can buy a housing for the Wyze Camera. I don’t Know if it will work but I will give it a try.",Not  A Great Deign.

Audio seems marginally better than the original cameras—I couldn't really tell a difference aside from maybe the frame rate/smoothness of video being slightly better(?).

I only set my camera to be ""armed"" for about two hours per day (this is the mode where it alerts you when it detects motion), and I have only needed to charge it twice in the last three months.

I already had three cameras plus the base station from a previous purchase. I bought this extra camera to add to the back entrance of my house. These cameras are a breeze to setup and the batteries last about 3 months per charge for my house. I only enable recording when I’m away from home (I use the geofencing feature for this) and I have the cameras scheduled to record during sleeping hours at night. Because I have these paremeters setup for recording, the cameras don’t record unless they sense motion during the specified times of the day and when I’m away from home. This really increases how long the battery charges last. Like I said, setting these cameras up is a no brainer and the mobile application is fantastic and easy to use. I also like the Apple TV app for arlo. The cameras are made really well and they really do well in cold, hot, wet, or snowy weather. I haven’t had any issues to report after having my original first three cameras for over a year. For the price, I wish the cameras were higher resolution. 1080p seems to be fairly standard these days for cameras, but you get a lower quality 720p with the Arlo Pro cameras. They get the job done though. I love that I didn’t have to wire any of the cameras, and the base station easily hooks up to your existing router. Overall, I’m very happy with the Arlo projects. I would like the Arlo Pro 2 cameras which have 1080p, but I’m too invested in my current setup to hand out the extra cash for the higher resolution.

Kids having friends over while we're out etc. This system does that to a tee. You can purchase a 24/7 recording service from Arlo if you want an always ""on"" security system too. I use the FREE 7 day cloud recording that is available right out of the box. I love the ""modes"" option, you can set camera's to record ITTT scenarios, disarm, only certain cameras to record while others push notify you. The phone app is very easy and intuitive. Live video is great, there is a delay like people say, but it all depends on your internet speed. I have 500mb down, 50mb up and my delay is only about 1-2 seconds. All live video is delayed through the internet anyways, you will never get a true live feed from any service out there. Night vision is great.

BTW the reason I bought this as a spare is because one of my cameras quit. I tried every thing with it to no avail until the new camera arrived then my last attempt to get the old camera working was successful. I didn't do anything different, just the luck of the draw I guess. Full story:- I bought a 5 camera system about two years ago. Everything was fine and I was impressed with the system until about 12 months ago. Then I started getting two phone alerts for every motion event. A bit annoying but whatever. Then about 4 months after that I start getting 3 phone alerts for each motion event, then a bit later 4. At this point I decided to try to get some customer support from Arlo ……. it's a joke. If you go look at the forums you'll see Arlo commented to the multiple alerts issue in June 2018 saying they were aware of the issue and were investigating. Some people were reporting 7 notifications for each motion event ……... I couldn't find any further updates in the community pages so I went to online chat for help. I wasted 2 hours last Friday evening following the (obviously scripted) instructions. When we got to where the guy wanted me to uninstall the app I was reluctant. I had seen in the community pages people saying that every time they removed and reinstalled the app they got another additional notification. I had kinda run out of time anyway (late Friday night after a long work week) so I decided to live with the multiple alerts. That lasted over the weekend until it got to be intolerable. today I uninstalled then re-installed the app. as the guy had recommended. Guess what …… now I get no alerts ……. zero ….. So tonight (Monday) I spent 2 hours on online chat where the best advice the girl could give me was ""you're going to have to wait until your cell phone company rolls out Android 9 then call us back to see if the problem persists"". Seriously ……… Arlo doesn't test their app updates on the last version of android????? I persisted and said I wanted to talk to a supervisor. They told me it would be no more than an hour ……… after about an hour the phone rings, I answer it and keep saying hello for about 30 secs then the other end hangs up. I called the number back from caller id and give my case number etc. then I'm told that the supervisor had tried to call me multiple times with no answer. Why would they lie about stupid things like that. Eventually through persistence I was connected with the supervisor and asked about the claim they had called multiple time, she told me ""no I only called once"". Long story short Arlo has no idea when they will be able to resolve my issue ……….. if you want a security camera system that may or may not work (surprise) Arlo will be a fun ride for you but if you want a no hassle well supported security camera system I recommend you look elsewhere. Me …. I'm going to end up throwing my $1000 Arlo security camera system in the trash ….. EDIT July 2019 - As a result of Arlo responding to my review I reached out to them. The phone call with customer support took place today. I spent another 2 hours on the phone following the instructions of the Arlo guy. He had me change about every setting in the App and many on my phone, even one's that logically couldn't possibly affect the notification function. Result - no change. My impression is that he was reaching in the dark and didn't seem to have a logical thought out plan of trouble shooting. At the end of the call he told me my case will be elevated and they would contact me with any updates - exactly the same process, result and empty assurance I had been given in my call with Arlo CS back in April. Now I have to go back into my phone settings and try to remember all the things he had me change so I can change them back. NOT HAPPY!!!!","The Arlo phone app is terrible, as is Arlo customer support"

After customer service help and readjusting the setting on the cameras, I’ve accepted  the faults are due to poor quality. For example, the camera in the back yard has no obstructions. No roads, cars, or any other background that could set off a false alarm. So on this camera I have the sensitivity on high. Through out the day I get alerts showing me light changes as clouds pass by the sun, but I can walk right past the camera when it’s armed and it won’t activate. I would say these cameras work about 70% of the time. Most times a person walking past will activate them, but 30% of the time they fail. If the price was less I would be more satisfied, but their high price gives the customer the allusion of better quality. But they are not.",Motion dectection and sound quality are poor

Cameras work great when they work. Very easy set up, but one of my (less than a week old) cameras had an issue and their support gave me an RMA. $10 charge to ship back a camera I received earlier in the week....(I had already thrown out the boxes or I could have a returned it to Amazon).  The App is sweet and set up a breeze. I was just disappointed that a brand new camera costs me $10 to get it fixed/replaced. I call BS. The Arlo App for the cameras was a breeze to set up and configure. Cameras seem to function well and get good quality pictures. The base unit was easy to set up with Syncing each camera. Support has been very helpful when there was an issue. I'm just dinging them 3 stars due to me having to pay shipping for a brand new camera malfunction. We set up 4 of these and an Arlo Q (indoor) with a breeze. I did like the outdoor covers I got from eBoot and you have to get the brick mounts for outside, which are nice too.  I didn't have confidence in the suction cup mount and returned it, as I saw that when the suction cup gives out, the camera drops and breaks. These are too pricey for that.  The wall mounts are easy to use and set up.",Disappointed. Be prepared to pay shipping (even for a new camera) to get it fixed. Otherwise the working ones are pretty cool.

I purchased my first product about 5 years ago and am now a paid subscriber with several cameras. Everything was fine (except for normal connection issues), until two months ago when one of my new cameras stopped working just one month after purchase. I called the support and they walked me through a few basic diagnostic steps, which I had done before anyways (disconnect the camera, reset the camera, log in and out of account, change wifi channel). Clearly it didn't work so after another call they said they would replace my camera. The CSA said he would send me an email with the RMA information. After 4 days I still didn't have the email so called again and the new CSA said oh the previous person made a mistake and that she would send me a new email. I received that email right away and it did have an RMA number, but the email asked me to check the status of RMA approval online. After one week, nothing had happened and I called again and they said oh sorry that email was wrong and you were supposed to send your camera in before we can send you a new camera (by the way, the email had Netgear's phone number, not Arlo's, and Netgear said we don't handle Arlo's issues). Yes, they expected me to pay for shipping for a faulty camera that was still under warranty. The next person said he was going to make an *exception* and send me a new camera and then I can send them my camera. I feel this has to be the standard procedure anyways when your product is not working. Two weeks later, I still didn't have a camera. I called again and the new person said oh sorry the previous person had made a mistake and our warehouse had trouble processing this request. He promised he would follow up with me the next day and send me the camera. Five days after that I still haven't received a call and I still don't have a camera---two months after reporting the issue to Arlo. This has been very frustrating. The first phone call should have solved the issue. While I understand manufacturing problems do occur, I do question Arlo's customer service practices. I am currently, as I write, on the phone waiting for a CS supervisor. I will update this review as the case progresses.",Great product; AWFUL customer service

The first week i had them i did use the 2 way audio to calm her down on a few occasions, but after that, the only camera activity on it would be for a few seconds each activation. several times a day.

These cameras are great when they work. I have found that after using them for 2+ years that they have some shortcomings. First of all the biggest problem I find is the motion detection is very spotty at best. I have literally had one camera record based on motion and not far away another did not. So you have a very spotty record of what went on. For example I had a prowler on my property and of the 3 cameras the individual went by only 2 out of the 3 recorded something. I have seen this occur in multiple instances. So you end up with a spotty record of what went on but I guess it is better than nothing. Even when the cameras are set to 100% motion detection at times they will totally ignore motion. So be warned these are not perfect.,Motion Detection Spotty at Best...
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2019,JJ,"I ordered two add-on cameras for my Arlo Pro to serve as “cat-cams” in my living room and kitchen. The installation process said to hold the button in on the top of the camera until the blue light blinked, but instead you have to press and release it; otherwise it won’t blink. I figured it out but the instructions should be updated. Also, Arlo doesn’t make it easy to learn which base model I had purchased years ago so I knew which add-ons to get - there should be a way to view that in the app, such as Help, About, or even just the camera description, but I had to go look up my original order. Again, I figured it out but Arlo should make it easier. Also, there don’t seem to be any good surface mount stands for these cameras other than the short little stubby ones offered by Arlo - you might as well just set the camera on the surface as the stands only provide an inch or two of height. But the cameras do stick and the mounts hold, and you can direct the cameras which is nice. However, Arlo should offer a stand that is higher - I wanted to put a camera on the top of my hutch and one on the top of my bookcase but due to the moulding at the top of both tall pieces of furniture, the mount was far too low and I had to use books or something else to give them height, which I didn’t really want to do. I don’t want to drill holes in my ceiling and I don’t want my cameras on all the time, so there should be a stand with more height to allow for aiming around the room from on top of tall pieces of furniture or cabinetry, which usually have moulding. Lastly, the app should be more user friendly - you have to click around to every available page to find what you’re looking for. I could easily “sell” these cameras to friends and family but I know they will come to me for tech support - Arlo should make their app easier to navigate and more intuitive so less techy people are more comfortable getting started and using them.",Good cameras but technology isn’t as user friendly as it could be

Arlo Pro has it figured out. Add a sixth camera and you have to buy the upgraded package to get it to work. Rip-off! Worse thing, after the first charge that lasted 3 months, subsequent charges only lasted 2 weeks. Customer service is worthless, I don't speak Hindi or whatever language it is. I was on hold for 50 minutes waiting for a rep. Pathetic! Got no resolution after 2 hours on the phone. You will spend more time in keeping the system running than the $1,000 cost and not so convenience as advertised. The good...easy set-up, syncing, and installing. No wiring! Yay!  App and computer website is very good. Bad...Magnetic ball hangers are a joke to hang. Only one pivoting screw in type included. Expensive for what you get and here is why. You can walk directly at the camera and it will not capture your image. I am 6 feet-212 pounds and it won't capture me no matter the walk pace. Speaking of walk pace, if you cross the field of view quickly it will not capture an image either, car, human, dog, elephant. Arlo needs to correct that and quickly. It is slow also. It takes forever to download, update live view and view recordings. Convenient and better than nothing but Arlo needs to fix their customer service, camera motion detector, battery drain and speed up the processing.","Mostly bad, some good, just avoid"
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jul 2019,SierraTheWolfe,"App Review: Overall I love these security cameras, but to speak through the microphone to output audio on the app is flawed. The microphone sensitivity barely picks up your voice and in order to get the speakers on the cameras to be loud enough to be heard, you have to raise the volume of your voice directly at the microphone area of your tablet or smartphone. However if you have a headset or headphones with a microphone where you can adjust the microphone up close it works slightly better. I think the app needs to allow microphone sensitivity adjustments.  The app also cannot format your data storage device such as an External HDD or Flash Drive without encountering errors. Thus you have to disconnect the entire data storage device and reformat it upon the PC. Website Portal Review: As for the website after applying proper web settings, I noticed there are no issues with the audio as long as you own a headset and computer. You can format the data storage devices without any issues. I am getting to the point where the website is far more better than the app itself. Camera Review: The battery life on these cameras are amazing if you plan to go wireless, but it all depends on your settings. The higher quality of recording and how long or when it should record means you will have less battery life. However, there are power saving features which is nice to have and you can prolong the battery life without sacrificing too much video recording quality. I can get roughly a month on a single charge when I set up power saving settings properly if I am lucky. However if you have kids and animals, expect these cameras to die quickly if they are triggered by motion movements within view. Again depends on your settings. I can also plug in the charger with usb cable Live streaming or viewing old recordings is a breeze through both the app and website. Additionally there is a few seconds or slightly more video delay when watching live, but that is to be expected and depends on your internet speeds. You also have the ability to take a screenshot of a still frame within a live streaming or previously recorded video.  The image resolution quality all depends on your camera settings, but at the highest settings there are no issues. Daytime and Nighttime video and audio recordings are crystal clear. You'll get the full RGB spectrum for daylight recordings while at night you'll receive black and white with greyscale recordings. Works in a variety of light conditions with no issues. You don't need to have a subscription to use these cameras and can use a storage device or network pathway to store videos and pictures. However the subscription route may be best if you need better security features and further camera support which vary from 2.99 to 14.99 a month depending on your needs. Push notifications and alerts are improved, option to dial emergency services as long as it is supported in your area or alert a friend with one touch of a button. All media stored can be downloaded, shared (share a direct url link to the video or image via email or on any social media platform or website) and donate (give Arlo developers your video, so they can research and make improvements on their devices and software). The image quality aka video resolution depends on your power saving settings and when or how to record. Camera accessories: There is a huge list of accessories such as tripods, protective covers, indoor / outdoor power chargers or cables, additional batteries and housings. So many that you are like a kid in a candy store. Plenty of options to choose from. I do wish there were more accessories that featured what Ring could offer, but maybe down in the future. I'd love a door bell or two way face to face communication. Charging Support: Sadly you can't use any random charger in your house because many or not all will be compatible with these Cameras. They require proper voltage ratings to be able to charge these cameras. However Arlo does sale an external charger with usb cable for 14.99 if you want to constantly go without charging or charge it every so often. You can however use almost any micro usb cable as long as it fits into the micro usb camera port. Using a different charger will prompt an warning error, but there are some third party chargers that will work with these cameras. You can keep the camera plugged in directly to the charger at all times, but the usb cable can be obstruct the mount slightly if you are placing your camera at a tight corner or at a certain angle. I recommend finding a right angle charging cable or adapter that will fit into the camera's charging port. Overall these are good security cameras and I love the portability. I can use these cameras for almost any purpose such as keeping tabs on the baby sitter or as a nanny cam or keeping my apartment or home safe from intruders. I guess you could use this to record wild life if you wanted to, but all up to your imagination. I do recommend these security cameras and there different versions of these cameras, so do some research on which one is perfect for you.","The App needs work, but the cameras are amazing."

In the day mine will trip a car coming down the road from 100'.  Since the area its scans isn't square but in the shape of a cone, the closer you are the shorter the distance is.  I now have a total of 5 cameras up and on all 5 they seem to trip better from camera right.  All are a minimum of 7' in the air. I used an inline wifi extender under my front window and plugged ( Linksys AC1900 Gigabit Range Extender / WiFi Booster / Repeater MU-MIMO (Max Stream RE7000) ) and plugged the base station into it.  That allowed me to mount 2 camera's on the side of the house across the street from me (~200 ft/).  I have those set to trip the cameras on my house plus record from the camera that was tripped.  Gives us both a way to better track the car/person similar to ""follow me"". I have added Arlo smart to all cameras ($39 per camera, per year). As of 9/16/17 Arlo Smart is basically in beta but once trained it does quite well with people and animals close to the camera and cars during the day from quite a distance. At night car lights tend to trip it but Smart does not register it as a car.  Once trained you can set it to send push notification for only for 1 or all; animal, person, vehicle.  If it can't detect what it is, you will still get the motion notice.  It will record all motion detections. The batteries will last much longer once you start to trust it and don't use live view very often. To save battery also setup a schedule so when you don't need one or more of the cameras active they are suspended from tripping.  They are not off so you can still use live view.  From the app or the browser you can completely turn off one or more of the cameras.",Works amazing well during the day but outside at night not ...

Wish I would have had them earlier as they appear to work a deterrent.

If you have teenagers they work well as a sneaking out deterrent. Quality: The quality of the video is great. Day obviously being the best, but the camera performs well at night too. Sound: I don't listen to the sound very often in the video but every once i a while I will mention something my to my 5 year old that she said while in the driveway to mess with her. For a while she believed me when I said I was hiding on the roof. So the sound quality is good enough to mess with your kids.

Or because of bugs in the app that the support team cannot really solve (check the support forum), probably under-staffed. * The delay for alerts. Recording starts after a few seconds, variable depending on your situation, but we are talking about 3-5 seconds, which can make the recording just useless. * Notifications are terrible.

The pictures are VERY clear and we have it on the medium setting to help with battery life.  So far we have not charged our outdoor camera and it is always picking up our flag blowing into frame.  It starts recording before someone even walks up which is awesome! It will even pick up sound from our neighbors house clear as day, and we are not that close to them! We also have a camera in our dog room.  It has been a great addition although it will not pick up motion by them, I am not sure if it is because the room is 9 ft deep and only 4.5 feet wide or what.  It does pick up every time they bark though.  I have all the setting on sensitive so I have just settled with the audio and no motion. The two way voice is to die for! I can hear very clear and usually my pets can hear me too. The night mode is great and picks up stray cats walking up our patio and even bugs flying around.  My husband and I both have iPhone and the app works most of the time.  Every once in a while it will say that it could not log onto the cameras or there is a problem with the connection, we just reload and try again.

I ended up buying a 3 pack of 9V usb quick chargers for basically the same price as Netgear S&H charge but now I can charge 3 batteries instead of 1. If you plan on buying these cameras just avoid Netgear support altogether and solve the hardware problems yourself. @Netgear step your game up, do right by your customers, and stop being penny wise, pound foolish.

It’s convinence to have the cordless camera that we are able to move the camera around to get different angles but as to quality of the video is not close to professional and plus the camera doesn’t work right after six months. During these couple months I covered the camera with silicone covers from the beginning but now it seems that the camera will record 2-3mins of nothing and the image is ....... well you can judge for yourself. Although it’s 1080p but the video can only let you know whether there is movement but you won’t able to make out either license plate or faces over 10ft and if lighting is bad than good luck! I had Nest cam around same time I got Arlo, and downsides of Nest is it needs to plug in all the time and it will go offline for time to time if the wireless internet is not stable. It’s 1080p just like Arlo so similar problem with seeing the face clearing and license plate when make report to police. However the image quality is never as bad as Arlo whereas all your see is blur of color blocks on your screen. If your are away from your house, and received Arlo alert, you have to wait 5-8mins for the app to download the images whereas Nest you just wait 3-5sec for the app to open and you are able to see instant images right away. Anyway, I am done with these ‘toy’ cameras, none of them provide enough image quality to identify face or able to make out a license plate from 70ft (which is how long our driveway is) I lived in the city and gets people wondering around the neighborhood a lot so I will definitely consider 4K camera and self recording system after these experiments.",Broke down after six months

This is very critical when something goes down and you need immediate access.  The two-step should be an option, not mandatory.  Arlo says you only have to do it once.  That is not an accurate statement.",Mandatory Two-Step Authentication

I called Cox and had them put me on a different channel, turns out I was getting interference from other wi-fi- in the area, now It works flawlessly. Need to be a little bit techy to navigate but once you use it, it has some options you will like. I turn it off during the day so the battery lasts a very long time.You can take pictures or video like I said nice options with this system. The camera is at least 60 feet away from the base and modem, operating  through walls and works great.I also bought the mounting stand which has a great range of positions, and the skins that give it more protection from the weather, also the stand and skins are black for stealth. Arlo has a user forum  to use should you run into problems that gets a very fast response from other users rather than calling Arlo for help.",Great System

Please learn from my costly mistake. First, IF the base is actually online & hasn’t gone offline on its own, chances are the camera won’t actually connect the first, second or third time you try to watch it. It might work IF you manually turn the camera off and then back on via the app. And oh, you think it’ll stay on when you turn the next camera off/on? Well that’s just silly. This is probably why no more ratings are allowed with the package that includes the base. Oh and how to you reconnect cameras if your internet goes out?  You have to manually remove the battery from each & every camera. Seriously.  Run. Don’t buy this.",Always offline

At first I was a little hesitant.  It is very pricy.  The range is ok.  But it does something that nothing else does.  It is fully wireless.  Not cables for signal or power.  We originally purchased these so that we could set them up away from the house looking at the house.  Then we would know if something broke a window (like a speeding bird). I have found an additional use for them that is great.  I use them as test cameras for my wired in cameras.  Before I run a cable, I setup an Arlo camera at the location to see if it will is a good setup.  That lets me tweak my setup before the expense of running cables.  Why don't I just use Arlo?  1 - cost, 2 - it doesn't work with Blue Iris.  So where I can cable a camera, I do.  Where I can't cable a camera I use Arlo Pro. Battery life is also fantastic.  If you place them where they have a decent signal to the base station, and they are not constantly triggering motion, then the batteries have been lasting me about 5-6 months.  If there is lots and lots of motion, my battery life was down around 3 months.","Costly, but very flexible and easy to use.  Wife loves them."

After deciding that I didn't want the hassle and all of the work to install a wired system I closely compared the Arlo Pro to the Nest cameras.  I ultimately picked the Arlo Pro because there is absolutely nothing else to buy if the 7 day cloud storage is good enough (which it is for me).  I believe the Nest camera requires a fee for cloud storage.  I didn't get the newer model Arlo with higher definition because my understanding is that it needs to be plugged in to power for HD, and that defeats the purpose of having a wire-free system for me. I have one camera looking at my porch and another camera looking at my driveway.  I used the magnet mount for my driveway camera because I can reach out my upstairs window to remove the camera for charging.  The magnet mount is very sturdy.  I purchased an Arlo mount for my porch camera because I didn't want someone to be able to easily steal it...even though it is bit of a reach to grab. I spent a lot of time playing with the sensitivities, and my cameras get 15-30 hits a day.  Part of that is due to a sunflower by my porch that moves in the wind and also due to the fact that there is more activity at my house in the summer than there is the rest of the year.  Even with all of that activity I've had the cameras up for 2 months and am still at 32% and 22% power.  I am very impressed by that. All in all this is a great product and I am very happy. PROS: 1.  Super easy to set up both the cameras and the software. 2.  Software is very straight forward and there are a lot of you tube videos explaining it if you get confused. 3.  Battery life has been great so far. 4.  Night vision is great. 5.  Sound from the cameras is very good. 6.  Being able to remotely view live video from anywhere (phone, PC, etc.) is very nice. CONS - And these aren't really cons, because the cameras work exactly as advertised. 1.  Image quality is just OK.  You can't read license plates with these cameras, but if you need that you need the HD model. 2.  There is a couple second delay and the speaker on the cameras is not very loud.  If you are trying to use one of these as a video doorbell and have a conversation with someone it is not ideal. 3.  The cameras trigger by motion going across the field of view, but won't trigger if you come straight at the camera.  The Arlo instructions are very up front about this, so you have to take that into account when you mount them so you are catching things crossing the path of the camera.",Good cameras for a wire-free solution.

The Arlo Pro resolved both of those problems. But I still read many verified user reviews before I purchased because I didn't want to invest in something that either didn't work or didn't have high quality video.. Installation was very simple, it took me more time to get out my ladder and put the screw into the eaves than it took to plug in the base to my router and sync the cameras.. I'm happy that I don't have to go back up the ladder for six months to recharge the battery. That's amazing technology, that makes my life better. It's so relaxing that I can see what's going on at my home from miles away. When I was out of town last weekend and my friend came to stay at the house, I freaked her out by saying hello when she got out of her car. The system is easy to access by either using the app on my phone or on a PC so I can have live views whenever I feel the need. I'm very happy with my purchase but I might add another camera and even though they are weatherproof, I think I'll buy some silicone skin covers to further protect my investment. I definitely recommend for someone like me who wants the latest technology that is also convenient to use.","Excellent Camera, Great Value"

When we needed to recharge them the app said the chargers were not compatible with the cameras. Upon further inspection it appeared that neither the chargers or cables were made for Arlo devices. We requested a replacement and we finally got what we initially were looking for. The difference from what we originally got to the replacement is night and day. From the box to the finishing screws it looks like the replacement is actually made by Arlo.  We tested the charger and cables immediately and everything worked great. The picture was even better as well. If you choose to buy I recommend you test the charger immediately.

The picture quality on the cameras is very good however for unknown reasons the picture on two of the cameras would switch to black and white only.  I called tech support a few times.  Not only because of two of the cameras showing black and white only,  but also because the two way listen and speak button was not available on the app they provide.  Also noticed their website and videos featured a camera positioning button that could be used to set up the cameras. When I called Tech support, it was disappointing to find that my call had been shipped off shore to tech support staff where English is not their first language. I had trouble understanding them and them me. When I asked questions they did not seem to know the answers particularly when I told them the app they provide does not support the listen and talk feature as well as the fact that the camera positioning function is simply not there as indicated on their website.  They seemed genuinely confused and didn't really have an answer.  They also said there would be an app update biut did not know when.

Once you get over the insanely inflated price & lie to your wife, it’s definitely worth investing in BUT this is NOT a system for live monitoring. It’s not capable of running your settings if you’re monitoring a camera in live mode 👎. The system does not come with a user manual so your left researching what the terminology & meaning of settings are. The slickest option is your can use any camera as a motion sensor to tell the other cameras to start recording. The battery life is way way over rated. At the minimal settings I had to recharge all 4 cameras with in 10 days so I purchased 2 outdoor power adapters, plugged those into a iHome smart plug & established a schedule via the iOS Home app to turn on the smart plug every Monday for 60 minutes. Now I can optimize my camera settings on my 2 primary cameras & not worry about the battery.

(i.e. start monitoring every night from 11pm to 5am automatically) Camera battery life is fantastic. I have put them in my vacation house for 6+ months without any worry about needing a recharge. If for some reason they lose power to the base station, however, they will die very fast as I suppose they will constantly search for the wireless signal. Motion detection algorithm seems good. I've never had a false alert and have these constantly monitoring for months at a time. I love the magnetic backs - they make it extremely easy to place the cameras. Cons: Cameras run through Arlo servers and when the servers go down you lose your connection to the cameras. This has not happened often as far as I have noticed but when it does happen it is obviously a big security risk. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. Bonus: I turn my android phone on Do not disturb at night, and I keep it so Arlo can still notify me of events, but sometimes I sleep with earplugs.

The motion sensor, even at its least sensitive setting, captured far too much - every time the wind blew and a tree in our yard moved even slightly, the sensor would start recording which drained the batteries quickly.  However, the low overall score for me comes from the terrible experience we had when our Arlo stopped charging.  We were easily able to diagnose the problem as the camera, not the battery or charging cable.  However, the Arlo tech support insisted on sending us a new battery and then new charging cables to try, taking over a month of back and forth to confirm the camera was broken.  Then they required a convoluted return process where they issued an RMA but made us call to confirm the RMA, then want us to send the defective camera back at our own cost.  They have dragged us around for nearly 2 months to repair the camera, using lots of red tape and delay tactics.

No cables neeeded.  Easy to position (and move), rechargable long-lived li ion batteries, free 7 day cloud storage, several ways to control when they are active.  I mostly use the ""schedule"" mode.  There is a location mode that uses your smartphone location to activate/deactivate the system, but my wife is often in the house when I leave, and I also found that occasionally the system would activate when it thought I'd left my house when I didn't.  Since these are so portable, I have a couple that I don't mount so that when we go on vacation, I can just set down (and disguise) in locations for which I don't when in town (such as in a bookshelf in my home office).  Nice to know if the house cleaner/pet sitter/house watcher is going where they shouldn't.  The email alerts work great (with a snapshot of the triggering scene and link to the cloud video), and the app is fast and robustly featured.  These have their own dedicated wifi base station which must be wired to your router.  Since it has limited range, I located it centrally by using a  NETGEAR PowerLINE NETGEAR PowerLINE 1200 Mbps, 1 Gigabit Port (PL1200-100PAS) adaptor to simulate ethernet connection to my router.  If you have a large house with cameras quite distant, you may need to get two controllers.  Saying that, I'm not sure if you could link cams on different controllers to the same free cloud account.  Worst case, you create two accounts, and just have to login/out when you want to switch. I wish I had the 1080p version, but those cost about twice as much at this time so I don't think it's worth it.  I've also had a problem when using my outdoor cams during daytime when the sun is out.  I THINK moving shadows created from wind-blown tree branches will cause it to activate.  I ended up turning the sensitivity way down to avoid lots of false alarms.  I'd have to spend more time to trouble-shoot to know if it actually was the shadows or if there were unseen blowing leaves or something of that sort.",Best home security cams (for 720p)

But, there are MANY downsides you need to accept: 1.  You will be changing/charging batteries about once per month.  (Your mileage may vary.) 2. You will NOT get all of the action.  The cameras don't start recoding until the action has already started, so you will miss 2-5 seconds of action.  This does not sound like a lot, but it often causes you to miss something critical. 3. The range of motion detection is VERY limited.  I would say 20 feet at best.  Again, this will cause you to miss a lot of action. 4. The quality of the picture, even at the highest setting is just OK. 5. The distance the cameras can be from the base station is limited.  With the base station at the back of my house, my front camera could not connect.  It is VERY picky. If you are OK with all of that, then the Arlo Pro is an OK system.  Its biggest selling point is obviously that the cameras are completely wireless.  But, I feel the trade-offs are still to great for this system to be useful. I tried the Nest Outdoor cameras.  They only require power.  Once seeing how good that system worked, there was just no way I could accept issues with the Arlo.  Sure, running power is a pain, but the camera system is AMAZING.",OK System if you MUST HAVE WIRELESS

The cameras have been installed for about a week or so (June 2019).  In any case, the install was pretty easy and the setup process is fine.  Now for performance.  I have two cameras on my front porch.  Camera one (right side) has great night vision, but poor audio and motion detection.  It rarely detects people walking on the sidewalk - maybe 20 feet away, and if a car drives by at anything over walking speed, all I get to see is the back of the car.  Running about 8 hours per day, the battery in this camera will probably last about 14 to 21 days.  Camera two is opposite side of the porch from camera one and supposedly covers the other side of the front (left side).  Motion and audio detection is not very good, and equal to camera one.  The battery on this side is just awful.  In two days it went from 100% (indicated) to 41%.  After one week it went to 12%, so I shut it off.  One thing I noticed is that this camera has a solar light that illuminates a flag.  That light fools the camera into thinking night is day, so there is no night vision, just daytime like color vision.  Not very useful, so the camera is not shut off.  Given the very limited battery life, and not wanting to get a ladder out and charge  camera one every two weeks, I am thinking about the solar charger.  It gets terrible reviews becuase it doesn't seem to be able to actually charge the cameras, but I already have $300 USD invested in it, so if I throw away another $80, so what.  If it works, 50/50 chance, I'm ahead.  Reading the reviews of Netgear's off shore customer service has convinced me that I'm on my own, and I don't need the aggravation of dealing with someone reading a script, but the ultimate answer of ""no"".  I'm going to change position of camera one to see if it actually detects motion.  If I find that this whole exercise is a waste of time, I'll put the whole thing on eBay and see if I can recover any of my expenditures.

The first one was too complicated to setup.  I really like how easy it was to setup and the image quality is fantastic.  This camera is 100% cordless.  What I cannot get over is that the battery is still working great after being out in the AZ sun all this summer when it has been over 100 every day.  How is that possible?  Why can't they put this technology in my cell phone battery? I only have 2 complaints which is the ""only"" reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  When it detects movement and notifies me by email on my cell phone.  It takes so long before I can see what is happening or talk to the person who is at the door, they have already left.  It takes a while minute which doesn't sound like a long time but long enough for the person at the door to assume nobody is there. My other complaint is that if I talk to the person outside from my cell phone, they can barely hear me but I can hear them outside at the camera as clear as day.  Now on my laptop they can hear me fine so it might just be my cell phone but I have tried everything possible.","If you like easy to setup, this is the camera for you."

The voice feature has been handy to tell her that her phone is off the hook and we cant call her.  The unit was not to hard to set up.

Shipped it in on 5/22/18 and received a replacement on 5/31/18.  However the replacement camera did not have the battery in it.  The warranty terms & agreements said Do not include manuals, softwear, cables or mounting brackets.  Which by the way is all external stuff.  It does not say do not include the battery.  I called support and they said I shouldn't have sent it in with the battery. I told her we have a charging issue I reasonably thought you would want to look at the battery too and it does not say that in the warranty instructions.  After she consulted with the team supervisor she said they will be sending me a battery.  I told her she needs to pass on that  its not mentioned in the Warranty Terms about not sending in the battery.

As a single woman with 2 teenagers, I often worry about their safety when they are home alone, as well as my safety when I am home alone.  Netgears continued improvement of the technology and camera design and capabilities has only further validated I have taken right decision in choosing Netgear Arlo Cameras.

These cameras have successfully helped us get 4 different incidents of trespassing and vandalism called into the police and result in arrests.  Best investment ever.

Unfortunately, the Arlo developers seem to be on a self destruction crusade.  Word of warning, do your due diligence before making any purchase.  This includes spending some time on their Community Forum.  There you will find how recent alleged firmware and app ""upgrades"" have diminished the capability and quality of the system and ignited thousands of complaints and created a host of disgruntled customers.  Their disregard for the customer is glaringly obvious, yet, devoid of any reason or common sense.  I have been an Arlo system owner for over a year and a half.  I have two base stations and 7 Arlo Pro cameras.  I planned on expanding my security system but those plans are on hold indefinitely with the advent of their meddling.  I purchased their mounts, camera skins, battery charger and several extra batteries.  Since their latest ""upgrades,"" the batteries are more necessary than I had ever dreamed as they now prematurely run out of juice. The support though is the weakest link.  It is as if they pay no attention to the forum comments and ask each of us to jump through unnecessary and unwarranted hoops.  All of which results in a vast amount of lost time and effort.  Never do they admit responsibility nor even acknowledge a problem exists. At this point I am researching other avenues for home security.  Too bad.  They seemed to have a good product which could have been built upon.  Not the tact Netgear has chosen to take though.  Unfortunate.",Use Caution!!

In July 2018 I called NETGEAR to get the first one replaced under warranty.  It was a lengthy phone call but I did get it replaced free of charge.  Two more died so I called 7/25/18 to get them replaced.  During the first phone call the gentlemen took all the information (serial number of batteries) and stated they would replace.  Now a little over a month later, an additional phone call on 8/15/18 (Netgear stated ""I should receive in the next day or two"") and two more phone calls today I am HOPING to receive two new batteries in 3-5 business days.  To help paint the picture here is the results of todays phone calls:  No batteries have been received so I once again called NETGEAR and this phone called resulted in the customer service rep stating batteries were only under warranty for six months.  All I could think of was a six month warranty for a $48.00 battery - ridiculous.  I got off of the phone and immediately started searching the web and saw strings stating batteries were under warranty for 12 months but I could not find the details of the Arlo Pro warranty within the NETGEAR website or the Arlo website.  I finally had an aha moment so went to my account under NETGEAR - hurray I registered this product - I clicked on it and it did say in black and white that I had a year warranty for ""accessories"".  So, I called back and conveyed what I found.  At least 90 minutes spent trying to rectify but I should have two batteries in my hot little hands in 3-5 business days saving myself $96.00.

This is a limitation that does not improve no matter how strong your signal is to the base station, or if you have the cameras plugged in. Arlo also limits the features on the free plan, such as inability to create motion zones. The cameras will pick up moving leaves, a waving flag, etc, meaning you will get hundreds of alerts per day unless you turn down the sensitivity to unusable levels where it will not even detect a walking person. They had released motion zones to free users for a short time, but that appears to have been removed. Look elsewhere for a better quality video system, I am sure some exist with free plans.

Reading the specifications I discovered that Arlo met all of my requirements and then some.  Gone was the requirement to run wires for power or invest in wifi cameras.  With this added perk I quickly placed my order. After the camera kit arrived I saw for myself how easy it was to deploy these cameras and included base station.  The pairing process is super fast and simple.  I’m able to easilyplace cameras where I want them and the magnetic base makes for very easy and specific positioning for the perfect viewing area. The mobile app is very nicely designed and has a pleasant and easy to use layout.  The cameras can be individually controlled and interacted with, alongwith very intuitive controls to set a manual recording or engage the two way audio which is a very nice feature when using the cameras indoors.  You can also use mobile devices in a geofence co figuration to trigger armingof the cameras for motion detection. The video and photo quality is great at 720P HD and I’d say it’s about what you’d expect for security cameras.  I like the built in digital zoom options and the ability to stream or download saved clips. Overall this is as close to perfect as I’ve seen for a solution where you need a completely wireless solution.

Worked pretty well for a few months, but over time, the video lag went from 3-or-4 seconds out of the box (which was bad enough) to 14 seconds today (today is October 25, 2019).  Worse yet - and perhaps related to the performance degradation described above - Arlo has forced a new app on its users this year - and it is terrible.  The “legacy” app is exponentially better (thank goodness we saved it).  What are they paying their developers?  I spent the first half of 2019 recommending Arlo to friends and I am now steering everyone away from it and will probably replace our base station + 3 with a new WiFi video security system this Christmas.  Have to say that the cameras are totally waterproof, easy to connect, and deliver high quality video - but what use is all that if it takes the camera 5-10 seconds to detect motion (whatever it is that you need to see is gone before the camera starts recording) - and the 14 second delay in “live” mode is super frustrating.

I have an Arlo Q and another interior Arlo in addition to this Pro, so I was familiar with the app and it wasn't bad to navigate. Pros: • Good picture, an app that I can navigate. • It paired up to my existing Netgear base station and showed up in the app quickly. • Has geofencing that works, unlike the Ring Spotlight that I returned previously to a local electronics place. Cons: • I live on the NY/Canada border. This camera is inside of the garage, pointing out to the back yard. When the garage temp is in the 20's, it's too cold for the charger (plugged in 24/7 in my case) to work because the battery is too cold. The battery has remained at 97% for the last 2 days though. So it remains to be seen how practical this will be for my area. • The slider switch for motion detection sensitivity is counter intuitive. A search turns up the fact that many folks agree. Sliding it toward the still figure icon reduces sensitivity while sliding it toward the running person icon increases sensitivity. You would thing that larger motions require less sensitivity and lesser motions require more. Perhaps Netgear could address this in future app updates. I was clearly in view of the camera shoveling snow and no motion was detected. I'll continue adjusting sensitivity to see if I can remedy this. Maybe this lack of recording is due to the cold battery and is a power conservation thing. Not much of a security cam if it can't detect a person and begin recording. I may update this review as time and experience come into play and I can offer more insights. Well, it's update time. I returned the camera. Try as I might, the only way the camera would detect motion is if I physically moved the camera itself or if I was directly in front of it at the 1-2 foot mark. I read up on the Netgear forums. I tweaked every setting and pencil icon I could find. All to no avail. So back the Pro went to be replaced by an Arlo Q. I have one of those in another location and so far, so good with that one.","I like Arlo cams in general, but this one was not so good."

Forget instant notifications.  What was working great for months-now is a complete broken piece of junk. I am contacting them for a full refund as they have taken a great (really-I'd have given it 5 stars if they used the old app) product and have ruined it. If you have Arlo now-don't update to the new app (it's not an existing update-but a whole new app they make you download).  I think it switches over 9/30 at which time is research Netgear and see if they are making their own.  I think they owned the Arlo system. So bummed,All earlier reviews are moot bc the old app is done as of 9/30/19.

If you order this camera expecting the Arlo Pro 2 1080p version (Model #VMC4030P) as advertised, you will receive the cheaper, older model Arlo Pro 720p version (Model #VMC4030) I have had multiple phone calls with amazon customer service to straighten this issue out and we came to a satisfactory resolution - but be aware, this particular item is improperly labeled as 1080p when it is not.

I took it to charge, it shows back to 75%  sometimes and shows 1% some other times. The video quality is horrible too. It is always blur, worse than regular Arlo camera. I thought the Len got dirty so I gently cleaned with wet wipes but it is still the same. Jeeeeeeerz it is fine so far (one week use). but obviously more improvements can be reached: 1. the camera should have an option for power line in(non-pro version) 2. the night surveillance area is very narrow (Arlo not pro; Pro is good) 3. Very Limited area is covered by emotion. Only the object is very close it can be triggered even set to 100% sensitivity. Sometimes it cannot be triggered by persons steps. 4. if possible, the camera should be rotated that can be controlled on App.",Two significant defects

Wagner,"I bought my arlo pro to deter vandals and trespassers.  So far, it seems to be working.  I am also hoping to catch the bear that visits my home on camera. I consider myself experienced in technology setup and was surprised that I had some issues setting up my Arlo Pro (issues getting it to connect and maintain a connection to the internet after the initial software update ran during setup).  Had to uninstall the base station and the camera from my app.  When I reinstalled fresh, everything connected easily and continues to work well. I have a suggestion about the mount.  I love the magnetic mount, but I couldn't get my camera to stay in the position I needed.  It kept swiveling on the mount.  I ended up adding a nail next to the mount to steady it and all works well now.  This could be easily improved by Arlo in the future. I love the one week of video storage and the ability to download and favorite videos.  I am impressed with the clarity of the night vision as well as the sound.  I like that it has two-way audio, but so far, have not had an opportunity to use that feature.  A couple days after I setup my Arlo Pro, I returned home to find police combing the woods in my neighborhood for a suspect.  I felt safer during this incident knowing I could have eyes outside with my Arlo Pro. I am already considering adding another Arlo to my home.  Definitely recommending this product!","Love my Arlo Pro, but a few suggestions...."

Don't make the mistake of getting one camera and think that will be your security system.  The reaction time of the motion detector is not fast enough to trigger and record someone moving quickly in an auto or walking.  You need several cameras in sequence to signal one another to begin the video.  Resolution not good enough to see a license tag except maybe with some type of enhancement.  Syncing works well.  Can turn motion detector on or off remotely.  Serves my purpose and fine for my needs. Well designed product. Update on 5/19/18 I own six of these cameras and have the premium package for viewing.  I have noticed a pattern.  At about the 8 month to 1 year level, the batteries begin to go bad and won't hold a charge.  I returned 2 of these to Netgear and got refurbished units.  Now 2 additional ones have the same problem  Netgear tech support kept me on the phone for half an hour with an extraordinary set of steps to try and reset the camera/battery but nothing worked.  They were responsive. I believe there is just a product issue that causes the batteries to go bad after a year due to the pattern that I have seen on 4 of the 6 cameras I own.  Netgear sells replacement batteries for 60 bucks so that makes up 40% or more of the price.  Not sure I would go this route again if I had to do it over and am dropping my 4 stars to 3.",Really nicely designed product but you need at least 3 to make them effective.

While Arlo is cheaper and wireless it could be amazing with some improvements. Pros Setup is amazingly simple.  Was setup in less than 10 min. Wireless works really well and they have great range.  Bought a wireless extender when I ordered it, didn't need it 7 days free online storage on up to 5 cameras Tons of assessories available like skins, chargers (including a solar panel) and mounts Movement notifications arrive quickly to your phone Siren is very loud Sensitive microphones Very modern look to the cameras System can be customized by createing recordin rules.  Like turn on other cameras if movement is detected, each camera can start recording on sound or motion, system can be setup on a timer, geofence or constantly on. Good battery life Cons Motion detecting is my biggest gripe.  You need to be fairly close and detection only works when traveling across the field of view. I ended up spending more than half a day moving cameras around, making many holes in my house and porch to find a decent location. I then needed to crank the sensitivity all the way up to be somewhat happy with the results. Along with motion detecting the startup lag needs to be cut in half.  Most of the time I could walk past the camera and all it would capture was the back of my head.  I could walk right up to my house and through the door before it would start recording (most of the time it didn't even start).  However upping the sensitivity somewhat helped but the trade off is more notifications from animals, birds and leaves.  Also positioning the camera off center like in a corner helped (so objects are more traveling across the field of view).  I want to capture someone coming at the camera not the side or back of his head. Video quality could be increased. It's a little grainy and is even worse when zooming. The app needs some fine tuning. Setting up the cameras I needed to constantly restart the app because it froze or dropped access to the cameras.  Also some features like sensitivty are buried and difficult to find. Online support needs to improve.  While troubleshooting the motion detecting issue I found SEVERAL people had the same problem.  Tech support constantly pushed people to documention based on a previous version of the app.  The app had been overhauled and many of the settings are now located somewhere else. The system forces you to upgrade firmware and app so having that older documention available is confusing and frustrating. Overall I think with some tweaks and upgrades Arlo could dominate the competition but right now it's just satisfactory. Because of the motion detecting flaws I'll need to order another 2 or 3 cameras to get the coverage I would like.  I'm torn on spending the addition money, waiting for the next upgrade hoping the issues get addressed or returning everything.",Could be amazing with some improvements

I will start by saying I purchased the Arlo Pro system and was going to return it because I was worried about the video quality.  I loved all the other features (free 7 day online recording, local USB recording, app integration, tons of features to customize how you want it to record, etc.), but I was still worried about the image quality after watching some online reviews.  After going back and forth about whether I wanted to install a hard wired system, I decided just to keep the Arlo and give it a try since it would be a hassle to try to run any kind of hardwired system to where I needed cameras, plus most hardwired systems don't notify you of anything, so unless you know to look, you will never know. I am happy to say I am glad I kept the Arlo system.  While it provides everything I was looking for, the only negative is the video is not as clear as I would like, but I would say for the most part it does the job just fine. Here are some of my tips to get the best quality video possible: 1) Set up the recording quality in the settings to best (obviously). 2) Keep the cameras and base station as close as possible.  My base station is probably 15 feet away from both cameras. 3) Position the cameras so they record as little movement as possible.  What I mean is when it starts recording, if it is aimed at an area with lots of external movement (bushes, shrubs, leaves, anything that can move) it can get pixelated due to data transfer.  The more still the background, the higher quality your images will appear.",Great setup but know it's limitations before buying.  Please read till the end.

Karapetian,"I love these ARLO Pro cameras. They are easy to use, easy to install, and they work.  The following are improvements that would make this system great! 1. The application is not as great as it can be. I would allow multiple on-off scheduling on the same day, and the ability to use different cameras for specific events in custom modes. 2. Because you cant do ""keep out zones"" with IR motion detection, and the IR motion detection is limited to about 20 feet of range, I would encourage ARLO/Netgear to build and sell stand-alone IR motion detectors that trigger cameras.  That way, we can place independent motion detectors where the camera range is not able to reach, and trigger one or multiple cameras. 3. it would be great to boost the resolution to 1080dp. 4. The IR illumination for night-time are weak.  I know on a battery operated camera it is a compromise, but it would be great to give the customer the option to select really strong illumination, or battery saving mode.  For my application, the cameras are pretty much useless at night, which isnt great. Other than the above improvements, I think the cameras are great. They are easy to mount, easy to install, easy to use, and easy to setup. And, lets not forget the free storage for video. This is huge. This is the main reason I chose this system over the google NEST.",I love these ARLO Pro cameras

Now that I've finally found the perfect mount (Grifiti Nootle Magnetic Camera Mount), I thought it's time to upgrade to Arlo Pro (not Pro 2, just the original Pro)  You'll notice the camera seems to be larger and it's now rechargeable out of the box (no more swapping those expensive batteries)  If you have the original Arlo Base you're good to go, sync it up and setup is a breeze.  The video quality is much better (at least during the day)  Sadly night vision is still crap in my opinion.  I also noticed if I change the power management to ""Best battery life"" I can get by almost a month before it needs a recharge.

It is, as advertised, easy to set up and easy to use. The mobile app, while a bit of a maze in some portions, is quite user friendly and quick. However, all of these niceties are completely useless since the video quality is terrible. The product description and the ""tech support"" say that the video quality is 780p. This is false. It is no better than VGA quality. You would not be able to identify a person in your front yard, day or night, unless you knew them or they were wearing a t-shirt that had their name on it in very large letters. You may as well forget trying to read the license plate of a car that is parked outside your home. Security cameras are only useful if the video can help the police catch the perpetrators. If you just want to know that someone broke into your car that is parked in your driveway, I'm sure you will have found that out by the broken glass the next morning and don't need an Arlo to show you useless video of a fuzzy blob breaking your window and driving away in another, more square shaped fuzzy blob. The attached photo is of a van parked, literally, in front of my house. A would-be robber would park no closer and you can barely make out the Chevy logo, much less the license plate number. Some will say that my base station isn't close enough to the camera or that my internet is too slow or that my expectations are too high. To those, I say that my camera is no farther than 20 feet, my internet is fiber optic (capable of 300mbps down/300mbps up), and my expectations are that a camera show us something useful. The call into tech support was equally as useless as the Arlo itself. The person who answered the call said that the video looked pretty good and that the fuzziness is 720p.

Have installed these in a vacation house and just love checking in on it from time to time from my computer at home.  If you have a USB power source nearby that works even better since you can leave the camera plugged in and there is no worries about charging the battery.  Plus, the backs of the cameras are magnetic. We have a huge secure metal wall art piece on our lanai and just ""stuck"" the camera to the wall art (it even blends in very well), plugged it into a nearby socket - and there you go!  Did not even need to mount the mount.  Am getting great pictures.  We bought one of the screw in mounts for the front of the house and mounted it above the roof line and now we can see the front door.  This one is on battery power only and we will see how long the battery lasts before we need to recharge.  We can just run a line to that camera and recharge the batteries without taking it down.  Haven't done this yet and not sure how long it will take to recharge, but it seems very simple to do.  However, will need to purchase a second charger and USB cable since the two cameras only come with one each.  Understand these are very reasonably priced items.

Within 20 minutes of arriving, I had the cameras setup and ready to go.  The batteries come completely charged, so there was no delay in getting it up and running.  The ease in which you setup your account, pair the cameras to the base, and then use the ""positioning mode"" to assist you in setting them up is wonderful.  Keep your phone with you, and the Arlo App on, so you can adjust the camera view without needing any help. Pros: - Up to 5 cameras can be added free with 7-day rotating schedule. No huge subscription fees unless you want ""more"". - Batteries are fully charged out of the box. - Cameras ""sip power"" from the batteries.  I still have a full charge after a week of positioning, playing, and even using the two-way communication feature! - Love the fact that I can talk on the camera.  It makes my puppy happy to hear my voice. - Setup and pairing is simple and easy to follow. - Firmware upgrades are a breeze (There was one immediately following pairing that installed in minutes and was painless.) - Build quality is excellent. - Image quality is excellent, even from a distance of 20+ feet. - Nighttime image quality is also very good, even at distance. Cons: - Mounting cups don't allow for enough freedom of positioning to eliminate ceiling from the frame. - At the start of some 10 second videos, the video has a very visible green hue to it.  It disappears rapidly, but is a bit annoying. - Motion sensing can not be turned on and off individually for each camera; you either have them all on, or all off. - There are rubber ""plugs"" covering the ports on the base of each camera.  Two are snug, but the third is so loose it won't stay in.  This might compromise the integrity of the camera if it gets wet. - Magnetic cups are cool, but they could be improved by putting a rubber backing on them.  This would help keep the mount tight to the wall after the single-screw key-hole mounting. - The scheduling tool is powerful, but a bit klunky to work with.  After a couple of days playing with it, I think I have a nice rounded-out schedule. - The setting of the duration of the motion capture doesn't work in schedule mode.  It would be really handy if it did. - With cameras both inside and outside, it would be great to have them individually configurable. Notes: The trouble positioning the camera on the magnetic cups is due only to the fact that the bottom of the camera bumps into the bottom of the disk when tilting it down.  The mounts don't stand off the wall enough.  I solved this problem by purchasing some inexpensive post mounts with infinite positioning capability. I also picked up some awesome ""skins"" for the cameras that were black.  It makes them much more weather hearty.  They have a nice hood on the front to help keep down lens flare and debris from the lens.  They also help you hide the cameras, especially the exterior ones. I would love a way to tag/name videos so i can refer back to them later.  Sure we can download the video and store it locally, but tagging them would help me identify periods in my schedule that I need to refine.","A wireless video setup that is easy to use, quality built, and consumer friendly!"

I am please so far. The clarity of the pictures are incredible.  It also alerts you for any movement which is very nice.  I am using this outside only. Although it would also be a great indoor camera if you wanted one. Another thing that is great about these cameras is how easy you can move them from place to place. They come with excellent mounts however, I did purchase additional ones for I wanted them on poles/trees.  I also bought skins for them for I wanted them hidden. The reason I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5, is I was looking for two very different things in the camera.1). catching wildlife pictures, 2).  just over all security.  The security part is great, the wildlife not so good. That part however is my fault for I do not have or leave on any outdoor lighting at night and the reach of the camera is not far enough. I really need a camera just for that. I would not hesitate to purchase this system. At first I thought it was too much money but then I realized for the product, clarity, etc...it really is very inexpensive. Plus the cost of being locked into a contract for 3 years.

The cameras are very easy to use and install, and they work better at night or in the dark than I anticipated. The one thing I wish they would have is a recognition system in place. By this I mean, instead of being alerted for any motion Arlo detects, it would be nice to be alerted if Arlo detected a person. I live in an area with lots of feral cats, and they are constantly setting off the cameras, which is sometimes annoying but at least I know they work. Batteries will last much longer than I expected, but I'm sure it depends on how much motion your camera will pick up.

But not all of them offer the same thing. Arlo Pro is one of the best and most convenient systems out there if you don't want to pay a third party to watch your home. I have set up my entire system, several cameras, in less than an hour.  I receive text messages and email alerts any time my cameras sense motion or sound (depending on the feature you enable, both if you want). All of the cameras are 100% wireless, meaning you can put them in positions that most camera systems would require a ton of time, effort, and wire. The sky is the limit with these cameras, some of mine are in trees 20 ft above the ground. I have had mine operating for a little over a week and all batteries still read 100%. Some people report having their cameras last 6 months before needing to charge their batteries. All results seem to be dependent on settings. I would strongly recommend the Arlo pro camera over any other wireless system. Arlo offers 7 day cloud storage for free (meaning it writes over itself every 7 days) no one else seems to offer that feature, non that I have found.

I set up a schedule for the cameras to turn on/off and will help conserve more battery. So far, the detection sensors on the cameras have been working correctly and triggering fast enough to capture the image. The 720p resolution gives you enough detail to get job done, but I would really prefer 1080p. My only major disappointment, is not with the camera system, but the outdoor screw mount. The mounts are short and not flexible enough to get that 100% perfect angle. Everything is working so great that I just order a third Arlo Pro camera for a blind spot on the side of my house. Make your move thief, I'll be watching!",Gets the job done

This an add on device for my system I have owned for almost a year now. This is the 5th camera for my system. The  system really works well and the cameras are very much weather proof. The software is easy to use and the cloud system Netgear has setup is the reason I bought the system. I like the no monthly expense option. I really like the Geofencing option that automatically arms the system when I drive a preset distance from my house. I also like the fact you only have to charge these about 3 times a year , depending upon you settings. These are easy to setup and maintain. There are few things to consider before you buy these. This system is not 100% perfect. Kind of expensive compared to other products that have hit the market over the last year. Don't expect these to work at temperatures under 10. The lithium batteries simply do not work at low temps. There is a slight delay on these. You don't always catch the action that triggered these cameras.",Good option for easy security monitoring.

Step one of getting it installed is to sync the cameras with its base station. However, that just would not happen. I called Amazon and Netgear Tech Support and they came to the conclusion that it was a defective product and asked me to return it. I returned it immediately and ordered a new one. And guess what!!! The new one that arrived also would not sync and was defective. I have never had such an experience on Amazon where even a replacement product turns out to be defective.

If I had known the product would require monthly subscription, I wouldn’t have purchased.  However, I subscribed and the camera only dectected motion or sent alerts while the base and camera were 2 feet apart.

This little thing is fairly easy to set up, it holds charge amazingly, as it should for its high price. It’s been four days and the battery only dropped today. I don’t know how long it will take to recharge though so I’m a little wary about that. Looks like some neighborhood kids were using our garage as a smoke shop, it was great to use the two way audio to let them know the jig was up. I do not like that sharing the app and alerts with family members has been tedious, timeconsuming and very user unfriendly, as it keeps asking me to set up and sync a new camera. Also the volume on the two way audio mic is very low. It has to be dead of the night quiet in order for the person you’re talking to to hear you.

I had no trouble whatever enabling the system.  I found mounting and aligning the camera to be easy due to the magnetic bracket and the ability to see what the camera sees live on the iPhone.  The only reason I am not giving Arlo a five is that geofencing does not work for more than one Arlo-enabled phone, making that very desirable function unusable in a multi-person household.  Netgear acknowledges this as a known bug but there is no committed time for resolution.  Subsequent post:  I had a problem with the connection of my base station to my router.  A very knowledgeable Netgear advisor was able to help me resolve this by opening three ports on my router.  And lo and behold, it fixed the geofencing with two iPhones problem too.

However, I am noticing that my camera doesn't always record when it should and when it does, it records in 15 second increments. Sometimes the recording doesn't begin until the subject is almost out of the frame. I worry that if someone were to steal packages from my porch, that the recording won't kick off in time. I hope that Arlo releases a software update soon. To Arlo, please release an update extending the record time or to record when all motion has stopped. I did enable the setting to record until motion has stopped - but it doesn't work how it should.",Great but with a few bugs

Today I came home and COULD NOT DISARM my security system because the app stopped showing it in the device list for no apparent reason. The only way I was able to fix it (after several minutes of troubleshooting) was to reboot my phone. Even when it's not completely broken, the app is so slow I've often had to sit in my driveway for more than a minute before the UI would load to let me arm or disarm it. This is somewhat mitigated by using IFTTT integration, but sometimes that stops working until you open the app and log in again.

When that day arrived it’s been a huge disappointment, especially for people trying to figure out how to get it to work - have a look at their Community posts.  Other than acting like a HomeKit motion sensor, there is no way to change any settings without using their online App and no way to trigger the siren using Scenes or Automations. If you use the App, the only HomeKit integration is the ability to destroy your HomeKit accessories!!  I have Apps from Eve, Schlage, Philips Hue and iDevices that are well integrated with HomeKit and none of them force me to have an online account but the Arlo App does.

The app, camera, and base did everything as advertised. I then brought the camera inside one day to charge and it lost sync to the base. I tried forever to get it to re-sync with no luck. I then contacted Netgear support, which is where the real issue starts. If you call on the phone, the wait times are ridiculous. I never once was able to hold long enough to speak to someone. I then contacted email support on 8/18/2017. Each time, someone new would respond to me and ask me the same questions: did you reboot it, is your internet on, did you follow the directions... I was asked the same thing by many different people. Then, finally, on September 12th, I think they got tired of me and simply closed my case without resolving it. I have since filed another case. I bought a camera because someone attacked my wife at the doorway of our house. Having downtime on a camera I just paid over $200 for is not an option. This is a cool setup and a nice camera and online app... BUT, if you have any problem, consider yourself screwed out of $200+ or whatever you paid.

The video quality (day and night) is great - you get high clarity video and crisp photos.  The sound is great too - although maybe a little too good because we actually turned the mic off on one camera because we didn't want to hear our neighbors conversations.  The whole system was super easy and fast to set up.  Wireless was a key criteria for me because we have zero attic space to run hidden wires and I hate the look of wires hung on walls. The only reason I call the system nearly perfect is I wish there were more screw-in mounting bracket options or an adjustable height one to offer more flexibility. The basic magnetic mount is amazing, but we needed something with a similar range of motion in a screw-in form because we have low roof lines.

Then I search the Google oracle of wisdom, and determined that: a) The device I received must be a previously return item and previously activated by another customer, so MUST be factory reset before I can use it b) The factory reset was failing because the app, the website, and the paper instructions all stated that the Sync button on top and the reset button on back (using a paperclip) must be depressed for 10 seconds.

The only thing I can say that’s even slightly negative ( and it’s nitpicking) is I want my wife’s phone to have the same “master” capability as mine, and for the most part it does because I have her administrative rights, but unlike my phone ap she can’t “shut off” the notifications when there is movement so she gets dings on her phone throughout the night. I’ve heard others state there is too long of a delay before the cameras catch movements but on the ap you can turn up or down the sensitivity. I have mine set almost all the way up and it catches movement from my curb all the way to the house with no issues!

Those are my two cons to the camera.  I do like the wireless never the less.  I was still able to place two cameras where I wanted.  There was another position that I would like but out of range of the base.  Image quality is good but not great.  So far battery life has been great.  I was expecting it to drain quickly but it hasn't.  An setting that I wish it had was recording length setting.  Recordings are typically 15-20 seconds.

I was so twisted around by the various options out there, each with their strengths and weaknesses - and with mixed reviews for all of the brands/product options.  I finally decided to roll the dice on the Arlo Pro system (2 Pro wireless, battery powered outdoor/indoor cameras with a base station) to see how it went.  Got installed (quickly, no big problems -- both cameras and base station up and running in about 20 minutes, took longer to decide where to mount cameras than it did for the tech to be happy.) That was over three weeks ago - WOW!  It has blown away my expectations by far, here's details: 1.  It's been three weeks - I haven't had to recharge either camera yet.  The camera on front door/main entrance says 90% battery remaining (you can see that through the app) and the secondary camera (less traffic) actually says 100% remaining.  Granted, we live on a private drive (postal carrier only comes to door if they have a package for us) so we don't get as many 'triggers' on the cameras as some people would --- but just coming and going through the course of the day my better half and I are still triggering the main door camera at least 8-12 times a day - so the battery life is 'crushing' my expectations so far (the Arlo Pro generation must be a big step up from the prior generation and some people's comments?) 2.  When a camera is triggered -- I get notification through my smartphone extremely fast.  (Like, within 2-4 seconds most times, 8-10 seconds at most.)  This is fast enough so that I can check the notification and talk through my phone, through the camera -- to speak to a would-be thief.  I was skeptical that the system would be able to work that fast such the the microphone/speaker thing would be of much help in an actual attempted-theft -- now I'm pretty sure it would be.  (My better-half and I have tested the microphone/speaker tech -- pretty cool!) 3.  The videos and even the audio are surprisingly high quality/clear, I love the fact that I have cloud storage and access for free, but that I have also put a USB drive in the base station so I have my own local copies of the audio/video.  (I like the cloud backups because -- if someone broke into the house -- they'd probably damage or steal the base station thinking it could help them cover their tracks?  This way I've got backup.) 4.  I feel more confident that I won't lose any packages to common thieves, and I actually just feel more secure in general at night knowing how fast the system turns things around...  if anyone was even just creeping around the house I'd know about it almost instantly.  So far I still just have the two cameras, but plan to buy 3 more to place strategically around the house to have an even more complete sense of security and confidence. This has been a purchase that has far exceeded my expectations in features and performance.  So much faster and more reliable than I could have believed possible (I will add here:  we have 'blast' speed internet service bandwidth, I have a Netgear AC5300 Nighthawk X8 router, and a Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone that I run the app through -- so most of this gear is fairly 'up-to-date' and high quality, which may be a factor in performance speeds.)  I highly recommend anyone to give the Arlo Pro system a try (in other words -- don't get too hung up on comments that might be referring back to previous generations/versions of Arlo gear - this Arlo Pro equipment is doing a great job.)",Wow! - Extremely happy with this purchase after 3+ weeks of use

My old Arlo camera was on my porch.  It would half the time not record a person walking on to my porch but every car that drove by more than 30 feet away it would record. This caused recordings in the mid 50's each day.  This new camera has not recorded any cars driving by and only records people approaching my porch.  I HAVE TURNED ON NOTIFICATIONS AGAIN! Literally I only get 1-2 recordings a day and that is only if I am expecting a package delivery. It is great.

Overall very happy with all of it, but I have seen some problems with software. I would love to say it's a wifi problem, but the camera is only one room away from our router/system. Two way audio is great, but the speaker needs to be a little louder. I know no one wants the cameras to be to big, but some improvement would be nice. Also to be able to have more than one person signed into your account at one time. My wife and myself get the alerts, and go to check on it only to find we keep kicking the other one off the system. Would also love to be able to block motion from some areas to keep the alerts down (example, flag). I know they offer a package that will do that for you, but who wants to spend more money on a system that you own (per camera might I add). Only allowed 6 cameras on a free account as well. I use my cameras all over. One for a baby monitor, out door camera over swing set and pool, and have set a system up at my parents house. My Father's health is not the greatest so when no one is home with him for a short time we can check in on him, or get an alert if he is up and moving. Awesome for that, and the system setting only turns after you leave your house (or in this case when my Mother leaves). Great part of the software, and you can share with other systems which is perfect for my use right now. Like a said before very happy with the system, but does have a few minor problems. Glad I bought it, and would buy again and may buy more cameras. Almost forgot to say set up is VERY EASY (did have to do a firmware update right away, BOO), and batteries has been great so far.

Johnson,"I recently purchased a 4 camera system with the base and added on a camera via purchase direct from Amazon. My thoughts after a few weeks of use. Set-up starts by powering the base and directly connecting into your internet  router via ethernet cable.  Following that, set-up is a breeze and involves pairing the cameras to the base individually. Only takes a minutes or so per camera for the pairing and recognition. The cameras have been installed for a few weeks and the batteries have barely inched off full charge. I really liked the mounting options (via magnetic base) or via a more traditional screw fitting for an add on mount that can be purchased separately.  Once everything was linked and mounted, on-line access and operation was a breeze via the Arlo app. Several thoughts on camera set-up. 1)  The motion detection field of view works over a relatively short distance.  You need to really determine exactly what area you want to observe.  For areas where you expect the camera to be triggered and the subject to remain in a location (i.e. the front door) these work great.  if you aim it at a walkway then you have to ensure the total time to cross exceeds 3-4 seconds, otherwise the camera triggers and you only catch the back of the individual.. 2) The resolution on the camera is great for overall field of view but is not clear enough to pick up a license plate number for a car parked in the driveway (unless really really close to the camera) or provide a good picture of a person passing through the field of view. If you are checking to see if someone in your family arrived home or the dog sitter came by then these are great and hardly ever suffer from false notifications. As for overall improvement: The delay on the motion recognition (widely discussed in the various reviews is a challenge) and needs to be factored in to camera placement.  In my experience the camera takes 2-3 seconds to kick into capture mode.  I resolved this by leveraging a trigger camera and the ""Mode"" logic that allows you to leverage motion in one area to trigger another camera. All in all it fits the bill for my needs but you'll need to appreciate the cameras for what they are. A well designed, completely wireless system for capturing event based recordings.  If they had 1080P resolution and were able to speed up the lag to start the capture sooner these would easily be 5 stars across the board.",Very Impressed but can't wait to see the next generation

The quality of the picture/video is pretty good. You can even zoom in. The app is good but could use some more work. There’s been a couple of times that I have been alerted to movement but when I open the app, it doesn’t load the video or allow me to “live stream” the camera. This has happened a couple of times so far. Luckily, it wasn’t a criminal. The different arming modes fit all life styles. I use the geofencing which goes off your phone. If you leave the radias of the home, the system will automatically arm and disarm when you return. The different variations in arming is pretty impressive. Overall, really happy with my choice.

Have Arlo Pro wireless system with two cameras. System is at a vacation home where I monitor via the app. Cameras are outside and mounted under patio/porch coverings. I was very excited about them at first but have become very disappointed given a rapidly declining camera battery life that renders the system useless. First four months, battery life was fine, even with several motions triggering 10 sec filming. Recharged after four months even though not quite drained and both cameras were at about same level...20% or so left. Then batteries on both lasted about two months before getting to 14%.. It was about 80 degrees during the day and less activity. Then I charged again during July 4 weekend. About a month later, both batteries are on 0%! No motions triggered at all during this time. Batteries consistently seem to drain at about the same rate each time. Power is on. Wi-fi signal is strong. Cameras have not gotten any farther from the base station. and aren’t that far since place isn’t that big. I can’t keep making the 2.5 hour drive to charge cameras.  Battery life appears to be dwindling more and more. Headed back on Labor Day weekend to try again.  I left my cameras fully charged on Sept 3rd. Now it's Sept 15 and one camera is at 57% and the other 56%. Each has only been triggered once, by a bird and a fly. Have reached out multiple times to Arlo/Netgear for help.  No solution.

The ten second record time with no pre-record or post-record is kind of limiting. The range is also limited to way less than 60 feet. The system does not stitch together events that happen in the same time span which means portions of the video which would tell the whole story are left out entirely. The answer to this is to buy multiple cameras of course. It is super simple to setup and does most of what I need but it's the few features that as a ""Pro"" user I've come to expect in lesser systems that makes me not want to give this system at least four stars. That said, one of the best features is the battery life in each camera, which I understand is only attainable due to the shortcomings mentioned above.",I thought the Pro would be better than expected

(Sorry, Amazon, on this I got a better deal elsewhere.) Arlo Pro is outstanding, in my opinion. Great Motion Detection, haven't even toughed the sensitivity, and haven't needed to set up 'zones'. Night Vision is good enough for me, with some light where my cameras are. Picture Quality is Great. But the most impressive thing? BATTERY LIFE! My first two camera's batteries lasted over 5 months, and they did not have a 100% Charge when I installed them. So unless you're putting these on a two-story house, you'll be able to take these down, and charge these, no more than three times a year. ALSO, unlike RING, you own the videos.

With that in mind I added 3 more cameras over the next several months. Fast forward 11 months and I barely like the system, what used to be 6-8 weeks of battery life is now down to 1-2 weeks and this includes a camera that was bought about 4 months ago.  Keep in mind that none of these cameras are in high traffic areas.  I also noticed that I'll get notifications of movement but no recordings, although that doesn't happen too often. I will re-evaluate my rating if I see the batteries are only lasting a few days.

The Arlo Pro system looked like it would meet these needs well. The setup was a breeze, and overall experience has been mostly positive. Images are clear, even at night, and the sound element (mic + speaker) are a nice bonus. That said, there are a few quirks: 1. Connection via the app (Android) hasn't been 100% reliable, which can be frustrating for a home security system. 2. It would be nice to have an installation system that was more permanent, especially in instances where the camera is only barely out of reach. 3. Not the biggest fan of the cloud-based storage - it would be nice to be able to bypass this entirely and just use local storage (or my own cloud/server storage). 4. The video delay is, admittedly, incredibly frustrating. The fact that the video isn't in real-time isn't a dealbreaker, but dramatically diminishes the effectiveness of a home security system. I can set up a remotely-access video camera using an old Android phone that broadcasts in real-time, so why can't this $$$ system?",Good potential with a few quirks

Right now I only have two complaints. They will not charge when the weather is too cold outside. It was about 32 degrees outside and they won't charge when plugged in. The settings will tell you that it's plugged in, but not charging until it warms up. The cameras themselves work in the cold but to recharge them the temperature has to probably be in the upper thirties or in the forties I'm guessing. Just make sure they are charged enough before a long cold streak or you can bring unit in the house and charge it anytime. And number two, I think the speaker volume is too low. Even set at 100 percent, the volume doesn't seem very loud for speaking to someone or the dog outside.  But as far as picking up video and sound, they are satisfactory.",Good So Far.

When I leave my home, geofencing doesn't set the camera to away. I actually have to open the arlo app before it will recognize I have left my home. What good is geofencing, if I have to open the app for it to recognize I have left? That is no difference as is almost the same as me manually turning it on. What happens if I leave and I forget to open the app? If I am burglarized, Arlo doesn't accept responsibility correct? So, Beta testing for over 2 yrs and not resolving issues is not good. That is entirely too long to Beta test a product. In addition, when I do return home, Arlo doesn't recognize I am home and stays in the away position. Once again, I have to open the app for it to know I am home and for the camera to change automatically ""after opening app"" to the home position. I would not recommend this until Geofencing is actually working properly. Everything now says works off geofencing, including alarm systems, thermostats, etc. Arlo is setup to recognize distance by 3 distances and I have it setup on the shortest distance.

Very nice overall.  I like the fact that there are no monthly recurring charges. I use a USB drive with the base to store videos locally (if needed beyond 1 week).  Night vision is so so. Update after 9 months of use: After 6 months of use, the batteries started to run out of charge every 4 weeks or so.  This became a major issue since the cameras has to come down, get charged for hours and then re-mounted & adjusted for accuracy every time.  Not fun.  I tried to email customer support but it was difficult to do so. After 4 calls to customer support they acknowledged that the base is defective.  Making a long story short, they agreed to replace the unit after sending them a proof of purchase. I had to pay $16.50 to get a replacement (for their defective unit).  Hoping this is the end of the issue. Bottom line: While the product is good, the need for charging, remounting & adjusting for accuracy gets to be annoying.

I chose the Arlo Pro because it saves a sliding 7 days of videos to an internet library free of charge, and because the wireless cameras are easier to install than camera systems requiring an outdoor source of power. The Arlo Pro application, installed both on her iPhone and my iPhone, provides alerts whenever motion is detected. After five days of use I have seen reliable detection of human motion, and only one false detection (at least I could not tell what triggered the alert from the recorded video). The intruder's image is recorded long before he/she can get to the camera to destroy or disable it.

The wireless connectivity seems fine, even with the farthest camera to the base unit. The battery life is very acceptable for a wireless camera with no power cords. The night vision is clear in most cases. The app is fairly simple and functional. The motion sensing is lacking.

But initially, I give this system 5 stars for ease of setup, and general deploy-ready configuration.  A few things could have been made a more integrated part of the setup process, such as turning off email alerts when you have the mobile app installed, or guidance on infrared settings when setting up a camera indoors pointing out through a window (doesn't work so well, which is understandable, but not explained). Overall I like this system a lot.  Battery life appears to track with predictions others have made so far.  Well done Netgear.  Well done. Note: Still a nice system, but I lowered my rating to 4 stars for two reasons:  1) Mounted inside looking out through a window may not work if you have modern thermal-resistant windows.  Motion detection is based on a heat signature only (no motion detect option), so these cameras won't work in that situation.  2) Outdoor magnet mounts are strong, but not secure enough should a bird decide your camera makes a nice stopping point.  Having to reset the camera position due to small environmental factors can be frustrating, especially if your camera is mounted high and requires ladder climbing to reposition.",Overall I like this system a lot

It might be good for some hours but eventually it will fail. I tried fixing it through all of the steps outlined on their website because good luck getting a hold of a human. Still fails. I ended up buying a different camera which does work a little better regarding it staying connected. It's not an issue with the wireless reception either as that is fine. The video compression can be bad and the motion sensor seems like it should pick up things that it sometimes misses. I tried getting a hold of their support via email to try and resolve the problem by getting a refund or a replacement for the camera. I was ignored. The extra camera I bought does work better regarding connection but I should not have had to buy an extra camera. Do not buy.

And, I get an alert on my cell phone if motion is triggered, like when I am not home.. In the event of a break in, I can easily call the police. The resolution is not great, but they make a better camera if you wish to buy that one.. And, it's infarred, can see in the dark. And, you can add 4 cameras or more I think. So easy to sink..

I ordered a new base station with a single camera for my new house with the plan to bring over the rest of the cameras once my old house sells. After using the new camera for a couple of weeks it stopped charging. I chatted with Arlo support and their best offer was to send me a new charger even though it was unclear if the issue was the charger, the cable, or the camera. I only have one camera/charger at this location and my request was that they replace them all to get me back up and running. Arlo support refused and said the best they could do was send me a charger and see if that worked, basically troubleshooting via USPS/Fedex/UPS. I'm sad to say that I'm forced to look at alternatives at this point. FIRST UPDATE: The Arlo system software has degraded to the point where it simply cannot be trusted as a 'security' system. Arlo/Netgear could fix it in an instant with rigorous software testing and updates, but they do not, and things are spinning out of control now that Netgear is spinning off Arlo. I'm an IT guy, and the mess they have made of their software breaks my heart, because the hardware is *great*.  My advice is to look elsewhere, and maybe check back on Arlo in a couple of years to see if they've managed to fix their basic functionality. I'm sure some exec somewhere is getting their bonus because they launched a doorbell, meanwhile people like me who have invested thousands in their existing products sit around trying to figure out why our systems are spontaneously disarming and our schedules are being deleted, and they've never gotten geofencing to work reliably. Just check the support boards for a litany of issues. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a safety/security guy in that I focus on minimizing risk for myself and family, while still being flexible enough to live life - a balancing act, if you will. I have previously resisted getting security camera systems because of the 'Big Brother' aspects of it, however we recently took an extended road-trip vacation, and I wanted to be able to monitor things on the home front. After doing extensive research, I opted for this wireless, rechargeable system, and man, am I glad that I did. I got the five-camera system, thinking it was overkill, but even my wife remarked that ""we could sure use some more cameras"" after spending some time using it. Pros and cons as follow: Pros: Cordless and wireless: the cameras run on batteries and wifi and can be placed virtually anywhere that can be reached by the wifi signal Long battery life: so far we're going months between battery recharges, and highly recommend getting a spare battery and charger so you always have one ready to go without dismounting cameras Day/night vision: the cameras automatically switch between day and night vision as appropriate Motion detection: the motion detection feature means video is only recorded when there is detected motion Live view option: you can use the app or web to view/record any/all cameras live any time you want Audio: audio is also recorded, and two-way audio is available via the app/web App system: the application has a lot of options and is easy to navigate and use Vibrant ecosystem: there are a *lot* of OEM and third-party add-ons and accessories Cons: Video quality: the video quality does not quite seem fully HD, although it's still good Recording start delay: when motion is detected there is a few seconds of delay before recording starts, which can miss fast-moving action Sound volume: using the two-way audio to talk through the device results in a pretty quiet audio stream from the camera's speaker, even at the highest volume levels Arlo Smart is extra: NetGear has developed 'Arlo Smart' which attempts to recognize objects (people, cars, pets, etc) and allow you to use the object designations to refine the system logic - this is great, but should be included, not a monthly, per-camera fee, which is ridiculous That last one is the only negative that's giving me pause, because it indicates that NetGear is looking for create a monthly monetized stream for the system by withholding functionality for ransom (my interpretation). Given that these are *security* systems, anything that increases security should be included, particularly if it is software/firmware based. This price-gouging (my opinion) is what caused me to take off one star. Other than that, this is a good system. I hope NetGear comes to their senses on Arlo Smart.",Second Update: *REALLY* AVOID ARLO! Original: Not sure how I lived without this system...

Even during mild to warm weather, over time you will need to charge battery more frequently even after few months of use. 3.

The battery life is nice too, as in battery saver and not ""armed"" 24/7, then they easily last a month or longer before requiring charging. I have a couple where I use them in a garage and then I can plug them in directly not draining battery. I can't really comment on the level or video or audio quality, as that's not my main purpose, but they do work really well to alert me of potential dangers to my property, which I appreciate. They were highly rated and I am very satisfied with my purchase.",Love my Arlos

Awesome. ArloPro system: I like the camera and system functions, such as wifi, remote alerts and viewing, and cloud memory, all without running cables. I hope the next level of camera will improve the HD pixel count for improved clarity and night time vision. Arlo also needs to reduce the price of its swivel mount; $20 each is stretching one's logic to purchase. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the system operations and have not found a better wifi (cableless) security camera system on the market. Yes, I have checked extensively. I bought a two camera security system (Model VMS4230-100) from Best Buy, as one would not save money purchasing online (still had to pay $25 state tax). I did purchase through Amazon two iABLER metal swivel mounts, which I will provide reviews when received and installed. I have read good and bad reviews on these particular mounts, but the plastic mounts have garnered many negative feedbacks, so I avoided the plastic units. Overall, I am pleased with the operations of the Arlo security camera system.",GOOD SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM

It was very inexpensive but had many disadvantages. The major annoying disadvantage: the ""motion detection"" trigger is triggered by changes in the ambient light, and not movement.  I got 150 email alerts a day as the sun rose and set. This might be fine for a ""baby cam""  but certainly not for my small business.  It does have remote pan feature in x and y axis, that's very useful for remote viewing.  The software is HORRIBLE. Conversely I'm very, very happy with the Arlo Pro. The software is intuitive, well designed and very easy to install and pair the base station with the cameras. It took just a few minutes. The totally wireless cameras are exactly what I've been looking for.  Haven't had to recharge them yet but that's one of the main reasons I switched to Arlo.  I can place the cameras anywhere without having to be in proximity to an outlet, including outside.So far so good, I'm very happy with them (I have two cameras). One complaint.....I feel the range for motion detection is too short.  For my purposes, it's not an issue but it would be nice if the cameras could be placed a bit farther apart for wider coverage. I'd buy them again and recommend them highly",Very Happy With Arlo Pro

The Arlo engineers have addressed nearly everything I could think of.  My home WIIFI suffers the same limitations as Arlo though.  Distance.  I want outside cameras facing the back of the house but that is a bridge too far for Arlo.  Most of my cameras are within 30 feet of the base station.  Venture beyond that and they drop offline.

Also purchased 1 Arlo Pro2 (add-on) camera for the benefits of better spec features (viewing angle, resolution, advanced features) to watch the outdoor yard area of the home. My decision on Arlo system vs other brand(s) was 1) slightly better costs of Arlo system; 2) wireless (battery) power capability; 3) 7-day recording history included w/o subscription. My feedback after 1st month of installing and using the system: - The initial 2-camera system setup was easy and had no problems; - Adding the 3rd Arlo Pro2 camera to the system was a different story; * The Pro2 camera would not successfully complete the initial firmware update; * This caused the whole Arlo system to 'lock up' and finally had to do a full reset of the base station and start over initializing, naming, adding and setup of all cameras again; - Disappointed by the video quality of these cameras; * Initial Video Settings on ""Optimized"" for better battery life, but little to no quality improvement using ""Best Video"" setting after running the cameras on connected power; - Other than slightly wider viewing angle for the Arlo Pro2 vs Pro, not seeing any real differences for the extra costs of the Pro2. The Pro2's more advance features requires subscription, which defeats my reason for choosing Arlo. - On any given day, randomly and intermittently the system is Offline when I've tried to check the video; * Not only the live view is offline, but also no recordings take place during these 'outages'. * It is NOT a problem with internet because luckily I decided to go with a Nest Hello for the doorbell and it has operated flawlessly never missing a beat on the exact same system; All 3 Arlo cameras show full strength wifi signal connection with the base station also; * The system returns to 'Online' status without any actions, sometimes within minutes, sometimes hours; Not exactly reassuring for remote security monitoring nor when wanting to check-in on an elderly person; - Battery life inconsistent; Although I have since wired my cameras for power as always intended, I can offer my experience of the initial wireless battery usage since that is why most people would choose Arlo; * My indoor located Arlo Pro camera used about 15% battery / week; ""Optimized setting, Nightvision IR ""OFF""; Approx 30-40 motion triggered video recordings / day; * My outdoor located Arlo Pro camera used about 10% battery / week; ""Optimized"" setting, Nightvision IR ""OFF""; Approx 10-15 motion triggered video recordings / day; * My outdoor located Arlo Pro2 camera used about 30-35% battery / week; ""Optimized"" setting, Nightvision IR ""OFF""; Approx 10-15 motion triggered video recordings / day; - Based on that initial usage on wireless battery setup, my Arlo Pro cameras would have required recharging about every 5-6 weeks, and the Arlo Pro2 about every 2-3 weeks to avoid low battery levels; - As would be expected, the more times a camera is triggered and transmits video to the base station, and/or the more you live stream view the camera video, the more battery power that is used and faster battery draining; - Also, using the IR LED's for nightvision eats up battery power even faster, and most advanced features are only available when the cameras are directly wired to power plus the having extra subscription services activated; - Bottom line from my impression and experience so far; + Having some recording history provided no additional costs is a bonus for the Arlo system; - However, present random system ""Offline"" problem is a reliability issue for monitoring / security; + Overall, the system is okay for basic home monitoring (when it works); - True wireless (battery) installation is disappointing, especially for Pro2 camera, since that is why many people would choose the Arlo system over other direct-wire powered systems; - Video quality disappointing; my cheap 720p webcam video quality is noticeably superior to the Arlo cams; - The frequent user complaints and reviews about system problems and firmware should taken into consideration for purchase decisions; - Since I always planned to direct-wire my cameras for power anyway, I now would have gladly paid more for a different system for better video quality and reliability for my particular situation, even if addtnl subscription fees required.",Disappointed overall; Marginally useful for remote home monitoring

I even borrowed someone else’s base station to see if that would fix the problem.. it was older so it did not have the firmware update one it and the cameras worked perfect so I bought this second base station originally to replace my original base station thinking it had maybe been fried in a power blink .. I use my system as a nanny camera .. only live feed to check in on the kids through out the day with the nanny ... however it doesn’t work .. I have made several calls to Arlo and it’s always the same story .. take the batter out and replace it and re sync the cameras .. well I have 6 and to 4 times a day get a ladder and take the batter out and re sync each one is ridiculous.  I even hooked up second base station in order to divide the work load of the base .. no help..

The picture clarity (both day and night), audio, tiny size, and versatility of being cordless have been perfect for what I need. I have not had to recharge the batteries yet and I have them active all night and most of the day (they are still running off of the factory charge!!!!). I love how I am sent an instant notification on my phone and email when motion and/or audio is detected. I also appreciate that I don't have to pay anything for a week's worth of storage and can put anything I want to save past that on a USB. I was leery of the 10 second snippets worrying that it might not catch everything but as long as there is motion, it will keep taking more 10 second snippets one right after another. Plus you always have the option to watch live. My only complaint is that there is a slight lag time between motion detection and recording but I have really only noticed it when it's in night/dark mode (a cat set it off by walking up to it but all I saw was midway through the cat rather than it's face). These cameras have really given me the piece of mind I needed after my car was stolen out of my driveway.",Has it all!

My internet is fine, there isn't a radio interference issue, doesn't matter which channel I choose for my wireless modem.

I especially love the fact that this system is wireless, which allowed me to place the cameras exactly where I wanted, and setup only took about 30 minutes.

My problem is the connectivity of the cameras to my base station. It’s all dependent on the quality of the WiFi in the home. I am using the router from my cable company and it has decent range. But unless I have full bars in all cameras the video feed will drop or be choppy. After calling Arlo support I realized the support team is trash. A complete wast of time. I asked about a range extender and they said the system didn’t work with range extenders. After I told them a video on their website said something different they proceeded to ask me what video? What kind of support team doesn’t even know the support content of its own product? After a lengthy time on hold they said it would work with an extender but they couldn’t tell me how to hook it up to the base station. I have figured out how to fix my situation on my own and will continue to use the system because I am not allowed to have a wired system in my building. Just remember if you have any problems with it it will fall on you to fix it because the outsourced support that couldn’t understand what I was saying has no idea how their own system works. ALSO! I have yet to figure out a way to manage individual cameras notifications with the motion activation so I have over 700 notifications in a day of the movement going on in and around my house. It’s either no notifications or all of them. That is very frustrating when you phone constantly is buzzing at work or even sitting on in my home and I know the camera sees motion because it’s me and I can’t tell it to not see me and still monitor the other cameras and send me notifications. A great product with a flawed system unless you want to purchase premium service after dropping a large wad of cash on the system itself.

When viewing (live or recorded) video, there was an audible ticking noise that came through 4 out of 6 of the cameras. After spending some time on Google I found that this is a common issue with the cameras but I couldn't find any answers to fix it. I contacted Arlo's/Negear Customer Support and after going through all of the steps that I had originally done (made sure the firmware was up-to-date, restarted the system, etc.) they took control of the system (with permission) and verified the noise. They stated that they have been aware of the problem but that because it affected so many of the cameras that I should replace the whole system and send it back to the retailer (Amazon), and request a replacement. Fast forward 5 days and I've just finished re-boxing the replacement set and printing out the new return label. This time, 6 out of 6 of the cameras have the ticking noise. At least this go around I didn't mount all of them before checking their operation; however, this is the last set I'll be dealing with as I'm not going to keep sending these back hoping for a set that works.","Ticking noise coming from live audio as well as recorded audio.

I have both the iOS app (personal phone) and Android app (work phone) both are simple to use. I love that motion detection alerts you and captures 10 secs of video of that moment that you can access on your phone app. In addition, when leaving the house you can alarm any of the cams so it will set off a 100 decibel alarm if triggered.

There is a camera delay, but I have a long porch so by the time the person gets to the door - it starts taping. That works for me. It was easy to set up.

So given that - plus the great reviews - I took a chance on this product.  And I am very glad I did !!  I have 4 less expensive cameras from by another major supplier that I have used for inside monitoring for some time now; and compared to my experience with them - the Arlo Pro system is far superior !!  The fact that it is battery operated makes the installation very do-a-ble.  I previously put off getting an outside camera because of the power issue.  And I half expected that to affect the wireless transmission quality of the camera !!  I previously had to hard wire my other inside cameras directly to the router because of wireless transmission errors.  But no !!  The Arlo camera is the farthest from my main router of them all - and has no latency and no intermittent wireless transmissions problems what-so-ever !!

The cameras work well when they are close to the base, but they really start to falter when more than 50 feet away from the base, even though the range is supposed to be much larger than that. Videos freeze, major movements aren't captured, and sometimes the image is partially blocked out or pixelated.  It appears the only way to resolve this issue (which is relevant if you are getting more than one camera) is to have additional bases and to have a base located close to each camera (and that means having an internet connection, whether via router or extender, in those locations). Overall, this makes the multi-camera system less efficient and more costly. It would be great if Netgear figured out a way to allow you to connect a camera to a wifi extender instead of the base itself, so you don't have to buy multiple bases.",Cameras good but base needs better range

We always wanted to have two cameras. One to watch our 1 yr old dog in the living room and another one to monitor our front door. We spent a quite a bit of time doing online research. At the end it came down to Nest and Arlo systems. One of our family members owned a nest camera and they highly recommended the unit. However we didn't like Nest because it didn't have a storage to keep recordings unlike Arlo that provided 7 day cloud storage to keep the recordings. Arlo also offers a baby monitoring camera which we would definitely add when time comes. These two factors made our decision clear. There are several useful features Arlo Pros.: - GeoFencing feature. Although it's still in a beta mode it still works well - You can rotate the camera view and install the unit upside down - Night vision works so well. The image is clear even in a pitch dark place - Long lasting battery ~2wks without charge (indoor at optimal recording quality) - Mobile app. Doesn't crash and doesn't require much updating - Super easy to install Arlo Cons.: - Batter doesn't charge with a USB extension. It requires Arlo charging adapter directly connected to power outlet I would definitely recommend Arlo systems to everyone. It's affordable and works well.,Arlo Pro Security System

The system itself works fine when it's working. The app works, the cameras are easy to set up and install, and I thought everything was great for a week. Unfortunately things went down hill very quickly from there. I live in an area that suffers from tiny power cuts once or twice a month. They last less than a second, just long enough for the microwave clock to reset. I had one about two weeks after I installed my system, and it completely screwed up the base station. It had 3 solid green lights on the front, but the app and website both said my system was offline. I checked the forums and the only solution seemed to be a complete reset, which meant removing all devices from the app, re-adding the base station to the app, then taking down each installed camera and pairing it with the base again. I really didn't want to do this so I contacted Netgear support. Unfortunately they offered no better solution, and this seems like a common enough problem that the first thing they asked was ""have you had a power cut recently"", so I had to do it. I have the 6 camera system, so taking down each camera was very annoying to do. At this point I had already decided to return the system, but decided to keep it in place until I replaced it. Then we had another power cut about a week later and it happened again. Completely unimpressed. What kind of security system needs to be completely reset after a power cut! If I'd left for a week and this happened I'd be completely unprotected. As a side note, I could never get any cameras outside my house to work. I tried to put one camera outside my front door and as soon as the door closed, I couldn't connect to the camera anymore (base station about 15ft away, direct line of sight to the front door). I tried another in the back garden, same problem. I'm assuming it's the structure of my house, but who knows.","If you're looking for peace of mind, look elsewhere."

The product itself seems well built, the video quality is good (but not great), the battery life is good, the 7 day free storage is nice, and the website/mobile app work well.  HOWEVER, the motion detection on these cameras simply does NOT work well or even reasonably well enough for it to be considered reliable.  I have other 3 year old Samsung IP cameras in my house that work far better when it comes to motion detection.  The fact that Netgear itself says motion detection on these cameras doesn't work well when coming from a front on view is telling.  I've relocated these cameras multiple times in varying degrees of heights/angles/views with varying levels of sensitivity to motion detection and no matter what I do, they simply do not record soon enough to catch motion.

The installation was straight forward and the arlo Q cameras continue to operate with full functionality.  I am able to see live images from the new arlo pro cameras but I am unable to change the camera mode from ""disarm"" to ""arm"" using the arlo app on my iPhone 8.  Arlo tech support requested that I use Safari and Chrome on my iMac and internet explorer and chrome on a windows computer.  All had the same result.  I can see the camera images but can not change the mode for the arlo pro cameras only.  At this point the tech support said this is a known issue and I would be notified when a software fix was released.  The arlo app and iPhone, iMac, and windows based computer all have the latest updates.  It has been five days since installation with no fix provided.  At this point, the new arlo pro cameras are useless as security devices.  This is disapointing in that the arlo Q cameras have worked, and continue to work well, for over a year.",Update:  Works now.  Initial complaint:  Unable to change mode on new Arlo Pro cameras

It's amazing how great the images are and how well the home base can effectively communicate with far-flung cameras around the property. We started with 3 and once we had them and saw what they could do, we ordered 2 more. We're very impressed with battery life as with our setup, it only records when it's triggered. They do have some issues, though. The IR lights are very, very weak and do not highlight much more than 10-15 feet in front of the cameras. So, we're now considering adding some IR floodlights to our security to help illuminate what Arlo cannot see. Also, the sensitivity of the motion detectors sure could be improved but that may have something to do with illumination too. Once Arlo does see something it's pretty slow at starting the video, so you see a lot of things on the edge of the camera field walking or driving away and quickly disappearing. Many times the hard coded 10 seconds of video just isn't enough and it would be great to be able to adjust camera recording times. The bottom line it is a pretty great security system that could still use some TLC but we believe that they are an almost perfect fit for us.",Very good camera security system with some caveots

The motion detection sensitivity is all the way up, yet, the device only turns on when an object is within 10 feet of the camera.  There is no protection for the rest of my property.  Someone could break into my vehicle parked 20 feet away from the camera, and Arlo wouldn't record a thing. Total waste of money.  I did verify that I didn't have the motion sensitivity on backwards.  It is not a user error.  The only thing Arlo can protect is your front porch from stray cats.  Do not buy!",Very poor range on motion detection

I bought the Blink initially, but Arlos have a true night mode, instead of using a bright LED to light up the room. This means you can use it to monitor for example a sleeping baby without waking him up. The batteries last pretty well. The website and the software ecosystem (desktop, mobile app) are easy to use and pretty flexible/feature-rich. Things to improve: 1 - The Micro USB charger cable connector on the cameras: The plug housing the USB connection sits too deep in the camera body, meaning that you can only use the (custom-made?) Arlo charger cable to charge them, and not any generic USB charger. 1.1 - The USB charger cable is too short if you wanted to leave the cameras in place while charging. This means you have to bring them down, recharge, then take them back up and re-position them. 2- If the main router/hub is turned off, your camera batteries will drain in almost 2 days (EVEN WHEN THEY ARE OFF). My guess is the cameras (even when you turn them off) ping the hub once in a while to report their status and make sure they are connected. If they can't find the hub, they will keep pinging it till they run out of battery. This is terrible as you can never really shut down the system (say you are home for a while and don't need cameras)","Great product, and possibly the best consumer-level ones in ..."

If these issues get resolved, I will change my review to 5 star: - There is a long delay between clicking to view the camera in the app and the camera feed coming through (10 second delay). - Sometimes the camera does not detect motion. For example, I installed the camera in the garage but it does not detect the garage door opening as movement. This concerns me as to how robust the motion detection system is - The geofencing and scheduling features are not flexible enough. I would like to have more flexibility in planning my Arlo (for example scheduling + geofencing) - The app looks like it was made by a 12 year old.

Weiss,This security camera is so much better than the ring doorbell or ring stick up cam. There is so many options for tweaking the settings. The video picture is great and the app is awesome. Very well designed and easy to use. My only complaint is how sensitive the cameras are. But that issue was solved by turning down the sensitivity setting. Also these cameras pick up heat. So don't face camera towards a heater vent because you'll get false motion alarms. Another awesome thing is that these cameras can be placed outside. I don't really care for the magnet style wall mounts but they'll do for now until I can order the screw on mount. But overall this setup is pretty cool. Can't ask for anything better. The siren on the base station is loud as heck. Would definitely scare a robber away. There is a 2 or 3 second lag in the live viewing mode but what can u expect with the feed having to go through your Wi-Fi then to a satellite and then back to another satellite back to you. And I'm probably leaving out a step or two. But it's an awesome setup. You also get 7 free days of video recordings. And you can set the recording time to 10 seconds all the way up to 2 minutes. I found out that even 1 minute is way too long. I have my cameras set at 20 seconds. There is so many features between the cameras and app that I would be writing a book in order to explain it all. One thing I forgot to mention is that setting up the cameras with the base station is a breeze. A 12 year old could do it. Anyways I think these cameras are the bomb.,This is the bomb

One of the major downfall of this wireless security camera set is its battery life. If you don't buy the only available replacement batteries for this ($50 each) then you would find yourself replacing each camera every other week, which is not only a major inconvenience but also a question of reliability since you can't monitor the house as you would like if you need to take it down so often to recharge the batteries.",Low Battery Life

I didn't want to invest too much so I bought the one camera system to see if I liked it.  I only had it for a few days and so far it works great.  I am going to purchase two more cameras over time.  I like the stylish design.  I have tried two other WiFi systems and so far this is the best.  It picks up motion pretty well and I have yet to receive false alarms.  The connection seems to be pretty stable.  I guess it took a company that specializes in wireless networking to get this right.  I truly like that you have the option to record to a USB or hard drive.  Right now I have a 64GB micro USB plugged into it.  I gave it 4 stars because the price is a little over the top.

Installing these on Hardie plank I wasn't able to use the included screws, but I opted for outdoor double sided mounting tape, which worked really well. They are good quality and I've been delighted by having extra eyes when packages arrive or when a solicitor is at my house so I know I should dawdle before pulling up to avoid them. Haha! The only issue I have is that Arlo Smart, the subscription, is pretty much necessary. Tree leaves blowing will trigger your motion sensor every couple minutes if you don't have Arlo Smart to indicate you only care about people and vehicles and not any random motion detected. Additionally, I wish the zones you set up could be made into an irregular shape. One of my cameras is pointed diagonally at my driveway, and a uniform rectangle includes part of the street if I want to include my entire driveway. If I wanted to make sure not to get street traffic, the detection zone would have to be made much smaller and wouldn't include part of the driveway, which isn't desired, so I opt for a larger detection area which will get more notifications than I want as it will catch passing cars. But those are minor complaints. Overall, I'm really pleased with my purchase and could easily recommend them.",Love these cameras!

A. Montgomery,"Edit:  I am revising my review from a year ago now that I’ve had this system for just a little over a year. I am also keeping my original review which you can find below. The major issue after using this a year is that the batteries are now worthless and I will have to order replacements for $48 each.  Make sure you factor this into your purchasing decision as it turns out you are likely going to have a running cost with replacing batteries.  The battery on the main camera that gets the most use needed it charged every 3-4 months initially. After 3 charges this past year, now it needs charged every 1-2 weeks.  The camera did not get all that much use either with some weeks not even being activated or put into use. I expected longer battery overall lifetime than what I got and after reading reviews on the official battery replacement amazon product page, it appears that it’s a crapshoot on whether you get a decent battery or not. Either way plan on at least $50 per camera per year for replacement batteries.  We went with this because we didn’t want to pay monthly subscription fees to other big security companies.  Had I known then what I know now I would likely have taken a closer look at some of what else was out there. Having used it for 10 days now I am very pleased with it.  I have installed it over my entryway and plan to add more cameras at some point in the future.  Only issue I had was that I had a landscape light that was pointing towards the camera and this really screwed up the night vision.  So far though it works as advertised.",Not pleased after a year.

Each cable that came with the cameras failed within a week on cameras mounted outdoors.  Then I upgraded and purchased the Arlo Outdoor Power Adapters.  The first four power adapters failed and Amazon sent me replacements.  Now 3 of 4 replacement outdoor power adapters have failed.  The cameras display an error code and shortly thereafter each camera cannot be located.  Customer service with Netgear says to unplug the cable for one hour and replace it.  They say it's a battery overheating issue.  But my issue is that I have the four outdoor power adapters mounted up high 30 feet under my roof ledges.  So it requires me to hire a contractor on a ladder every week or two to fix the issue.  I am returning all 10 of my cameras - I wish Netgear would have tested the Arlo Pro system before they began selling it to the general public.  Pretty disappointed.  Amazon has been great at replacing defective parts.  I hope they'll take the thousands of dollars I've spent on my system back now.,Major problems with Arlo Pro charging cables

Regardless, it shouldn't have crapped out after only 2-1/2 weeks.  I looked up on line to see if it can be fixed somehow and it looks like there are lots of people with the same issue.

From about 12' away the patio camera just shows the patio door and a foot or so on either side of it. Pointed out into the open patio area, the field of view remains disappointingly narrow. I'd like to have one camera display a decent amount of area instead of having to buy more just to cover one direction fully.

The video isn't the highest of quality, it's HD but not 4K, which is pretty good for a home surveillance, it's definitely better quality as the cheaper wifi cameras. I even bought a second camera and was able to add it to the base in under 10 minutes. I also bought the outdoor mount, which is ""good enough"" to use with the camera but can be a pain to get the camera back on the threaded mount. Find it here NETGEAR Arlo Outdoor Security Mount The configuration settings are ok, easy enough to follow along and set things to what you want, the only downsides are that it doesn't prompt when you make changes, so if you forget to hit Save, you'll have to redo it. A bit frustrating for me at least. Right now I have a schedule running to set the camera to a lower detection rate during the day, and then at night to bump up the detection settings and the recording length as well. I also have it set to be deactivated when my kids usually are playing out in the front yard. Arlo Smart has introduced a month ago, its free for 30 days on one camera. I set it on the front door and bumped the detection level to see how it works.It works fairly well for what it does. I've noticed that it does think shapes are people, which it will alert you if there might be a movement that it just doesn't understand what it is. This leads me to the negative bits. The battery, the one concerns I think most have. IF you have it record on movement in places that are not going to have your kids playing, then the battery will last a whole lot longer than it would by having your kids play outside and you be alerted as it records every time (1-2 minutes based on how you set it up) sections. I had to recharge the camera a couple times due to this. After the configuration for the schedules, the battery lasts a lot longer. If it had ""fences"" or ""grids"" to set how the camera starts recording, then that would also be very helpful. I would like to click a fence on the viewport of the camera on my phone or the web view, of where to record and where not to. An example would be to point the camera at your mailbox from the house, but click a fence or grid around the mailbox and not the street. So if there's movement next to it, the camera will record, if there is a car driving by, and it's not in the detection fence/grid then the camera won't record. Something to wish for I guess. The app is kinda slow and clunky. When I am trying to turn off the mode when my kids are playing, it takes it time to talk to the base station on the same network. If they allowed for local storage, rather than their cloud service, I would think more would buy in. Some rural locations don't have the network available to sync the footage. Overall, I keep telling people to get one.",Excellent camera system.

Pros-they work really well. Video quality is excellent and I just recharged them for the first time and they were only down to 40%, so battery life is better than I expected. The live feature and sound is exceptional. Even speaking to people works really well. The only Con, the motion sensitivity. I would like to be able to zone them but you cannot. I had to adjust my cameras field of view from the road so it didn’t go off every couple minutes from cars. Other than that, it does go off every time someone or something goes across my yard, sidewalk or driveway. I’d like a zone though so when it does record when someone is on my property it records a larger area, where maybe a car would be. If that makes sense. Update Battery life after 7 months is awesome.

Problem is its not quite true.So being told that the battery would last 4-6 months but not reading anything about the camera having three quality settings until I was setting it up I was surprised and felt a little trepidation choosing of course the highest quality setting. the arlo is not the very highest quality camera available i reasoned and how much difference could the setting make to battery life. The very next day I was having to dig out the ladder to get to the battery and change it, although i had charged them before installing them aand they claim to be pre charged i decided to use a different camera and battery, this time i chose the middle quality video setting, well its less than a week and it just notified me its dying again.So now i am wondering how long the lowest quality will last two weeks?so I know whats going on i live in a city and it uploads about five seconds of videa when ever its triggered which can be every few minutes to every twenty or thirty minutes. Well im sorry most people live in cities so if your product only last six months  staring at a suburban drivway but is useless in cities and the country  then you need to be plain about that not brag about six months battery life have some other problems with the product they are inexplicably proud to not supply a manual and expect you to read on the internet, then you find on the net only the barest details and links to their fan club. basically they expect you to read through a labyrinth of user comments about their journey of discovery its retarded you know its a pretty good product but there is a lot of retarded presentation. If you have read about the two way talk and alarm and thought oh i can use this as a video intercom think again. Its really  frustrating when you realize this wont work and they dont sell a doorbellcam to integrate into the sytem and you will have to go to another brand or hope and wait for them to wise up. Heres why it wont work as a video doorbell.which include several of the bugs that make it less than it first seems and again most of this is not spelled out in the promo descriptions. the alarm is super loud and will be triggered anytime the camera detects motion and or sound.(in most situations see above} that will be a lot of false alarms.the camera  and alarm have a huge lag, all signals must go through netgears server you cant bypass it even in live view which is really unnecessarily annoying and should be fixed as an option for live veiw and as a local network,but it also inexplicably  just takes a while to start recording at all,you often only catch the tail end of someone walking past the camera.when you see features actual video doorbells have you realize this isnt a substitute the camera is too far away from the door and the person at the door will be in side view and of course theres no door bell feature that say rings your phone as i said if theres any chance of the camera being triggered by passers by you wont use the alarm, and i set up text alerts at first then got one every few minutes and turned them off. when you look at doorbell features you realize the difference and you really want arlo to make one to add to the same system. You can hardwire the cameras that will pick up a lot of movement and hopefully the other cameras really last that long when seldom triggered.and wait assuming arlo will figure out it has to  make a doorbell and fix the lag issues. or you can return it all and wait another year or two for someone to get it right im debating i like some features but it was a lot to buy so many cameras and have the most important one really not do their job as advertized.",Misleading

Battery life is very good - so far. They have been up and running for a few months and the units show fully charged (on initial charge - I have not recharged the units yet since their initial charge after purchase) . I rarely set the cameras to motion mode. I typically log into the system a few times a week and don't continuous run them. The motion sensing functionality is excellent. Very cool to know when anyone comes by especially when traveling. The audio quality is just good too especially given they are wireless. The two way communication is challenging given the delay. There is a good 3 to 5 second delay in video on my network. Not certain if it's an issue to my local network or not, but the delay can be an issue in communicating with someone from my iPhone or computer to the person on camera. The process is a bit - awkward. I start my conversations with - please wait 3 seconds before beginning to respond/speak due to the lag.  It's not that big of a deal given my use case, but may be an issue for others if seamless two way communication is expected to be like a phone conversation.  The two way communication is more like a walkie talkie with a delay. The limitations in two way audio is easily overlooked given the units are wireless, compact, efficient, color, night vision, motion and audio trigger/sensor, easy to create program modes for different scenarios (like motion sensors on exterior cameras at night, but leave interior camera motion sensors off). Audio is very sensitive. You can create workflows to record based on sensing sound as well as sensing motion. I have a mix of older Arlo wireless (w/o sound) and they operate together w/o issue. All in all I am very satisfied with this system. I have 5 cameras as of this writing and will be adding a couple more units soon.",Battery life is very good - so far

Setting it up is VERY easy!  The video quality is 720p, but in my opinion is a lower quality 720p.  When zooming in on a video it is a digital zoom, and not really useful as it starts to blur quickly.  1080p would have been more useful for this purpose.  I have the volume for the speaker/microphone turned all the way up, and they aren't really loud enough.  Carrying on a conversation is very difficult.  The motion detection in most cases is adequate if you pay attention to the sensitivity setting, and spend some time getting it right.

Also the speaker on the cameras are not very loud. The microphone is ok. The reason I bought this brand camera was that it works with IFTTT.

I tried an Arlo system first (non-pro) and ended up having to return three of the five cameras under warranty because they did not work properly.  When the fourth camera quit I returned the entire system and tried the Arlo Pro.  I haven't had much better luck with it.  Two of the cameras frequently only record in black and white.  One camera is hit and miss whether it picks up motion five feet in front of it.  I have had to reboot the system, disconnect and reconnect the cameras, etc. to get them to work properly.  If it was reliable, it would be a great system, but the equipment is not reliable.  Also, Amazon says you can record from six cameras for free.  That is not the case.  You can only connect five for free.  You have to pay for a subscription if you want to connect more than five at a time.  The system is not worth the headaches.  It worked great for the first couple of months, then one problem after another. - Update - five months in and one camera is dead and a battery in another is dead.  I have been online with Arlo support for 90 minutes.  They want you to do all kinds of trouble shooting, some of which is utterly useless, before they will do anything.

We like this for security purposes and  it doesn't frighten  us with false alarms as too many security systems do. It's very easy to install and get running. We only wish that the cameras could be wired for power but Arlo does now offer a battery charger for the unique and expensive batteries.

Cons: when alert arrives, there is a lag between the alert, opening app, logging in and seeing the video. Why does this matter? It doesn't if you aren't home. It does if you want to know who is at the door before you answer or if you want to talk to the person at the door using the audio feature. Most people don't wait long enough at the door for you to interact.

There is a lag between the time the camera detects motion and the time is starts recording.  For example I have a camera on my front steps to try and catch someone who has been stealing packages.  I have 25 feet of walkway to the base of my stairs and another 15 feet up the stairs.  Someone can get almost all the way to the stairs before that camera starts recording, and if someone were to run up, snatch a package and run off, I probably will only catch their backside. I have turned the camera sensitivity up all the way.  This could be solved by setting up custom rules, but there are certain combinations of actions that prevent me from being able to do this; I'd have to buy another camera just to trigger the other two which is not something I'm prepared to spend $180 for..

Sometimes I just go ""live"" on the camera to check the weather at our cabin. It's awesome! Batteries have lasted over a week without hardly dropping in power at all. I do want to invest in the optional solar charger but they are a little pricey. Siren is loud but should be called a beeper since it's more like a smoke alarm than a true siren. It would be nice for them to make the ""siren"" sound come from the cameras, rather than the base station as well since my base is approaching the 100 ft maximum distance and it can hardly be heard from there.",Bought based on reviews but surprisingly worth the money

Merritt,"I would give it 5 stars but there are a couple of improvements that could be made to really make them stand out. They are great for being able to mount about anywhere as no wiring is needed and they are small enough to easily mount to about anything, but they aren't so small they don't produce a good picture. The battery life depends a lot on how far from base they are and what materials the signal need to go through to the base. The 300 foot limit they talk about is strictly wide open area and little blockage of signal by walls of wood, concrete, brick, and so forth. The system is a great starter system which can be built upon by adding cameras and the fact they only allow 5 before a monthly fee is in place is a little bit of a let down but again, all in all a fairly decent product and with some exploring and working on adjustments and all you can pretty much set up the system almost anyway you would like with motion and noise activation of recording and alerts.

For some reason the arlo pro cant use sound as a trigger for ifttt even though the arlo q can, but it can use motion as an ifttt trigger and the sound notifications still come to your phone as regular app notifications.  geofencing worked fine when it was just my phone but it couldnt seem to work when i shared access with my roommate.  indoors i would reccommend the arlo q unless you want to put it in a place where a cord isnt parctical.

I live in a Townhouse with quite a few 2.4Ghz access points nearby, I haven't worried about it before as I use 5Ghz for everything. I am absolutely shocked that the cameras do not have 5Ghz capability! Especially from a networking company like Netgear! So now I am really frustrated. The cameras and app are better than most so I don't want to return it, but it infuriates me when I use it. If there is 5ghz hardware in the cameras, I really hope they add it via firmware update.

Yes, you sacrifice some video quality, but for most purposes these are more than adequate. We have five configured around our home, and in conjunction with IFTTT programming they're an incredible security asset.  The wireless system permitted us to hang two from trees and capture the entire front and back of our home and driveway.  The motion sensors on those cameras picks up very little, of course, but we've used IFTTT to tie them to the other cameras and independent motion sensors.  We get a beautiful, complete view of any activity occurring around our home. The battery charging is somewhat of a hassle as-is, but I'm not docking my review of the cameras for that.

I like that the email alert gives a quick snapshot of the motion it detects. That way I can see if it is just my dog tripping the motion detector.

I bought it for myself as a christmas gift and was super excited to set it up since package theft has been an issue in our neighborhood. 1. The setup was fairly easy, took everything out of the box hooked up the base station and synced the cameras. First step was to download the mobile app and update the firmware. *firmware would not update via the mobile application, you would click update and nothing would happen. I had  to login to the arlo account via my laptop web browser and then the firmware would finally update. 2. Post firmware update I set the cameras up in my desired locations (2 cameras for the front door and garage door both about 10 -20 feet from the basestation. Everything seemed to be ok at first then about 20 minutes later one of the cameras disconnects. I reconnect and this keeps happening it will stay connected for 5 - 20 min only then losses connection, only way to get it back up is to remove battery and put it back in. plugged in the cameras to ensure both batteries are fully charged, moved the camera right beside the basestation in case it was a range issue, swapped new batteries, reset the system numerous times and re-synced the cameras, reset my cable modem and router, etc. etc. Camera still would not stay connected. 3. I have a very technical background & wasted most of my Christmas day troubleshooting these cameras trying to get them to work. Finally contacted Netgear support only to waste another several hours of my time on basic steps like turn the power off and on. That was the extent of the technical knowledge the representative on the line could help me with. After 3 days of messing with the camera trying to get it to stay connected I give up and returned this faulty product.

This exposed the sealed battery compartment.  My camera was used outside, but luckily it was under a covered area.

So although I had to take the camera down for a few weeks, Arlo support was awesome and replaced it without hassle. I really like it.  Works as described.  I dont have any issue with motion being triggered by sun glare or car passing by, but it could be how my is setup under an overhang. When setting up I did notice there is about a 3 second delay.

Given some of the other comments about the cameras working inconsistently when directly exposed to the elements (which they would have been in the places available to mount them on the exterior of my house), I decided to repurpose them to use as, essentially, webcams to use inside my house when doing separation anxiety training with my dog. They were working fine for this purpose - okay, but not great - for a few months until recently, when the cameras stopped staying connected to my phone, failed to reconnect when I tried to reconnect, and in general stopped working entirely - no audio, video, motion detection, recording, etc. I've had them more than a year, and Arlo only provides a one-year warranty on the hardware, so now I have a hub and cameras that, because they have no functional use since they don't consistently work for any purpose now, are going to become waste in a landfill, which isn't a thing I feel great about.

Video quality is good, cameras are small and sleek, and the mounting hardware is nice. Some issues: the 2-pack wire free Arlo Pro only comes with one AC adapter and charging cable for the camera. As a product that touts the ability to stay plugged in if desired, they don't provide enough accessories to accomplish this. Since it only comes with one AC adapter and cable, you can only plug in one camera at all times. If you want another charging adapter and cable, it appears the only way is to buy another rechargeable battery, which does you no good if you don't have the battery charging station. And in theory, a truly wire-free option is nice, but unless you buy extra batteries and a charging station, you will need to remove the battery and camera at some point to charge, thus leaving you without any security for the time it takes to charge. Not ideal! And this may be the case with all wire-free/IP cameras, but there is a noticeable lag. I have my camera pointed at the stairs to my door and I almost get to the top of the stairs before my camera starts to record. Wish it came on sooner.

Wanted a continuous power connection to charger to avoid recharging manually.  I thought I could cut the USB cable and then feed it through a simple plastic coax cable bushing and splice the cable on the inside of the house/garage.  It turned out the cable wire was so thin and the coated strands made it near impossible to easily splice. Don't cut the USB cable - you'll be sorry.  So I looked around for some kind of weatherproof feed through bushing that would accept the USB cable including the connector at the end without having to cut the cable. West Marine sells a nice round plastic wire feed through bushing that comes apart so you can feed the wire and connector through it. It has a rubber washer that seals the bushing to the mounting surface.  the bottom of the bushing is still open and in some cases you might need to apply silicone caulk to keep out the rain and bugs.  See attached photo. Cost is $7.49 for one bushing. Comes in white or black.  A little pricey but good quality construction and it does the job. As far as the Arlo Pro cameras go, for me the 720p resolution is more than adequate. No need to spend the extra money for the Arlo 2 in my opinion. I tried using the shorter outside mount but was unable to get a steep enough angle down to view my front door.  I'd recommend the Wasserman mounts for the Arlo Pro. You get 2 for about $11.

Where I will use this, if I can figure it out, is that during the day, high traffic camera views like the street and sidewalk with lots of traffic, I won't have the video recording armed, but at night I will.  The camera will still be live, it just won't record or send notifications when it detects motion.",Very good wireless security cameras.

You get a FREE 7day cloud storage or use a flash drive to store your images or you can opt to buy extra cloud services. I would definitely buy more cameras when I have the money. Something to consider: -there are motions that were not captured but maybe it's how I positioned the camera.

No need to here!  Amazing.  I am a (retired) mechanical engineer and am amazed at how well this device performs.  My first experience using it outdoors produced a notification of an email on my phone that indicated the camera was triggered by motion.  I watched the video it had recorded and sure enough, a (presumably) large bug had had the audacity (at night) to fly by the camera!  A quick adjustment of the sensitivity, using my phone, eliminated the (bug) detection but reliably triggered the camera when a person was in view.  Ha!  I love it!",Super!

I've try dropcam and blink as well. Setup and install is a breeze. Picture quality and features are fine. Battery life is undetermined because I have only had them for a week or two. This system has what you need to guard your home. Sensors, camera, recording and siren. The distance from cam to hub is great. I've went out double the distance compared to my blink cams. Now for the negative. The iOS app doesn't offer all the same features as the pc web interface. Mode setup is easier on the pc browser. Next the lag between sensing and recording is real. There is easily a five second or so lag. This is probably the case with most battery wifi camera systems. People want more features and more power yet they forget these are battery powered wifi cameras. Buy a wired system if you want instant access. Four stars.",Close to perfect.

I have setup other cameras as motion detectors to start the new camera before visitors walk up and that works great. Love the ability to schedule, set cameras to capture photos or video, set length, and other settings. The cameras are small, powerful, and really like to be able to place them anywhere I choose.

Simple installation with the ease of just plug and play. I personally love how convenient and clear the video capture is when viewing through your smartphone & PC. Since it automatically uploads footage to the cloud, the free 7-day, 5 camera recording is the best.  The plus side is that you can easily view those footage anywhere and download it and post it on social media right away.  There is an option to setup an alarm when motion or sound detected which is ridiculously loud.  So far, battery has been good but i'm currently waiting for the outdoor charging plug which plugs via micro usb connection. This device is great but there are flaws.  While setting up, the owner will get bombarded with email and push notifications to your phone which will be annoying but once fully set up with the right scheduling, it will be less bombarded.  Very quick movements far away will not be detected and when nearby, it will briefly capture that quick movement if passing by.  This device will not automatically capture outdoor movements while being positioned through a Window indoors.  This device only automatically records up to ten secs of footage then detects again if there is still movement and sound. This will continue to record another ten seconds of footage but because of this process, there is a delay in between. Overall, even with the flaws, I personally recommend getting this Camera system.  A person can easily spend on expensive professional equipment as well as paying someone to professionally install that system but if you just want to avoid all that, this product will be quick and easy.",Quick and Easy Protection Right Away

The quality of the footage is pretty good for being a wireless camera. I really can't complain about the system. Some people argue that it wont pick up license plates.... but most camera systems won't pick unless you buy a camera specifically for that (license plate recognition cameras) which for one camera it costs more than the price of this entire system. The motion activated feature is really nice. I wish you could watch all clips continuously. Going through all the footage takes forever even if the clips are only for a few seconds. It would be nice if I could just press play all and watch them in order, one after another. Then I could go back and delete footage as needed.",Great system! Just needs a watch all button.

"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Oct 2017,Koko,"I've recently purchased the Arlo Pro single bundle set to test and see if it was worth purchasing additional cameras. This was my additional camera purchase for a single Arlo Pro Security Camera from Amazon Arlo Pro Security Camera by NETGEAR - Add-on Rechargeable Wire-Free HD Camera with Audio [Base Station not included] | Indoor/Outdoor | Night Vision (VMC4030) . Listed below are my pros and cons about this device. Note that these devices are placed outdoors. IMAGE QUALITY:  720p Resolution is good, but not great. You can capture objects in good detail IF you place the camera close to the object/area of recording. If you place it further away from object/area the quality will become pixelated/blotchy. I currently have this eight feet above and two feet away from my door. I can see whoever approaches my door at fair to good detail. I also have one facing my driveway, but the quality is very average and I cannot see details of a person walking by or even my vehicle license plate. Again good up close. Currently, Netgear has just released their newer Arlo Outdoor cameras - Arlo Pro 2 which records at 1080p. You can find it here: Arlo Pro 2 by NETGEAR Add-on Security Camera, Rechargeable, Wire-Free, 1080p HD, Audio, Indoor/Outdoor, Night Vision, Works with Amazon Alexa (VMC4030P) [Base Station not Included ] NOTE: This is a very new release and there hasn't been enough reviews yet. The reviews there are currently not about the product itself, but more about their disdain with pricing. Best wait after a month to see actual purchased reviews. Complaints about the differences between 720p and 1080p not making much of a difference is completely illogical. As a person who works with video editing this is like saying DVDs and Blu-Rays visual quality look alike. They do not. There is a great significance between detail. Unfortunately, as I'm waiting to test the Arlo's 1080p product, I can't say for certain if this is going to capture the quality I want, but on a technical standpoint 1080p should raise the bar on these cameras, and I'm willing to spend $220 to buy them over these 720p versions. AUDIO QUALITY: When viewing this on my smartphone or computer, the audio is great. I can hear everything crisp and clear from my recordings. However, in regards to the MIC function for speaking with someone outdoors, make sure that it's close by. At the max audio level, I tested audibility by standing outside my door and talking using the microphone on my smartphone. The audio was very audible from where I was standing which was probably about 3 to 4 feet away. However, anywhere beyond that will be difficult to hear. NIGHT VISION: Love the night vision on this, but again same thing happens with Image Quality as listed above. If it's too far away, you're not going to see much detail. At a closer distance I was able to decipher raccoons walking across our door. Just note, when placing these near any area around the house, make sure it's away from any motion sensor light. The initial flare of the light automatically turning on will cause the image of the camera to blur out a bit until it stabilizes to accommodate for the lighting. This means you may lose a few seconds of recording. RECORDING SENSITIVITY: You'll need to play with the sensitivity function on each individual camera. I've tested cars passing by about 15-20 feet away and they will set it off. If I were to reduce the sensitivity under 50 (This is out of 100 max) then it'll ignore some of the cars passing by. NOTE: There is a three second delay on the recording as many have mentioned in this review. So be aware that you may lose two to three seconds before it starts capturing anything. BATTERY LIFE: Yes, the batteries do last long (Potentially 3 months) IF you leave it at a default setting of 10 second recording and not watching LIVE mode for too long. If you set your recordings at 60 seconds, then the battery life may only last about 1 month. So be aware of this. You can also set your camera to record only when motion is detected. SMARTPHONE APP: Great App and works well. Pretty user friendly and not difficult to maneuver to find things. Just make sure that if you're viewing your videos live to have your phone using WIFI and not your data plan. If you have a limited data plan (Mine is 2 GB only) on your smartphone, this thing will guzzle it in a matter of just a few days. My mobile carrier currently is throttling my bandwidth down even though it's unlimited. This can happen to you too if you're not careful. OVERALL: I'm happy with my Arlo Pro system. The only down part was that I didn't wait long enough for the 1080p cameras to come out which isn't too big of a loss. I still plan to use my 720p near areas of short distance recording while the others down the line will be at 1080p.","Arlo Pro Security System - Cameras are Good, but Not Great."
"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Feb 2017,I. Costner,"I've had 5 Arlo Pro cameras for about two weeks now and just ordered 5 more.  The first kit I purchased at Best Buy, the extra cameras I bought on Amazon.  These solved the biggest problem I was facing with outdoor cameras - wiring.  I bought a few IP cameras a couple of years ago and never got around to installing the wiring necessary to operate them.  They would have had much better video quality and would not have required a subscription or broadband data usage, but the wiring obstacle is a big one. First, the not so good:  There are a few compromises, but not deal breakers.  For starters, the video quality is so-so.  It really doesn't look like 720p on the ""optimized"" mode, but I assume this is a compromise for battery life.  Also, when I put two cameras within a foot or two of each other, the signals get scrambled about half the time.  They must be spaced out, but not more than 300 or so feet from the base.  I'd make sure they are at least 3-6 feet from each other as well.  I also do not like the fact that the motion recording will not stop when the motion stops, or continue recording as long as there is motion.  You must set a specific time for each clip (5-120 seconds, I think).  Each time motion is detected, it will record for that length of time only.  If the motion is a bug that flies in front of the camera for one second, and you have your video clip set to record for 120 seconds, you are going to have 119 seconds of unnecessary recording.  Also, if you have it set for 10 seconds and motion continues for 60 seconds, you will have a few very disconnected clips with several seconds missing between each clip.  I have read that the developers are working on a mode that will capture just motion, regardless of how long.  I hope they implement that soon.  Battery life has been pretty good on my cameras.  In one week, they went down about 3% (and that is with a lot of messing with them).  Of course, eventually, I'll have to go take every one of them down and either charge them (which is pretty fast) or buy an incredibly expensive charger and expensive extra batteries and swap out batteries one camera at a time.  I suppose that is not too bad since I didn't have to run any wires. The good:  They are SUPER easy to set up and manage.  They install in seconds anywhere you want to put them.  I really like the magnetic connection because it makes adjustments very easy.  The cloud recording is really fairly priced for what you get, and if you buy 10 cameras you get a lot of value out of the cloud service.  They also give me peace of mind while I'm away and that is really all I wanted. Overall:  Even with the compromises, I would buy these again without hesitation.  If you are looking for simple and cost effective home monitoring, Arlo Pro is the way to go.","The first kit I purchased at Best Buy, the extra cameras I bought on Amazon"

I do know when my amazon delivery shows up or the cat gets on the counter, after some time tuning I have false positive alerts down to a minimum. The price of both the cameras and the free cloud service make it one of the most affordable I've seen. The geolocation arming works pretty well for me to turn on notifications, I still have issues from time to time with doing geolocation based on two phones, but mostly it works. The integration with the Echo Show makes it easy to ask for a view of any of the cameras, handy when the dog is barking and I'm in the basement office. I have it integrated with my Wink home automation, so I can also react to motion detected from any of the cameras, with Stringify and IFTTT I've got some pretty cool automations going.

Whitmore,"We have had these cameras for about 3 weeks. We fully charged the batteries before we installed the system. They lasted for about 2 weeks before we needed to recharge them. We plugged them into the charger cord that came with the system and only one of them would charge. The other would not. We took the one that did charge back to our store and it has only been 5 days since and we already need to recharge it. I called Amazon and they were not really able to help us with this issue. The replacement batteries are VERY expensive. Another thing that we have a problem with is the time delay before the cameras actually start recording. It is at least 10 seconds after motion is detected that it will start recording and transmit to our phone. I do have to say though that the picture quality is amazing. The night vision works great as well. If we can't figure out what is going on with the battery charging issue, we may have to just return the system.","Battery quality, not the greatest.

The free level of cloud service was the greatest differentiator from competitors. Though I really wish the cameras were 4K, the picture is very nice at 720p. I did not realize that motion is detected by infrared sensors on the camera, as opposed to a certain % of changed pixels in the frame.  This is somewhat annoying based on my previous experience, but in retrospect it does result in much more efficient use of recording/cloud time.  I do find it does not catch some events well, like pets depending on where they are physically in respect to the camera.  Pixel triggers do not discriminate but infrared ones do.  Both have strengths and weaknesses. What I'd really like to do is constant video recording locally while only using the cloud as determined now.  I don't think that's possible, but I'm not sure. The construction of the cameras and design of the ball mount is really clever.  It makes it very easy to install. The batteries have been only lasting a couple days for me, because power is consumed whenever the camera is ""working"" based on the sensitivity of the motion sensor.  I fall on the more sensitive side, so my battery use is far greater than ""normal"" referenced in marketing material... but now I get it.  They want you to be very selective in your trigger settings and only record/upload to the cloud highly significant moments.  Makes sense. In my case, I have been forced to buy solar panels for each camera to keep them powered at my preferred sensitivity settings.  This makes each unit fairly pricey, but I think the overall solid function of the ecosystem warrants it.",Clever Approach to Camera

We initially had them mounted outside of our house for security. My husband and I began noticing that the camera was frequently picking up the sound of our infant son crying inside the house. Because of the easy portability of the cameras, we decided to move one into the house and saw that our nanny was leaving our baby in crib all day while she napped and watched TV. We fired her immediately once we realized what was going on. Arlo's superior sound pick up is what initially alerted us that there might be a problem and without the video portion we would never have known what was really going on inside our house.  I highly, highly, highly recommend these cameras.",Security cam turned nanny cam

The motion detection also seems to work well. The Android app is a bit confusing, but usable.  I have three main complaints about the product: First, the packaging is ridiculous for the 5-camera kit; taking apart the plastic dome that encloses the cameras is like solving a puzzle. Second, four of the five enclosed camera mounts are of the magnetic variety, which according to the Netgear website, are for *indoor* use only; why sell weather-proof cameras with indoor-only mounts? Finally, Netgear apparently refuses to provide Google Home integration, for reasons they won't explain on their forum; thinking about returning the whole $800+ package because of this.","Good cameras, bad mounts included for outdoor use, no Google Home integration"

Easy setup other than having to charge one camera to possibly update the software and worked fine a few moments after charging. Took me about 20 minutes to have 5 cameras working properly. Agree with others that blocking out areas for detection would be great. Had to adjust cameras for a flag blowing and cars driving by will set off the device, but I would want that if there was an issue. There is a delay with recording, but knew that before buying. It’s not an issue for me since I have 5 cameras to cover what I need. Four cover the outside and one inside. I only bought 5 because of cyber Monday prices and glad I did. I can easily move one inside based on my needs. I would carefully plan where you want to place the cameras before your start drilling. You also want to pre drill holes. Make SURE you listen to the reviews about recordings and triggers not working when walking straight at a camera. That is really my only concern with the camera, but I knew that before the purchase and set my cameras accordingly. It is easy to hear through the cameras, but talking through them is not perfect, but works. Not really planning on using the talking feature so not an issue for me. The sound is outstanding though. The batteries have held up well so far after two weeks and a lot of live camera action while I play with the system. I’m more than ok with having to charge the cameras in the future so I can move them where I need them based on my needs. I also avoided having to pay someone to install a system that may need fixing or adjustments later. Again, the cameras were ready to use in 20 minutes and mounted the same day and adjusted as needed the first two weeks. I also love the app and can give access to others based on my needs. I would not allow access to your email unless you want to delete tons of detection emails. The notifications on the phone is great and can be turned off as needed or you can turn off a camera that triggers cars driving by when you are not concerned about cars driving by. Yes, I would love continuous recording and unlimited recordings, but it’s not a priority with five cameras filming as needed or ready to go live as needed. I want to be notified of issues when I’m home or away so I can act accordingly, such as sounding an alarm, calling the police, or checking in at home. If more than one camera triggers there is something to check out and I can record it and have it on the cloud and a USB. You can also set modes based on triggers for recording and alarms in case you are not watching. Great purchase so far!",Great purchase after a wealth of research on different systems

The new system has addressed our complaints about the original system.  First, the rechargeable batteries seem to be holding up well in the great outdoors.  The battery charge is lasting much longer than the original system.  Time will tell.  Second, the new camera operates much better in low light situations.  Our original cameras did not operate well at night, which was critical since we use these as security cameras.  The new systems low light produces a clear picture in high resolution in the dark.  Finally, the new base station connects to the old cameras much more quickly and we do not have the buffering issue we had before with live streaming.  My only criticism and therefore awarding four star instead of five the process of recharging the batteries.  You either recharge the battery in the camera, which requires taking the cameras off their mounts or placing the battery in a recharging station, which is on back order for 1-2 months.

McNerney,"This system is a decent camera system with offsite cloud storage. However, it is not perfect. In fact there are a few bugs that can really destroy the concept if not worked out.  The following is a review of the Arlo Pro camera system, parts of it may not apply to other arlo systems. Camera: Decently heavy duty plastic that is well designed. With a proper cover this camera will last for years in an outdoor environment, Better mounting options should be considered, but you can use either magnetic or a screw in mount.  The picture quality is awesome, getting a high definition picture during daylight hours that most cameras would not achieve. The night vision is not very powerful, but still comparable to other cameras. The motion detection is decent, despite many complaints about it I have not had a problem. with it not working. It IS however slow to kick in, but this is normal for any camera. The delay is about 1 or 2 seconds longer, leading to about a 5 second delay before it records. This can be countered with using rules that turn on other cameras that may catch the entire movement when it is detected on a different camera, and any good setup will have multiple angles anyways. You can talk through the camera to someone, but I have not tested this. Access to the battery is fairly easy to get to, even while the camera is mounted. The camera cannot be used by itself and REQUIRES the use of the Arlo base station. Base: This is a small base with only one modifiable function, an audible alarm. However this base station is what all the cameras connect to. For those worried about the number of IP's used, your entire system will use a single IP because they all link to the base station.  Be careful though, the noise floor for 2.4GHz gets raised by quite a bit. Syncing and updating the base and the cameras can be a little problematic for a few days, but be patient and give it time...things settle down and the camera system all begins to work, despite the many errors you get in the app (often due to impatiently pushing an update multiple times).  The benefit of the Pro system is the ability to connect a USB hard drive as a backup for video.  For me this was the deciding factor. I would love to use my NAS so I can store years worth, but that is not an option with Arlo, so having a 2TB USB hard drive attached is the next best thing. This will store years of motion capture, despite my having only the free service. But this is a risk since it is on site storage and may be stolen. This base station requires a camera and an internet connection.  You will also need to have an account with Arlo. Services: This entire setup is designed to make you want to buy a subscription based plan.  Keep this in mind!  i disagree with their requirement for using the cloud and having their account, but this is the business model they chose (and I knew this before I purchased). You absolutely MUST have an Arlo account, or the system will not work. You can connect up to 5 cameras for free, and it will save 1 week or 1GB (whichever is smaller) of video.  This is pitiful! Take a 2 week vacation and get your stuff stolen on day 2, and you have no proof of anything when you get home! However, if you use a hard drive you may be able to survive this limitation.  They do offer other plans, and a weeks work of free offsite storage is not a bad idea.  But to be charged for adding 6th camera and now your required to pay monthly fees? Well, it is not the perfect system, and although I would love a couple more cameras I refuse to pay monthly fees....especially at the cost associated with this system. App: Here is the problem! The app is required for use, especially if you set up geofencing.  But recently I have been getting a slew of errors stating that geofencing requires the use of internet, which is fine if I lose internet....but I didn't. And the error does not disappear until you restart the phone. Also, geofencing has up to a 5 minute delay, so I can return home and the siren will sound (which is why i have it off currently) all before it registers that I am home and changes the running mode. The app occasionally will state that my systems is offline, yet i could have full access via the web or my wife's app. These errors are with Arlo support, and I am hoping they fix them.  If they don't they are severe enough for me to return the system. However if you do not use geofencing these would never be a problem for you. Phone Data: If you view the video a lot, and have a low data plan, it may be a good idea to look into a high data plan for this.  Especially if you use Geofencing! This is not a data friendly app, but it also has not completely obliterated my data either. Summary: This system could use improvements in the app, and maybe the motion sensors. But for a no wires system this setup has been outstanding! I am not a fan of being limited by the cloud setup, preventing me from using more cameras without a monthly fee, but I knew this going in. All in all it is a good buy so far.....and I will be VERY happy if they fix the geofencing data problem with my phone!","Pretty decent camera system, with a few bugs"

Always troubles and it is impossible to get any support from NetGear...the chat line is continually busy and they seldom answer the help line.  It is difficult to understand the representatives who are from a different country so there is a language mis-connect.  You have to PAY EXTRA for telephone support. The batteries on the arlo pro have to be charged CONSTANTLY. I leave the system turned off 90% of the time because of the very poor quality battery life .  With  batteries off 90% of the time they still need to be charged at least every 3 months.

I specifically chose this product due to its compatibility with Amazon Alexa's smart home automation functionality. Product setup is a breeze. The app provides a step by step process for setting up the base station and each camera. Regarding functionality, the video and sound quality are excellent. Smart alerts help to notify me of movement detection, which makes me feel more secure especially for cameras positioned in areas with low traffic. Though, I recommend reviewing your notification preferences since they can blow up your email/phone for cameras facing a roadway. My only complaint for this product is the resyncing process that is required if the base station is disconnected by a power outage. The process requires a complete repeat of the initial setup process i.e. taking down all cameras and syncing them to the base station. This is apparently an old issue that still has not been resolved, and very annoying. I am hoping a fix is still in the works. Other than that, great product!","Great Product!

I read through many reviews and compared with many other system and spent a good 3 weeks or so researching & making up my mind about this unit. 1st of all, I'd like to mention that Netgear waste SO MUCH in packaging of this unit.  I get it you're trying to make it look nice but man... you can reduce size of box by half & also probably save some $$ on it too. Anyway, video quality is good in both video & audio.  App works well & well designed, I was never comfortable with magnet wall mount but I was going to get another kind anyway so that was ok. For video to start, it takes about 3~5 seconds delay... little annoying but livable. Last test was for 2 way radio / talk feature which is why I went with this system.  (I don't have door bell nor intend to get one)  First of all, you need to wait for it to connect before you can talk.  This is another 3~5 second... so between video delay & audio delay, that's about 10 second delay.. not the best but once again, it's within my expectation. I said 'Hello' and on my Arlo unit I heard '-----'  Yup, nothing!  So I said again 'Hello~~~~'  And this time I heard 'Hel ------' Long story short, only about 1/3 of what I say would come through. I tried: Restarting the unit Reconnecting to internet And to MAKE SURE my internet was messing things up, I tried talking on my phone to my other IP camera at home (which does not have motion detection alert but has 2 way audio), and it was fine....  I say '1,2,3,4,5' and I can hear '1,2,3,4,5' clearly = internet is up & running. Over 3 day period, I kept trying Arlo... and end result is not once I was able to hear '1,2,3,4,5' all of them clearly.  Best I ever gotten was 3 numbers out of 5.  I said them slowly... 2 star for video part working... but I'm sending my back.  What a shame... had such as big hopes for this!  :(",2 way radio does NOT work

The benefits for me of being wireless outweighs the drawbacks with the 2-3 sec. delay when the recording starts. The one thing I don't like though is that the cameras on most occasions don't continuously record even though there is still movement. Instead it keeps recording several small chunks of 6-9 sec. recordings with 1-2 sec. gaps between them even though there is constant movement in front of the cameras even if it's within 5-10 ft.. I have the setting for up to 300 sec. record time and I have the sensitivity turned up to 100%. but it is not consistent.

After running our system for two weeks I can say the integration to our older system was seamless. What we love: Rechargeable batteries, two way sound feature, magnetic wall mounts, weather proof design. The ability the cameras have to record only when sound/motion is detected allow you to review the moments that matter most. What we don't like as much: Battery life short when using the cameras at high definition, picture quality is definitely not HD, even with settings at full resolution, tremendous lag getting live feed from the cams which renders the two way speaker system useless for communication.",Works great but...

The main attraction for this system was the free 7 days of cloud storage, but after using this for a week we have been impressed with the video quality, including the ability to monitor the home with the lights turned off.  We are able to log in and review the history of video clips that were recorded after detecting motion or watch a live feed (both include audio, too).  There is two-way audio, but we have not tested that feature yet.  Our experience with battery life is likely less than advertised, but we are exceeding the 5 minutes/day typical usage...perhaps that will change as the novelty wears off.  You can make adjustments to the settings (such as video quality, length of auto-recordings, times of day/week for detecting motion, etc.) that would also be useful to help conserve batteries or use AC power for the cameras (but it appears that purchasing additional AC adapters, 1 is included, is not a readily available option).  We like the ease of using an iPhone app to log in and have access to the online library of video clips or live feed.  Just an example of how we have found this useful, checking in on our relative during the night it was evident from watching and listening that the TV was left on (the batteries in the remote were drained) so we were able to make a late night visit and fix the issue so that they were not being kept awake all night with a TV that they could not turn off.  This system has allowed us to have peace and mind that our relative is okay, such as when  they refuse or can't answer the phone.",excellent surveillance system

It’s pretty easy to install and use. It has very good motion detection. My complaint is that the positioning of the camera greatly affects its ability to sense motion. If you are trying to keep it in a corner where it can’t be positioned at good angle, you can’t expect the motion detection to be effective. The notifications are a bit slow too. If it’s a quick movement, the camera won’t record the subject as there is a delay in the initiation of recording.

The motion detection on the cameras works well (almost too well as it will trigger when there are passing cars 40-50 feet away from the camera location).  Mounting the cameras on the exterior block walls of my house was fairly easy.  I would highly recommend using a drill bit designed for concrete as well as an impact driver to drill the holes for the exterior security mounts as this process will go much quicker with those tools than a standard drill with the same drill bit (not a fault towards the Arlo system as this is something you would experience with any exterior mounting to concrete block construction).",Solid Wireless Security Camera

It is easy to setup and use, but it does not capture all motion. For instance, if someone is coming directly towards your camera it most likely will not pick them up. Objects need to move horizontally to be recognized by the camera. I had an incident right in front of my house where I had two cameras placed, one at my door on the left side of my house and the other at the far right of my house, and they didn't pick up any of it. I adjusted the sensitivity settings several times and never got the right behavior that I would like. If you set the settings to be too sensitive, it will pick up things like the wind blowing a tree branch, but still not pickup the lady walking her dog and pooping on my lawn. This product is too expensive to not detect everything in motion. Here are my pros and cons. Pros: 1. Easy to install 2. Easy to setup 2. App is very responsive and easy to use 3. Battery life Cons: 1. Cameras do not pickup motion very well 2. Record delay can cause camera to miss things 3. Sensitive to wind 4.

However, the characteristics of my home's location mean that it does not work for us and unfortunately it will have to be returned.

Our house (as are most in Chicago) is essentially ""on the street"" with a sidewalk and parkway separating us from the road.  We would like outdoor monitoring as we have had problems with cars being broken into, and packages (allegedly) being delivered at our front door but not being there when we come home.  This seemed like an ideal solution, but a few factors mean it won't work for us. (a) there is a significant delay between motion being detected and the video starting; in most cases this means that the motion is not recorded sufficiently (b) because of the amount of traffic (pedestrian and car) a lot of video is being recorded (especially of cars) and this is consuming battery capacity too quickly (c) I can change the sensitivity of the motion detection, but it does not seem to capture all events (the newspaper being delivered in the morning for example) and if I turn up the sensitivity because of the traffic on our (side) street we are getting near-continuous recording which drains the battery even quicker.

The battery warranty is only for one year and Netgear customer support will not budge on replacement of these batteries once they are dead.  I have been a net gear customer for over eight years and have the Premier monthly subscription and none of that mattered when it came time to try and fix the battery issue. So if you purchase this camera just be aware that the batteries do not last more than a year and they will not replace them after the one year mark. If I hadn’t spent all of the money on these cameras I would’ve bought the Ring system instead. To say I’m disappointed in the quality of the battery system and the customer service is an understatement. I would not recommend buying Arlo until they fix the battery issue.,Buyer Beware. The battery life is awful.

It's motion-detection accuracy was best - very few false alarms and it only missed an event I knew about once in the three weeks I've been using it. All three cameras miss events from time to time. Installation was the easiest of the three - one screw and a magnetic half-dome mount that you pop the camera on, making it easy to aim. It's the smallest and least noticeable of the three. All three did a good job of walking you through the setup to get the camera on your network and viewing video on your phone, but Arlo's was the easiest because you just need to plug the base station into your network, then add cameras by pressing a connect button on the base station and the camera. The base-station is also a plus because for me because it has better range than my wireless network. The other cameras didn't always get a reliable signal at the far reaches of my house - especially the garage which juts out and has more concrete intervening. The battery-life is superior to Ring - enough to make it preferable to ones you have to plug in like Nest, which don't need to recharge, but I didn't have outlets in all the places I wanted a camera.. All three cameras cost about the same, but only Arlo has a free cloud-recording service that's good enough for most customers: 7 days of recording for up to five cameras (you pay for more cameras or recording history). The battery life is great, and recharging is easy since the camera comes off the magnetic mount easily. Altogether, the Arlo was the most accurate, easy and cheapest (because of the free cloud service).","and all of them were good, but Arlo was the best all-around"

Pros: Good picture quality, motion detection is fair (sometimes too sensitive), night vision works well enough to pick up people or animals at night with some ambient light. Set-up was fairly simple but took sometime to complete. Customer service is rather good when dealing with battery failures. Cons: Battery life diminishes quickly, additions to the system (doorbell and chimes in my case) need to be constantly re-synced with the system. I have had all 5 batteries for the cameras go bad, open cells in the lithium battery packs. Overall it is not a bad system, it works well when it works.

The Screw security mount is absolute garbage. Throw it out! The screw sits so shallowly in the base of the camera that little force can cause it to pop off.

I would love a way to tell the cam where the trigger is,.  It uses the edges and maybe 50 % of the time I miss movement.  It has to be really close to the camera and moving slow.  The other weirdness seems to be the ""spin up"" time.  If something does trip the camera, it needs to start recording and takes a little bit to get into focus.  So if something runs past it would trip, but the first second or 2 are fuzzy, rastered, and by the time it gets up to speed it could be too late.","Great concept, but some glitches"

Gonzalez,"First of all, the pro cameras live up to their rave reviews with regards to picture quality and sound. I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't hype. And it was super easy to set up. Almost too easy that I kept wondering if I was supposed to do more. Where it lacks is the delay on when sound begins when you press the microphone icon on the app display, and the delay in sound communication between the two parties. It's the same way cell phones were ten years ago with that annoying delay, only sometimes even longer. And the on / off of the microphone has a delay, too. I have extremely high speed internet and have several online streaming channels that rarely glitch and deliver a nice picture. So my internet can't be the problem. It may just be technology not caught up to Arlo, yet, I'm not sure. Am I being nit picky? Probably but these two cameras, the base, combined with the Galaxy 7 edge phone I bought just so I could have the best possible user experience weren't cheap either. I didn't read anywhere about this sound delay, and at the end of the day, I spent $1200. I guess I wish I had known about the delay going in. That delay is what  is keeping me from feeling I got my entire money's worth. I'm giving it four stars to be fair in case it's just that the technology isn't there yet.

In the end, I bought the Arlo Pro cameras.  They were pricier than the other two options I was looking at, but after receiving them I am extremely happy  with my decision.  Camera set-up was a breeze and the Arlo app is intuitive and easy to use.  I opted for the Pro instead of the Pro 2 because I value battery life over picture quality.  In well lighted situations, the picture quality is great.  Once you get into dim or night environments, picture quality does suffer but not to a point where you can't determine the activity you are viewing.  I really enjoy having the different ""modes"" for the cameras.  This makes it easy to customize automation of when the cameras turn on and off.  I would advise buying an extra battery and charger so that you can swap batteries immediately instead of waiting on the battery to charge.",Well worth the money

Purchased 3 and they work great without having to set up wires. - Good visibility, motion sensitivity is easy to fine tune, night vision works - Customizable alerts work (based on motion and/or sound) - Best bang for the buck available today - Alarm is loud enough to let someone breaking into the house know.  I think the alarm option is a better option than the sound of a shotgun.  I would love another alarm unit that I could plug in upstairs as part of the network - so 2 alarms would go off in the house (I have 2 stories in a long house so the noise carries upstairs but not as piercing upstairs). - I am fine with recharging every Xmonths Cons - audio is not strong (nor would I expect it from such a small unit) - UI is a little clunky, you have to search for where you set alerts.  Could be more intuitive - zooming in gets blurry when maxed.  If someone is trying to break into my car I probably won't get a clear view of their face as a result. - screwed in ceiling attachment can be unscrewed easily making for a fairly easy steal.

I had the option for expedited shipping which i could pay through their online portal. i only needed to pay the difference of cost between overnight or 2 business days and as said this was optional and on my personal direction.  i recieved the new unit and during the entire time i was kept updated via emails from them. when the replacement unit came it also came with a return label for shipping the old one back to them. as said this solution is great and 5 stars is the minimum i can give them.,great sense of security

I initially sought something like a Ring or Nest, but was turned off by the monthly fee to see past video feed. After researching these and learning from a friend his satisfaction with his Arlos I purchased these and have been very happy. I was amazed at the ease of set up- download the app and once you've created an account it will walk you through the entire thing. Mounting was easy as well. No cords meant I just placed the screw and positioned the camera where I thought it would be best located. Once set, I double checked the feed. I like that I can set times to motion sensor and turn off completed if needed. I also like that I can pull the camera down completely to charge when needed or when I don't want them up. The magnet to hold it in place helps with breeze of installation. Would highly recommend.",Easy set up and great feed

I have two other brands of outdoor cameras as well.  The Arlo Pro outperforms the other brands overall.  The Arlo Pro has NO wires, and after a week, the rechargeable battery is still at full power.  The sound picks up incredible detail, including our dog's nail-claws as he walks across our wood patio and a cat's meow 20 feet away.  The image is crystal clear during the day, and darker black and white at night but picks up excellent detail at 20 feet away at night.  My voice comes through loud and clear when using the talk mode.  The central indoor transmitter is 45 feet away from the outdoor camera, separated by a brick fireplace, and connection is just fine.

It was easy to install, and has worked well for the past two years. I enjoy the interface of the app, and the motion detection is good. However, in the past two months, the base station has been ""going offline"" every few weeks, and you can only reboot the unit physically, after calling Arlo Support. This renders all the security cameras completely useless. If the internet powers out intermittently, the base station does not reboot automatically. This has been an issue I have been noticing for many Arlo users on support boards. I feel like Arlo chooses not to recognize this as a deep, inherent flaw in it's technology.

I have 4 cameras placed around the perimeter of my house.  I've captured some beautiful wildlife walking in my backyard - great videos that I download and show off to people at work!  Installation was extremely simple and the only quirk I've encountered is sometimes the camera above my garage facing my driveway has false positives.  It seems to only happen at night and only when it's raining - readjusting it, lowering motion sensitivity, and resyncing it with the base hub haven't solved the issue.  I've seen on some forums that this appears to be something others have encountered as well.  Perhaps a firmware update in the future will solve the issue.  But outside of that small issue, everything else has been great and the app is wonderful.  I added Arlo to SmartThings and they seem to play well together, though I tend to mostly use the Arlo app instead because it has more features.  Overall, very happy and even considering purchasing a fifth camera for inside that I can trigger when I'm not home.",Excellent

I read about the original Arlo having issues with lag time between when it detected motion and when it starts recording, but I find no such issue with the Pro. Lag time was between 1-2 seconds, which I find more than acceptable for a completely wireless and weather proof device. I like the fact that the new base station has a 100db siren built-in, but I wish there were more options to configure it, such as timing (e.g. when activated, it gives a few audible beeps that's user configurable in order to disable it in case of an accidental activation, which most modern alarm systems have). The way it's set up now is you either have to activate it manually from the app, or have it go off immediately if motion is detected. I wish at least 1 outdoor mount was included with all package configurations, as while the magnetic mount is nice, doesn't leave much to security. I believe currently, only the 4 pack and above include 1 outdoor mount. The app is pretty awesome and Netgear has really been listening to its users via the forum for feedback and changes. They've recently integrated IFTTT into their software, which is great for adding customization to its functionality. For example, I have a recipe activated where ""If motion is triggered, then turn on Philips Hue light"" for added security. Can't say enough good things about this. I wish the cost of entry was a little lower (and the accessories more affordable), but I'm happy with what it has to offer.",Great little device that does it all

It can handle up to 15 from what I've read and I fully intend on getting a few extra to cover some remaining blind spots. It comes with free, 7-day recording cloud storage for up to 6 cameras, which I thought was pretty sweet. The system is awesome and very responsive. Motion and audio triggers are outstanding, hardly ever missing a beat. The two way audio and live view work very well, even when I'm on my cell data. The system itself is incredibly easy to set up. I have a 2000 sq/ft two-story home and the hub is placed on one corner of the home where our Wi-Fi router sits. The two don't interfere with each other, and the cameras on the opposite end of the house still have full signal strength.

I can now see what is going on from the comfort of my desktop or my phone.  It was very easy to set up and love that it has night vision, two way sound, decent picture quality and batteries that can be recharged after a few months of use.  Suggestions for improvement include the design of the website.  It feels a bit clunky navigating through the menus.  For the camera it would be nice if the delay would be reduced or eliminated.  Right now it takes at least 8 seconds to view a live picture.  One can also box in a specific area that you want the camera to capture.  It would be nice if you could draw free hand the area you need captured instead of adjusting the size of a rectangular box.  Regarding the magnetic mount that comes with the camera.  It would be nice if the buyer had an option at time of purchase which mount to have.  The magnetic is fine for indoor use but outdoors exposes your camera to theft since it is not bolted down.  Because of this I had to go buy mounts that are more secure and screw into the back of the camera.  It's not perfect as someone can still unscrew it from the mount but better than the magnetic mount where someone could just swing at it with a baseball bat to knock it down.

My main & biggest issue is the sensor delay, it’s a good 5 secs before it starts recording which may not seem like much but, a lot of times, it catches the person late so you only get a glimpse when they’re walking towards the camera, or if walking fast, it catches them walking back so you only see the back of their heads.","Great quality & battery life, bad delay"

Weeks,"I bought the Arlo Pro system to expand my existing 2 site Arlo system during Black Friday, mostly because of the price. I thought the sound would be useful, but wasn't a big deal to me. Well, I'm already a little hooked on the audio capability, but the real surprise was the night vision! None of the reviews I read mentioned any difference in the night vision capabilities between Arlo and Arlo Pro, and in a small space, like a bedroom, it doesn't matter much. But when I put some cameras outside, oh my gosh! The Arlo Pro definitely has much better illuminators. I'm attaching a couple pix to demonstrate. In a dark setting you can see much farther with the Arlo Pro. I will not be buying any more base Arlo cameras now--at least if they will be used in large, dark spaces. I'll suck up the extra cost for anything going outside, for sure.",What a pleasant surprise!

Now the image quality is so poor you wouldn’t be able to identify anyone. Arlo did something with the firmware to compress the video file; I assume to save space on their cloud server and that made the system worthless.

The motion activated record lags a bit, and the base firmware is a little glitchy, but they still work okay. I've had a lot of trouble with the geofencing settings. Apparently, according to Arlo tech support, if a device you're setting up for geofencing has special characters in its name then it causes problems, but the software doesn't warn you of this when you add the device. What's worse is that a device can never be removed from your geofencing list, which means if you've added a device with special characters in its network name then you get rid of the device your geofencing won't work unless you reset the system to factory defaults.","A little glitchy, but usable"

Instructions were very easy to follow. The video is very good for 720P when using the best video configuration. Siren is pretty load - but could be a little louder in my opinion. Field of vision is very good. This makes it easy to place the camera. The microphone and speaker are adequate. I do not have any experience with other security solutions, but feel confident that this was the right unit for my objectives. Simply tell me when someone is in the house that should not be. Let me know if I left the garage door open by mistake. And give me good enough video in case I need it. Love the 7 day free cloud service. Also like the option to easily expand with additional cameras. Maybe the cost of each unit will become cheaper over time. Hope this was helpful to a few of you! Cheers!",Nice product!

We needed it for monitoring entry points around the building and works perfectly, even at night. The night vision will not work for monitoring an entire street, but I'm not sure many people realize that it uses a IR LEDs, which are just lights, to see in the dark. Pros: Perfect for enclosed spaces up to about 20ft at night. The option to plug in the Pro is a great upgrade from the HD version: Never need to replace batteries! If you need completely wireless, the battery is life is surprisingly good. I've had mine up for about 2 months and it's at 80%. It records about 20 min per day on average. (Though adults rage about their toys running out of batteries occurs fairly often in reviews... Electricity isn't free people.) Arlo gives you free server space for up to 5 cameras. Up to 7 days of recordings. Very nice! (Server space isn't free either!) You can bulk download your videos and store them if you want. Cons: Will not be able extremely far at night, so place it with that in mind (NOT on top of a 3 story building looking down, for example, you'll see nothing at night). The field of view on the Pro is narrower than on the HD (non mic-enable version).",Works great for our needs!

I'm also loving IFTTT integration, but would really love if Stringify were added as a partner for more advanced customization (e.g., ability to turn smart lights at certain hours if Arlo detects motion).

I was hoping to cover my whole back yard (which is pretty small) but all it covers is about 1/3 of it. Other than that it's awesome. So easy to move and reposition it in different locations. I plan on buying at least 3 or 4 more of these. I tried the Nest cam and this is way more  versatile.

While others have posted that tuning down sensitivity to motion, moving closer to the base station or improving a weak wifi signal might improve battery life, that has not been my experience. I purchased a 6 camera system with very random but on aggregate very disappointing results.  The battery in the camera farthest from the base and wifi actually lasts the longest of these 6.  I have to conclude after 3 months of use that you should only buy this system if you are ok with frequently recharging batteries.  In 3 months, I've had to recharge 3 times.

I didn't want the hassle of wiring but was concerned about battery life. So far, I'm very happy with battery life and expect it to need recharging as advertised. Battery life will depend on how you have it positioned and adjusted and it did take several tries to get both just right so we don't have too many false alarms. Discovered aiming the camera through the brightest part of the porch light is not a good idea for night vision as the glare from the light makes it difficult to see anything else. Repositioning the camera solved that problem. The app also has a good feature that allows you to increase or decrease the motion sensitivity. So, for example, we didn't want our lawn irrigation to set off the motion detector and run down the battery. This adjustment is a sliding scale in the app but it's not obvious which direction increases or decreases motion sensitivity so be prepared to experiment with it until you get it set to your specific needs.

The wireless-ness of them is fantastic, however the app leaves a little bit to be desired.  It runs very slowly on my HTC 10 (flagship phone from Mid last year) and sometimes takes a minute or two to get into the camera and see what is going on. I'd imagine by that point the outside camera will have been useless if someone is breaking in, I won't have been able to see it!  However I do have a second one inside which I can use and hopefully connect to quicker than the outdoor one. With that said, I like that it's rechargeable and basically all weather. So far it's captured a couple cars going down the alley so I've had to adjust the sensitivity, even though I'm on the 3rd floor and the camera is probably a good 50 feet above the ground, meaning that the '23 foot' rule that Netgear claims is wrong, it clearly detects motion much further away and slightly off to the side.  That's both good and bad.

After 6 months, I'm a bit disappointed with this product.  As someone who is fiercely loyal to Netgear products, I had high hopes.  This product has definite positives, including the fact that it's wireless, the video quality is good, it has 7 days of free cloud storage, and setup is extremely easy.  One major negative is the battery life.  I don't know if it's my unit or an accurate representation of the product, but I find myself having to charge the camera every 6-8 days.  I have made adjustments to lower video quality and sensitivity, but that made a negligible difference.  An additional negative is the ability for the unit to detect motion from the right side.  The camera can instantly detect motion from the left, but from the right, it takes at least a few seconds to detect motion, if it detects the motion at all.  My wife and I always approach our front door from the right side of the camera when entering, and it only detects us about half the time.  I think this is a major drawback considering I bought the camera to detect possible break-ins.  The videos attached show the delayed detection from the right.

After using it for awhile I purchased three more. They work in very dark places well (my crawl space to see rodent activity) plus in normal lighting. I receive alerts on my phone with activity which I can then access to see clips. These clips are stored for free for a week on the cloud, and I believe can be kept longer for a fee. Any clips you desire to keep can be downloaded. I also plugged a memory stick into the base unit to keep my own copies. I haven't tried viewing these yet. The cameras don't need to plugged in to work, and the batteries last for months. Mine was getting triggered many times a day and lasted three months before a recharge. They are supposed to be able to last 6-8 months between charges if they aren't in use a lot. The cameras can also be used to speak to someone when accessed remotely. They are weatherproof.

The volume is so soft that it is basically useless.  The microphone does work well, however.  Video quality is okay. I find that on a sunny day, the contrast between light and shadow is a little too harsh so you can't get clear view.  If you mount it high beyond someone's reach, you wouldn't be able to get a high quality shot of their face. Night vision camera is nifty, but if  there is a large white wall in the view, it will blow out contrast and essentially break night vision. Installation is easy because it is wireless.  You put a screw into the wall, mount the magnetic mount on the screw and the camera is attached to the magnetic mount.

It was so easy to install.  That really makes it worth it to me.  The way the app works is great too.  It is really easy to get into the app when you get a notification and watch the recorded clip.  I did have a problem about a day after I got the system installed where none of my camera would show that they were online but they would still record motion events and I could see the recorded clips but I could not see the live cameras.  I got a hold of the tech support on chat and they walked me through it but they had me uninstall my base station and cameras from my account and then add them back.  Which cause me to have to reset all my settings that I had spent lots of time figuring out.  I haven't had that problem again.  The picture is great for a fully wireless system.  Zoom gets grainy pretty fast, but it is digital zoom.  I've only had my system for a couple of weeks so I can't really say anything about the battery life other than I have mine set to record on the highest quality and for the whole event.  Most of my clips are 10 to 20 sec long.  I have the motion and audio settings set pretty sensitive so I don't miss anything.  My lowest battery is 90% and the highest is 95%. I also did not charge them before I put them up, so this is the charge from factory.  All in all I think they work as advertised.  Except... The lag on the cameras is pretty significant.  I do catch all of the motion or audio triggered events, but they may be half way across the lawn before the recording starts.  The front door camera so far has always started recording before someone steps on my porch and when I look at the recording you can see their face clearly.  But there is a cat that hangs around and walks in front of the porch a lot and it is usually almost out of the picture before the camera starts recording.  The main lag problem is the live videos.  The commercials show that you could talk to someone through the 2 way system on the camera, but in my experience, by the time you started trying to talk to them, they would be walking away already.  Plus the fact that you have to practically yell into your phone for them to be able to hear you.  I am happy with the cameras and do think they will work great for what I want them for, it's just the lag on the live streaming is several seconds behind.",Good but could be better

Nice to not have to pay extra for a monthly service. So far I have found the free option to be sufficient for my needs as far as the cloud plans go. Only downside is the camera will stop working in extremely cold weather, but that is something Netgear says upfront about the product. I wish there was a way to prevent this. So far the battery life has been great for me. I do wish it had come with more stickers for the doors so let people know we have cameras.",Great!

The Nest cam works great, but paying $10/month for each camera ended up being way too expensive.  I also had too much trouble with geofencing.  The camera would turn on and off when it felt like it.  Next I tried the Canary Flex and while it was plugged in, the camera functioned well.  I received motion alerts, but there was no customization.  All I could do was change how often I receive alerts and there was no IFTTT integration either.  The free recording was nice, but when you have multiple cameras, the record time drops.  Then I tried running the camera on battery only and it NEVER worked!  I was working in front of the Canary Flex for 3 minutes and I did not receive one motion alert.  I never setup any type of geofencing, so it should have picked up some motion.  I decided to give Arlo a go after reading about it on some tech sites and I could not be happier!  The camera's actually work!  I haven't plugged any of them in yet and I can't believe how well they function.  I have three cameras setup right now and they have worked flawlessly.  I'm selling all the other cameras and keeping the Arlo.  I have seen a few bugs in the Android app, but nothing that makes it hard to use.

There are several other wireless devices that transmit wireless; however, most still require a physical A/C connection nearby. The players in full wireless (record/transmit and power) is very limited. For me, the Arlo stood out because I could attach my own storage to the device where the others required a subscription to a cloud service to store data. (The Arlo also offers a cloud service, but it is not required). Even with the options I was looking for, I was still a little hesitant as the Arlo is at the top of the list is cost, but after running it for three weeks, I am pleased with the results thus far. The connection is stable with cameras being 50 to 110 feet from the base going through walls. The battery life indicator has hardly moved and I have an active house averaging around 40 to 60 clips per day on both cameras. The picture is very clear in both day and night settings.

First off, these cameras are non visible when the weather is foggy or during a winter storm. I thought that was normal until my friend showed me his Nest camera pictures under the same weather conditions. These are expensive cameras and I expect better. The picture quality didn't really bother me because no activity was happening. But what really bothers me is when there IS activity and I am not home, the camera always fails! It either doesn't let me log in, or kicks me off, and one time when I was talking through the camera speaker there was so much static neither one of us can hear each other!! I had no idea why that stranger came knocking on my door! Arlo was useless! The camera ALWAYS fails on me when I need it to work the most. Other than that I have no complaints when I don't need it, like a dummy camera its just a camera to look at. Sadly, I compare this to a dummy camera with the exception that it has live view.

I love the free Arlo app on the I-Phone and the cloud storage too! The cameras are installed at my cabin about 250 miles away and have performed well - even in bad weather. There are a couple things I wish were a bit better. While i am impressed with the night vision, the picture quality during the day could be sharper. I hope Netgear upgrades the cameras to 1080P with the next version. The two-way audio works very well but the speaker on the camera could be louder.  Also the settings for the video and audio controls could be a bit more customer friendly.

Super easy, intuitive setup that was ready to go within 15 minutes of opening the box. Great ability to create custom modes for monitoring so that you don't get alerts needlessly but can fully monitor when you want to. Ability to pan and zoom for the best view of whatever it is you want to see.  We are also using one as a baby monitor and it works great for that purpose. Easy to access live video any time from anywhere. The video and sound quality are excellent. It's also a sleek system that looks great and unobtrusive in the house and I love that it's completely wireless. The battery life seems pretty good as well. The app interface on the iPhone is also excellent and easy to use. We aren't using any outdoors so I can't comment on that but I am a huge fan of this camera system.

You can fine tune the alert settings to only notify you of activity at certain cameras or time of day.

I suppose a higher quality image requires more battery/WIFI usage. However, all of the features of this system more than make up for this. Night time viewing is very good. The motion sensing is adjustable and doesn't trigger with every leaf blowing past the camera. The remote viewing works flawlessly. The app works well on my smart phone and PC.

Set up was a piece of cake.  This is my second Arlo Pro purchase with my first being the Arlo Pro single camera.  One for the office and two cameras for home so I'm running on two base stations.  They can be fully customized and tailored for your needs.  See the Arlo forums for great advise and troubleshooting.  The scheduling and mode configurations can be a bit confusing but once you get it (see the Arlo forums)  you will see how customized each camera can become when programming the modes and schedules.  For example for a certain time frame you can have the cameras set to not record.  Then next hour have one camera record motion for 30 seconds while the other is standing by.  The next hour you can have all cameras recording motion for 2 minutes after motion while having one trigger the 100db alarm.  The possibilities of configuration are endless and is cool if you like modifying things precisely. Again the forums really helped when customizing complex schedules and modes. Note, when viewing ""live""  there is a few second delay.  You will notice this especially when using the microphone feature making it a bit of a nuisance to try and carry a back and forth conversation.  This will be expected on a wireless system. The lithium ion battery life is quite incredible.  You will see that, with normal usage ( I use it for security purposes so it's not triggered often, but I do use the ""live with microphone"" function daily) that battery should last a few months at least without the hour recharge.  Better than buying 4 cr123 batteries for each camera like the previous Arlo cameras! I did have a hardware issue on one of the cameras.  I opened up a service ticket online.  Email responses were usually after two days and were quite detailed.  After a few back and forth conversations, I was given an RMA# and detailed instructions for return.  I received a new camera free of bugs only three days after I mailed the defective one out.  So customer service was quite responsive and flawless in my opinion I'd also recommend purchasing a UPS battery backup, so if anyone or anything cuts your power, your modem and base station stay on recording away!

We have some problems with the contractor next to us working on a house. So we bought additional cameras to put outside to keep it an eye on his workers. They hooked up to our system already installed very easily. We tried others Systems before. Arlo cameras are so easy to work with, to see what’s going on on your cell phone, to get Alerts if somethings going on and to keep certain dates on file as long as you want. It’s perfect.",Added additional cameras

I affixed the single camera outside of the front door of my patio. Since the exterior of my home is concrete stucco and I didn't want to bother hammer drilling into it, I ended up buying the outdoor mount and mounting it on the ceiling of my breezeway. The setup process was simple and intuitive, the video and sound quality is very good, and the android app is easy to use. The battery life has been great so far as well. Even with the brutal, desert heat my battery is still going strong at 100%! My only complaint about the experience so far is that when the android app sends a push notification for motion/sound and I click through to the app directly from the notification, it hangs the Arlo app process and I have to quit the app and re-open it manually. I've started to dismiss the notifications and open the app manually after acknowledging the alert. Hopefully this will get fixed in a software update. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the system overall! I want to buy an additional camera to mount in my main living space for an additional layer of security. Also, I love that the camera and every individual accessory comes with a window sticker! I have them stuck all over now!","Simple setup, easy to use. HIGHLY Recommend"

It helped with some legal matters in previous years and this time I bought the pro and honestly it's pure genius. All the issues I might have had before in the original were fixed. The base station gives encryption keys to each device and pairs it to avoid hackers or other agencies from peeking and the 128gb flush micro USB in the read of the base station (not uncluded) allows the cameras to continue recording even when the internet goes out in your area straight to the USB drive (only can be viewed once detached from base station and attached to PC) when set to Armed (Cameras record when motion is detected). The fact that they added a mic to talk through the camera and night visions and even options to control the brightness of the camera just make it that much cooler and more useful. Pics can be taken or a video of a live stream as well. Everything this camera has is incredibly useful and user friendly. I really do recommend the Arlo if you want a easy secure one stop shop.Thanks,Trey S.",Really Neat System

I did not; in fact, I had to hire someone to install the software and cameras.  It is not intuitive.  The cameras work, but they are EXTREMELY sensitive to wind or any type of movement.  Consequently, I constantly receive e-mails stating that ""Arlo has detected motion"" in one of the five surveillance areas.  Within the first 24 hours, I received over 2,000 e-mails!  So I set the sensitivity to 10% (factory default is 80%) and I now receive about 200 e-mails a day.  Still too much.  It is annoying and I tend not even to look at each one.  This concerns me because there could be an outside intruder, but I do not have time to examine each video for its content. On a positive note, the cameras do work and they do their job.  I just wish they were not so sensitive. I am still not sure if I would recommend the system.

Goodhue,"We received our first Arlo Pro camera in December as a gift.  We have been using it to monitor our driveway as we have no line of site to the street from inside the house.  The battery has only required charging once since we set it up and the wifi signal is strong, even though the base is distant from the camera.  When adding the second camera we had some difficulty syncing.  One member of the family has the administrator rights and shared the camera with other family members.  The new camera would not show up on the shared links.  We resolved this by having all users sign into the administrator account.  Once set up, the second camera is working as well as the first.  We had to be careful to position the backyard camera so as not to have every bunny running across the lawn trigger it.  Monitoring the cameras is easy from the phone app and provided peace of mind while we were out of town.",Monitoring the cameras is easy from the phone app and provided peace of mind ...

One camera is an ArloQ the others Arlo Pro. One is outside running on battery.  The ArloQ is powered via the wall adapter. One Arlo Pro is also powered by the charger/wall adapter. So far the battery life is fine at 86% charge. The motion detection and alarming has worked fine. The mic and speaker work fair to poor. Seems to be a bit of delay in getting those to work. The included magnetic mounts are junk especially for outdoors. They hang on a single nail or screw head and are not very secure. The siren works fine and is super loud. The outdoor camera is in a coastal environment and not showing any issues from the elements. The night vision is good. So far so good and I would purchase again. 04/01/2017 Update - Still working well. The outdoor Arlo Pro has not been recharged and the battery level is 62%. 09/06/2018 Update - Wow how things have changed. I added an ArloQ Spring of 2017 and moved the other Arlo Pro outside, on battery. Worked great for a year. Now as of 7/2018 the battery powered cameras will last less than a month. Nothing has changed about the camera placement or configuration. Still the same basic motion detection.

The video quality is good enough to recognize faces at 10-15 feet. However, of the 5 cameras I've purchased, 1 was defective and refused to update firmware. So whenever I would look at the app, I get a big ""please update firmware"" text, and I would not be able to look at live feed of that defective camera or use any other of its functions. Netgear support has been a big headache. I went through the support forum and followed instructions on troubleshooting recommended by other users. Without luck, I contacted Netgear support and they asked me to run through the same exact steps even though I've informed them I already did them. After a few weeks of back and forth email, they finally emailed me saying ""they deemed my product as defective, so would exchange the unit.""

Con's: 1)Night vision is not bad, but if your sight line is along a wall / window / siding,  you experience the IR back splash which takes away from open darkness areas. 2) Motion alarm needs work.  The delay in recording from the time the camera trips till it records is WAY too long.  Every other camera system out there can do it,  get on the ball Arlo. 3) Mag mounts are great,  but mounts need to be flush straight on to the area you want to cover.  You can'tmount to a wall / siding, and then have it angled at a door.  Will have to order the other mounts. 4) Recording can be glitchy at times.

The cost was a bit high compared to other similar cameras, but I trust net gear as a brand over the knock offs. One note for people unfamiliar with infrared for night vision, this feature will not capture video through glass because the infrared light will reflect on the video recording. So if you want an outside view, for example, the camera must be physically outside and not inside pointed out the window.

Since the camera is triggered to record by motion (or sound)  the ""security"" is only as good as the motion detection. With an approximate 20-22 foot range (across field of view better than head on) this should be fine for almost any indoor application unless you live in a mansion. For outdoors the range may be a factor you need to consider as far as triggering to record. As far as a live view you can clearly see multiple times that range (minimum 60+ feet).

Cons: video and audio are definitely delayed - does not start the moment it senses movement but several seconds later. When playing back video, the audio also does not begin until several seconds into the recording. Wish there was a way to customize the length of the recordings (default is 10 second clips).

In fact, now we are thinking of buying 1-2 extra camera. The camera and it's nice App on mobile are really one of the best assistance either when you are at home or away. The controls and features on mobile App is impressive. As of now we have no negative comments about it other than the fact that there is a delay of couple of seconds when it detects motion activity on App and notifies via email.",I was recommended by one of my friend

Most systems required sensors on each entry point, or cameras that needed to be plugged into an outlet. To get the most out of these systems, a monthly fee was needed.  I was happy to find Arlo, which has a base station, wireless cameras, recharchable camera batteries, motion detection notices sent to my phone, two way microphones, the coverage I needed without a fee, AND, was so simple to set up!  It has worked flawlessly so far...I highly recommend Arlo.",Just what I was looking fir!

But, if you are looking for a camera with resolution sufficient to identify an intruder this unit does not cut indoors under normal light.  Outside in bright sunshine you may actually get an image sharp enough for identification.  The saved video is only 448 x 240.  It looks fine on your phone but try blowing it up for any details like a face and forget it. As you can see from the two images(amazon review does not support mp4 videos) the color one is useless unless the perp were to walk right up and look straight in the camera.  The night vision black and white is sharper but there is no way to force the camera to stay in that mode.  The User Manual on page 40 says that you can set the camera to take snapshots which might give you the true HD this camera promises.  I could not find this setting and when I talked to tech support I was told that feature was never added.  In short, the manual is inaccurate on that point. What I am still looking for is a wireless security camera (they may simply not exist) that has resolution sufficient to identify an intruder with an image that will stand up in court.  Otherwise, cameras like these will let you know someone is or has been in your house or outside on your property but not whom.",Saved video not even close to HD

The cameras base station also have a really loud siren that can be enabled/disabled from the mobile app in which live streams from each camera can be watched as well. I'm guessing the cameras can be configured so the siren is triggered by the motion sensor as well but as I use other sensors it's nothing I've tried to do.

Battery life has been excellent although I notice the cameras with more detected incidents have slightly less battery remaining.  Not an issue since these are rechargeable. The range of motion and items these detect is incredible.  I had one camera in my garage that was detecting the security light that blinks inside my vehicle.

The Arlo pro worked with the old base station but some options are limited such as sounding an alarm this does not work as original base station has no alarm. Pros: Cost. at around $180 at time of this post it is $70 to $20 less then competitors like Nest($249) and Ring ($199.99). The arlo pro was easy to setup, can be used wired or Wire-free, has 130 degree field of view over the 110 field of view of original Arlo, weatherproof, HD quality (720p), has rechargeable battery, 2 way audio (built in mic and speaker), better motion detection then original Arlo, night vision, 7 day FREE cloud storage. Cons: It would be nice to have 1080p HD quality but to save on battery life Netgear opted for 720p. No 5GHz option wireless is limited to the already crowded 2.4GHz band. The base station is required to setup and use Arlo. so this adds another piece of hardware to your modem/router/etc can take up space and power outlets. The rechargeable battery is not standard size battery. So while it is great not to need to buy batteries over and over or buy your own rechargeable batteries like with original Arlo. Since the battery is not standard you will have to take down camera once battery is low to recharge or have the option to spend $50 and get a second battery and $60 for the charging station adding $110 in additional cost. The mic on Arlo pro is amazing at catching the smallest sound detail but the speaker, if camera is setup outside, is next to impossible to hear. Overall:  Arlo pro is step up from Arlo and it does what it is designed to do which is mount the camera ( using wireless option) in many places you cannot get a wired camera and it provide clear HD quality videos and audio to monitor an area. If you do not mount in high traffic area battery should last about 6 months before charge is needed ( per Netgear) so if you can get past the inconvenience of having to take down camera to recharge battery or buy charge station/extra battery then the Arlo pro is a great option for you.  Having both Ring Doorbell and Ring Stickup can I can say Arlo Pro does give Ring competition as video does tend to be clearer on Arlo.",Netgear has nice HD securtity cam!

My street is a side street and isn't overly busy. I initially used the provided magnetic mounts but couldn't get the right positioning for the area I wanted to monitor. I then purchased additional mounts that have more range of motion (they also allow you to screw the camera down which is much more secure than the magnetic mount which anyone could just pull the camera off). The initial problem was that every car that drove down the block set off the motion sensor, after dialing down the sensitivity and positioning the camera's field of vision as tightly against the front of my house as I could I prevented cars from triggering the motion detector. However I still have people walk down the block, so I'll get 30-40 motion activations every day which runs the battery down pretty quickly and I'm looking at having to recharge the battery (which means unscrewing the camera from it's mount) every week or two. I'm going to end up plugging the camera into an outdoor power outlet so I don't have to worry about recharging the battery all the time and it will allow me to have a larger field of vision with what the camera monitors. If you set the video to record longer snippets (2 min is the max) it eats up the the battery super quick. The video quality is pretty good in terms of resolution but it frequently freezes on captured videos or has weird motion artifact. Watching the camera live either on a computer or a mobile device is possible but the signal frequently drops for a second or two (and I have a super good wifi connection). If the camera goes offline for some reason, you physically have to take the camera down and return it to the base to resync it. It seems like this camera is much better suited for an area where you expect to get zero motion activations and wanted to record/be notified every time it detects motion. I'm a little disappointed overall, but the wireless aspect was really enticing. I'd only recommend this for an area with very few times the camera will go off (either with motion or noise detection).",Not Great For City Life

A breeze to setup and configure. So far my only issue is the lag time on recording. Due to these cameras being wireless, they must be very efficient. This means the camera is not actually on all the time. It is powered on and records whenever the IR sensor detects movement. Due to this mechanism, there is a 2-3 second delay from when movement actually occurs and when the recording starts. The stopping of recording also seems arbitrary. Many clips are 10 seconds, but some go longer. Also, due to the IR movement detection, these cameras will not detect movement through glass.

I  was worried about two main things; first,  the lag between detecting motion and starting the recoding and second, the battery life. I don't have a comment on the battery life just yet, but the lag time seems minimal. Even though I purchased this to be an outdoor camera, I have had it inside to better test it before it goes outdoors. It detects motion when a person walks in front of it, but the cats do not trigger it which is excellent. I have bird feeders near my front door and I was afraid that birds flying back and forth would trigger it, but I don't think that should be a problem. I'm using it together with Samsung Smartthings and setting the connection up was quite easy.  It automatically arms when no one is home and disarms when people are. I can also use it to turn on lights when it detects motion. All in all,  I quite like this camera.","Works well, no complaints"

When it came to my home security there were a few key factors I was most interested in. I wanted a system that would allow remote access but with the IOT hacking concerns of today, the last thing I wanted was a zombie network appliance sitting in my home waiting for a DDOS attack to be launch using my own equipment. Netgear has been around a long time and I feel fairly confident they take security seriously and stay on top of new hacks with updates and security patches. This is something a lot of the fly by night cheap systems you can buy out there dont spend the time worrying about. Those companies are out to make a very low cost system and spending money on system security will often make their system cost more then their competitor. So you get what you pay for with those. A security system with little to no security. Seemed counter intuitive to me. The next thing the system had to have was alerts and playback. Since I don't have the time to sit around and watch my camera feed, an alert was pretty much a no brainer. I like Arlo for the fact that it gives you several options for alerts and also gives you a weeks worth of cloud based play backs with download capabilities with the cost of the camera. And for those who might be using this for a small business and cant afford a $50k system, you can subscribe for more storage. For me, and for most situations, you should he reviewing you alerts as soon as they occur in order to be proactive with calling your local Police with descriptions of what you see so a week of cloud storage is more than enough for me. One of the last things I needed in a system was simply ease of use and set up. I can say that this is probably the easiest system I have ever seen for both. I was up and running 10 minutes after getting the box open. The software is very intuitive and I have had zero issues. The camera being able to run multiple months with a single charge on a battery is also a highlight and makes for a very flexible deployment with the option to easily keep the bad guys guessing where the camera might be today since you can move it in a matter of minutes. As far as issues go... the only one has been thw two way speaker/microphone which is not the Arlo systems fault but rather my cell phone which has a noise canceling microphone on it which affects the volume and quality of my voice when speaking through it. As we all know, one size does not fit all. This system is probably the easiest and best quality system you can buy for the home for most applications. If you don't like the idea of your video on the cloud or if you are trying to cover a large area and signal strength for wireless is a concern then maybe you might have a little more searching to do but I can whole heartedly recommend this system.",The Best Option

Mobile application is very efficient to use and great for an added layer of security over common alarm services like Frontpoint.

I will get 6 extra recordings for no reason. It looks like this is a common issue. -Needed to resync when recordings would freeze after a few seconds.

Apparently I'm not the first to encounter this issue and I'm pretty sure it will be resolved after I spend a few hours with tech support resetting, updating, etc. But the second issue is more damning -- the video quality is lackluster. I'm guessing the video compression is the culprit. There seems to be little user control over how much compression is applied. Too bad.

It is everything, and more, that it claims to be.  I had some problems the first day with the cameras staying online and I think it is because I had them all sitting on the desk that i had the router and my laptop on while I was setting up the system.  But from day 2 on, the cameras have worked perfectly once I had them installed in the areas of the house and yard that I had decided upon.  The camera's clarify is perfect.  The motion detection works perfectly also.  My dad paid $9000 for a camera system for his storage units which he also has on his property.  He showed me the views from the cameras in both day and night vision and it is just poor quality.  The only thing that really works is the motion detection and the lights.  So when there is motion detected the lights at the units come on, but then the cameras are so dark it is impossible to detect what it is that is in motion.  He has had to replace the recorder box 3 times by the company and the cameras go out and frequently do not work.  Right now there are two cameras that are not working at this time.  Arlo states that their cameras will operate at a distance of up to 300 ft from the base system.  My dad's storage units are approx 360 feet from his house.  We took one of the cameras over to his storage units and the camera worked perfectly!  My dad had a lot of words to say about his existing system, of which I cannot mention, that he paid so much money for.  I think what I will do is purchase another system exclusively for his business since it states that each base will accommodate up to 5 cameras for free.  This way he does not need to spend any further money except for the initial purchase price.  The first night these cameras were in use, my dad's wife said the next morning that this was the first night's sleep that she slept peacefully knowing that she was safe and the cameras!!",Five Stars

I grew to like it after a couple of weeks. What I like about the Arlo: We have tried several other cheaper security cameras, they are a misery to set up. This is not easy but not horrible as most I have tried to install.  Instructions are mostly easy to understand and the app is user friendly. Like the ability to be able to view from different devices (But there is down side, see what I do not like below). Night vision is better than expected. Free secure cloud storage.  FYI folks, those cheap cameras from Aldi are easy to hack (Google ""Aldi reports security risks in IP cameras sold in its stores""). Has a microphone to pickup sound, I do not use this feature but could see where it could be handy. Have this unit outside with one of the silicone skins covering it.  There was no place handy to place it on the porch so we purchased a suction cup stick on shelf attached to a window, and Arlo sits on that shelf, seems to be working well. What I do not like about the Arlo: Orginally positioned this so movement was from the front, did not pick up any motion.  I watched one of the Youtube videos and it said, best picks up side-to-side motion. Moved it to where entering the house was now a side-to-side motion and yes, Arlo began to detect motion. May want to think about this before getting a unit. Logging on one device kicks out every other device. So if the husband and I are not together and we log on to view Arlo, who ever logs on second kicks out the first.  Most of the video are about 30 seconds long so has not been an issue. Not able to individually adjust the motion sensitivity for each camera. I called customer support they had me adjust motion sensitivity at the base station. I was little surprised by this but its not a deal breaker for me. Have just adjusted that certain times of day arlo is going to ding due to light hitting on passing cars. Its offline sometimes.  This is annoying.  However, we discovered although ""Live"" is not available, we can usually go to ""Library"" and view from there.  It was little distressing being on vacation, hearing Arlo ding that motion was detected and not being able to view it for 10 minutes. Was just headlights but if had been a burglar, probably too late to do anything proactive. Resetting the base, resync the camera requires you to be physically there.  Power went out, base went off while out of town, and no idea if we would be able to access.  We were able to access, but after getting home, realized the motion sensor was not working so had to bring it inside and resync.  About a 10 minute job, but still thought (hoped) would be able to do this online. More expensive than I wanted to spend, but folks, with security systems, you get what you pay for.",Grew to like it

I'm having to work to make this work.  I'm constantly having to change out batteries for freshly charged ones every couple of days.  So unless you disable just about every feature, you might not have the coverage you are expecting.  As far as charging.  First, there is a wait for Netgear to produce more ""proprietary"" versions of their charging station.  Which I've been waiting a couple of months to get ahold of one. In the meantime, I bought an ""extra"" $200 camera just to act as a charging station.  And because of the way they have it setup, its not a simple swap out.  First, you have to remove it from the base, then add a ""new"" one, and re-setup the configuration.  Assuming you stick to the base subscription, else you are paying an extra $120/year to have the privilege of 4 extra cameras. So the simple solution is to plug them into the outlet.  1. the cable is too short, 2. not enough chargers for every camera.  Starting with 2.  You have to have a charger capable of quick charge, i.e., 9v with at least 20 watts.  Which brings us to 1.  There are even fewer USB cables long enough where its not complaining its not charging.  So, you'll need to bring the extension cord to the camera.  And pay $50 for an extra battery with power cord and charger to cover each of the camera that didn't come with one.  And if you are planning on using this outside... Operationally, its another item on the chore list.  Or it becomes really super expensive just to eliminate the problems.

I plug them in all the time so no need to recharge the batteries.  2nd camera was faulty and would go offline after a few hours.  Reset battery and then it would last a few more hours until offline.  Exchanged for new camera right away.  Replacement camera is performing as expected.  One camera is outside and far from the base station - even farther than my wifi reaches.  No issues with it connecting to the base.  So far this is a great solution for quick easy cameras at home.,Great DYI camera system

The camera provides a nice, wide field of vision and the picture is good.  Would love to have HD quality as a choice.  I can move it anywhere because it is wireless, understanding that it must be in range of the router but that is easier than all the wiring and gives me lots of flexibility.  The lag in motion detection and beginning the recording is not a problem if I planned it properly.  I intend to purchase more cameras and do a complete system setup for all potential entrances into my home.  Great product, well thought out recording process with a choice of cloud or local storage.

What I am still disappointed even with this camera is the lag of when it detects motion. Even at 100% sensitivity facing the driveway 25’ away sometimes I will be lucky catching a car pull in. Other times a car can pull in and I will catch the last two seconds of someone walking past the camera to to door. I hope this improves with newer versions. 8/5/19 camera has lost 98% of its sound and the talk feature also does not work.,Ok camera for a wireless system/ needs improvement

Sleek design, clean white appearance, syncs brilliantly with my phone and streams on my phone while I’m at work.

I sent it back and ordered this system instead. I found the Arlo installation and setup process to be far easier than the Ring setup. I also found the phone app to be easier to use and more intuitive than the Ring app. The setup and installation were fast and easy. The camera battery arrived fully charged and linking the camera with the base station was easy. The siren on the base station is extremely loud. I like the options available on the app to turn on and off motion detection as well as the live view and other features as well. The audio works well but it seems to be only one way in that I can either hear audio from the camera or speak through the microphone but not both at the same time. I haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life but I believe where you mount it and the number of times it gets activated has a lot to do with how long the charge lasts. The app shows the remaining battery which is a nice feature. Add on cameras are less expensive than the Ring cameras and you don't have to pay for cloud storage like you do with the Ring cameras. The cameras work well at night as well and provide a clear view. I would definitely recommend this camera system.,Arlo pro review

Lam,"Mixed review about the Arlo Pro so far.  I have 3 Arlo's and 1 Arlo Q working with this Arlo Pro and here are my pros and cons so far after 2 weeks with it. Pros - Video quality is slightly better than the regular Arlos.  Not night and day difference but the improvement is there Pros - Rechargeable batteries will save me money in the long run Pros - Slightly wider angle view Pros - Motion detection seems to be better than the standard Arlo cam. Cons - Battery life does not live up to my expectations.  Set on best quality recording about 2-6 40second videos per day it only lasted about 2 weeks.  It does charge quickly.  Took about 1 hour to go from empty to full. Cons - Using the alro app this camera always gives me an error when trying to see the live view.  Granted this is the furthest camera from the base station but it seems more problematic than the old arlo camera i had in the same position.  Hopefully a firmware will make it more reliable. Update - after charging the battery to full, camera set to medium quality doing about 5 40second clips per day the battery is already at 48% after 4 days.  I seriously hope there will be stronger 3rd party batteries offered for this because removing the camera every week to charge it is a pain",Better than the original but needs improvements

Arlo Pro meets and exceeds those needs out of the box.  Within less than 30 minutes per-location I was able to put in full monitoring and delegate access.... literally within minutes of having to depart for a flight.  System worked flawlessly and if needed I could have tuned it remotely....it has not been necessary.  I have already shown and recommended it to family and peers!",Arlo Pro Sees it All!

The online app is highly functional. The problem is you can't extend the range of the base unit or the cameras. While they say it reaches 'up to 300 feet'...it's more like 40' in a typical house. As a networking company, you would think that Netgear could figure out an extender system that could broaden the reach of the unit beyond the bare minimum.

First off, no need for any wires and no monthly fees. Which is the reason that makes Arlo very interesting. However being completely wireless is also the cause for all of its short comings. - First thing you should know, I didn't realize until after buying and trying it. The individual cameras are not connecting to your wi-fi, they are connecting to their own base station. That means if you are trying to cover a large property you might have to buy multiple base stations. This limited where I could place the cameras - Unlike most of the, always on, competitors Arlo only comes on and starts recording after it detects motion with the IR sensor. In my use case that meant the camera taking too long to turn on and actually missing the cause of the motion. Example for this is if I walked ( not run just walk) towards the camera and past it from 30ft away it would only catch the last split second of me passing by it, which wasn't enough to see my face (camera mounted 8-10ft high) - The IR lights does not seem to be strong enough for my use case. I am trying to monitor a large area ( I will include the pictures below) that meant missing motion at night. This can be solved by adding IR light sources that turns on at night but I didn't find the cameras own IR lights enough. I am guessing this is again a result of having to survive on a battery. But I have been using competitors plug-in cameras that are able to cover the area I am looking to cover with its built in IR LEDs - Video  : 720p and manual exposure adjustment.  720p decision is probably due to battery life concerns. The video from the camera was not clear enough for me especially when trying to cover a large area. The manual exposure setting was annoying as well since during the day as the sun changes location, I found out I had to constantly fiddle with the exposure setting. At peak sun hours part of the image would be washed out or the shadows would be too dark to see anything. - No zones of interest selection to reduce false alarms. - I moved the cameras couple of times to see if I can get a better location that would cover the areas I am looking to cover but I wasn’t able to. One location would trigger way too many false alarms ( even though I reduce the motion detection sensitivity), one location wouldn’t capture me,  directly walking in front of the camera from 20 ft away. So as I sit in front of my computer with my iPhone getting way too many notifications, I have decided to return the Arlo. I think the direction Arlo has taken is the right direction but for my case it didn’t really work. - Oh and one more thing. The web interface for Arlo from a PC requires Flash!!! I thought the industry, including Adobe themselves are moving away from flash. Why require that? Please note that the images I uploaded are from a screen capture from the Arlo app on my iPhone 7S so the quality might differ from what you will see.",Great camera because of the wire free design but this is also the cause of all the short comings...

My family and I are very impressed with the product overall, which is getting a lot of use in our household.  There are a few items that I feel are gaps in the product (e.g. wifi range extension for a larger home, perhaps the ability to piggy back on existing wifi infrastructure so as not to overlap RF signals, time stamps on video/pics, etc...).  Perhaps these are gaps that Netgear can explore with future enhancements and updates.  Ov​erall, I'm satisfied with the product, and I'm looking to expand beyond my initial proof of concept by adding additional cameras.",Easy Installation and Setup

Very impress with this product. One of my worries prior to purchase was experiencing the alert and recording delay and mobile app issues that purchasers of similar products complained about. In regards to these 2 areas which were my concern the system performed great. I tried the 2 way audio both from home and away from home and the feature performed very well. As per my lady audio quality was very good. The system appears to have some very good microphones and speakers. To be frank everything just worked. The only pause moment i had was during the firmware update process which appeared to take awhile but was actually successful. The system did not provide any notification that the firmware update was completed. I actually waited more than 20 minutes before getting enough courage to interrupt the update process only to find that the update was already completed. The ""firmware updating"" status message was still present prior to checking to see if it wad completed. The successful update was confirmed by the newly assigned.  Firmware versions to the base and the camera.

First its compact size and lightweight is a plus for the easiest mounting I have ever seen.  A four year old could mount them it's so simple and durable.  Too, the batteries coming fully charged amazed me as into three weeks they still have over 50 percent charged power.  The sensors picking up both sound and movement are very impressive catching the movements or sound and recording it on the easy to view and access website....great is an understatement!  Amazing clarity, color, field of view and distance for the tiny camera is remarkable.  I also love how the camera switches from incredible color to sharp infrared black and white at night and unlike some Infrared cameras at other companies having strong blacks and whites the arlo system looks like normal black and white with all tones in between with grey contrasts so you can easily see people, animals and automobiles....the detail is amazing.  Truly the camera's technology is the best I've seen.  The audio is also equally impressive as you can hear detail and clear sounds from people speaking much further than your human ear could pick up.  Too I love how you can speak back and forth with each camera.  Last I'd like to touch on the durability as it is made to last.  From the easy to use mounting system, literally any age person can install and the cameras tough exterior and optical system stands up to rain, wind and dust.  The picture is the proof!  Finally, the way the system notifies you and keeps a complete history of your videos that automatically store and is so easy to see and view and playback.  It is not only great for security but also informative to see how many people come by your home you never knew did from solicitors, neighbors, delivery personnel, family, etc., who never leave a note but you can see it recorded and they have no idea.  With children coming and going the added security can't be overstated.  Thank you arlo, I can easily pass along my highest recommendation to anyone of any age as the whole operating system is easy to use, amazing technology and a superior product through and through!",I'm very happy to talk about the small yet amazing arlo camera ...

Right out of the box, one of the cameras had such low volume out of its speaker, it couldn't be heard more than 2 feet away - at maximum volume. I contacted Arlo customer service and with very little hassle, obtained an RMA and returned it for repair. A few days later, I received the repaired camera back in good working order. About a month ago, the other camera stopped sensing motion. I got out my ladder and removed the camera from its mount. I tried several remedies but the only thing that worked was removing the battery from the camera and then reinserting it. The camera then started sensing motion again. I got out my ladder again and remounted the camera. A couple of weeks later it stopped sensing motion again. Instead of continuing to go through this cycle over and over, I decided to contact Arlo support again. This time the agent wanted me to perform all kinds of useless, non-related tests on the camera. When I told them this camera's problem was intermittent and these tests probably wouldn't reveal any pertinent information, they insisted I spend my time to perform them anyway. I finally got fed up and told them I just wanted an RMA so I could send the camera back for repair. However they refused to do so. Arlo evidently hires morons to handle their online customer service, since they are incapable of diagnosing a problem without wasting hours of the customer's time. I realize some customers are technically challenged but it isn't fair for Arlo to automatically throw all customers into that category and assume we are all idiots. (I was an electronic and software engineer for 30 years.) Long story short, do not buy the Arlo Pro products. They are full of defects and their customer service is horrible!",Full of Defects & Horrible Customer Service

I wanted to mount these on the second story where they could not be easily reached. That is impossible. They won't register anything at all. I moved them over the tops of the doors. They do not register any motion until someone is within about two feet of the door, even at maximum sensitivity -- and even then they are inconsistent. You can increase the range to about five feet if you lower the units to about six feet high -- but that is impractical. Before we got these, we had an old wired system, but I thought these would be more versatile. Huge mistake. On the occasions that they do detect motion, there is a several-second delay between the time motion is sensed and the time recording begins to conserve battery life. Someone could grab the camera, which must be mounted rather low, and smash it before the camera kicked in. Even if you just wanted to use them to keep an eye on your kids, there is a several-second delay between what is happening and when it displays on the screen.

I had an indoor Panasonic camera, that was plugged into the wall, and could just record to either the cloud or the micro sd from there (no base station, and it was only $64).  Unfortunately it was stolen, and I had in set up to record to the microSD and not the cloud (yup, I'm an idiot).  So I bought this Arlo system, with the plan to try it out and possibly expand it to more cameras.  Well, after about two or three days after the relatively easy set up, camera 1 goes down, cannot connect to the base station.  After some back and forth I am waiting on a replacement battery, again, this system has not been used for more then a few days. As far as the system goes, other reviews are correct, their is a huge delay between when motion is detected and recording starts (my cheapo Panasonic camera was far quicker to record).  Nightvision is good (when it worked), and overall clarity is good.  App is decent, far from excellent, far from horrible. Getting ahold of someone at Netgear was a bit of a challenge, but after contacting them, the customer support guy was fairly helpful troubleshooting.  He believes it is the battery and not the camera (I'll update this when I am back up and running), I think it is the camera.  One thing that really p'd me off though, is after spending the amount of money I spent on this system, the small print on the RMA says I am responsible for shipping costs...come on!  I feel like this is something that should be handled by the company, small detail, but it really is a nickel and dime approach to squeezing their customers. We'll see how this pans out, as I am expecting the new battery any day now.",Netgear needs to improve it sproducts that cost this much.

While we were generally happy with the Dropcam its image quality was severely impacted by the window screen.  Removing the screen was not an option since we frequently open the window for ventilation and want to keep flying bugs out,  We considered the outdoor Nest camera when it came out but getting power outdoors was not practical for us. The Arlo Pro has excellent versatility in mounting options since it is completely wire free.  Constant recording would be nice but to improve battery life Arlo Pro is limited to recording clips when motion is detected or there is other trigger activity as defined by the user.  There are several options for clip length. If you're considering this product then spend some time reading up on Netgear's community site as well.",Definitely do your research

I thought about Nest but the cost of the membership turned me off, other cameras have free apps but sketchy companies who manage them then.... tada! Arlo Pro came into my awareness and the vast amount of features won me over. 1. We love that it is moveable. We use this camera to watch our dogs when we are gone and we put them in different areas of the house so this allows us to be flexible. 2. We love the magnetic mount. It allows the mount to be more discreet than having a big stick. 3. We love the wireless component it makes 1&2 possible. 4. The battery is rockstar, after a week our battery is still in the 90% range. 5. We never have connection issues with the app. 6. The video is super clear even when not at full capacity for battery saving. The angle is wide enough that I can see the whole room. 7. I love the two way audio although my dogs have no idea what is going on. 8. At night we set the motion detection on and it records clips for you. Or you can set up alerts so for instance if you are at work and there is motion in your house you can see what is happening. 9. It has night vision! 10. There is a siren in the app so if #8 happens you can scare the robber while you call 911. 11. The app is free and enough recording to meet my needs is free. You can also access it through your computer. 12. You can take pictures or recordings when you are not there. So for me, if me dogs are doing something cute or naughty I can take a snap or video, it then is in our library for my husband to go see, or I can download and share with anyone. 12a. When I mean my husband can go see, I am referring to how you can have multiple accounts on the Arlo app for your device. 13. You can also buy an Arlo monitor if you don't want to use a computer or phone. This might be particularly nice for parents who want to use the Arlo for baby and security. The price is a little more than some of the cameras you can get on Amazon but #yougetwhatyoupayfor.",We love that it is moveable

The main visible difference between them is that one comes with four batteries and the second one comes with the little square box as a battery. The one with the little square box I believe they designate as the Pro version. So let’s talk about the Pro version 1st it has great resolution great response you can trigger it both with movement and with sound I love the ability to do both of these. The revolution on this camera is also very good. The downside to this one is that you need a special charger and a very expensive 50+ dollar backup battery or you have to take the camera down and plug it in every time it runs out of charge. And to add insult to injury the special charger is 2 to 3 months backordered. The non-Pro version its resolution is okay but compared to the Pro version it’s probably half as good in both distance and resolution. The batteries are easily replaceable charger for these batteries is fairly reasonable although if you have more than one or two of these cameras you will probably need to add some more outlet sockets to your house so that you can charge the replacement batteries for your cameras. One of the other things about the non-Pro version is that it only has a motion activation mode it cannot be activated by voice. As a plus and does seem to last longer than the Pro version on a single charge.,Good system easy to install.

Comparing it to a 1080p or 4k wired camera system isn't fair... if you want that sort of quality and response from your security cameras you're going to have to run wires. But, for an affordable, feature-rich, easy to setup system this is as good as any I've tried. Given that the cameras are battery powered AND wireless there are some sacrifices that need to be made so yes, the video quality isn't stellar when on a setting that conserves power and logging in with the app can sometimes take up to 20 seconds to get a live feed. But I've found that the motion detect works very well and events are captured in the library as they happened. The scheduling feature to automatically arm it at night is nice and overall the app works very well. I had two NEST dropcams that I'd used to supplement the house's security system when we were away and while the picture quality was nicer, having to plug it in limited where I could put them and the app was buggy and never worked properly. I also like how the Arlo cameras communicate to a base station that's wired into the router instead of all the cams running over the hosue WiFi. Couple that with the free cloud subscription (something else it does better than dropcam) and it's a no-brainer if you want a few cameras and don't want to cut up your walls.",Easy system that has a lot of features for the price.

WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY! I've doing lots of research and YouTubing. I was looking for a security camera that is wireless and wire free, Arlo Pro Security Camera by NETGEAR was a perfect fit. Now, I was very close on purchasing Blink but it didn't have the features that I was looking for such as zoom, solar panel, photo/video storage and siren. Arlo Pro was an easy setup. Zooming, Blink doesn't have zooming capability but then it also depends on where you set your Arlo Pro Camera. For example, if your trying to zoom in the Arlo Pro Camera from far away, you will not have a clear picture which is a downside. Solar panel, I purchase this camera before the solar panel first came out and not knowing if it's worth on buying or not but I took the risk because I need a good working camera. I charged the camera to 100% before installing and set it up to the best setting I can where it won't eat up the battery. When the solar panel was FINALLY for sale, I purchased 2 without not knowing it will work but my Arlo Pro battery was getting towards to it needs to be recharged. Photo/video storage, Blink only offers monthly paid cloud storage where Arlo Pro offers EXTERNAL storage. Arlo Pro Base Station offers a built in USB where you an plus in like a USB/thumb drive or external hard drive to store the videos or pictures. Siren, while doing some YouTubing, it has a loud siren. The siren will sound when you set the camera onto ""ARMED"". When I tested out the siren for the first time, the siren was so loud!! I even tested the siren to see how loud it is when the front door is open and close. LOVE IT!!! Arlo Pro is undetectable! I ask a couple of friends and family members if they can see the camera anywhere and they said no which it's a plus. Now with all that being said, would I recommend this? Definitely a YES! I am planning on purchasing a couple more both the camera and the solar panel. NOTE: If your a Mac user, Safari browser will not allow you to do a two-way talking which I don't know why so you will need to install Google Chrome. Night vision, it's not that great but still decent (you gonna have to use some lights). If your a type of person who does not want to drill holes through walls, do the wiring and get a monitor then this is the best option for you.",Worth the purchase.

Graham,"The reality is that most of these current gen security/wifi/webcam systems are not really up to people's expectations. You can compare them back and forth all day and you will still be missing things you expect with every system available. I would say the two major positives going for Arlo is the built in siren and flexible camera install. In just about every other area I am dissapointed. Video quality is not good, performance is sluggish, I can't adjust how long I want to capture on motion, setup is a tad confusing, a second battery is not included, price is too high, sharing with family required too many steps on their part, ETC. I wonder if Blink just might be the better option due to it's much more competitive pricing and similar features. I think each of these systems should include free 7 days off on going cloud storage at full HD. I think you should be able to live stream fairly quickly. I think connecting to the camera should not stop a live recording. I think at this price you should get a dedicated charger and an extra battery. The bottom line is features that cost extra money when they should be included significantly diminsh the value of this product. I have used the YI camera prior to this and in some ways it is a superior product as it does not require a hub, has better image quality, lower price and never misses motion. UPDATE - I have been trying to use the GEOFENCING feature for days and the only thing it has accomplished is arming and disarming the system constantly when I am not home. Then when I get home and I have been on WiFi for 2-3 minutes the system does not know it and goes off when I walk in front of the camera. Then the app does not load fast enough to turn it off. If I have to manually arm and disarm the system constantly it pretty much takes the SMART and PRO out of this system entirely. I will likely be packing this up, sending it back and getting a more traditional security system. UPDATE 2 - The video quality is totally unacceptable. Even on the highest quality setting at 4:30 in the afternoon with a decent amount of light I can't make out faces well enough to do anything with them. Sure I can tell when it is a family member, but if I had to turn these over to police to try and identify someone I think I would be laughed out of the building.",It's another disappointing system in a market of disappointing so called SMART products

The addition of the Pro series has fixed some of the issues that worried be and kept me from buying about 6 months ago. The cameras go in very simple and once you get an idea on where to place them, some trial and error should be expected, you are up and running.  The reason I didn’t give this a perfect rating was the interface leaves some to be desired.  Many of the competitors have the ability to fine tune the settings, something lacking here.  Rumor has it that they are working on an update that will bring them current with what others offer:  virtual boundary lines, more extensive customizations of alerts, ability to snooze alerts, pet detection, etc. All in all this is a great unit and you really do get what you pay for.

The flexibility of being able to put the camera just about anywhere without running wires is valuable.  And the magnetic semi-circular mount is very innovative; combined with the wide-angle lens the mount allows surprising flexibility when positioning the camera. But the drawbacks are too great for this to be a decent general purpose security camera. The battery life is really short unless you put somewhere there's rarely any motion.  I have one camera in front of my house, watching my front door.  The battery lasted a few weeks.  I changed it to 100% yesterday, and this morning, within 20 hours, it'd down to 96%. Recharging or replacing the battery is an enormous hassle.  To recharge the battery in my camera out front, I need to get the ladder, go retrieve the camera, put the ladder away (I don't want it stolen), recharge the camera a few hours, get the ladder back out, put the camera back up, muck about with repositioning it, etc.  That's a ton of work. Picture quality is really bad.  For instance, with a person 10' from the camera, I could recognize the person if I know them, but it's not enough to really identify someone (e.g. useless for police to try to catch someone).  I could mount the camera lower, so I don't need a ladder, but then someone could just walk up and take it. The motion detection isn't very good.  It detects trees moving but often won't detect a person walking by until they're halfway through the field of view. And it's expensive.  There are cheaper wired camera systems with better resolution. So with a bad picture and a battery you need to replace a lot, this is a very limited camera.  Get a wired high-resolution camera and you'll be far better off. There are some scenarios it might be a decent choice.  If you're a renter and can't install a wired system maybe this is the only choice.  Of if you plan to put it somewhere where there shouldn't be any motion (like in your house when you're gone, if you don't have pets) it's probably fine.  But as a general security camera it's not good. Also it's so over-packaged that it's tough to return it.",Too limited for general purpose security camera.  Maybe it's good for some narrow scenarios.

Bailey,I moved up to Arlo Pro and the quality and frame rate from the video cameras is more than adequate for viewing in a range of conditions.  This was not the case with the previous system we were using.  The rechargeable batter is great saving us not only the frequent and high cost of batteries and also the bother of having to go out and buy them and the bother to properly dispose of them.

As others have said, it was easy to setup and appears to be a well thought out system. A couple things I noticed, that some might be interested in knowing. 1. Buying the cameras separately ended up costing me less (want to say about $66) then getting a multi camera kit. Not only was it less, but it includes separate cables for each camera, which from my understanding, you only get one charger with the multi kits. I have no idea why they price it that way. I also like having individual boxes in case I need to send one back under warranty or return. 2. There is no way to apply separate ‘modes’ to each camera or group of cameras (at least from what I can tell). I want the ability to set my inside camera to not record/alert when I am home or between 5pm and 12am, but that is not possible unless I don’t mind ALL my cameras having that setting. It really is a misstep in my opinion, all the cameras should be able to have their own settings and schedule. In addition, it would be amazing to have the ability to set rules so that if one camera is tripped, more than one camera can be engaged to record. For example, if someone steals a parcel from your doorstep, it would be nice if it could have a camera that might see them as they walk away or get in a vehicle. Unfortunately, they crippled the software to make it more user friendly leaving out customers who want a more sophisticated configuration. 3. Instead of buying an extra battery and the accompanied charger, just buy another camera. Yes, it costs more money but it ends up being a handy way to swap out batteries during recharging along with having an extra camera. I am using mine as a inside camera that I only turn on when I am out of town (because you know, only one mode is possible). 4. The speed of loading a live camera is a bit lacking. It usually takes 10-20 seconds, sometimes it will even time out. There is also occasional delays on the feed, some as long as minutes. 5. The intercom function is neat, but they went cheap on the speaker. No one is going to be able to hear you. Why did they even bother? 6. The siren is also useless unless you happen to catch the perps in the act and manually engage it. Not to beat a dead horse, but having additional active modes would prevent this. Despite the issues, I am actually pretty happy with it and would buy again. However, I am hoping Netgear eventually upgrades it’s software to make more configurations possible. Update - 03/05/2017 Well I feel like an idiot. Yes, you can choose individual modes that are specific to each camera. What threw me off is that when selecting the active mode, you are only allowed to select one at a time. However, under the schedule, you are able to select multiple custom modes for each schedule made (doh!). For example, I made two custom modes, one for during the day and one for at night. They are almost identical except I am going set the siren for both my front door and backyard during sleeping hours (no one should be there during those times). No sirens during the day.  I am going to leave my review unedited as punishment for not doing more research beforehand. Update - 04/04/2017 Battery life on my two most active cameras is about 50% after one month of use. I noticed the motion sensitivity doesn't work as well as I was hoping. Unlike my security system, you can't really adjust the motion for the size of object (like for a dog or cat). One thing that would REALLY help is if you could set motion boundaries. This would especially help with cameras that oversee a busy street, as you could disable motion on that part of the frame. As of now, I have completely disabled all the alerts (set them to email) as I get WAY too many false positives. I also disabled the alarm at night because it went off when a moth flew by the camera haha. That was an interesting way to wake up at 3am. I noticed that on rare occasions, the cameras won't record a motion event, which is concerning.",Good so far!

In particular, it seems deliberately crippled in ways which to force users to pay Netgear for its arbitrarily limited, overpriced cloud storage. The controller supports external USB storage, but requires the antiquated FAT32 format and supports a maximum partition size of only 1.6 tb., with no support for multiple partitions.  (1.6 tb.  For archival video files.  From up to 15 cameras per controller.  It's hard not to be sarcastic.)  The drive must be physically detached from the controller and plugged into a computer to access it.  The controller isn't capable of connecting to a network share, rendering any existing server infrastructure you might have useless. The controller can be accessed only through Netgear's Arlo servers, meaning the entire system becomes inaccessible if its internet connection is interrupted.  (That's right - you can't connect to the system through your local network, only through the internet via Netgear's servers, rendering the whole thing grossly inappropriate for privacy-critical applications.) You're forced to use the Arlo site for everything, yet the site itself is nothing write home about.  It offers no provision whatsoever for automating file management.  Downloaded video files (typically one clip per camera per movement - _thousands_ of files) are named in Unix Epoch date format rather than human readable.  The filenames contain no reference to which camera recorded them.  The site's filtering options are limited.  The site does support IFTTT, but its implementation is limited to the point of imbecility. The obvious thing any serious user would want - a library of easily accessed files organized by camera and date-time stamped, can be achieved only through laborious manual manipulation of the Arlo website.  Given that security systems typically run 24/7 indefinitely, this is simply unacceptable. Further weirdness…  Alerts are limited to motion and sound detection, which strikes me as downright bizarre.  How many users want to receive an email every time a camera sees something move or hears a sound?  Worse, it spews one alert per event, rather than aggregating the data in any useful way.  There's no provision for alerts in response to low battery, camera failure, or any other fault condition, meaning unreliability is essentially designed into the system. The wi-fi network created by the controller is utterly opaque and doesn't play well (i.e., at all) with others.  There's no provision for integrating Arlo into an existing wi-fi network, so any substantial installation ends up duplicating equipment, wasting money, and needlessly increasing radio interference. The few things Arlo does it does fairly well, but it's limited in ways that make it a very cool toy rather than a serious security tool.  If you want something beyond watching what your dog gets up to while you're at work, you'll want to look elsewhere.",Very Disappointing

Biggest drawback for me is that there is a lag between it detecting motion and the camera capturing.,Works well but just short of what I needed

"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Mar 2017,Andy F,"This is a good camera that has solid functionality and is VERY easy to setup and use.  It is completely wireless, no power cord, no video cable, nothing.  That makes it very easy to install and get running... however, there are a few down sides. 1) Battery Life: They say it will last about 3-4 weeks, my first one went dead after a week. 2) Battery powered means you have to physically access it regularly.  Since you have to take the camera down and either replace the battery with a charged one (or recharge the one in the camera ) you won't want to place this too far out of reach. 3) Security of the camera(s) - unless you get the security mount, the only way the camera is mounted is via a magnet.  If someone reaches up and grabs the camera, it just comes off in their hand.  I have not lost a camera yet but I am concerned.  This combined with having to regularly access the camera means that you either risk it being stolen or you have to climb a ladder once a month. 4) You MUST have internet access to use the camera and video server.  Even with the mobile app you access the video via the internet.  Thus, the cameras are no good for security in a out of the way location (Think farm, vacation home, etc) that doesn't have internet access. 5) 4-6 second delay on ""Live"" video feed- If you watch the live feed, you are 4-6 seconds behind the real world.  Not a huge deal but if you are trying to talk to someone via the camera it causes a problem. 6) The camera appears to link to it's own video server wirelessly, not to your wifi network.  This limits the locations you can place cameras to within wireless range of your video server and you cannot use wifi extenders. That said, I really like the camera set and will continue to use it. Oh, and the Arlo website says that you can use it plugged into power as well as completely wireless.  That works well if you have a convenient power plug nearby.

Plesh,"I have the regular Arlo system and an Arlo Pro system installed at my house. Both systems are extremely easy to install and setup. You can have either of these systems up and running in under an hour which was perfect for me because I needed to have something installed before leaving my home before a night out. The Pro cameras have 2 way audio, rechargeable batteries, and both the base station and cameras have alarms. I bought the non-pro version first because that was all that was available at my local store, however after trying out the Pro version, I'd recommend them over the regular cameras. By the time you invest in rechargeable batteries and a charger you're almost spending as much as the Pro version anyway and your getting a lot more features. Additionally, the batteries on the Pro cameras seem to last longer. My only complaint is that the cameras are way to easy to knock down and steal with the provided mounts. There should be a way to lock them in place so that thiefs don't run away with your camera's. Both systems work with the same app so you can run multiple systems simultaneously if you want. The motion detection works pretty well but. If you set it too sensitive, then you'll get a lot of false alarms. my work around was to install two cameras at different angles covering the same area plus an additional camera at the front door. If one camera detects motion, then it's most likely a false alarm but when 2 or more cameras start going off at the same time, I know that someone is actually nearby. I'm very pleased with this purchase. I'd definitely recommend these cameras to anyone looking for a quick and easy security system.",Arlo Pro is worth the extra money

Got my placed in really busy area, so all the notifications has to be turned off o I I'll get around 100-200 notifications per day. Camera has been 7 days installed with full battery and already there is only 65% of the battery left. It won't go even a month. So that's out of question who would like to charge the camera every month, not me, if it had an option to run a charger cable to keep it running from outlet like nest, then this camera would be a 5 star. Picture quality is ok, not great but if you place it in right place it will work. Got mine 15 feet high and 20 feet away from my car, even with a close up I can't read the plates. Another issue is, 2 way talk from iOS didn't work not even once. But there is something really good about this camera is the microphone can take everything even when my neighbors talk outside. So after all these issues I need to return it, don't have time to babysit a camera. Update. One full month and battery is gone, motion sensor is very poor, needs big movements or it will send 20 notifications make 20 videos of couple seconds just from standing and smoking outside under camera. This is very annoying and had to disable it and just let it record. This needs more maintenance then anything else in my house, charge it every month is a joke. This camera would be ok with option to connect cable and let it record nonstop.",Sometimes it's better to  go extra mile.

Connect base to your network, turn on camera.  The camera will pick up your wifi automatically (at least for me), and you can start using it right away.  Because it runs on batteries, your recordings will start a couple seconds after the camera detects motion, but that's pretty much all you need unless you want a real, fully wired, 24/7 system.  You can always connect directly to the camera as well.

It was easy to set up and easy to use.  I am so glad Netgear came out with this re-chargeable version as I wasn't too thrilled with having to constantly replace batteries.  One camera is on the front porch and the other is in the carport.  Both are in covered locations so other than cold or heat, they are protected from direct exposure to wind, rain, snow, ice, sun etc. To give an idea of the battery drain, by end of February, the carport cam was down to 55%, while the porch cam was down to 95%.  I thought the carport cam would hit 50% by beginning of March, but the drain actually slowed down - I think because the temp started to warm up a bit.  Jan and Feb saw temps of low 30's to mid 40's.  March temps were high 30's to low 50's.  By mid March, the battery finally hit 50%.  The carport cam records 10 second clips 3 to 5 times in the morning and 3 to 5 times late afternoon everyday.  This is with us coming and going each day.  The porch cam rarely gets triggered - usually when a package is delivered, or when I step out to grab the newspaper.  I charged it up the other day and it went from 45% to 100% in just over an hour.  At this moment, the porch cam is at 85%. Pros: Easy to set up.  Easy to use. Notifications to my cellphone usually comes within 2 seconds (sometime not - see cons), cameras are completely wireless, two way communication - sort of.  Many mounting possibilities. Re-chargeable. Cons: Expensive system, expensive add-ons. Notifications sometimes arrive a few minutes later - not sure if this is Arlo related, WIFI/Internet, or cellphone related. With the two way communication - unless I'm doing  something wrong - you have to go into the app, turn on the mic and talk, but you have to turn off the mic to hear a response, then turn it on again to talk again.  There should be a simple, quick toggle or button like a walkie talkie.  Speakers could be a little louder.  Once again - Expensive. I need a third camera, but will wait to see if any deals during the next Black Friday/Cyber Monday. **Update - May 27, 2017** 1) I don't think temperature has an effect on battery drain. Since recharging it for the first time in March, one month later in April, the charge was down to 50%.  I recharged again, but this time after four hours, it was only 75%. I unplugged it and plugged it again, then after another two hours, it was 95%.  Another hour later, 98%.  After some research, it seemed this was common as the battery is only supposed to charge to 85% capacity???? However, the first time I recharged in March, it was 100%. 2) After the 2nd recharge in April, It has drained down to 50% again here in late May.  This time recharge took just under 2 hours, and the unit is showing 100% charge. 3) The porch cam finally came down to 50% about mid May since it's original install in January.  It still only gets triggered a few times a week. I will be recharging it today. 4) There was a Arlo systems upgrade a few weeks ago.  Since then, the notifications on my Samsung S7 do not always open like they did prior to the upgrade.  My phone sometimes freezes when the Arlo app is trying to open. Also, it seems to take a lot longer to open the live view on the app.  Due to these issues, I have knocked a star off.",This was a good purchase... (see update)

Wing,"All the parts are there for a great product, and then Netgear got greedy.  The want to force you to pay every month for unnecessary cloud storage, so they prevented reliable recording to local storage.  You can set it up to hopefully record only the motion-activated recordings locally (when it doesn’t silently fail).  But the manual recordings – you know, the ones you actually want to retain – those are deliberately not recorded locally.  They instead go to the cloud where they require manual intervention to download, one at a time, or else they get automatically deleted in 7 days (or earlier if you use up the paltry amount of storage provided sooner.  It’s just too much unnecessary work. Also, the camera won’t record from the beginning of motion being sensed until after the end of motion being sensed.  Instead, it records for a fixed period of time, starting a few seconds after motion is sensed.  Thus, you lose very important parts of the action.  This is a cop-out for their motion-sensing not being good enough to make the former scenario work reliably. I could live with the motion-sensing being sub-par, as that is an actual technical challenge that costs money to fix.  But forcing me to use the cloud to store my video, even if it were free, is not acceptable.  Frankly, placing videos on the cloud is the opposite of security, for a number of reasons. I’m returning mine.",Netgear crippled it.

After playing with the motion detection settings I seem to have the right balance of video clips being picked up from activity around our urban area town house (e.g. mail/shipment deliveries, my direct neighbor walking dog along our back shared path, people walking by our entrance etc). It is very easy to setup and sync. For installation and to avoid the hassle of drilling into the exterior stucco wall,  I purchased the suction cup mounts (and skins in black) separately from Wassertein and easily set the cameras up on the outside of our windows that look down over our front entrance and backyard. The suction cups are really incredibly strong and held up nicely during a recent heavy rain and wind storm. I did later add tethers for secondary piece of mind and cosmetics (Cosmos ® 2 PCS 24 Inch Black Color Stainless Steel Tether Lanyard Wire Coated in Soft Plastic for Gopro)  The rechargeable batteries on the pro last me about a 3-4 weeks right now (based on motion detection settings and how often you look at a live feed).  I am happy and content with that. You can add users to the app/web/cloud recordings and alerts, so my wife also can see activity and use the system. We can even trigger the 100 decibel siren on the pro base unit if we needed to from the app if we see suspicious activity and we are away. I am looking forward to a solar drip plug in charging unit which is rumoured to be in the works from the Arlo discussion boards, which would be a nice to have.","Great product, great design, great app!"

There are too many hardware and software problems. I work in tech and have specifically worked with wireless communicators. After working through multiple hardware and software issues (managing to avoid customer service which I've heard is terrible.)  I got the system to work. 20 minutes after placing the camera I find out that the camera is ""offline."" They don't even have it set up so that you get a notification if a camera goes down. So I went through troubleshooting and managed to get it working again. 20 minutes later, camera goes offline I get it to work and not work and then fail a few minutes later about 3Xs before I came to the conclusion that the camera cannot stay connected to the base station some 15 feet away...I live in a small condo I don't see how these would work for anybody if they don't work for my tiny place.

Setup was extremely easy and I'm generally happy with the sensitivity, which was the main thing I was worried about after reading other reviews. We have it setup at a 45 degree angle to our front door in a narrow entry area, and it picks up people within a second or so as long as they aren't sprinting to our front door. The ability to plug in an external hard drive to get local copies of the video is a good feature that I didn't see any many other cameras of this type. That + the free 7 days of rolling cloud coverage means that you won't need to upgrade to a paid subscription unless you really want to. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I really think it needs 1080p to be get viable shots of peoples faces as they cross the field of view. I've also had a 1-2 videos that show a few seconds of motion and then everything holds still and I can only hear audio. Could be a connection issue, and time will tell whether this is a recurring problem or not.","Overall a good system, but resolution could be improved."

I have been playing with them and their capabilities.  Getting used to the different settings and how they respond has taken some time but I now know how to use them for my situation. I mounted one on the porch and in 6 short days I ran the battery completely down.  Not because it was an issue but I wanted to see what happens when I run it with Audio and motion detected.  Since the wind blows and the birds chirp I had nearly constant video in 4min 58 second clips which was consistent for that setting. My inside camera were still at 92% after a week but the porch was down to 20%.  Of course I changed the settings and the battery is lasting much longer. The audio is clean and crisp.  Using the mike the speakers still have something to be desired and volume is low but works. Charging a battery from 20% to full took less than an hour. The app is awesome as is the website. You get your cameras up, you can go live, manually record, check systems status and a bunch more.  You can power off a camera in the app also. Custom modes lets you build different rules to meet your varying needs. I have one the excludes the porch camera during the day and one that only arms the porch camera at night. If you set the video quality to HD it i amazing.  Set it to balanced and it is still awesome but distance (200 ft.) is a little fuzzy but very view able. The Geofencing works great on Android.  I can set the mode and view my cameras from anywhere. Adding cameras to the base station is so super simple.  NetGear got this right. Now coupled with my monitored alarm systems separate from Arlo the Cameras will record for cops to see. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the speaker sound and volume.

Also good for just watching some remote area in real-time.  Excellent quality video.  Might work well as an outside front door camera pointed in such a way that it only alerts when someone is right at your door. Con:  Terrible for high motion areas.  It will send you an email every time something moves.  No way to turn configure it otherwise.  Motion detection is only configurable from 0% to 100%. No way to customize the alert zone, just alert sensitivity.  If motion alert is set at 80% sensitivity, anything moves you get an alert.  So.. if you have it in a general area of your home or business where there is regular traffic.. you going to get hundreds of email every day.  Set sensitivity to 0% (I'm guessing this means 'OFF'), then you just have a real-time remote viewing camera.  There is no sound (like breaking window) alert option.  Also..  Packaging is designed for store shelf merchandising.  Way over packaged for mail order.  Each camera is a packaged in a ton of packaging.  Almost filled up my trash can after unboxed.

Once the account was setup, adjusting everything just the way I wanted it was a 15 minute affair. Not having to run any wires at all makes this so much easier to set up and use. I've purchased two $200 wired/DVR type systems that I have never installed, because even after weeks of playing with the software, I could never get them to work properly. This is not the case with the Arlo Pro: it could not be easier, and it works perfectly every time. It records every time there is motion, those recordings are on the cloud every time, the quality is great every time, and I get an email alert every time. Yes, this is arguably one of the most expensive security camera systems on the market, but it is absolutely worth it for the ease of use. Also, if you have your router and cable modem on a UPS, you effectively have a system that will work even if someone cuts the power. That kind of peace of mind is worth far more than the cost of these cameras. I started with two cameras, but am already looking forward to adding another. If you've tried any other type of security camera system, you'll likely agree the price is worth every penny.",Absolutely fantastic compared to wired counterparts

My issues are with battery power.  The re-chargeable battery surely does beat buying expensive lithium batteries for the regular camera.  However, the battery runs down very quickly. For example, charged it to 100% in the morning, after a little more than 24hrs, the remaining charge is down to 65%; this is after reducing motion sensitivity to 50% so that I don't get hundreds of recordings of every car that drives by.  Most of the time, the yellow light indicates that it is not close enough to base station, and frequently a message is indicates that it is offline. When camera used outside with temperature in 30's, it has to warm up before it will re-charge the battery.  I'm still contemplating buying another re-chargeable camera...",Still contemplating...

I haven’t found a way for system to alert me to power or internet outages as of yet, which should obviously be an option. It was not intuitive to find where to adjust the length of video clips or sensitivity of motion detection – important settings that everyone will need that are buried in settings layers. Additionally, I needed to contact support for one of my cameras and was given a 35-50 minute estimated wait time, and when I went the email route, it took three days for support to respond.  Will eventually be a great system I’m sure with a few refinements. Updated 1/11:  Emailed support asking how to enable option to be alerted when the system loses internet or power, and they shared it's not technically possible, though there are many cloud based services that can alert users when a connection is lost (Alarm.com, various thermostats and other home monitoring services, etc.)  The solution is simple – if a device hasn’t checked in with the cloud server after a certain number of seconds, then the server sends an alert letting the user know their device has lost connection.  That allows for the user to check other systems to see if there’s an intruder who has cut the internet, cut the power, turned off the base station, or just a power outage.  I’m disappointed to learn after spending a lot of money on the system that this isn’t already in place, and that support seems to think this technology isn’t available. Also disappointed at how long it takes support to respond to messages.","Great Cameras, Though System, App and Support Need Refinements"

I thought I would have decided on a place to install this in the front and took a chance and ordered this set anyways. Currently, the cameras are on the window sill looking out. They are not hardly obvious from the outside, which is what I prefer. BUT, that means, there is ONLY LIVE viewing now. I have to turn off motion and audio detection because obviously it won't work for outside through the window. It only picks up noise and motion inside which is not what I want because the camera is pointing out anyways. So, I have this expensive camera set with still has a great option of being able to view from my smartphone from anywhere and if I happen to see anything unusual LIVE, I can do a manual recording. And I have the speaker function also. But that's it. It's a bit frustrating that I can't use motion or audio and maybe I should look around at another security system instead with the smartphone interface also, and wireless. And for live nighttime viewing, I have to have the night vision set to off or else nothing can be seen out through the glass. It only reflects the camera lights from the glass. When the night vision is off, I can see outside as if it was live. Yes, it is dark but can still make out figures and cars. When there are house lights on outside, you can see more. At least it is something. I was considering getting the suction holders (from a different brand) on the windows for the outdoors that is designed to work with these cameras, which I may try. However, since the only place I would install this will be installed at most about 7-1/2' high, near an entrance under an overhang, there is still a chance it could be stolen. But it would be next to a window and no way to sneak up behind the camera in that location anyways without being recorded. But I am concerned with the lag-time that occurs with these cameras. However, these cameras are still great for what they can do. (But getting used to the settings of these cameras and the layout is a little odd on the app, but I guess not too bad when someone gets used to it. ) I will try to update this if there is any significant changes to my purchase and using this product.",READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO INSTALL THIS OUTSIDE BUT YOU STILL WANT TO MONITOR THE OUTDOORS.

First of all, if you are not very handy with some tools or computer literate, don't buy this.  Get a pro to instal a regular one.  This is not for people who don't want to do hours of work. After you install it, it works well. If you are average with a computer it will take you about a half hour to install the software and set up your phone.  For me, it took an hour.  As usual, the user manual for these electronics don't come with the item, just a basic set up guide.  You have to go online to download a lengthy 100 page manual to understand everything this camera can do.  And it does many things.  For the money you pay, this manual should be in the box. The company is deceptive on several issues, which I found to be outright lies.  They claim you just take off the camera from it's mount to recharge the battery.  Yeah, get up on a ladder every 2-3 months and take the camera down to recharge it.  I don't think so.  If you read the manual, it says  the battery will only need recharging every 3-4 months for normal use.  That's a lie.  Using it on the factory settings, the battery went down to 65 % after one month. At that rate, it will only last 2- 3 months max.  And I have very little traffic where I put it up in front of my door.  I have no kids, and the sensor was only going off a few times a day when my wife or I went in and out, or a delivery person came.  The manual states they you can change the power mode to give you longer battery life.  Well the only way to do that is to reduce your video resolution.  Now who wants to buy a camera to lessen the image ?  And they state that it only takes about 2.5 hours to charge a battery that is down to 0.  This is a lie.  My battery was down to 65 %, and it took 4 hours and 5 minutes to charge it to 100 %.  That means if your battery was down to 0, it would take you over 8 hours to charge that battery, 8 hours you have no camera outside, and you have to remember to put it back.  This is nonsense !  I can understand some of the specifications to be a little off, but when they are this off, you know they deliberately lied about this stuff to make it seem like it's so easy and fast to recharge the battery.  The whole battery aspect is ridiculous.  It works, if you want to take the maintenance time to do everything every 2-3 months.  Who has time for this ?  Maybe if you are retired with nothing to do. The physical design of the camera is ridiculous.  They only enclose one magnetic mounting disc, which can work for certain areas. This will work with drilling as little as one small hole for one screw. And it does work well.  But it you want more options, like to have it angled more down or to the side, it won't work.  Now you have to buy a special screw on mount, which the camera has a threaded hole for.  You can get them for as little as $5.00 online, but you'll wait weeks for it, unless you want to pay more.  Be prepared to drill 3 holes for that mount.  Now for the nightmares.  Since the battery life is horrible, and you won't want to go outside and stand on your ladder to remove the camera every 2-3 months to bring it in to recharge the battery, you need to buy another part - the optional AC charging cord.  BTW, do not order the one from Weinstein, for some reason people say it doesn't work.  Get the 20' one from Panda.  It will cost you about $16.00.  Again, this should have been included in the box. If you are selling a do it yourself camera, everything you might need should be in the box.  I didn't see one from Arlo, I don't know why.  I did read that when they came out with the camera, they didn't even have the AC cord.  Really?  They made an AC adaptor cord hole for it, but didn't include the cord or even make one.  That came many months later.  Now when you plug this cord in, you will see that you can't use the better mounting bracket, the hole for the screw mounting unit is right next to the AC jack.  Impossible to use both.  Whoever designed that should be fired.  Then, if you use the included magnetic mount, you will see that you can't angle the camera very downward, the way you need it, because the AC cord gets in the way with the mounting bracket.  Your camera will probably be too high.  I wanted mine pointed more down in front of my door, and I can't get the area right in front of the door anymore.  Absolute stupidity on this manufacturer.  The AC cord hole should have been put on the top or the side, it gets in the way of any of the optional accessories that you need. Now for more aggravation.  When I ordered the AC cord, I though all I would have to do is drill a small 1/4 hole through the top of the door frame, to thread the cord inside my door, and about 8 feet to an outlet. I measured the door frame at almost 6"" deep.  What I thought would be a 15 minute task wound up taking me over 3 hours of work.  One end of the cord is a mini USB, which is a right angle plug.  I would need to drill a one inch hole to get that through. The other end is a standard USB cord, which I only needed a 5/8 "" hole to thread through.  In order to drill this through an average 6"" door frame, you need to use a 1/4"" wide 12"" long drill bit, which most homeowners won't have.  Don't get anything bigger to make your initial hole, the drill will go wild on you.  Unfortunately, my long bit was old and not very sharp, and there was metal strips in two layers of the frame.  To me, it just looked like wood frame, an easy drill with even an old bit.  I was there drilling for 5 minutes and couldn't get through the metal.  Luckily I have a drill bit sharpener, which most homeowners won't have, and I had to sharpen it 4 times to get the big through.  I had sweat running in my eyes from all of this.  It was only about 80 degrees in Florida at the time. Then, you have to drill open each side from the 1/4"" inch to 5/8"", using each size bit at a time, on each side of the door, otherwise your drill will go wild in the hole.  For the 5/8' bit, which I had never used, I had to switch drills to a hammer drill, because my standard electric one did not accept the 1/2"" shank that comes with the 5/8"" bit.  Just more aggravation.  Most homeowners won't have that type of hammer drill.  Then I had to drill out each side so many times to fish that USB cord through, using a metal hanger with tape to fish it through.  Yeah, it  sounds easy, but I'm handy, not a contractor.  It took hours of labor to do all of this.  Then you have to use a staple gun - use the rounded staples, to tack it down your door frame.  Be carefull, the wire is a flat wire, which barely fits in the rounded staple, it looks better.  It's easy to send the staple through the wire, which can damage your wire.  I did this once, but luckily it didn't affect the wire. Better to get coax plastic brackets that come with nails to hang the wire around the frame .  Just pre drill the holes to make it easier to install. Then hammer them in. Finally, you'll need a tube of chaulk or wood filler to fill up that big hole in the door or window frame.  Than paint it when it dries. The cord works, constantly charging the battery, but as you can see, this was a long tedious project. The average home owner or senior won't want to deal with all of this.  If you are not handy and will to work hours at this, don't buy this camera.  Otherwise, the camera works well.","This camera works, but is poorly designed"

Kim,"Item arrived on time without issues. The cameras were very easy to pair with the hub and install.  I definitely like the fact that I did not have to drill holes to route power or network cables for the camera.  The hub required an ethernet connection to an internet router (cable included), but communication between the hub and cameras were indeed wireless.  Wireless signal strength seems fine with the hub located about 90ft away from the camera through a door/stucco.  App was easy to install on my iPhone and intuitive to use as well.  I like the ""live"" mode where live video/sound is streamed directly to my phone... One thing I found weird is that in order to ""speak"" I have to press down the microphone icon and then ""release"" to listen to the sound again (operates like ""push to talk"" feature). I haven't yet figured out how to enable longer video captures than default 10 seconds, but every feature seems to work so far.  Video quality is not perfect but not bad either.  I will definitely be adding more cameras to the system soon.","Easy to install & Use, and no wires!"

I biggest reason I bought the camera was to view my front entrance and be able to talk to the person at my door from any where without having to actually go to the door.  Well I can hear well enough the person at the door but they cannot hear me.  I mounted the camera about 10' to the left of my door at the ceiling level to be able to see the full height of the door and the full length of the sidewalk which is allows for motion pick up as they start up my sidewalk.  After calling Arlo support they suggested it may be a bad camera as the speaker volume comes factory set at max and checking the settings sure enough it was at max.  The speaker does little good if the visitor cannot hear you.  I will exchange out this unit for another and see what happens.

In virtually all respects the Arlo System is one of the best technical products  have ever purchased.  It was very easy to set up, both the Base Station and the 4 Pro Cameras I purchased, including the following steps: access to the Internet through my existing Modem/Router; connection of the 4 Pro Cameras to the Arlo Base Station; updating the firmware for both the Base Station and the cameras; installation of the Arlo iPhone app; and learning to use the well-developed Arlo iPhone app to modify the system and camera settings to fit my personal preferences.  The system provides a wealth of options and features which can be accessed, turned on/off, and personalized with ease.  However, the default system settings work very well right out of the box.  Whether you're considering a single Camera or up to five Cameras this is an outstanding video security system that delivers exactly what it promises.  You can start with a single camera and add up to four additional cameras at any time, either one-at-a-time or as a group, as your needs change.  A lifetime ""basic"" cloud-based storage system for up to 5 cameras and 7 days of rolling storage is included in the package at no additional cost.  You can also plug a USB Memory Stick into the Arlo Base Station to capture all 'motion-triggered' video clips for long-term local retention.  Longer cloud storage options are also available at additional monthly cost if that better fits you needs.  The only negative I observed is that, while the sound capture function does work, it is limited in terms of volume and could certainly be improved.  Bottom Line:  5 Stars!!  -mike-","Not Perfect, But Really a Great Product!"

Have rotated the units around and the problems remain with the troubled devices.  Will return for warranty repair.  On the up side, those cameras which work well are otherwise flawless except for the limited IR light range (night lighting).  Respectible considering these are wireless/battery operated. ALSO- WTH- software doesn't allow you to 'mask' the motion detection; meaning you can bring up the camera image and block out part of the image for the motion detection to ignore, i.e., like a waving flag or tree, while keeping motion active for the rest of the picture.

I am techie, so I was able to figure out the install (but it took more time than expected). I was first disappointed with the recording lag time, from when motion-was-detected to when recording actually starting... I was further disappointed that; when it was obvious there was still motion... it stops recording (not capturing it all of the motion). Then, I started having intermittent motion-detection issues with my most active camera... it has stopped recording any motion, 3 times in 30 days, only working again after I (reboot) remove the battery & replace it in the camera. I was further disappointed that; when I tried to ""chat"" online with support, it never would connect... so, when I called support... there was an unusual lengthy wait (with no prompts suggesting what the hold time would be) for a support person. I was further disappointed that; the support person (who's first language clearly was not English) had trouble understanding me and put me on hold many times... the script she was using, clearly was not correct for my issue. After 34 minutes, and coming back, after the last being-put-on-hold... she finally decided to replace the camera, and sent me an RMA email. Imagine my surprise when when I read I have to send them the defective camera (AT MY EXPENSE) before they will send me a replacement camera!!! So, I am going to have to pay shipping on a defective camera (I pay for Prime so I don't pay shipping costs, but I guess I will have to anyway!)... based on my experience (so far), I doubt I'll ever purchase another NETGEAR product.

Only got one camera and great to see who is comibg up our path. The camera and base station are high quailty and prefer these over standard cameras that record 24/7.

Also the base station has an alarm built in and is very loud and can set it remotely by phone/ ipad, etc. If there is one issue is that the android app seems to crash times and other minor issues, but works. Using it with my ipad and the app is rock steady and no crashing.",Does a great job !!!!

The 720p is crisp and clear.  Streaming and downloading videos is extremely quick and easy.  I added a USB hard drive to the system in less than 30 seconds - all automatic.  We are very, very happy with the system and after agonizing over all the options out there - this is the best. For me, I LOVE that it is battery operated.  I had thought and considered the various wired cameras - that would have been a HUGE mistake.  I have one camera in a top-back corner of a kids room - impossible with a corded setup (or permanent and involving an electrician).  I also like the idea of moving them around wherever I want - not where there are outlets and ways i can hide the cord..  These are perfect.  I put one in a higher up window facing out.  It looks nice, doesn't look weird, and no dangling cord that would make it look completely idiotic.  And if you just want a cord, these work fine with cords, too.  It's just that it's not necessary. Second, I love that they download to a central USB hard drive, not separate SD cards that would take a while to go in/out of.  That would be annoying.  This is not. I should address some negative reviews that had held me back: 1) this is not a security system (truly).  It will work as one, kind of.  I can set the system to alarm noisily and notify me for movement or sound.  But at the end of the day, wifi can be easily broken by a tech savvy thief, and if I'm not paying attention, no one calls the police.  There aren't the typical window break / door open alarms.  It's not meant to be that.  It can work as one - again relying on YOU to call the police - but it wouldn't be my first choice. 2) More on the ""not a security system...really"" aspect-- If the camera has to stand up in court to identify a face, I would want a higher resolution (or even more cameras to hit things closer up.  Nonetheless, I see faces, facial expressions, who people are clearly.  But in court or with night vision...probably not. 3) This could work as a baby monitor easily, but you'd be streaming from your phone constantly.  But it works that way and I've done that while I was doing side work in the garage. 4) Talking through the camera to people is OK, but it's not like FaceTime or a cell phone call.  But really, why are people complaining about this? It works well for what it is - you can talk in, but holding a conversation is best over a phone! A huge win.",Streaming and downloading videos is extremely quick and easy. I added a USB hard drive to the ...

After reading about nearly every competitive product available I decided to buy an Arlo Pro system.  Why?  After researching security cameras, Arlo Pro seemed to be the best value for the dollar. Here are the details:  Arlo Pro has a FREE account option with no monthly fees.  Rechargeable battery? Check.  Water and weather proof?  Arlo is working fine so far in the weird Minnesota winter. Works well in the dark?  You betcha!  Arlo Pro has a good microphone and the speaker also is decent, too. Multiple resolution settings are available which help to manage file sizes.  The battery life seems very good so far as well; Arlo Pro has been on the job for six days and the battery still shows 100%.  I could go on and on with all sorts of details, but they'd all be quite positive. If you're wondering about the set up experience that was a breeze too.  I think it took about as long to unbox Arlo Pro as it did to set up and configure. A couple of firmware updates were needed and that was super simple too; just a few button clicks and viola! I mounted my Arlo Pro under the overhang near my front door and about 10' off the ground, which took about 15 minutes.  While the mounting was simple it was the most difficult part of my Arlo Pro install...screws can be hard to find when dropped in the snow!  After operating Arlo Pro for one day I did tinker with some of the settings, including recording time and turning off email notifications which were sent every time the camera detected motion and captured video. In summary, I can say that Arlo Pro is a system that I would recommend to my friends without hesitation. If you're looking for a security camera system please do look carefully at all the options available; my guess is that you'll also conclude Arlo Pro is the best option available. Update 1-4/17:  I have configured my camera to record 30 seconds of video and it has been installed since December 20, 2016.  Given the current batter level, I am projecting the battery to last about 8-9 weeks between charges in the winter weather; I was projecting up to 25 weeks of battery life with the default 10 second recording per event.  Also, the temperature last night at 9:51 p.m. was about 4 degrees F and the camera was working fine.  This morning however, the ambient air temp was well below 0 and the Arlo app was telling me, ""Your camera needs to warm up before you can use it.""  At 9:45 a.m. the temperature is still -6 and with the morning sun shining on the camera body it's now warm enough to work again.  Impressive.",Looking for a great security camera? Look no further!

Best wireless camera out in the market. Video quality is good. Some effort is required to tweak the motion detection as you might receive quite a lot of alerts if live close to a busy street. It was able to detect motion as far as end of my driveway. That resulted in lot of false alerts . After some tweaks I was able to somewhat focus the motion detection to just the area I want. I like this camera and I plan to buy more in future.,Easy to install wireless security camera.

It took all of 15 min from unboxing to watching the camera record movement. Mount is strong and holds the camera well. Everything was included and the system interface needs very little attention to get it going. Once you have it up and going you can play with the app to personalize the settings. The system sends notices about camera activation based on sound or movement very quickly and the cloud service save 7 days of video free. I'm going to add an external HD to also save video to my home as well. The only thing I would do different is bite the bullet and buy a package with 3 or more camera from the start.,"Great system, just stop looking and buy it."

I am using not for security but to monitor a recovery room in a medical clinic. It has been great because no outlet was needed, the nurses can log on on any computer to monitor area. Still learning how to customize it since I don't need alerts of motion. But it is very easy to set up. less them 10 min and no problems at all. Field of view s good. You can listen to the room as well. We got this system to test it out. We didn't want to pay for storage of video. The Nest camera had tons of software issues and you have to pay a monthly fee bla bla bra. This works way better. No issues with battery life. So far 1 week in monitoring the room all day. Easy to charge when it needs not that we have needed to charge yet. You log in to delete the saved videos. We tried 4 other brands and this has been the best. The siren is not needed for us but you have to activate yourself if you need it. Ill be getting one for my home.

Well, I love it and have ordered more cameras and even a system for my office. Quick and easy setup except for the first firmware update I have to grab my laptop cause the iPad kept failing. Easy to mount the camera although I don't trust the magnetic mount so I bought the screw type mount. The base is way smaller than I expected. I like the way it can save to the cloud and to a USB HD, I have yet to try this feature but I will be putting the USB drive on today once the other 4 cameras I ordered arrive. I love that there's an app my Apple TVs, iPad, and iPhone and a web login for my Mac. But I had to use a ton of emails so it didn't sign out the other devices. Some people are gonna ask why do you need multiple devices, a situation is brewing on the camera and you don't want to miss it but have to switch devices, it takes time to sign on and kicks you off. I can think of many other situations. But this is Netgear software update so I still give Arlo 5 stars.",Best cloud security system

After using my system for about 6 months, I realized this product was causing internet outages by interfering with the wifi signal of my wireless router (which it needs to be connected to of course).  I had a technician come out and show me exactly how it was interfering (through the wifi channels).  When he manually changed my router's channel, it all started working perfectly.  Here's the problem...any time you have a power outage, your router will reset to the default channel, same as the Arlo system.  So every time there's a power outage, they'll both use the same channel and you'll get MAJOR internet outages and decreased reception for all devices connected to your wifi.  I did some research and this is a VERY COMMON problem with this item.  What's worse, Arlo wants to charge people for customer support over 90 days out.  INSANE!!!!  Typical warranty is 1 to 2 years, yet NETGEAR wants to get away with 3 months.  Why buy a product that has major complications from a company that doesn't appreciate its customers.",DO NOT BUY until you read this!!!

From there, follow the app instructions to sync up from your hub to the cameras to be able to view the cameras from the app and it's all set.

"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 May 2017,MinisterofDOOM,"After a little over 2 weeks with 3 Arlo Pro cameras, I have to say I do not trust these cameras to do their job and protect my property.  These cameras promise a lot of versatility and offer some great features.  If they worked as intented, they would be phenomenal.  The issue is that they very very rarely work as intended.  I repeatedly encounter significant issues that render the cameras nearly useless for their intended purpose (on-event-triggered recording and video monitoring of my property). I'm going to start with the issues I'm encountering, but I WILL follow up with what I like about these cameras (which is still certainly a strong list).  I should also clarify that I'm an Android phone user, so any app issues may be specific to the Android version; I can't say for sure if they also apply to the iPhone version. Firstly: The geofencing feature is completely buggy and barely functional.  I will be sitting on my couch with my phone in my hand and over a 5 minute period, the geofencing will change from Home to Away mode several times.  I have not moved.  My phone's connectivity and location detection settings have not changed.  But the geofencing keeps switching modes.  This is extremely frustrating and completely breaks the cameras usefulness as it will change the event detection settings from what they should be based on my location.  Fortunately, I do not have geofencing freak out when I'm NOT at home (e.g. when actually away, the cameras stay in Away mode) which is at least a sort of safe fail mode.  But it's still broken and not performing as advertised. Secondly: I'm being frustrated with a completely incomprehensible PERSISTENT notification from the Arlo app that tells me that ""You are not connected to the Internet.""  Not only does this notification fail to explain WHAT is not connected to the internet (my phone?  The base station?  One or more of the cameras?  All of the above?), but it is also completely inaccurate.  Every single time this notification has appeared,  I have been able to launch the app, connect to my cameras, and view to my heart's content.  But making it even MORE irritating is the fact that this notification can NEVER be cleared.  Even once whatever connectivity issue the app thinks it detected is clearly resolved, it persists.  The ONLY WAY TO CLEAR IT IS TO FORCE CLOSE THE ARLO APP.  This is so broken it's insane.  Why is this notification persistent at all?  None of the others are?  It might make sense if the notification was actually useful, but it has never EVER been useful.  EVER.  And I've seen it dozens upon dozens of times.  In two weeks. Thirdly: exacerbating the irritation of the broken geofencing and nonsense ""not connected to the Internet"" issues is the app's lack of granular notification controls.  ALL notifications from the app, be they system, event/recording alerts, geofencing alerts, mode changes, or ANYTHING, all use the same notification tone and icon.  This means that thanks to the truly insane number of useless geofencing and ""not connected to the internet"" alerts I see, I basically don't pay attention to notifications from the app anymore.  Because I get easily tenfold more nonsense broken-feature-triggered alerts than actually camera event alerts. Particularly in light of the excellent nested-condition mode and alerting configuration options within this app (more on that when I discuss what I like about these cameras), it seems insane to me that there's no way to tie separate notification sounds to different alerts or modes as well as to different system notifications (or to at least separate system notifications from event notifications). Fourthly: Also on the subject of notifications, the Event Detection notifications are completely inconsistent in their clickability.  Sometimes I'll get a notification that a camera has detected motion and, upon tapping it, be taking to the log-in screen of the app and then the recording for that event.  Other times, tapping the notification does absolutely nothing, and I have to launch the application manually and then find the event in the list manually.  How is this kind of inconsistent behavior even possible?  So spectacularly broken. Fifth: These cameras and their software lack detection zones (e.g. the ability to select areas of the camera's overall view to either include in or remove from motion detection).  This means that you have to be very careful how you aim them (especially when outdoors) or you will get a lot of false positive alerts on motion detection.  Each of my cameras has in its view either trees or hedges.  I have had to do a lot of tweaking on motion sensitivity, but there's no way to eliminate all false positives without reducing detection so far that REAL positives are missed.  Having the ability to block out foot-traffic areas of the cameras view from the background for motion detection would make these cameras much more dependable as event-triggered devices (which is the only way they operate; due to the battery powered nature, there's no continual record mode--even when on USB power). And lastly: The Arlo app scales from fairly responsive to completely useless.  Sometimes, I can launch the app and quickly jump into any live camera view or alerted camera view.  Other times, I am greeted with nothing more than a spinning ""loading"" circle.  There's now way to force a ""retry"" and since the app runs in the background, the only way to fix this is to force close and try again, hoping you have better luck.  When viewing an alert in urgent circumstances, this is hardly ideal.  It's also frustration compounding in a very special kind of way when the Geofencing starts freaking out, and I attempt to launch the app to see what's going on, only to be greeted with an endlessly spinning circle.  Broken compounded with broken. Now, as to what I like: The programmability of alerting, detection, and recording is exemplary.  You can create a variety of modes and then nest them by referring them to each-other conditionally. For instance, I have my geofencing mode pointing to a scheduled mode, which in turn points to multiple static modes.  When at home, I get one set of behaviors at some hours and different behaviors at other hours.  While away, I get yet a different set of behaviors.  I could select any of these static modes as the current ""active"" mode, or I can chose to refer to them conditionally with other modes as desired.  It's very easy to configure and the specific sub-settings (such as motion sensitivity) are unique to each mode, allowing for a huge degree of variability between modes.  This basically means I can leave my house in a highly-monitored state, but still have my front door watched while I'm home during the day and then switch to more active full-yard monitoring at night when nobody should be in my yard. It is also possible to trigger recording on one camera from an event on another camera, meaning you can record multiple perspectives of an event even if only one camera detects motion or sound. The truly-wireless nature of the cameras means I can mount them in places that might be impractical or less-than-aesthetically-ideal otherwise.  The base station also has quite a decent range.  I have the cameras covering about a third of an acre from the outside in and have not had any connectivity issues, which is extra impressive considering that the cameras link with the base station over the extremely interference-prone 2.4GHz spectrum via WiDi.  There's also very little compression artifacting in the camera feed (only showing up when things get very busy on-camera), though it's worth noting that I have all my cameras set to ""highest quality"" mode, rather than the balanced mode or battery-focused mode, so that may change with difference modes. The cameras are quite small and the optional weather-hooded sleeves add more color options, meaning they can be quite discrete even when mounted in clear view.  I have yet to have anybody spot the cameras before having them pointed out, and mine are not in well-hidden locations. IR night vision range is quite solid and pretty glare-free.  In fact, while the manual recommends against pointing the cameras in the direction of windows, I experience no glare or washing out despite having all 3 of my cameras aimed at a house with IR-reflective-tinted windows.  A nice bonus is that each camera will activate its own IR lighting, meaning that if two cameras have a view that overlaps, illumination is particularly bright.  And since it's possible to trigger multiple cameras to record from a single event, this actually comes into useful practice quite frequently. The audio recording is a nice touch, but all my cameras experience enough background hiss that it's not really very useful for recording from any kind of distance.  I am experimenting with disabling microphone audio on certain cameras to improve battery life. If Netgear can fix the major functionality glitches, I will LOVE these cameras.  As they stand, I will most likely be requesting a refund.","Great concept, but completely broken functionality."

Setup was a breeze, considering I have an IT systems engineering degree. Setup for me for two cameras is approximately 20 minutes, with an additional 5 minutes for camera and receiver firmware updates. I would expect a novice can complete setup in the same amount of time. One camera experience about 4-5 minutes extra to reboot after firmware upgrade, but reconnected without issue. Running both cameras in doors in open floor plan home with really good connection to receiver. Software is intuitive with just enough options to not create confusion or complicated functionality. Will test for a few more days, and if still satisfied, will add two additional cameras for external coverage. I gave 5 stars because I believe I got exactly what's being advertised. I'm sure a wired system will out perform this one. However, if you need something with DIY minus the cables. I would recommend giving the Arlo a shot. Okay, a few days into my ARLO, and I've added two additional external cameras. I used both hard mount and suction cup mount (on glass window), and both are sturdy enough for the light-weight cameras. Have not experienced issues with camera functionality as detailed in other reviews. The software is great for configuring custom operation of individual cameras. The video quality could be better. However, considering portability of the system (no wires and no DVR), the trade off is tolerable. A little on the pricy side, but you get that when you want the newest technology. Still worth 5 stars now after operating four cameras.",Arlo Holds True...so far.

So as any other person, I ran a plethora of reviews and shopped before I decided to go with this. I bought the Arlo Pro 2 pack and got it in 1 day (thank you Amazon!). I live in FL so I have not had the temperature issues that people have discussed but I'd like to share some thoughts that may not be addressed as often from other reviews: 1. Packaging was a bit difficult to be delicate (in case you are worried about returning) however once all the pieces were out, setup was a breeze. Everything was hooked up and synced within 10 minutes. I had a couple firmware updates on the hub and cameras but they updated with no issue. 2. I have not mounted the cameras at all. I plan on placing one outside so I will need to get an extra accessory and the other I plan on using indoors but on the table mount (another accessory). The magnets are strong though. 3. I have been live streaming through PC and iPhone on the hour and batteries are still at 100%! 4. Web app is awesome. Very little lag but it is minimal. If I'm not on wifi (using crappy Tmo 4G), live feed can be impossible. 5. The monitoring options are great. I like how I can tell one camera to start recording if the other camera sees motion /hears noise. This is great if you have dogs! I say this because I am currently using the outside one inside pointing out the window and the motion sensor does not work through a window! But if your dog is barking bc they hear someone outside, your camera pointing outside will record! I posted pic and video for some insight if you are someone who cannot have the camera outside. The only limitation is the outside area must be lit otherwise the LEDs will just white out the screen. I can understand someone complaining that this is a weak line of defense but honestly, if you are truly concerned about being burglarized, you should have a monitoring security system anyways. Paired this with Arlo, you can dispatch police and give adequate details so I feel good about this. I have had a dispatch on a false positive before and they were at my home within 5min so I think if that is good enough for you, then Arlo would be a great 2nd line of defense for you. All other concerns have been addressed plenty of times in other reviews so I will just keep this short. I hope this will help you in deciding if Arlo is right for you or not. I plan on buying Arlo Q in the future and Netgear has announced the Arlo GO if that is something you want to wait on. Overall, I am very satisfied and will update in a few months.",Not bad if you are pointing out the window

The new camera is great and I've been using Arlo since the beginning and the predecessor Camera system and its works as advertised and fulfills our needs of keeping an eye on our place when we are not there while giving us some fun as well with seeing what's going on at night with the local critters.  What's great about the system is the ability to tailor the system to your imagination. The price point is not bad considering there is no monthly charge with a nice variety of cloud features depending on what you want. With the new features of this camera with sound, it offers flexibility for situations we cannot even imagine.  The new battery seems like great evolution of the product and we will be buying more of these when its time to retire older cameras.

It should be if plugged in. *No prerecord option! This would be extremely helpful for all motion recordings.  Most all other surveillance systems offer this. *No contrast/sharpness option. *Needs better brightness levels.

The IOS app only allows a few minutes of real time viewing and only after you ""activate"" a camera by selecting it. Doing this disables its recording function so you'd have to manually start that as well. I am used to Nest, where I can view 4 cameras in real time simultaneously on my phone, without needing to wake any of the cameras or disrupting their recording settings. The Arlo may provide 7 days of cloud for free but it doesn't make up for the horrible app controls or terrible lag. The lag is so bad that I watched myself turn around in front of the camera, after I had stopped it was a full two seconds before the view on the app caught up to real time.

Hall Jr.,"This camera system is great, but I had one of the six batteries that would not charge so I contacted Netgear. Their representative was great and really wanted to help with the battery issue, but when she went up the chain to get a replacement, I was only offered a charge adapter with the battery issue off the table. I assured them that the two charge adapters I had worked perfectly, and a new one would not change a thing. I had already eliminated the camera by swapping out the batteries. It all came down to a battery and all they would do is sent me the cheapest thing they could to try to pacify me and get me off the phone. I still have a bad battery, don't have the time to fight them, and like the product enough not to want to send it back. So the Arlo pro is excellent with Netgear's customer service poor. UPDATE: I no longer submitted this review when Amazon contacted me, and completely fixed the problem. I am extremely happy with this product, and now rate it a 5 star. Thank you Amazon.","This camera system is great, but I had one of the six batteries ..."

I am a software engineer, so I do know a few things about networks and setups. The support had me basically trial and error to get the first one to work , finally gave up and told me to send back for replacement. second one arrived,  Same issues, nothing worked. thru the netgear email support, I disabled firewalls, reset the base station, reset both modem and router, and over 3 days tried everything they had. No go!! Here is my thoughts as a Software developer. there is NO interface that you can get to to determine why or what is the error, routers and other items have a internal Webpage to administrate the device. ANY product that will work with networks as far as I am concerned should have it, I have wasted hours to not get this to work.

Before trying Aro pro, I had tried 2 other products and they were both disappointing. Pros: 1. You can place this product almost anywhere, even up on the trees around your property. 2. The phone software does an excellent job of managing the recorded videos. 3. The video quality of the recordings is excellent. 4. Works well for monitoring big homes. I'm using these cameras in 5500sqft + home. 5. Records sounds very clearly. 6. Rechargeable batteries, makes the maintenance easier and cheaper. 7. Saves the users installation money since it is completely wireless. Cons: 1. The night vision only covers 10-15 ft. 2. If you place the camera in places with a lot of trees or a pool, the motion sensor is constantly triggered during the day. 3. Sometimes motion is not picked at all during the day when the object is 20-30ft away. 4. Fast movements are sometimes not picked up by the cameras. This depends on the angle which tge object is passing through the sensors.",Excellent purchase

The magnet in the back is a bonus for that. Amazingly easy setup (easier than I'd like, actually; I'd prefer a little more manual control). The accompanying mobile app is well done. Image quality is very good relative to other cameras in this category. Cons: Since they're engineered to save battery life, they use a passive infrared receiver to detect motion. That means you can't set up detection zones within the image to minimize false alarms. The threaded camera mount is on the back, not the bottom, so a lot of existing tripods, etc. don't work well. The website requires Flash to play your video clips (seriously, Netgear, if I'd know that beforehand, that might've been a deal-killer). I haven't had them long enough to evaluate battery life, but so far so good.","Excellent, with a few caveats"

They are awesome cameras but......... If you buy the arlo solar chargers make sure you force the cable in to the point you think your going to break the camera. If you don't you will get a error. If you got to netgears website they show these arlo pro cameras in snow. Well You will get another error in 30F about it can charge the battery with solar and non solar charging. These cameras are awesome and have great video and sound. But In cold weather make sure you have 1 or 2 extra battery's. Good thing is if you have these inside the the rest outside the inside cams will charge the battery and can run with out the batterys. This will allow you to charge the batterys for the outside cams so you can swap them. No need to buy a battery charger.,The good the bad and the ungly

The first thing I noticed on receipt was the design of the packaging. A lot of clever design went into just the shipping materials and I felt that if Netgear put as much ingenuity into their product as they did with the packaging, I was probably going to be a satisfied customer. The product itself is elegantly designed and the control functions are both complete and easy to learn. The optics, resolution, night vision, motion sensing and remote notification all perform as advertised. The only problem I had with the setup was getting the base station to see the internet. I have U-verse and had to learn about the arcane art of port forwarding, which basically amounts to editing your firewall settings to let Netgear have access. (Check your ""gateway settings"" if you do have U-verse and are having problems; it becomes pretty straightforward at that point.) The Arlo system has thus far exceeded my expectations. Netgear has done an excellent job with this product line. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a very high quality home security system.",Very impressive by all measures

(The only issue I had was positioning it so the dogs aren't constantly setting off the motion sensor.) Alerts are pretty much immediate, and  it's always accessible via the app.  If anything is detected, I love that it's all saved safely in  the Cloud and that you can choose to  sound an alarm.

Highly recommended for any residential consumer. Easy to setup and use! Simply connect the Arlo Hub in a central location (if possible) to get the best reception on your cameras. The microphones that are built in within the camera are extremely sensitive! However the speaker could use a boost as it can be hard to hear if your camera is up high (7ft+). Night mode is sharp and you can see details at a very long range. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a home outdoor security camera.,Fully wireless! Highly recommended!

I have to say, Arlo's are my favorite cameras for a few reasons: for one, they are wireless and can be installed anywhere within the range of the access point. The picture is great day and night. I have motion alert enabled and I get no false alarms. Both camera versions are weather-sealed and I have no problem with the ones that I have outdoors under open sun and rain. I have never tried the feature, but I like to know that if I ever have to use the built-in siren, with its 100+ decibel, it will knock the socks off of intruders. I also like the Arlo app on my phone and the battery - is amazing: I have them protecting my house for about 4 months now, day and night, and still have 45% of battery charge left!

"Arlo Pro - Wireless Home Security Camera System with Siren | Rechargeable, Night vision, Indoor/Outdoor, HD Video, 2-Way Audio, Wall Mount | Cloud Storage Included | 5 camera kit (VMS4530)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Dec 2016,Scott Mathison,"After reading a lot about all of the competition in this space, the Arlo Pro was the winner. I bought the Arlo Pro 4-pack. -100% wireless works well, but don't expect it to record 24/7 recording (it's default settings work well). It uses motion/audio to trigger recording. -Video quality is really good for a surveillance camera (surveillance systems are something I evaluate/price/buy professionally). Night vision is even better than daytime. -The batteries come precharged. Be careful where you point the camera or how sensitive you set its motion activation as it can drain battery ridiculously fast if you point it at a busy road/sidewalk. -Charging was a HUGE unknown plus. After being too overzealous with my recording (I was able to drain one of the cameras' batteries in a day or two) I charged one camera from 5% to full in about an hour! I was expecting at least overnight charging. -IFTTT support! If you are getting into smart home stuff then these cameras can function as de facto motion sensors for lights. After going through quite a few different motion sensing lights for my front door (never could get one that wouldn't trigger on people walking by), I positioned a camera down my stairs and installed a smartswitch for my light and created an IFTTT trigger that would turn on the light when the camera detected motion. Works WAY better than any of the dozens of motion sensing lights that are supposed to be built for the purpose. The only catch is it doesn't care if it is night or day, but in my case it still turns the light on far less often and should save me some bulbs in the long run. IFTTT has been so powerful in replacing light timers in my house that this section could go on forever. Needless to say, if you have any intention of going smart home, this is the only good choice in town -These things are very compact; less than the size of an average fist -Weatherproof. The fact they are able to get such a high-quality camera in a weatherproof case for this cost is going to change how I negotiate the next time I have to buy cameras for work. -Smartthings integration. Integration is not working properly. I was able to add the cameras in the beginning, but now they can't be removed/changed/updated in the Smartthings app. I am not willing to reset the app to fix it, so it'll just have to stay broken until an update fixes it. -Wifi range. I don't particularly like having another hub, but it is a necessary evil and the connection between the cameras reaches places my normal WiFi couldn't come close to (until I bought a Google OnHub). -Android app. I have heard the iPhone app is more reliable, but the Android app is still pretty good. Functionally it is well done, I just notice that it has glitches while using it. -Website. LIVE VIEW STILL USES FLASH! This should be #1,2, and 3. No one should be using Flash for anything, especially not for a live camera into what could be private areas of your home. To clarify, if you want to view recorded video, you don't need flash, but if you want to view live view of your camera you HAVE to use Flash. And if you didn't know; Flash is terrible, insecure, and so bad the company who made it recommends not using it anymore...It is a big enough problem that I would suggest not buying this product at all if you need to use the website to view live video. -Dynamic range. This is basically the cameras' ability to handle varying light conditions, like what happens when the sun shines right into the lens and the camera has to adjust so that it doesn't go blind. This camera handles it very well, but don't expect anything on the level of the Pixel phone. Some spots will be blown out, but the video is still useful. -Cloud storage. 7-days free cloud storage AND unlimited local storage is so awesome it easily trumps all other competitors by itself. In fact, due to this there really isn't a good second choice. This is definitely #1 and everything else is a very distant second, including the non-pro version of the Arlo base station. This has gotten out of hand, so let me summarize. This is the best, by far, so .buy it unless you NEED to use the website, as opposed to the app, for live video.",Arlo Pro is the way to go!

I'm glad I finally decided to give it a go.  I've had it for about a week and so far I have had no issues.  The setup was super easy.  It does not do continuous monitoring but rather it saves clips after a triggering event (motion and/or sound).  Continuous monitoring would be better but it's not how this model was designed to work.  Maybe in a future update?  I haven't had it long enough to experience the ""end of recorded clip"" issue but I do hope they have a fix for it.  It would be a shame to miss recording part of an important event.

It’s hard to believe they can cram so much tech into such small, weather-proof devices. The video and audio playback is amazing. I can’t believe the sound these things pick up. You can totally customize your system for the different times of day or different circumstances. I’ve had this system about a year and have just recently charged the cameras for the second time so the battery life is amazing. We use this system several times a day so it is not the type of thing you get bored with and stop using after a while. In fact, we just now after a year added an additional camera. The setup is quick and easy. I can find out whether packages were delivered to the front porch, or see if I left the garage door open. Best of all, I now know whether the mother in law is visiting by looking at the driveway cam and can quick text my wife,  “I’m going to be home Home late tonight Hun!” Disaster averted. The interface is great, and can easily be used by the kids. It's really great to be able to control the whole system from your cell at anytime.I also love how you don’t need to pay a monthly fee for security and they provide cloud storage free of charge.

(Note: All run well off of the original base station.) I love this system because it just works. No sunscription needed, easy to pair and set up and the image quality and alerts are good quality and reliable. Battery life for me has been strong, running several months for the original cams and looks like the Pros are on the same path. I view live video a few times a day and generally have a handful of motion alerts, so I would consider this average use. Mine have held up well in rain and snow, hot and very cold temps without issue. Only gripes: Takes 10-15 seconds before live video appears from when you open the appp; there is a lag between when motion is detected and video is recorded, so you miss a wider shot sometimes of what triggered the alert (you can turn up motion sensitivity but then get a lot of false alerts); and the range of the base station could be a bit better.

Lately it seems I have to return everything I order.  Most of the reviews of this are 4.5 stars.  In the two days before it came I read many negative reviews of this camera.  I opened it and the camera looks to be fragile and held by a magnet.  Then you have to pay for cloud storage every month.  This system for its high price is false advertising.  It is nothing more than an expensive baby camera.  I’m going to pay the big bucks and have a professional system installed.  If I would have to buy three more of these cameras at 179$ apiece added to the total cost would only be 300$ less then my installed system.  Also will not have monthly fees.,To Good to be True

When we were about to settle for one of those... we found Arlo! This baby can do it all!! The alarm! It is so darn loud!!! We would scare anyone that comes into our home unwanted. The mic is great!

After talking with customer service and trying a few things, we finally got the camera to update, but only after several tries and logging in and out of the phone app. After that, the camera is worked very well, but the battery life was much shorter than I anticipated. I'm guessing that the 6 months advertised battery life is only if the camera is activated occasionally, not always on. Although I was a little frustrated with the updating problem that I had (I was really excited to get it working right away), once that was fixed I felt that the camera worked very well, and minus the updating problem, was exactly what was advertised.

The batteries last a long time, the motion sensing is spot on, the push/email notifications are great. The only real downside to this system is the Android app (I don't have an IOS device so I can't review based on that - sorry) Sometimes it's a bit buggy. Sometimes it takes a long time to get the status of your devices (even when you have a good internet connection), sometimes (rarely) it asks you to scan your fingerprint more than once and then bugs out (though, I absolutely love the fact that it has fingerprint support - I think any developer who implements this is awesome), and (always) talking through the Android app out the camera speaker is so soft I didn't even think it worked at first (but I didn't buy it for this, it would just be cooler if it worked). Overall, I think the system is great. The bad points seem numerous because I didn't really go into the good points, but there's definitely more pros than cons.","Great camera system, Android app could use improvement"

Imagine my uneasiness about leaving my house vacant for a week. Amazon and Arlo came to the rescue. Amazon got the product to me amazingly in less than 18 hours. The ease of the wireless system allowed me to set up multiple exterior cameras around the house, just hours before departure for vacation. While hundreds of miles from home, I was able to check on the house anytime through the day and night. Without the Arlo system I would not have had the peace of mind to enjoy my wonderful vacation with my awesome fiancee'!",Amazon and Arlo To the Rescue!!!

Jozefowicz,"Great product! A tech product that enables the user with few complications. Crazy simple to setup. Criticisms: Would like a fresh snapshot from each cam when initially opening app. Would like the text alert to contain a snapshot of movement just to see if i need to start fiddling with my phone. Would like to be able to toggle text/email notifications when movement/sound is detected. I.e., if expecting amazon delivery, need an alert sent for the front door occasionally but would always like to have a backlog of recordings. Modifying some settings can be a little wonky at times. Would like to be able to create deadzones in the camera to completely disregard any movement. A camera 6 feet from a walking cat will always send an alert no matter the sensitivity.  I had to get creative with cam positioning. Grant access function is great but if you give it to your housekeeper, she can use the app to look inside your home at any time. This is a problem. Until it is fixed, simply have a visitor call you to disarm home. Overall a great product and i would suggest to most people that would like a home security solution. Gives me total peace of mind when i am away and despite some issues that you can correct for it is in my opinion the best single solution to home security. This product also works great with some battery powered water leak detection devices that have an audible alarm. The cameras will pick up the sounds and i get an alert on my phone immediately! Would like in future versions the ability of the device to alert the user if the garage door is open (for example). Possibly without even a sensor, just alert user if the user leaves the geofencing area without a particular zone looking a certain way.",Awesome product! Covers all bases.

I typically get about 4 months of use out of mine before I need to recharge them.I set mine up between my windows and the window screens. I did so because I didn't want to hard mount them to a surface, which would leave holes. I also didn't want someone to potentially steal them from the outer surface of my home.They do a good job catching motion during the day time, but there performance is poor at night. I believe that the IR sensor reflects off of the screen, and never takes pictures at night. This would probably also happen behind window glass. Overall, not a bad camera.

I only needed a camera to monitor the front door of my house as there as been questionable criminal activity occurring in our neighborhood. It has only been a week since I installed it but already I have been able to speak to someone coming to the front door through my smart phone while I was actually at work. I allowed myself 4 hours to set the system up but was very surprised that the process was easier than anticipated and just 20 minutes later I had everything setup. I am already thinking about expanding the system to the back of the house and inside the house. Overall I am extremely pleased with ARLO.,It has only been a week since I installed it but already I have been able to speak to someone coming to the front door through m

While I have had it less than a month and am still learning how to use the system so far I am completely satisfied. Extremely easy to set up. The price is a little high that's why 4 stars instead of 5. I did opt for the Arlo Pro which is more if you want to send less the regular Arlo I think is a good deal although I don't know how well the camera picture quality is and battery life is another issue since the pro has rechargeable batteries.. One feature I wish the system had is a temperature alarm. I have seen other home security systems that monitor the temperature in the room and send an alert when the temp falls below a certain preset level. This alerts you that your heat is not working and saves you from having frozen pipes in the winter.,A great system

My main concerns were mounting and remote live viewing. Mounting was generally pretty painless, but the mount simply hangs on a single nail. If the camera is placed perpendicular to the wall, it works fine. But I needed to mount it in a corner so it would need to be about 45 degrees from the wall and pointing downwards. If the mount is not perfectly in the corner with the mount right up next to the other wall, the entire mount will swing and you probably won't get the right angle. I had to remount it to get this right. Remote live viewing works very well, even in the dark. Starting the app and going into live view takes quite a while though - maybe around 15-20 seconds. In an unexpected situation, it might seem quite long if you want to immediately know what's going on.",Great camera

If someone walks by the camera in less than 2 seconds you miss them completely.  My main reason for the low score was i bought another unit for our vacation home in the mountains  (yes another $450 )  Even if you buy another base station and separate system they want you to upgrade for an additional $100 per year to see the other house!  this is crazy.  If my wife (or anyone else) signed up for another account it would be free.  Why would you penalize anyone for buying more of your product?  I could see it if i was buying more cameras for the same house/base station.  so if you never want to add another system to another location then i would buy it.  if you more than one  I would find another provider..,Only purchase if you have one location

The camera quality definitely lack, there is no consistency with the motion detection. The alarm is on the base unit indoors which does no good for an outdoor mounted camera. Night vision? I don't think the manufacture reallyknows what that is. They claim the battery should last anywhere from 4-6 months on a charge. I'm just a little over a month into it and battery is already down to about 30% and that is with the camera only running about 10 hours or less per day.

I finally broke down and called tech support.  What a waste of my time.  They could not fix the problem. I ended up returning and exchanging thinking I got a defective camera.  The 2nd camera had the exact same problem. Once again after trouble shooting and calling tech support, they finally informed me that the IOS11.3 does not work with their camera and that their engineers were working on it.  They informed me that they would contact me with a solution.  The next email I received from them was that they were closing my case...WHAT? That made no sense to me.  I informed them that their product advertises push to talk but they do not have a solution to this feature which is not working.  This is false advertising.  I will be returning this product.

Without home security we felt like we were flying in the dark with blinders on. The Arlo by netgear works seemlessly with our netgear router and has really great range. It still picks up a signal all the way across a two story home to outside front door. I passed on using the magnet mount and instead went with the other screw in mount that can be mounted above front door. I used ladder and mounted it high enough that would be bad guys couldn't remove it. The picture quality isn't grainy and looks crystal clear. Even at night works well. It does pick up all movement in front of camera field of sight so be prepared for lots of 10 sec recordings. I did change settings to 15 sec because I wanted a bit longer record time. I also went with the pro account for $10 a month because it offered more. I'm already planning on getting 1-2 more cameras around home. Thank you Netgear for making a quality product that everyone can operate and control. The only downside (which isn't that big a deal) is that I have to take ladder outside and remove camera from mount when I need to charge it monthly. I'm thinking I might plug in charge cable and use extension cord to charge without removing from mount. Not sure if that is recommended though. Anyway, I just love this product",Quality product from Netgear and worth the money

One of the Pro Camera (VMC4030) and One of the HD Cameras (VMC3030) with the Pro Base station. They were very simple to sync and setup. I did read some concerns over the battery life and I thought that might be an issue here in Minnesota. But the battery have not been an issue. In a week, they have only used 1% of their battery and the temperature is -4 f. I also like the ability to have a hard drive attached for the videos to save to. Overall, I would recommend the Arol cameras/system to anyone looking for a wireless option on security cameras.  They have been working great thus far. Update - I has now been 9 months of using the Arlo Pro system. I really love the Pro cameras. They definitely catch more activity then the Arlo HD's. As the rechargeable batteries last for months. Great system to provide peach of mind at a reasonable price.",Great System

The minor complaint: I'm not crazy about the limited options for mounts or at least that the after-market mounts all have bad reviews. The major complaints: A) The volume of the audio-out is minuscule. Hardly more than a whisper most of the time. We have decent connectivity. The audio-in is fantastic. The picture is pretty darn good even on the mid-range setting. But that audio-out is hardly the frightening voice of God I'd hoped for if I need to deter a prowler. B) I contacted the company after realizing there was a dead pixel on one of the cameras. They gave me so much grief, making excuse after excuse. I get they have to triage issues before they just up and replace a camera, but when increasing the camera's resolution (their recommendation to get rid of it) makes the pixel more pronounced, and bringing the camera closer to the base station doesn't improve it. It was one thing after the next... do this, do that. It wasn't enough that I had demonstrated over and over and over again that the pixel was steadily dead no matter the relationship it had to the base station and the internet speed they even wanted a comparison of the two cameras side by side near the base station. They finally sent an RMA for return after weeks of multiple emails and online chats with tech support.",Not bad.
