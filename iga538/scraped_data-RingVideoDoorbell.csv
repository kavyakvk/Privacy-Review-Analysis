"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jun 2020,Dajaab,"I don't understand why so much bad reviews ? I received this cam today, already installed at my front door, connected with Ring app... It was so easy ! Picture is clear, 1080HD, wired with my previous bell switch, no worries about the battery... Set up with Ring app takes 10 seconds, same for Alexa, same with my Fridge Samsung Family hub... again, so easy Only one thing matters, a good WiFi. It's the key !  I use 3 Eero pro so I have a strong Wifi everywhere inside and outside of my home but you can also use the Ring Chime pro, less expensive then Eero. It works well, I confirm and I was not paid for this review.",Very happy with this $100 door bell
"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jun 2020,User,"I had the original Ring Doorbell for about a year and really enjoyed it. It was cheap but lower quality video resolution. It was fine for the time I had it. When the same thing with improved video was being released, I jumped on it. I received it today and got it installed. The video quality is night and day as shown in the photos and much better than the 1st generation. Good work ring. Unfortunately, the installation and mounting sucks compared to the 1st generation. Why they did this, I have no clue but here are the issues. 1. The mounting plate on the first generation has connections for the wiring. This made it very easy to remove the device and charge, especially in the winter months where we live and the batteries lose charge. 2nd generation has a mounting plate and the wiring on the back of the unit, which was a pain especially when the existing wire is not very long. This will be a nightmare having to remove this and recharge compared to the 1st generation. I had no issues with the 1st generation. This is a failure for Ring in my opinion. I am debating about keeping my 1st  generation instead of this now. 2. The mounting of the device to the frame also sucks. The 1st literally had no gaps and was secure in my opinion. It had guides that made the doorbell align to the mount. The 2nd generation does not and there are gaps all the way around and loose. I mounted it no differently than before, in fact the holes for 1st and 2nd generation are identical which is a plus, but again I see this mounting as a failure for Ring. I literally just installed this, and outside of the perfect video, I can’t attest to motion and nightvision yet. I am disappointed in the execution of mounting the device. I have no idea why this changed this from the 1st generation but this was a bad move in my opinion. I still have no idea why these require a battery they never stay charged when connected to wiring, but I assume this unit will have the same issue for me as well come winter. They really need to rethink the whole battery idea and have a hardwired version and battery version or fix the way these thing function when power is applied. At this point I may deal with it and hope Ring fixes these mounting and wiring flaws. If this mounted the same way as the 1st generation, I would not be writing a review because I had no issues with the device other than the battery and that wasn’t enough for me to write a review. Excellent otherwise but seriously why did you change the way these mount? ***Update 6/6/2020*** So I decided to keep it primarily because I had already offered to sell my 1st generation to a neighbor, but I did end up having to make some changes. Ultimately I bought some spade terminals and soldered them to my doorbell wire with heat shrink tubing (Ring provided in older versions, but not this one for some reason). While it was easy for me, it won’t be for others. Overall I am still upset over this mounting as it is extremely poor execution when the previous version was perfect. I guess this is Rings way to get the price down to $99 by cutting corners. The doorbell it self seems quality but mounting just plain sucks. I have no other words for it. You can see my updated photos of what I did. There are two photos that show the camera quality difference. The low quality image is from a generation 1 ring and the better quality HD is from the generation 2 ring. Night vision appears to be decent and motion the jury is still out because of the People only filter. I am still trying to tweak it. I am still leaving only 3 stars because of the mounting issues and there is still a gap between the mounting plate and the doorbell. Maybe Ring will fix and send everyone a new mount, but that is wishful thinking.","Better video quality, poor installation and mounting (Updated 6/6/2020)"
"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jun 2020,sean branstetter,Returning this device after waiting over a month for it and now I’m mad. The way it comes you can’t even install on vinyl siding because there is no bracket to hold it off the uneven surface. Then they moved the wiring bolts to the back of the device itself so if you have shorter wires it’s impossible to connect. I’ve seen the first gen ring doorbell and they changed everything about it. Why make a product that you can’t mount and not include the right mounting brackets that’s stupid.,Mounting on vinyl is impossible

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jun 2020,Christopher,"Image in product listing is of matte/solid color (I already own one of these in Venetian Bronze, and it looks like the product image here). The device I received has a texture to it and the finish has a faux-sandblasted quality to it with antique copper faux highlights mimicking lighting effects (I suppose) which does not match the image in the product description or the image on the box itself. It is NOT unattractive, all I am saying is it doesn't look anything at all like the image (originally) posted to this product listing or the image on the box, both of which depict a  smooth and consistent matte gray. I also did not realize Ring 2nd Gen is NOT the Ring 2, which has been consistently referred to everywhere as the 2nd generation of the Ring doorbell, just as most people are referring to the Ring 3 as the third generation. The branding is terribly confusing and I think Amazon should brace for a LOT of returns from customers who presume, as I did, that I was ordering an update of Ring 2 and will be disappointed to discover the battery is not swappable inf R2G. That’s not why I sent it back, I sent it back b/c it was hideous (individual tastes will vary of course). A much better name for the device would be “Ring 1 (Second Generation)”. That’s MUCH clearer.

Overall, the performance is very poor compared to other ring devices. I use the ring security system and monitoring inside of my home, and figured adding the doorbell would be a good addition based on my success with their other products. However, the doorbell all around is ineffective and an embarrassment to the company. Installing and setting up with the instructions is pretty straight forward. It took three separate attempts to connect to my phone and app before it finally did though. The picture quality is good for both day and night. The doorbell DOES NOT pick up on most motion though. It DOES NOT even pick up my mail carrier putting mail into my mailbox, which is directly next to the doorbell on my porch. Not only does it not register motion, but it sends NO notifications to my phone. I've tried reconnecting the doorbell to my app and wifi, tried downloading the ring app again, changed settings in my phone, done everything I can think of but still cant get it to work. Overall - the doorbell doesnt register motion, doesn't record motion, and doesnt give notifications. SO IT IS USELESS.",USELESS - doesnt record motion or give notifications.

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2020,Rick grimes,Update..... After writing this review I was contacted by Max of the ring team. He has bent over backwards helping me solve the problem. Customer service is amazing. I would give 5 stars for that. I will update again if problem is solved. I am not impressed with this product. I have a porch connected to the front door. I installed the ring doorbell and the only time I see someone come is when they are right at the door or the first step. And most of the time I can see them leaving. It was recommended that I buy the wedge and that did not do anything as well. I tried multiple points on where to install it and different heights. Finally I found the height that I wanted because I was able to see on my lawn if someone came. I kept testing it for hours.but the next day I went right back to only getting it if someone was right on my step. I wanted more than that I wanted to see people deliver my packages. I don't want them right at my door I want a heads-up. This will help if you want to catch someone if they go right to the door but if you want to see them coming forget about it.,Good only of you want to see someone right at the door

This unit does not utilize the same instructions as the original unit. Videos implied that I could expect the unit to be shipped with a mounting wedge, mounting screws, screw driver, wire extensions and a diode.  This unit did not come with the mounting wedge, wire extensions or diode.  I needed to mount the doorbell on an angle so ordered a separate mounting wedge  I managed to wire the unit with the existing wiring,but installion would have been easier if extensions were available. Apparently the diode is not required with this unit since the written instructions do not mention it. Bottom line, the unit was easy to install and set up.

Motion detection is worthless.  I get notifications but by the time I can log on whatever the motion was is long gone.  Look at the recording--no good either nothing there.  I am certainly NOT going to pay $3 per month in perpetuity for this (almost) useless device. I DO NOT recommend. Wanted to like more obviously.  The reaction time is so long that without paying $3 per month there is no way to ever see what caused the motion alarm.  I don't really want to pay forever.  Wish I hadn't purchased it to replace a cheap camera that recorded and saved video for free.  Camera is fairly good just as a camera.  Also they start three free trial when they ship or when it arrives but not when it's first installed so I missed out a week or so.",Meh

I thought it was optional, but you aren't able to see the video recordings without the plan. Maybe I missed it, but it seems like once you buy the product you're forced to pay additional for the subscription. Again, not like my Arlo cameras; the videos are just emailed to me - no need for cloud storage. Orig Review: So regretting buying this. I use Arlo cameras and thought the Ring doorbell would give me another level of security, but it was a huge regret. First the motion is off, I've watched the YouTube videos and instructional videos to fix it, but I only get people walking away. The angle shows directly in front and then the entire skyline, not my porch and packages below. I've read there's some angle device I can buy to add-on, but why bother when it doesn't hold a wifi signal. I even moved my wifi extender near the front door, but whenever I go for live view it's processing... so frustrating! Everything is so delayed that it's pointless to have honestly. The night view is so dark that I don't even try to look when the alerts go off at night. I just roll over in bed and pray no one is breaking in because Ring won't show me anything useful and I have my porch light on. I have my Ring hardwired, but it still loses battery frequently, even when I decreased my motion settings. I feel like it was a waste of time, effort and money. Very disappointed and I know they can do better.",Does Not Live Up to the Hype

Set up is easy, install is easy. If you are wiring into an existing doorbell connection, yes the old doorbell wires keep the battery charged and keep it running. You only have to do the initial install charge. Took a while to tinker with the motion detection sensitivity and notifications, but they work well.

Let start with the positive things: the picture quality is very good, even night time. The set up is very straightforward and the installation very easy. Not so good: the motion detector is not very reliable. Sometimes works, sometimes don't. Has a delay of about 10 seconds to advise you of the motion. The other day a guy from Amazon was delivering a package and when I receive the motion notification he was already in the truck and record him get in the truck and leaving. What the heck!!! what is the point of the camera if I can't see the person's face!!! Also the app saying that doorbell has a poor connection to my wifi. I don't know why. I first connect to my router and when I see the bad signal I changed to my extender that is literally 5 feet from the doorbell. All my other devices works perfectly and have a great connection with extender, except the doorbell. Contact ring and they said I should buy the ring chime pro wifi extender.

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2020,New Mrs JR,"Bought this to replace our older version. The frame is wider but it definitely is not an upgrade as far as motion detection. Sometimes I get a notification but nothing is in the frame. Other notifications I get is from when the person is already walking away, or them actually already ringing the doorbell. It hardly ever picks up people walking up to the door or even standing on the porch. Might as well not have it cuz it won’t catch anything anyway. Edited to add: apparently (from what we were told, did not get to try it out) it works better if it’s set up at an angle. We had it on top of our doorbell which is directly next to the door and not angled.

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,Cindy,"This really grinds my gears. The product design on this new ""improved"" version of the original ring doorbell is so baffling to me. While the set up was easy, I don't understand why they would change the wall plate set up. I had my original doorbell hard wired to my existing doorbell. I did not want to worry about charging it. That said, my wifi connection tends to go offline quite a lot, thanks to Comcast, who happens to be the only internet service provider in my area. And, many times I  have to remove the door bell to reset the network setting, which is something I should not have to do if Ring did not require it in their software design. Now with the new ""improved"" design, I can't just remove the doorbell, I have to unwire it as well. The existing doorbell wires are small and can only take so many rounds of maneuvering the wire before they wear out and break. Geese Ring, WTH, at lease with the old design I did not have to tinker with wires to reset the network after an internet outage or something. 🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬.  If you wanted to improve the camera, did you really need to change the wall plate. Did you really need to change the way this thing physically connects to the building in order to get a better camera resolution. 🤬 I didn't have to drill any new holes, you got that part right. ***************************************************************************************************************** 10/3/2020 Just wanted to pop back on to review exactly what I already knew would happen. After a power outage for 5 days due to hurricane Laura, I had to reconnect my ring doorbell to wifi and go through all the set up steps again like new. First off, I have the original ring door bell that was redesigned and included updated features. Problem #1 I had to remove the door bell, press the orange button. What's wrong with that? I have my doorbell hard wired to my home to use my in home chime. The new design has the screws connected to the back of the doorbell. The old design had the screws for connecting to your home wires, to allow constant charging, connected to the wall plate. That was a design that Ring developers should have left alone. It was soooooo awkward and tedious trying to line the home wiring up with those tiny screws and a nut case job of trying to screw it all back together. If your home wires are short, good luck trying to pull this off. If you are the kind of person who likes to pop off a few cuss words at home projects that should be simple but turn out to be a frustrating time drain, this is not the doorbell for you. Why does making updates have to mean screw up the  parts that work. While I appreciate the 1080p video quality, I never had to bother the home wires on the old wall plate or the screws connecting my home doorbell wires. What a stupid, stupid idea. If I sound pissed I'm. I got it all connected, but it's totally coo coo crazy to have to go through in the first place. What a sick design!!! I could go on .. but seriously Ring what a crappy design.",Product design is flawed - This is on an upgrade to the original Ring doorbell.

We bought this because of recent activity in our neighborhood. I have to say that the motion detection on it is amazing. I had to adjust the motion ranges though because it kept picking up when our neighbor (directly across the road from us!) would open her door! I wouldn't be able to tell what ""motion"" it was picking up on at first, but when I zoomed in, I realized it detected motion THAT far away and had to reset the motion settings. I love the ""people only"" option that it has and it allows me to focus on what is truly important instead of having alerts every time a dog or cat runs across our yard.

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2020,Matthew Vosburgh,"I've got an original Ring 1 and a Ring 2, installed at different homes without trouble. My Ring 1 after some years was becoming unreliable and going offline so I ordered this ""2020 version"" Ring to replace it, actually thinking it was a Ring 2 on sale (the Amazon description was very vague).  It is in fact the 2nd generation of the Ring 1. It has a different mounting plate,  a fixed battery instead of a swappable one, is wired in differently etc. It's quite different from the gen 1 even though it looks very similar from the front. I open the box and see that the product is covered in warnings not to use the long screws supplied to attach the doorbell to the mounting plate, you must use the short security screws for that. Apparently some people have used the supplied long screws in the wrong holes, and pierced the internal battery, which is dangerous. Well that seems like bad design in the first place, not a problem you patch with warning stickers. I start the install. First problem is I can't remove my old Ring 1, as the special screws on the Ring 1 gen 2 are different, as is the supplied screwdriver. I call tech support and they tell me I need a TORX 6 screwdriver. A week later I come back to the house with a T6 and remove the old bell. Fitting the gen 2 is much more awkward than a gen 1 because it requires much greater length of free doorbell wire than the original, because you have to connect the wire to the doorbell itself, not to the mounting plate. This also makes it hard to take the gen 2 doorbell on and off, e.g. to charge the battery. I go and buy wire, connection screws, electrical tape, to extend the doorbell wiring. I wire up the doorbell.  Now it is hard to get it into place on its bracket because the required  loose wire behind it gets in the way, unlike the gen 1. Eventually I get the bell in place, press the button. It rings the elecronic chime, and notifies my phone but it does not ring the physical doorbell, which my Ring 1 and 2 both do. I check the connections but it still won't actually ring the physical doorbell, like every other Ring does. That's the last straw, I take the gen 2 off the wall to return it, remove its bracket, re-install the original Ring 1, which I think just needed a good charge on USB anyway. I tried to return the Ring gen 2, but I am past the return window. Well if I'm stuck with this cheap nasty version of what was once a good product, Amazon is stuck with this review.",Lower quality than other Ring doorbells

Very easy install wired right in where my existing doorbell button was, I had to extend the wires Slightly but it was no big deal at all as I already had everything I needed to do it on hand.  The packaging did indicate but there were provided wire extenders but there was not, but thats definitely not a big deal considering you can even install it wirelesslyand just recharge it periodically.  As I said we already had a wired doorbell but if you do not it can be used with the battery and echo dots work well as chimes, So if you already have a dot and no wired doorbell you don't necessarily have to buy a chime to go with it, we use it so we can hear it in the laundry room or when I'm in the garage.

First, he said I needed the New Ring Chime which is also a WiFi extender, since the improved video needs a stronger signal. Max sent me a complementary Chime and it did improve the WiFi range. I still did not like the way the motion zones were set up, but just recently it was apparently upgraded, because I can now adjust the zones where I want them (last photo)! It does  still pick up on large vehicles, but not very much. I’m very happy with it now and I appreciate Ring listening to its customers! I changed my review from 2 to 4 stars ⭐️ INITIAL REVIEW- (I purchased the original Ring doorbell a few months ago, was the 720p, it was satisfactory in the way it worked, but when I noticed I got one of the last 720p (that was discontinued shortly afterwards) and the 1080p was now the same price, Amazon let me return it and get the gen 2. Unfortunately, the picture is the only thing that’s better! The first one worked with my WiFi, this one keeps telling me it’s a very poor connection (doorbell, router, EVERYTHING is in the same place). So it doesn’t always pick up any motion. But it DOES pick up almost every car that goes by, no matter how I set it! The old one has a much easier way to set the motion zones- this one only shows 4 zones, on or off (second photo).That’s it. The gen 1 let you slide your zones in or out with your finger. When I watch the tutorial, it shows the more detailed motion settings (first photo)but I don’t have that. I’m sorry I ever got the new one- it’s essentially useless.)",Edited since initially reviewed

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Sep 2020,Christian in Florida,"UPDATE: The problem I mentioned below that earned this ring doorbell one star has been completely rectified. I have to say that ring customer support was the absolute best. They helped me troubleshoot my phone without making me feel like an idiot and ultimately determined that the problem had already been fixed through an update that was automatically downloaded to my phone only a few days after I left a negative review. Needless to say, my ring doorbell is working perfectly. The ring doorbell gets five stars and yes, I recommend it and would buy one again. Thank you Ring! Pros: good video, wide field of view, good motion sensing and detection Cons: known problems with Galaxy S10, possibly some other Samsung products, makes the sound on this doorbell unusable. First, let me say this is not my first ring video doorbell. I've had the ring doorbell in the past and it has worked flawlessly. Video has always been good and the sound, even the two-way communication, has always been good as well. However, this time, there was a problem. it seems after the doorbell was installed and everything was set up to include the app, when someone would ring the doorbell, I would not be able to hear them through the app on my Samsung Galaxy s10. They could hear me fine but I just could not hear them and therefore could not communicate. I spent a great amount of time researching this on the internet and apparently there's an issue between the ring doorbell and the Samsung Galaxy phone and apparently Samsung thinks ring should fix it and ring thinks Samsung should fix it. And where does that leave the customer? You guessed it, stuck in the middle. I attempted to fix that I found on the internet with adjusting settings in the Ring app as well as reinstalling ring. No luck whatsoever. If I ever get another video doorbell, I will check out all the others on the market. There are quite a few and several are actually rated higher than the ring video doorbell. As for me, I guess I will just use this one the way it sits and maybe one day when a different brand of video doorbell goes on sale, I will replace this. It's too bad. I kind of feel like I wasted my money.",It's working perfectly!

At night, the image is good, too. I do have night lights out there, too.  Set up was easy and the app seems to work well. The problem...motion detection.  I live in Florida, so everything is flat, there isn’t an issue with sight line, but I can walk by the doorbell, up to the doorbell and after standing in front of it for about 10 seconds it will notice me. It will notice the delivery people about the time they are getting back to their truck.  I have gone into the app and the settings repeatedly and can’t get it any better. ************UPDATE************* Ring read my initial review (above) and contacted me to help me out.  IMPRESSIVE!!  Let me share some of the things I learned about the settings.  The setting capturing frequency- if it’s set to conserve battery life, it will only capture motion around every 10-15 minutes regardless of being in front of the door.  It will of course be responsive to a ring.  I changed that setting to ‘frequent’ and what a difference!  It uses battery life faster, but it captures all motion. But then I was getting captures from every car going by, even though the street is about 60 feet away, so Ring sent a wedge so I could angle it down a little (Florida being so flat, there is little visual distinction for the camera). So, thank you Max, from RING, for being so helpful. I can’t say enough about customer service!  And I really, REALLY, like my Ring Doorbell now!  So much so that I am going to get my Mom one for a gift!  I might get one for the side door, too. ******another update**** I take responsibility for not understanding the service plan- but..... I’m shocked at how scaled back the doorbell is without the monthly subscription plan!  The description stated “subscription needed for advance functions...(sic) like share and save for 60 days”. So I thought- I have no desire to share videos and don’t need to save video beyond a few hours if anything comes up while I’m at work.  Well, I was wrong! You get bubkis. You still get notified if the video is triggered, but by the time the app boots up the person is long gone. You have the ability to look through the camera live, and if someone rings the doorbell if you answer it that moment, you can see them and speak with them.  But no reviewing the video, not even one minute.  I feel I already paid a lot for the doorbell, that paying every month is prohibitive for me.  I will likely move this elsewhere in my home, maybe somewhere I can check in on the dogs, and get a doorbell that has an SD card.  I love the concept of the video doorbell, but will find a different option for me and my mom.",Not so great-at first- but Ring helped

There are a couple of things I don't care for, like how the mounting plate is configured differently than the original and if you hardwire it, it has to be wired directly to the doorbell instead of the plate.  The problem this creates is when you screw the hardwired electrical wires you are forced to pull extra out and then when you mount it there's no place for them to go.  The other thing that I find frustrating is unlike in the original you cannot control the distance for the motion zones.  I have the original and this one on the original I can physically adjust the zones well viewing the live view, on this version you just get an option to enable or disable zones from a live view and then a basic screen to ""adjust the slider so your motion zones avoid the street"" but it doesn't show you how far the zones go out you just have to guess.","Great video, wish it had some of the same features of the original."

The floodlight cam and generally their customer service is very good. This doorbell is not because it doesn’t detect motion or runs out of battery, even when hardwired. Explained: Although mine is hardwired, it runs out of battery when I set the motion frequency to high, which I had to do because standard mode has a rule where when it detects and records, it will not do so again for some period of time. The practical implication of leaving it on standard mode was that at least twice, it did not detect someone right in front of the door. Probably happened a lot more but I happened to see those two instances. If I want to solve this problem, I set the frequency to high...but then it runs out of batteries. So no, I wouldn’t buy this again and would not recommend to anyone. Maybe their newer models don’t have this flaw... Update: I changed my motion frequency to light (least battery intensive mode).

I bought 3 of the 2020 updated 1080p HD doorbells because I heard nothing but good word of mouth reviews. Money wasted and can’t return now. First off motion detection worked great for the first week then all of sudden I’m getting missing footage and motion detection stopped. Not on one but ALL 3. You have to be right up on the doorbell now for it to trigger. All 3 have the latest firmware update since it makes you update when you first set them up. I’ve tried resetting the motion zones and adjusting settings, and rebooting the WiFi and modem and nothing.  Still issues. Only thing I haven’t tried yet is resetting the entire unit again but I shouldn’t have to do that with all 3 of them like this.

Silver,"1st of all, this was my 3rd Ring purchase.  I have been happy with the previous devices and thought they were a great value, so I decided to expand my security to the back door and buy another Ring device.  This one (an 'all-new', 'improved' 2nd generation) is very different. I could not get the mounting plate off, and re-read all the little pamphlets that came with it 3 times to find out how.  There are NO instructions to remove the mounting bracket!  Not wanting to damage the device by doing it wrong, I went online, and, after searching Youtube and other websites, found out how to remove the mounting bracket (it's simple, but RING NEEDS TO INCLUDE THAT INFO with the device!). Then, I got the bracket hung outside and went to setup my device.  Remember, I already have 2 other Ring devices.  I went to my Ring app on my Android phone, and could not find 'set up a new device' like the instructions said.  After searching, I found the set up and made more than a dozen attempts to set up this new device.  FINALLY, after much frustration, it completed the setup.  (hint: don't use the stupid scan thing on the back of the Ring; instead type in the 5 number code!). After setting it up, I took it out and installed it on the bracket (the ONLY easy step in this process!). Then I pushed the Ring button to test it, heard the 'doorbell' ring, but got nothing on my phone. The phone said 'failed to connect, and had a blue reconnect button.  Since then, and after much searching on the internet, I have tried to 'activate' or 'reconnect' the device more times that I have counted, and still nothing!  My conclusion: this new gen 2 device is a piece of crap.  My only hope at this time is if amazon will replace it, or refund my (Amazon day) sale price.  If only Ring could be made to reimburse me for my time: I started before noon and it is now 4:30 PM!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and money on this useless device.",Instructions are lacking!

The representative was very professional, polite and knowledgeable. He was able to address most of my issues, which I will address. But I want to address the connection problem first. -You should know the recommended minimum requirements, which at the time of my purchase were not listed. This would have saved me a lot of time, troubleshooting, frustration and money. It is recommended your Wi-Fi internet connection have 2 MB/s download and 2 MB/s upload speeds. The way to check is using your cell phone search the internet for an internet speed test. Go outside where you’d like to connect the Ring camera and run the test. If you do not meet the minimum requirements, you may experience similar connection problems. I have over 30 MB/s download but 1.90 MB/s upload speeds. This is the fastest speed from my provider in my area. I experienced long wait times for the camera to load, camera cutting out and connection error messages. I thought I had good internet speed because I can telework from home and stream video content with no issues, but apparently my internet is not fast enough for the camera.  Ring support kindly offered a refund. The installation process does not seem difficult, but I personally cannot install or uninstall the camera. I had to pay someone to install the camera and will likely need to pay someone to uninstall the camera. This sucks because I needed the camera for safety purposes. ISSUES RESOLVED: -The rep was knowledgeable in troubleshooting the following issues. In the Ring app setting you can select to have a live view option in the dashboard. Even better, ther is the Rapid Ring app. This app only shows your cameras with a one touch button for live view. This app is great if you miss the notification, or quickly want to see your cameras and live view. There was also less connection issues with the Rapid Ring app. -You can link and answer your Ring camera with your echo device. Uninstalling and reinstalling the twice fixed the connection problem I was experiencing. -The rep adjusted my camera’s sensitivity and other tweaks to my liking. Amazon listing the minimum requirements would have saved me a lot of trouble. I do not know why this was not listed. As mentioned, the Ring Community Support rep was excellent, and I appreciated his effort. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No problem with picture quality or night vision. Too many bugs with the camera and app. I constantly receive the activating device notice when going into live mode. I have good Internet and the camera is about 8 feet from the router so there should be no connection problems. P If I miss a notification for answering the door and have to tap into the app there are several taps  to get to live view. Why isn't there a live view button on the dashboard? Also, the Alexa skill does not work. I will get a notification on my Dot stating there's a person at the front door. When I say Alexa answer the front door it does nothing.

I now own 2 door bells, a spotlight camera and a chime. Each time I buy, it’s because I already own equipment and want to keep everything uniform, but regret each purchase. Not a single ring item I have owned has set up on the first try, I’m pretty average on tech in 2020 but it just isn’t as easy as it should be, and tech support by phone is sub par. Expect an hour of setup up time the first time as you wait on the phone, if you can get through. After you own some equipment expect an hour setup for new equipment as you update your app and  each piece of equipment., seriously, I own two properties and spent most of my time with my hand on my forehead. After your equipment is set up and working, get ready for the real let down. Imagine you are at work, you get an alert that your doorbell has been pressed, you respond to the alert, 30 seconds later after watching a wheel spin you get to view nobody there. They left, long gone, but that’s how long it takes. Furthermore, since you responded to the promp, it doesn’t start recording until you can see it live. And it takes at least 30-60 sec for it to see live. So someone has pressed your doorbell, it takes 30-60 sec for the ring doorbell to establish a connection, if they haven’t already left  already, that’s a long time waiting staring at you phone, they gave up and walked away. When you check your recorded events (at a monthly subscription price), all you get is the “live video recording” but since it took up to a minute  to connect ( if it does, many times it won’t) they have left and all you have is a recording of absolutely nothing. Also, video recording is for only 14 seconds for motion alerts. So someone comes up to your driveway or front yard and scopes out you property for a bit. Then they wreck, vandalize, steal or whatever to your property. It won’t be filmed ! Let me say that again, 14 seconds of recording that you pay for, per motion alert. And my spotlight has been connected for 2+ years, it sucks, I can rarely get a live view to work in  my own home. It suddenly disconnected from my home network, looking forward to spending an hour plus getting a previously working piece of equipment to work. Don’t do it UPDATE 7/22/20 After having this for a while, some additional observations: -hardwiring this device solves none of the issues I mentioned above, but I guess I don’t Have to remove it to charge it now. -it takes a few seconds for this to start recording in 1080. It starts recording well after someone enters the activity zone , so they are usually pretty close by the time it wakes up. For a few seconds it records at a very low resolution, somewhere around a 7 year olds sketch and recording with VHS. Expect most recordings to have low resolution when it would help identifying them, and by the time 1080 finally sets in, they have moved out of frame. -After 30 days you have to pay for recording service, the app will tell you that you need to subscribe, but will not provide a link in the app to allow you to Sign up, also you can’t sign up within the app. You have to go to the website log in and do that. Have fun searching around the app for a while, only to realize you can’t sign up for the service using the interface that you use 99.999% of the time","Noooooooooo.....then I went back and updated my review, still nooooooooo"
"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jun 2020,Lazaro,"This horrible doorbell can't seem to keep a wifi connection for more than a few hours. When I first got it it worked fine for the first couple of days but then one day I woke up and noticed that the doorbell hadn't recorded anything. I tried going in to live view and it didn't connect. So, I removed the doorbell, pressed the orange button on the back and reset its wifi connection. That worked for about another day and then the same thing happened. I didn't want to remove the doorbell again so I just unplugged my modem/router in hopes that everything would reset and the doorbell would pick up the connection again. It worked! For like half a day.... By nighttime the connection was lost again. So I went in to my wireless router settings and I looked around and noticed it did show the ring doorbell as being connected to the wifi but for some reason the live video still wouldn't transmit and I would get no motion alerts. So the doorbell is connected to the wifi but it is not transmitting. Still, I decided to log in to my router and mess around with the settings to see if that would help. I did a little research, changed the wifi channel etc. The doorbell would always reconnect and work fine but after a few hours it would stop working again. It just doesn't transmit anything despite it showing up as being connected to the wifi. Now, I will say I am no expert in wifi connections or routers or anything like that but I've tried my best to troubleshoot the problems. I stood outside with my phone right next to the doorbell and ran the internet speed test from the Ring App. With the door closed and everything. As if my phone was the actual ring doorbell. As you can see I uploaded the pictures of the results and it is sufficiently fast for the Ring to work. So the wifi signal outside does not seem to be the problem. I mean, the router is literally along the same wall running parallel to the doorbell just about 20 feet away. I do live in a Condo so maybe once in a while someone turns something on that disrupts the signal... I don't know. But still, you would expect the damn doorbell to attempt to reconnect by itself without me having to reset the router or having to unscrew my doorbell and press a button once a day. It is awful, just awful! Biggest headache ever. Plus the ring app itself isn't very helpful. When I go into ""device health"" in the app in order to get the latest up to date information about my device I first have to first connect the live view, then I have to go into ""Device Health Report"" and then finally the information displayed will refresh. I don't think the information being displayed is even accurate to be honest with you. I'm very disappointed in the Ring doorbell. I'm not even sure what the return policy is on this doorbell is but I swear if it weren't for the fact that I will be left with 4 horrible holes on the wall outside my condo unit (and I have no matching paint to cover and paint over the holes) I would have removed this doorbell and tried to return it. It's JUNK! At least my old wired doorbell chime still rings when someone presses the Ring button but this thing has turned out to be the biggest, most expensive doorbell button ever. 7/31/20 Update So, a Ring representative reached out to me a few weeks ago to try and help me fix the connection problems with my doorbell. I purchased a WiFi range extender and although it did help with the doorbell keeping a WiFi connection I still had some intermittent connection problems where some motions were missed and I couldn’t connect to Live View. Most of the connection problems seemed to happen during the weekend so I’m assuming it was caused by neighbors being home and using electronics that interfered with the WiFi signal or something like that. After explaining all this to the Ring representative they were nice enough to send me a Chime Pro which I installed in the same spot as the WiFi extender I had before. I haven’t had any more connection problems after installing the Chime Pro. It’s been about two weeks now and the RSSI level for both the Doorbell and the Chime stay at around -55 most of the time. I gotta say that Ring customer service has been excellent. They really want to keep customers happy and get their products working as intended. Still, I honestly can’t give the doorbell more than four stars because even though I got it working it did take a lot of trial and error and it does require buying extra stuff to get it working right. Plus the doorbell is not perfect since the video and audio are still choppy at times. It’s not a deal breaker for me because at least the doorbell does capture everyone that comes to my door, which is what I wanted, but it doesn’t work as smoothly as advertised. As long as you’re aware of all these issue though, I think the doorbell is a decent product. I just wish Ring were more “honest” in their advertising and showing the way the doorbell video might actually look and sound if your WiFi connection isn’t perfect. Plus they should also probably warn people that they will most likely need to buy a Chime to keep a solid WiFi connection with the doorbell. I don’t know why they don’t just sell it as a bundle doorbell/chime and that way they can avoid some of these connection problem issues.",Biggest piece of junk ever? Update.

Customer service said they were having lots of problems w the gen 2. Works okay. It starts recording way too late. The person can be out of the video by the time it starts recording. Seriously.  Delivery guy triggers it but can be gone on the video it takes. Apparently u have to buy the Ring V Dbell 3 plus. Which is 229.00 on sale. It records 4 seconds before. Why can't the thing just start recording immediately when it's triggered? It starts recording 3 or 5 seconds after it's triggered. Pretty dissatisfied & disappointed in a big co like Ring & owned by Amazon. The motion detection notifications are half the time immediately &  the other half 30 to 60 seconds after. Even had a few that were 3 to 5 minutes later. UPDATE: I took 2 stars off. The motion detection & alerts are just pitiful.,Starts recording way too long after the motion is triggered.

Martin,"The doorbell was pretty easy to install. Video quality is very good. I am extremely annoyed that it does not always alert my phone when someone rings the doorbell. I've had to go in more than once and try to figure out the settings to get it to work, and it will work for a while then it will stop giving me notifications again. It's set to notify me in all modes, and the app is set to notify me in my phone, so it's very aggravating. I may return it if this keeps up because what's the point of having the device if it doesn't notify your phone that someone is at your door? Edit: it gets worse and worse. Even when someone rings my doorbelland I get a notification that someone's at the door, I don't get a visual when I tap into ring. In fact, the video of the motion sometimes doesn't even show up until much later. Today the doorbell was rung at 5:32, I couldn't see who was there and I couldn't get to the door, and when I tried to look back at the video recording it's stopped at 5:28 and did it go any further. It's a piece of garbage.  Seriously sorry I purchased this. Update 8/25: Like others, after owning this one month it stopped giving me any notifications at all.  Still records video,but I longer notifies me that someone is at my door.",DO NOT BUY!!

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jul 2020,E. M.,"I have just upgraded my 1st generation Ring Doorbell with this new 2nd Generation Ring Doorbell. PROS: 1) The same mounting plate dimensions/holes as the 1st generation I could install it to the same 3rd party wedge mount which I got for the 1st generation saving me $20 to buy a new one. 2) Better video quality: The 1080p video is noticeably better than the 1st generation's 720p . 3) Better connectivity: The 2nd generation seems to connect better.  When I ask Alexa to display the video on Echo Show, it sometimes took forever with 1st generation.  The 2nd generation seems to connect more reliably. 4) Motion sensor: I have not tested this just yet but I am sure it is better with the new zone setting and else. CONS: 1) Trade-in discount did not apply: When I ordered it,  it asked if I wanted to trade the old one by showing ""Upgrade and save by trade-in"" right above ""Add to cart"" right on the product page.  I proceeded to take advantage of it.  My request was accepted and received email confirming $10 credit for the old one and 20% discount on the new one.  Great I thought and I went back to the product page, added the item in the cart, and proceeded to place the order.  However, I could not see the 20% discount applied to the item, while I did get the $10 credit. I ended up calling Amazon and got the courtesy credit worth the 20%, but it was just lame. Why do they ask you to trade in when it does not work for the product? 2) Lower quality mounting hardware: The 1st generation came with a quick connect so it was a little easier to connect wires if you go with hardwired installation.  However, once the installation is done, it is no issue because you never take the doorbell off unless you live in some cold area like some reviewers here and still need to remove it to charge. If that's the case, I recommend you using a connector like the one in the picture I attached.  If you just go with the battery only installation, I do not see much difference.  You remove two screws and remove the whole doorbell to charge.  Personally, I would not choose this model if I were planning without hardwired connection. Overall, I am happy with the upgrade.",Improvement over the 1st generation

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jul 2020,Paul Pierron,"Even with an exceptional WiFi setup and RSSI signal strength, and even with the device next to the router, it is so slow to send video anyone at the door would have left by the time it activates a live view. The sound from the unit to your tablet or phone is very weak and can barely be heard and the sound on the unit is super loud to the point of annoying all your neighbors.... meaning you can barely hear anyone speaking into it and anything you say is so loud it becomes distorted... even with all the settings set up correctly. Now perhaps if you have it constantly on and monitoring it would be more responsive or with motion sensing it would turn on the camera before the doorbell is actually rung, but if you are thinking of using it just for a doorbell and to monitor the video only when the doorbell rings, forget about it, you have to have it set up to sense motion and start the camera about a minute before the doorbell is pressed to get doorbell live of someone right when they are ringing the bell, which doing so would drain your battery. For a product targeting home owners, The only way for something like this to really work fast is to have it hardwired with Ethernet PoE, which i am surprise they do not offer this on all the units, it provides power to the unit and then provides potential gigabit ethernet using the ethernet cable instead of transformer wiring which you would route next to and then come up to your router. the other thing is it in not live at all, what it does is sends the video it captures to a server and then you watch that as it streams to you, which makes it a bandwidth hog - and any tech at ring, or anyone that hacks or buys their way to your privacy, and activate your camera, watch you or your saved videos, and you would not know it unless you check your router logs, but they can look at your videos at anytime and you would not know it.",So slow it is almost useless except as a basic WiFi ding-dong doorbell.

We have a door that you can’t really see who is coming at the front of the house and initially I wanted this so that I could see who is knocking or ringing the doorbell. (And this device definitely does that it alerts you when there is a visitor at your door and you can have a contactless conversation with them in real time) Sooo... also being a smart mother with teenagers I wanted some thing that would capture our teenagers movements. ( you know keep/force  them to be honest). Yes you heard me! I have kids that like to think that they are sneaky and that mom and dad do not know. Upon hooking up the ring doorbell device we have learned that we will be now purchasing two of the flood light ring devices for our back doors, as the teenagers have decided to try to sneak out the back of the house after bedtime. The ring doorbell device and it’s recording capabilities are great I’m able to see people who come up to the door as well as when kids leave for school on time… Or try to sneak out after bedtime. The real time alerts assist me in answering the door and grounding the kids properly. This is one of the best devices that we have in our home, I mean, I thought the Rumba was great because it cut down on me yelling for someone to please sweep the floor. BUT the door bell alerts me immediately when someone is coming or going. I’m very happy to say that ring has forced my teens to bond with one and other...yes I know it has become my teenagers number one enemy. Instead of being mad at each other for snitching... they are collectively mad at the ring for existing. It is literally helping us parent by teaching my teenagers a lesson instantly consequences for their actions  that I hope they take with them when they have children.

It took 4+ hours to cycle through the activation process (my first doorbell connected in under 20). I called customer service and after a painful 56 minutes,Melvin picked up. You could clearly tell he had no interest in helping me and shuffled me off the phone, telling me that the device needed to fully charge. I asked what time their offices close and he had no idea, makes me wonder what kind of customer service they would provide during normal hours. (My call was at 8:15pm eastern time) this is enough for me to consider returning the first doorbell and the 2 chimes I bought and actually picking up a reputable company. All in all the video isn't very clear and the motion alerts do not always pick up even though I have the first doorbell set at the highest sensitivity. It has a pretty long delay (around 5-7 seconds) before the alert that there is motion notifies me. Often I end up catching FedEx or UPS drivers as they are getting back into their vehicle. If you are looking for a camera that could identify a person's face if they are trespassing or stealing packages, id say this isn't the camera for you. You will get a fuzzy image and most likely it will be the back of the person due to the lag. And for those that would say its my WIFI connection - its not.

This was our first RING purchase, so I am not familiar with how it compares to other varieties or generations. We have our Ring doorbell installed beside a set of stairs, and it seems that the handrails block just enough so that the camera does not really detect until someone is RIGHT in front of it. By the time the actual video is triggered, about half of the activity is actually missed before someone goes inside the front door. Luckily, we have now connected our RING doorbell to other smart lighting at the bottom of the stairs so that when the lighting is triggered, the doorbell will also turn on. This helps to improve capture, but it also causes unnecessary battery use on occasion. At the end of the day, I'd rather use up battery but still capture more video than potentially miss something. The video quality is good and night vision satisfactory. The camera and microphone work well. We ended up connecting our RING to an after market solar panel so that it maintains battery for a longer period of time. I am very satisfied with our purchase and would definitely recommend this product in the future.","Good doorbell camera, motion detection could be slightly better."

It takes several seconds and in that time someone can have come and gone. It’s not as seen on TV where you get the chime notification and it’s instantly  on your phone for viewing. But I do find that it is a good product and a three dollar monthly fee for saving videos is very affordable,Live view after notification a bit disappointing

My understanding was that I was going to get a video doorbell that I could see who was at my door. My husband did a quick set up but after about 2.5 weeks the battery was dead.  But I did purchase the part to plug into the wall so you don’t have to constantly charge it.  When he had a few minutes he hooked it up the rest of the way.  So my problems are, since we set it up it doesn’t matter HOW we adjust the settings it goes off constantly with cars going past my house, I don’t live on a busy street per-say but busy enough to drive you batty with it going off every 3-5 minutes! So now that it’s set up correctly the battery says it won’t charge.  After 2 days now it still says it’s not charged..  BUT.. it is chiming telling me that their are cars going past.  Next problem.  The delay on this is anywhere from 5-20 seconds!  So now after the subscription trial is over with.. yes ANOTHER one of those pay me monthly schemes, it will go off, with cars, with deliveries, with neighbors who knows what BUT when you click on live it won’t open bc of something with the battery  and because of the delay And the subscription that is over with I can’t see the history, even tho it was like 30 seconds ago..  so basically this is completely useless for us!!!  Not a good purchase!!! **update**. The ring finally charged after day 4.  I do have a bit of a delay still but it will allow me to see what it is... I’m still not thrilled with having to pay monthly to be able to see the history of the videos, but it not as much as what I thought it would be... so I’m happy with the purchase now..",All’s good now...

This doorbell only lasted 5 months. I had mine hardwired in with highly restricted motion sensing. One day it quit going to live video and accepting the charge from the hard wire. In app says 0% battery. So I removed the hard wires and charged it for 6 hours via usb. This did nothing. The front ring lights up as fully charged and resets itself constantly. Upon calling customer service I was directed to charge for another 6 hours and call back. They wouldn't listen to me when I said it won't accept the charge, shows a fully charged front ring, and that it won't perform a hard reset with the orange button in the back. Obviously a faulty battery or charge sensor. When I asked to speak to another representative I was put on hold forever to the point that I hung up, a tactic to keep dissatisfaction off the reps record. There was 0 wait time to talk to the first rep. Considering that you have to pay a subscription to save videos, this product is not worth the headache and continuous price tag. Not at all imo. Poor product full of software and firmware bugs, a battery that fails in cold weather (lithium polymer), completely fails before 6 months, and with horrific customer support that has zero knowledge of their product while also seemingly lacking integrity.

I've waited almost five minutes to see if it activates and it doesn't. It's not too far from the wifi router, the wifi has sufficient bandwidth, etc. to handle the video, it just won't activate. I have to close the app and reopen it and sometimes it activates after that but sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't work when I need it to work it's a $179 decoration (because I bought the solar charger too) where our doorbell used to be. I'm very disappointed, to say the least. UPDATE: Ring sent us a Chime Pro for free to extend the signal from our wifi router since neither could be moved but this has not improved the problem at all. The specs call for the Chime doorbell to be NO MORE than 15 feet from the router but THESE SPECS ARE NOT LISTED IN ANY OBVIOUS PLACE!

You do not get a direct feed from the doorbell. The door bell uses your wifi to send the video to the ring servers then you access the feed from their  servers. You have no direct link to the ring device. If the servers are laggy then you might see the video for 10 minutes( I timed it ). This is why the device is incredibly limited without their service which they charge for. Without their service you cant see what happened 10 seconds ago much less 2 minutes. If the ring servers go down and they do the device is a brick until they get them back up and nothing is recorded during this time. Just be informed the camera feed is not sent to you directly so you cant just use your own storage to capture the camera feed. Ring gets the feed from the camera then you can access it from them and this is your only option.,Be aware of the lag

Not a problem at all. Install isnt as easy as it says it is. Everyone's homes are designed differently. The masonry bit they give you for concrete doesnt work very well. Had to use one of my bits. Then I come to find out that I have a metal bracket in the wall behind where the doorbell face plate is for my current doorbell. I cant drill it or need a professional to come do it because I cant use the screws for the 4 corners which the ring requires. My doorbell face plate has a bottom and top screw and the metal frame is what holds it there and nothing is behind that.

Unfortunately, the Ring Doorbell seems to either not have local storage, or doesn't let you access it without a $3 per month subscription. Also, when it detects motion (and it does have a not insignificant amount of false positives), it takes quite a bit for the ""video to process"" before you can access the stream, making it useless for real time monitoring.

Followings are summary of pros and cons Pros 1. Detection of who's in front of the door: This is a really good feature because I get a quick notification about who's in front of the door. I can check it because of the recording. 2. Ring Community: I notice that there is a ring community and they post alerts which helps a lot. 3. Easy installation: This was really nice and easy. I am not good with installing things like this but it was relatively easy. Cons 1. (Sometimes) Lagging - Even though I am very happy with the detection, I notice that I get a notification after about 5~10 mins later. ex) I opened the door because of notification but the notification was about me coming to house about 10 minutes ago. 2. Indoor bell doesn't work 50% of the time - I installed the ring correctly and when I press the button, chime works but it fails to work about 50% of the time.. I don't use bell but it would be nice if it works like it should. 3. False Detection - Because I trust in front of door notification, I always check to see whenever I get notice. But sometimes there is no one. However, I'm pretty satisfied with the ring and the con is minor to me. But it may be crucial to someone.. (like 50% of time, door bell not ringing).",Pros & Cons

Big problem: even when hardwired, you can only trigger motion an unknown number of limited times before it drains the battery faster than it can charge. They told me my camera had recorded 50 motion recordings and was ""way too many."" I had it that way in case of any report of problems on my street, to review the time line for any vehicles that may be out of place, in case of any neighborhood problems. So basically Ring has come out on the back end saying you can't use this as a street monitor, and only as a porch monitor for foot traffic. I wish they would tell you this up front. Battery went down to 3% in 3 months, hardwired. Even at 12% it will not let you use live view. I initially had a 10va transformer and tried upgrading to a popular 30va transformer (also use a mechanical chime). Battery did not increase after 1 day. I had to charge it via USB charger, and now have limited my motion to porch/front walkway and removed street motion, and scaled back sensitivity and frequency. I also limited recording back to 30 seconds. Battery seems to be holding with 30va transformer. Past the return window so I'm stuck with it. In my opinion this is a useless product as it can only record a limited number of times even while hardwired. The fact that they don't tell you this up front is nefarious. You can use it as a street monitor but will have to charge it via USB every few months or sooner. I also used thin metal washers to try and get better wire contact, and sanded all the copper wire ends. No improvement in charging. I can remove the security screws, hang it by the wires, disconnect the transformer, charge it outside via USB, if dry weather, but that is a huge pain. If I had to do it over again, any Ring doorbell would be off the list as it appears they all have this problem,while other hardwired smart doorbells do not appear to have this charging problem. 3 stars. But for the camera itself, picture is very good, 2 way communication is great. Their customer support is friendly and helpful.","Battery limits potential even when hardwired, otherwise very good"

I was able to use the existing doorbell wiring & transformer which will save us the effort of recharging the doorbell battery.  We love it and would recommend this solution to anyone out there.

The app setup for first person is easy, BUT you get to need to get a code to continue via email (not text), and so you go back and forth a bit, then from the app it takes you to the website and back on. so that was a pain, I think they could've speed up the process. No where in the manual say that your ring do not come with more than 30 days video saving feature, unless you pay $30/year for 1 device, which isn't bad but it should be better explained. It wasnt easy to explain either when you tap to check out the plus feature... You have to log out and then be able to see the features from plus and other plan. Viewing angle definitely is worth it, it can see my entire back porch area.",not hard to set it up but the manual is least to be desired

Pettigrew,"Pros: Easy to install Doesn’t require existing doorbell wiring but will work with it Highly customizable motion sensing Cons: Sometimes the video takes a long time to load for live view. I have VERY high speed internet and no problems with lags or buffering on anything else. This is a Ring-specific issue Doesn’t have a removable battery (you have to remove the whole unit). I’m sure this is a marketing scheme so you have to buy a whole new unit when the battery wears out. When I went to remove the unit for charging, it flipped off the mounting bracket, did a somersault and landed on the concrete porch - not ideal. You have to pay for a subscription just to be able to save recordings and pictures. It’s not outrageous, but I think $20 a year would suffice for the minimal service. If you’re wiring into an existing doorbell setup, this would work sufficiently. Otherwise I would recommend looking for a model with removable rechargeable batteries.",It’s sufficient but leaves a bit to be desired

I couldn’t wait to revive this doorbell when it finally came set up was easy and I thought I was done. Nope! Fist thing was poor Wifi connection, ok I can understand that I was due for a router upgrade and did just that. Still poor WiFi connection so I bought an extender, adjusted Ring to extender and all good. Now doorbell just falls off WiFi and keeps telling me my password is wrong when clearly it’s not. Over and over again. Absolutely annoying and in this day and age of technology absolutely absurd to have to go through this. Packing up and sending back! **update 7/7 - called Ring support and talked to a very friendly and helpful tech and he walked my through doing a soft reset ( hold orange button in for 20 seconds) and I was able to reset with no problem. Well that didn’t last long! Dropped off twice in less than 24 hours.  I tried Ring! So disappointed and I even bought a doorbell for my son. I hope he has better luck! At this point I just want my money back to try a different product. 1 star at best! **UPDATE 7/15 - I was contacted by Ring support by email due to my bad review. After speaking with a representative who was very friendly and helpful, we determined that my doorbell was not updating the firmware and was stuck. We also discussed where my doorbell is placed that being a good reason as well for dropping off WiFi. I was sent a new doorbell along with a Ring Pro Chime to help with the connectivity issue and extended the free coverage plan for all of my Ring devices for 6 months. I received the products in 2 days, set doorbell and chime up and crossed my fingers. SO FAR SO GOOD! it's been a week and have been hovering around RSSI -60-66.

I simply wanted something that would alert me when someone walked up to my door.  A motion sensing doorbell was the answer and this brand came highly recommended.  It worked like a charm!  I was alerted every time a delivery was made.  I would hit the notification on my phone and it would pull up the live view nearly instantly!  I loved it!  However, I didn't see the need to have record of people leaving boxes on my step (I live in an area where porch thieves are basically nonexistent and would stick out like a sore thumb) so I didn't subscribe to the recording service after the trial period ended.  And then the device basically stopped working.  Oh I still get notifications when there's motion....about half the time.  (Seriously.  I've walked past it and nothing)  And when I do get a notice, forget getting a live feed.  When I click it, I get a variety of error messages too numerous to list.  So I go directly to the app and hit live view.  The shortest amount of time I've had to wait to get a live view was 10 minutes after repeated attempts and getting error messages.  It's faster to go to the door.  By far.  But who wants to walk to the door to get a delivery only to discover it was just the meter reader or the neighbor's cat?

Be mindful that for this camera to ""record"" anything, you need to purchase a monthly or yearly subscription which I did. Now bear in mind, this isn't continuous recording either, it only records movement or when someone rings the doorbell otherwise, it fast forwards through the sections without movement or activity without you having control over it. Somehow this camera entirely missed someone coming into my property again and taking yet another one of my bikes. It didn't record any movement even though the bike was in view of the camera and the motion sensors were on. One frame my bike is there and the next frame, it's entirely gone with no recoding of anyone taking it. There is no time lapse in the video either since it clearly shows the time. My wifi did not go down during this time! I can't believe I payed a yearly membership just for the camera to annoyingly ping me that there is someone outside when it's just a cat (and once a fly even set off the motion detector) but when there is a whole person stealing a bike with no warning, that's how you know this product can't be trusted.

I thought that this is the same as Ring 2 but its a newer version (2nd Edition?) of the original Ring door bell. I can say that both Ring 2 and this new Ring door bell are almost identical but the only downside I think is the battery. I like the option of removable Battery from the Ring 2 door bell as it can still look that you have an active and working camera door bell. Unlike with the new Ring doorbell wherein you have to remove the whole Ring doorbell. However, I got this new Ring doorbell with free echo dot at half the price of the Ring 2. So overall, still a good buy.",Great Upgrade from the original Ring door camera!

This doorbell doesn’t have any wires aside from the charger that are supposed to be messed with (and the charger obviously isn’t connected unless you’re charging it). I see how mounting may be difficult if you aren’t mounting to a flat surface, but they seek a product for that as well (this is $100 people, stop acting like it was about to have every adapter you may ever possibly need - that would increase the cost for many people just to have adapter for a few). I have been fiddling with it for several hours now and thus far, so good (though I think it will take a very long time to charge because it at half full on arrival it took a full 3 hours to be full).","Great this far, charging takes forever though."

Also, with the unit that I have on the front door, the proximity sensor is a little too sensitive.

First thing I noticed was there are supposed to be 4 screws to attach frame to the house but only 3 screws were included. Second thing is the instructions to register and install the doorbell are targeted to the first generation so the instructions as to where to access code to scan into the app were not there. I called the Ring customer service and they had to instruct me how to locate it which was by removing the back frame. Instructions said to remove faceplate which is impossible to do since it’s all one piece. I haven’t been able to continue installing it until I get the correct number of screws which can be 2 more weeks. I’m wondering how much more issues I’ll encounter as I proceed with the installation.

I have adjusted the sensor/motion detection numerous times trying to figure out why it doesn’t detect “ALL” motion and also notifications have significant delay. I’ve charged the device once since I’ve owned it and today the battery won’t charge. 🙄 It makes me wonder if this is the Ring conspiracy and forcing to get newer models because the old ones won’t perform like they should. Super disappointed! Guess I’ll be investing in more Google products 🤷🏼‍♀️,Not recording or sending notifications and Battery no longer charges

Sparks,"My wife really likes this doorbell and is now considering adding a camera to view our driveway.  It was easy to install. It wouldn't fit between the brick and the door where the old button was located.  I mounted a PVC outdoor electric junction box and extended the wires and that worked out pretty well.  I painted the box to match the trim around the door and it blends in fairly well.  If you have brick wainscoting, you might have the same problem.  The ring doorbell is considerably wider than a typical doorbell button. The factory setting was way to sensitive, it was driving me crazy.  I changed it from detecting motion to detecting people and that is much better.","It works fine, Factory setting is too sensitive for us."

Mine is hard wired, so no battery issues.  Hardest part was I had to add holes in brick (mortar drill included) and I didn’t have a hammer drill, so took a little bit of elbow grease.  But, after that the whole thing went together quickly & paired up nicely.  Excellent video & I’ve got sensitivity tuned to my liking.

"All-new Ring Video Doorbell – 1080p HD video, improved motion detection, easy installation – Venetian Bronze (2020 release)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Oct 2020,eric,"I’m very displeased with this device. First thing is that there is a long delayed when it sends you a notification of a person at your door. For instance whenever the delivery person drops off a package I won’t get a notification until they’ve already put down my package, taken a picture of it, walked back to their vehicle and got in. Second this device is pretty useless unless you pay for the subscription plan. You loose every single feature that makes it appealing including “motion” vs “person” alerts and it turns into a delayed motions sensor with camera to look outside but you won’t see anything because it’s already gone by the time you got the notification. Without the subscription it will simply bombard you with notifications of “movement” for every little thing until you dumb down the setting to where it barely works. I went ahead and paid for the subscription since it obviously works better with it and to see how I like it in a year or so but as of now it’s been nearly 3 months and I’m not a fan. I’ll probably buy a separate motion sensor to detect movement at my door and hope that the ring camera will actually record it.",Long notification Delay and useless without subscription

This is kind of a stupid idea compared to the older version where you could just replace the rechargeable battery and continue to have security between charges. I will be returning this for a model when the “battery” only can be swapped vs having my security down while charging the whole unit. Just stupid when the old system was awesome.,Internal battery?

What happens is that you'll get an alert that there is a person or motion at your door but when you try to access the live camera, it buffers and won't show you the live view. Additionally, it takes a while for the video associated with the motion detection to appear for viewing. Other problems: sometimes the camera records a motion event with no video (black screen), sometimes the video clarity is really poor and pixelated. I would say it isn't the best first option to use as a camera for security purposes, but if you just want a door bell, it is really great for that -and that one purpose only really.",Wifi location is a problem which affects other aspects of the camera/doorbell

Soon after installation, I posted my stolen bike on neighbors (a feature of the Ring app). That night, one of my neighbors spotted the bike and called the police and notified me immediately. I met up in the area of where the police had been called and confirmed that it was indeed my stolen bike!

Installed the Ring which was very easy to set up. I set up the motion to not detect cars since we are about 70 ft. from the street and don’t want to detect every single car. Well, the motion detection is way too sensitive and and can detect the cars and the so-called “no animals detection” can detect every single animal including the lizards. The other night a “cat” burglar set off my Ring and woke me up. Lo and behold it was an actual cat that was staring at my Ring, I guess the light on the Ring had caught the cats eye.

It provides a clear picture.  The main downside to it is the charging.  I ordered a hardwired model to replace my existing doorbell.  If you read the fine print the hardwire is only for the doorbell chime itself.  It will only provide a “trickle charge” (aka will only charge when not in use) to the battery within the unit which means if it gets run down all the way you will still need to take it down and charge it with the USB cord.  That’s a pain in the A$$ when you have to unscrew wires and then leave them exposed while waiting for the unit to charge.,Good picture.  Horrible charging.
