Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Sep 2020,bowdette,"I wouldn’t really call it an accessory at this point as we rely on it so much! It helps take off the workload on the modem (which I turned the wi-fi off of). All of us here in the house have our own TVs and when we watch all the time, if not for this, it would have been a pixelated experience. I honestly love this thing. It makes my life easier, and for all the family as well. My little sister now has to have class all day and while she does it online, I can watch and not bother her connection. I’ve noticed that the max mbps for each device is about 17mbps which is very much enough for what each of us here deserve the first time around. I’m less angry at our local internet service because without this, the experience with them will continue despite our hate with it.

Now there are additional accessories to further extend the wifi but our little one story house is enough for just this wifi router. If you have a bigger home, and many more users (more than 6 people like us) spread out, you can test if this one router can reach anyone without a problem. For gamers, I think the ethernet is your best bet if you do PC gaming. But for console gaming, I do not find it bothersome as the constant fast connection is enough.","Even at 25 mbps, it’s much needed accessory"
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Dougsab,It is a bit pricey but you get a lot. The fact that the extenders are also google speakers is a fantastic bonus.

Increased a weak signal to max! Although I am not a big fan of Google, their products seem to work as advertised.",Best Wifi by far!
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,4,23 May 2020,McScruffy,"Bought a second Nest router to boost 5Ghz signal at the back of the house and back yard as well as to act as a wireless bridge for my PS4 Pro which is known to have unreliable wifi.  The Point access points do not have this capability which is why I went with a second router for the mesh system.

Setup, like with my main one I bought around Christmas, was extremely easy and straightforward.  The Google Home app handles the majority of the work for you and there are only a few steps which are clear and simple.

With the mesh system in place, between these two routers I have excellent 5Ghz signal and throughput throughout my 7000+ sq ft lot (and beyond).  I've yet to notice any drop when switching between the two streaming video on my phone or doing anything else, so it's about as seamless as I could ask for.

My main complaint is that in the process of Google making the mesh system so easy to set up, they've made it too simple for people like me who like to be able to customize the network(s) to a higher degree.  There is very little you can actually do with your network once set up, but you are able to see the devices connected, test the throughput between the device and the mesh system, and set a priority device for a specified amount of time.

You have no control over the IPs assigned and subnet settings, cannot place devices in a DMZ, or have the mesh set up as a gateway VPN for privacy.  The only option with the latter is to have VPN clients on the individual devices you are connecting with which I have done but it does create many more steps than just having the gateway connection perform this task.

Overall I'm still very happy with the system and all of my complaints are on the software side so it is possible Google could add these features down the road, though I doubt it.",Great mesh system with a minor complaint or two
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Apr 2020,skeller19,"Just what I needed to improve my signal strength and keep all my smart home devices connected. I recommend this to everyone. All the routers provided by your ISPs are trash, this should be the standard.",Perfect
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Aug 2020,Pastorclw,We have the original pucks that have worked well. This doubled our speed and increased the range. Bonus: easily works with existing pucks.,Big improvement!
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,1,23 Nov 2019,deranger,"Despite all the advances this is supposed to have over an older Google Wifi, it was unable to maintain anywhere near gigabit speeds on a wired network. I pay for gigabit internet and regularly test my bandwidth at 930-950 Mbps using my old Google WiFi and a Netgear switch.

When I replaced the Google WiFi with the Nest WiFi, I immediately began to run network tests to ensure everything was set correctly. However, bandwidth tests would rarely top 400 Mbps, typically settling around 330-350 Mbps. Running Google's built in bandwidth showed 800 Mbps, but running multiple bandwidth tests wired directly to the Nest Wifi by themselves, trying over ten different ethernet cables, and factory resetting numerous times always resulted in the Nest WiFi limiting bandwidth,

I replaced it with the old Google WiFi and it's back to repeatable bandwidth tests of ~940 Mbps, regardless of direct connection or through a Netgear switch.

Don't beta test products for companies, this could be good after some firmware updates, I hope.",Buy a Google Wifi instead

He purchased the slowest internet speed available from his ISP in order to keep his costs down, but he consequently had a few issues with his network as a result. I have the older style Google Wifi devices in my own home and I love them! They gave me fast, reliable connections to numerous devices in every room of my house. Since the older style Google Wifi access points are no longer available, I purchased this latest Google Wifi product instead. I installed it in my friend's apartment, and it solved several problems! His internet is faster on all of our devices. His Sling TV streams better on his Samsung 2019 smart TV.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Nov 2019,m0nkey,"The Google Nest WIFI AC2200 Router was super easy to set up with the Google Home app. The Google Home app walks you through the installation process with ease. I did have an issue with it connecting to my WIFI smart outlets that run on 2.4GHz. I called up Google and they provided me a workaround to get them set up. (it will require a secondary phone with hotspot capabilities). I am paying for 200 Mbps internet and when I perform the speed test I hit 207 Mbps on Ookla's speedtest. On top of the performance and ease of setup, I put this router ontop of our floating TV console in our living room and it is aesthetically pleasing to look at. My GF did not like our old router with the antennas sticking out.

1. Setup a secondary phone hotspot with the same SSID and password as you configured for your Google Nest WIFI Router

2. Turn on secondary phone hotspot

3. Connect your Phone to the secondary hotspot
     a. Ensure that you see the blue banner on secondary phone
     b. Ensure that you see the hotspot symbol on your phone

4. Using the specific WIFI smart app, enter in the same SSID and password as in step 1

5. Once you walk through the steps on the smart app and it successfully connects

6. You can now turn off the hotspot and rename the secondary phone back to its original name

7. On your phone now you can connect back to the Google Nest WIFI

8. Verify controls to WIFI outlets while on the Google Nest WIFI

This is to trick your WIFI outlets to thinking its connecting to a 2.4GHz router, this is because the Google Nest WIFI router does not have dedicated WIFI SSID's for 2.4GHz and 5Ghz. (Both channels are rolled up into one SSID)

Setup was a breeze and the range on this thing is simply impressive. The main router provides a stronger signal with faster and more consistent speeds than what Xfinity's box provided and destroyed the Netgear Nighthawk in all meaningful categories.

If you're looking for in-depth networking configuration options - this isn't for you. This is consumer grade (albeit high-end) networking tech. If you want fancy configuration options, you're better off with a Ubiquiti Unifi system or some other comparable enterprise system.

This does NOT have WiFi 6 compatibility but that's not mainstream yet and shouldn't be a dealbreaker (until 2022 or so)

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,3,23 Jul 2020,Bdub1,"I wanted to upgrade from my old Google Wifi and OnHub set up.  I am using two Nest Wifi routers, and have added one old Google Wifi Puck to help with coverage in a far-off corner of my home.

The difference in speed and coverage is fantastic.  It was also easy to set up.

Unfortunately, I have had some issues.  Having to use both the Google Home and Google Wifi app is a pain.  I have no idea why Google would be ok with that kind of set up.  A big source of frustration is that my Sonos speakers have been rendered useless (I am getting ready to sell them).  This is because they don't seem to work well with the Nest mesh system.  They constantly drop out of coverage, and it's impossible to have more than one Sonos speaker even showing as available at any time.  The final problem is that while i have 25 devices on my wifi network, the Google apps rarely show more than 12.  Again, I have no idea why, but it's been extremely frustrating.  I didn't have these issues with Google Wifi.  I'm close to selling this system and trying Eero.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Aug 2020,ScottC,"My old wifi had 3 range extenders (so 4 discreet wifi networks), and still had pathetic signal in some parts of the house. I switched to Google WiFi, and now a mixed Google/Nest WiFi setup, and love it. Strong signal everywhere, even in the front and back yards. Very simple setup, though I wish the app offered a little more control, as advanced options.
If you have things that need to be hard-wired (like my printer) to the network, the router offers a port for it. I've added a 6 port switch, so I can have multiple things wired. It gets a security update regularly, to watch for common exploits and protect your setup. Expensive, yes, but I think it's worth it.","Pricey, but worth it"
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Jun 2020,SNT1,"I highly recommend this if you have an existing google mesh system. It made a big difference. Before the upgrade, I saw Cox gigs last speeds that averaged in the mid 600Mbps. After the upgrade (and changing nothing else), I am consistently seeing low 800Mbps. 

The installation process requires you to factory reset all of the mesh points in your system and then relink  them. This takes a while because each mesh point takes 10-15 mins before it fully registers the reset.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Feb 2020,RoldieVStheWorld,"My pervious WiFi was horrendous with my old wireless router. So bad in fact that I resorted to doing a hotspot on my phone just to get decent connections even for simple things like emails. 

So I opted to buy a new router. I did a whole bunch of research on which would be good and was going to buy the bundle pack with this Router and a “Point” but the Best Buy Dude told me the specs of the coverage and only one is what I needed. 

Set up was easy with the app and I was up and running within 15 minutes. The WiFi speeds this router is giving exceeds everything I imagine.

To my surprise there is a problem with the devices that use the 2.4 GHz which at some point lost connectivity and never joined the network again. After a long conversation with Google support I had to change the DNS settings for the 2.4 GHz band. 
Not a very good experience. I'm encouraging Google to review their products plus give more troubleshooting instructions for them online. 
Another low point is that it has only 1 ethernet connector. If you have more than one device that needs ethernet connection you need to add an ethernet switch to your network.",Just ok router

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,5,23 Aug 2020,YodaZ,"Recently I started encountering connection issues with my Google Wi-Fi (original 1st gen) router. The signal strength in my home is somewhat wonky and the bedroom at the far end of the house was struggling to get signal. The only option I could think of was to add a Wi-Fi point in the bedroom to alleviate the problem. Since I had the original 1st gen Google Wi-Fi I knew I was going to need to get a newer unit. My options were A) buy just the access point, which is another AC1200 unit, or B) purchase the AC2200 Router and redo my Wi-Fi with the router as the main unit. I decided on option B.

First I had to factory reset my other Wi-Fi points. This was going to be a pain to re-do but worth it (for me) in the end. I set up the router next to the cable modem and then one-by-one I re-added the original Wi-Fi points in each room, and then added the original ""router"" access point to the bedroom. Now the connection is strong on there and I have not had any issues with dropped or weak signal. Just make sure you don't have too many access points as more is not always better. To give you an idea of what I mean, I currently have a total of 4 points and the router. Previously it was just the 4 points. I am considering replacing 2 points with 2 more of the AC2200 Google Nest Routers so that I hopefully use less Wi-Fi points as the router's AC2200 designation gives it nearly double the signal strength of the AC1200 points.

This isn't for everyone and not everyone will need the kind of set up I have but Google really did make the Google Nest Router a better update to the original Google Wi-Fi. My only complaint is that on the multi-unit kits they still include an AC1200 access point. I really wish the access points were AC2200 like the router. Other than that I definitely would recommend Google Nest!",Excellent Router for the Money!

They work well as a system, but you must first factory reset your network and build it from scratch. Keeping the same name and password as your previous network will allow all of your devices to reconnect. Note that you will need to install the new router with Google Assistant/Home and then transition back to the Google WiFi app to add access points.

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,2,23 May 2020,Jpeg,Currently have google mesh 3 pack.   System was fed from arris modem to ASUS router operating as a switch for Ethernet cables ran throughout home to hardwire certain devices.   If your trying to add this google nest router as the primary hub you will need to factory reset and install all of your existing 3 google mesh points.   This new google nest router uses google home app not google WiFi app like its previous version.   I found the setup process to be a huge pain in the bit and far less user friendly.   The biggest issue I had was my internet speed dropped consistently from day 1 of installing this new router.   I was loosing between 80mbps to 155mbps for 4 days.  Once I returned this device my internet no longer was or has been as slow as it was.  This is just my experience with this google nest router.  I may give it another try if the  price drops below $100 and if more compatibility testing is done with older google mesh system.,Not worth the price

Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,1,23 Oct 2020,Roxie,"I set it up, and really like the mesh network. It made a difference, however I am supposed to get 1000MB/S (which I get around 950 when hooked up) but wireless, I can only get up to ~300. Tried lots of different things, but nothing seems to help. Luckily that speed seems to be enough for me, but disappointing not to get the full speed. Would return but I spent so much setting it up I am just living with it.",Doesn't give me my full speed
Google - Nest Wifi AC2200 Router - Snow,1,1,23 May 2020,Jafar,"I originally had 2 Google Wifi pucks (predecessor to this model) and they worked great, but I wanted something with a little more horse power.  Unfortunately performance has been worse after upgrading to this.  I've spent hours troubleshooting and have a background in IT.  With the only variable being upgrading to this router I have to conclude it's either a firmware or hardware issue.  It seems many others are having similar problems if you check out the Nest support forums.  My current speeds were 80/80 now I'm getting 80/30 and my coworkers have commented on how my internet connection seems poorer during video calls.  Hopefully they'll be a fix soon but I'm afraid I'm going to have to return it for now if I don't hear about a solution from Google.",Got worse performance
