"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Aug 2020,Turnondafun,I've had alexa devices for a long time and never thought I needed one with a screen but it is super handy in the kitchen for recipes and I can watch shows while I cook.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Jul 2020,DeanO,We already had the Alexa Show 5 and now we're Living the Alexa Show 8. Best Buy made our Purchase Safe and Easy.,Loving the Alexa Show 8

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Apr 2020,JFPL,"For a time, been wanting an Echo, preferably the Echo Show for our downstairs to control some plugs we have. With our main Echo upstairs we didnt want to yell to get Alexa to turn off the smart plugs we had downstairs and thus had to use the App to control the plugs. FINALLY with the improvments and expanded Echo Show line, we bought the Echo Show 8 which was featured in one of Best Buy’s “Deal Of The Day” and was for sale as a 2 pack for $129.99!! With the ease of its setup, WE are so excited now that we have an Alexa WITH screen units downstairs AND upstairs!! THE screen is just right at 8”, very clear, vivid looking, and the touchscreen is responsive!! Has lots of features which my entire family is just getting to know and the ability to view our Arlo cameras is a huge huge plus!! In my opinion it is an excellent unit, well built, good screen, good sound from the speakers!! As always if you’re looking for a good Alexa screen this Echo Show 8 is it!! About the only “minor” complaint for now in order to play Youtube, once you ask Alexa to open Youtube you have to first select a “browser” and it will head to Youtube, which involves you having to do a touchscreen tap for the browser. I since have heard Google who owns Youtube and Amazon, which both had a nasty dispute, have finally come together with Google finally bringing back Youtube to Echo devices!! The only device left to have it back would be the Echo Show line. So until then, once Amazon has fully completed this agreement with Google, THE Echo Show still has to open Youtube in this manner. BUT again am sure FUTURE SOFTWARE UPDATES will address this!! Don’t let this minor omission detract from purchasing this unit!! As with all tech it gets better through the software updates, and consider the bigger picture of what this Echo Show can do!! Overall EXCELLENT!!",Awesome Alexa to date!!
"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,1,08 Nov 2020,nope,"not sure if this is a problem with best buy or amazon but this unit is not good and defective.
The problem is light bleed at the corner and it is visible . However its a great smart device for clock and simple thing at my desk. Im gunna go with staples instead. The price is good tho, but have to return this.

The one stars is for quality control form either best buy or amazon.",quality control is just -_-
"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Dec 2019,Luigi,"I just received this today and did a side by side comparison with the Echo Show 2nd Gen (ES2). TL;DR - I'm keeping this over the Echo Show 2nd Gen. Reasons below.

Form: I really like the smaller and even bezel around the display. The ES2 just looked imbalanced with the larger bezel above the screen.

Screen: I was wondering whether I might miss the larger display of the ES2, but the answer was a resounding NO. I think the display is every bit as readable if not a little better.

Sound: I personally like the sound better. Yeah, the ES2 has Dolby, but I honestly like the sound of this one better. The ES2 had more of a dynamic range (lows were lower and the highs were more crisp sounding) but my overall impression was that that the overly synthesized bass made the sound kind of muddy. The ES8 just sounds more balanced and pleasing to my ear.

Privacy: This was a strong selling point for me (ironic that I'm mentioning privacy with an Alexa device - I know). I like the fact that you can manually shut out the camera. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this appear on the next Echo Show 3rd Gen.

Price: After all of that coupled with the fact that it is 50-60% cheaper than the ES2 it was a no-brainer. For the same price of the ES2, I can have this AND an Echo Sub (not that it needs it IMHO).",Best in Show
"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 May 2020,StacieL,"I love having my Amazon show in my kitchen! I use it for everything from playing music basically all day long, following recipes, checking the weather, making my grocery list, to dropping in to my kid's echos to tell them dinner's ready. I love having the display screen with all the background options so it looks pretty on my counter! It was super easy to set up as well!",Perfect kitchen gadget
"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Feb 2020,creading,"The Echo Show 8 is my first venture into smart devices. I was basically looking for a nice clock to sit on my computer desk. I figured I would investigate the rest of the added features that it has. The screen is very good, with good color saturation. I was disappointed that it didn't have the different clock displays that the Show 5 has. To its credit, it has much better sound quality. Too me, that's it's best feature. Slowly working on using Alexa. My Show 8 sits on top of my computer hutch and sounds impressive. Overall, very pleased with my purchase. I may look into the Echo Studio for my living room.",Echo Show 8 better than expeced

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Feb 2020,Ruralcat,I got the Echo Show 8 to go with my Ring system.  It was easy to set up right from the box.  I have it showing Amazon photos when not in use by me with the time and weather.  It dims itself down when I turn off the lights at night but you can change that feature to remain bright if you like.  I haven't had it long enough to use all of the features but I continue to learn what it can do.  I do like that Alexa can read any of your books from your kindle library.  Great for unwinding at night.,"Echo Show 8 is great, with easy set up"

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,BobTheBuilder,"While I haven't utilized all features of this (no video phone calls yet), there is a lot of positives to say about this purchase.  

First of all, the sound quality is nice and fairly robust. Connecting it to my Amazon Prime music account was simple and with a voice command ""she"" gets my music running.  Volume control via voice as well.  

Second, she has seamlessly connected to my Wemo wall switches and plugs already named before Belkin stopped supporting them with their app.  Calling them by the name set up before turns lights on and off.  As this is my second Echo device (the other is the Echo Dot) it allowed me to move my Dot to the bedroom to control said lights.  I use Dot as my in bed security device able to turn on lights in other parts of the house if I hear stirring before I head into those areas to check them out, as if their movement triggered the lights to come on.

Third, I was able to hook it up to my Google calendar and the rotating screen reminds me of the day ahead of me with the first thing showing up along with other suggestions to try.

Finally, the whole package, screen size and footprint is relatively compact yet easy for this senior to see across the room.","So Far, So Nice!"
"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,10 Nov 2020,Chevy,Not as costly as the 10 inch screen and the viewing is good. It does what it is advertised to do and the sale prices have made it a better value. Will work with smart plugs and ring doorbell,Echo dot with a screen

It was recommended to go with the 8 but I was afraid it'd be too big where I wanted to put it.  Both were on sale, so that was a big plus...!!!

I had to pre-set everything on it to make installation easier - which meant he needed a phone number, Amazon account, etc. so there was a bit of legwork involved (he does not have a smartphone or an Amazon account), but I was able to get everything working so it only needed to be plugged in and Network and pw inputted by his caretaker.

The visual component is interesting and nice but not as useful as I thought it might be.  I'm very likely not using it up to its potential, which is at least partially my own fault. But it seems harder than necessary to find a single source of information about how to maximize its usefulness.  The sound quality is equal to or maybe a little better than my other Echo non-shows.  I tried to purchase a subwoofer but they seem to be out of stock or possibly discontinued, which was kind of annoying.

It is a little bigger screen with a shorter height but it sticks out in back a little more. The one drawback I see with the device is the power cord. While it is nice that it is now detachable it could be better by getting a 90 angle plug in tip. The straight one that comes with it sticks out even further and seems to get in the way a little, at least where I have mine. The system is pretty much the same as the other ones I have but seems a bit more responsive and I noticed things are a little faster as well. Overall I would say it was a good upgrade.",Good device and a nice upgrade

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,TH3SHUR1F,"After using an Echo Plus and a couple Dots for a few years, this was a nice change to adorn my nightstand. The weather and news readouts are helpful visual cues alongside Alexa's usual info blurbs.

The device itself is sleek and elegant, and it compliments the industrial-modern aesthetic of my decor (i.e. matte blacks, polished wood, and metal supports). Because the Show 8 and Show 10.1 occupy a larger footprint than the other Echo devices, some buyers may want to consider the space needed and the aesthetics the devices have in a living space.

Also, yes, it has a camera cover, assuming you're worried about privacy. Can't say the same about the microphones; but if you're that concerned about audio data privacy, you likely aren't going to buy an Echo device to begin with.

Only complaint is a one-time experience when it wouldn't shut off an alarm after I repeatedly told it to ""stop."" Some users may want to go into the device preferences and opt out of the cycling headlines and Alexa tips as well.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Jan 2020,Coquizap,"Having a Echo 1st Gen and Echo Plus I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 in order to have the ability to view video when using online news feeds and for home security. The Echo Show 8 comes preloaded with Tubi, and Hulu which does provide interesting contents if you done mine watching on an 8” screen. You can also request and watch your favorite YouTube videos without the need of a subscription service.  If you’re subscribed to prime video then you have access to the full Amazon library. 
It is also good for calling friends or family members and being able to see one other when you’re unable to use FaceTime. Having the ability to drop in on older parents is an plus, and being able to drop in from your mobile devices to check in on your home while you are away give you an extra layer of home security.
The Echo Show 8 doesn’t do anything more then any of the others echos beside having the capability of video, and it’s sound quality isn’t much better when considering that it does have two stereo speakers on either side. 
I enjoy watching my pictures as background photos, but it is a bit annoying having the constant “TRY this” message appear at the bottom of the screen and not having the option to eliminate it. That explains my evaluation of 4 Stars.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Sep 2020,TwoEZ,"Bought this device when it was on sale.  Definitely like the audio/video quality over the Show 5 (not that the show 5 is a bad device).  More space, better speakers & bass.  Screen is nice & bright, but dims in low light (a must if you want to sleep).  Made phone calls with it, great sound.  Haven't video called with it, so can't make any opinions on it.  If you owned any other echo device, does the same sound wise, but with a bonus of having a screen to show you some information, surf the web on it as well (it is a touch screen).

Bonus, I can see my security camera views I have setup in my place (skill required of course)!!  That's a nice touch especially if you have a multi level home.

Now, to fully take advantage of the device, you NEED to set up routines with your smart devices & appliances as well as have the right skills for them.  This will eliminate the need to constantly do it on your mobile device or tablet.  If you do not, won't do much for you.  As a stand alone product, you can use it, but you don't take full advantage of what it can do unless you're working on making your home a smart one.  Excellent addition to the Echo line of products.","Great device, but learn skills & routines!!"

It is so much fun displaying my Amazon photos...walking by and seeing random memories. And the sound on the Echo Show is far superior to the Dot.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,AppleMan,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.",I love it

That said, the show devices never seem to hear our voices as easily as the other echo speakers or Sonos one speakers around the house. I have to speak louder to get the wake word to activate.  Same issue with our Show 5. I think it’s because they have fewer far field microphones that other devices.","Nice screen, hard of hearing"

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Aug 2020,Giff85,"Purchased three Echo Shows: one for us, my elderly in-laws and a relative in a nursing home.  The purchase was made so everyone could see each other during COVID-19. All three devices were registered to my Amazon account (the others don’t have Amazon accounts or cell phones).  All of my contacts were visible in all three devices.  I didn’t like that my contacts were visible in the nursing home where our relative lives. While he receives excellent care, you can’t trust every employee and employees have access to his room. I feel this is an invasion of privacy.  I contacted Amazon about removing access to my contacts on the devices: they stated that this subject is reported in their Privacy Notice (lots of legal small print). I pointed out that this subject is not covered in their marketing materials.  After a lengthy discussion, eventually they instructed me how to remove access to the contacts in the Alexa app. Because all devices are registered to my Amazon account, the contacts are blocked from all devices (you can’t pick and choose which device to block them). We now have a closed network with just the 3 devices; we can’t communicate with others unless I unblock the contacts. That is fine for now.
Another thing to be aware of: every time one of the other two devices calls the Echo Show in our home- my cell phone would ring in the Alexa app. This occurred even though I blocked Alexa notifications from my phone.  I set up the Alexa app on my iPad and removed it from my cell phone.  The same situation occurs on the iPad, but I don’t carry my iPad with me at all times, so, the annoyance is minimized.
Now, the positives. Our relative in the nursing home is in his 50s and hasn’t seen any family members since March.  He has joy in being able to see his family again. It’s not the same as physical visits, but it makes his day that he can reach out when he wants to talk and he doesn’t need help from the nursing home staff to call us. Also, my elderly in-laws and wife love all the music options that Alexa provides. Alexa opens up a world of easy access information and entertainment.",Great purchase but some things to consider

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Sep 2020,DaKota,"I am actually wondering why I purchased this viewer.  It has a great picture, good quality sound,  I can view or answer my ring doorbell notifications, listen to music, etc.  But I really need to find some other uses for me, those I use hardly justify the hefty price tag of the item.  Granted, I do need to do some reading to see what else I might be interested in.  I do not do video chat and am not interested in that.  I will try to find a calendar program that fits my requirement to receive reminders, plus am hoping that future upgrades will give me more options.  I can watch Prime video on it but it is much larger on my TV screen. I wish I had looked into this more before I made the purchase.",Rather Disappointed

It does pretty well at this however there are a couple quirks - one namely being when I have a recipe or web page open after a period of time it reverts to the home page on its own but there doesn't appear to be a way to go back to what I was viewing. I haven't found a setting to stop that yet but I would think there is one. Sound, display quality and controls are excellent.",Great Device

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Oct 2020,Jyrymond,"I bought this for my dad who suffered a severe stroke a few years back. He always loved new tech but he is non verbal now and can’t interact verbally with devices like the echo dot. I saw that this has a touch screen and thought I’d give it a try. I set it up to play a slideshow of pictures of his grandkids and kids as the screen saver, display sport scores, video call mine and my daughters devices, and showed him how to navigate Amazon Music. He loves it more than anything he’s gotten in years. He pops up to see us a few times a week and even though he can’t really speak, we talk to him and it clearly brightens his day. He also loves the world of music available to him now. I would categorize this as a healthcare purchase in our family’s case! It’s been that good for his mental health. So affordable for everything it does!",Wonderful way to keep the family in touch

I’m sure it works perfectly with ring cameras, but was glad to discover it works very well with Nest as well.  If you are looking primarily for YouTube integration, I’d look elsewhere.

We plan on upgrading ours to a bigger screen and use the smaller one for a smaller room. It can be tricky to get things set up and to connect to phones and tablets but customer service is great.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,3,13 Jan 2020,fireman,"the Echo Show 8 has a screen that looks good. I find it difficult to set up anything on it because you need to use a tablet that has Alexa installed. It would be nice if you could set up routines on the Show itself.   The Alexa app is not very intuitive to use.  Also you need to know what verbiage to use so that the Show 8 will know what to do.  Documentation is nonexistent.  Have to do a google search to find out how to do anything.  Also the Show 8 always scrolls 'things to ask Alexa' at the bottom of the screen.  The only way I have found to stop this is to set the night mode to all the time.  I have set it up to perform a few routines and it does do them correctly (as long as you have an internet connection) , so that is a positive.  It has no battery so It needs to be plugged into a power outlet all the time. If you are watching something on it you can not carry it around and continue watching as you move.  Too many drawbacks for me to recommend it",difficult to use

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,5,13 Jun 2020,3dguy,"If you have any echo units you pretty much know how useful they can be. What surprised me is the the audio quality on this 8"" Show is on par with the 10"" Echo Show. There is some deep bass there, amply demonstrated by thunder in the storm sounds we will sometimes listen to when going to sleep. There are many blu-tooth speakers out there without video capabilities that cost as much or more than this but have no better audio. I replaced a PioneerVA-FW40 Alexa with this unit because the Echo Show was much more responsive to voice commands and the bass reproduction is at least 95% of what the Pioneer unit could do. Also, the high end is better, cleaner and more detailed, on the Echo Show. The 10"" unit has a few features this doesn't, such as a built in light control hub, but this 8"" unit it the best bang for the buck, especially if you can catch a sale price.",Excellent audio quality

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,4,13 Oct 2020,AshD,"The Echo Show has a known issue in which it acknowledges your voice command, but doesn’t perform it. Ask it to play music, turn on lights, etc., Alexa will acknowledge the request, but......nothing happens.

This can be rectified with a simple power cycle (unplug, wait a minute, then plug back in), but a product for a product that is 100% designed for convenience, power cycling is an annoyance.

Other than that, it’s been solid.","As advertised, but just one issue"

Almost picked up a bogo for the show 5 a few months back and glad I held off because I jumped on the deal of the day and scored a bogo on these Show 8’s and I am very happy with the purchase even though one arrived with a nick in the side but BestBuy was great and offered a replacement or discount to keep the item. All in all these are great smart displays with a crisp HDish picture and very good sound. Just wish it had the light for notifications and you could customize it a bit more. Also the mic array could use some improvement. I find myself having to shout and speak slowly for it to recognize what I am saying.

This one meets all the capabilities of the full Show, but with less space being taken up.  It sounds good, has a great display and is pretty customizable.

"Amazon - Echo Show 8"" Smart Display with Alexa - Charcoal",1,1,13 Jan 2020,Shinobi,"It's too tedious to setup and it is not compatible with a lot of the apps and services that we use. I bought this for my wife and she does not like it, and like most reviewers stated, it does not respond well to certain voice commands. The contacts don't sync properly, you pretty much have to add them one-by-one. You can only receive video calls from those who have the Alexa app/echo show. Cannot use any other app for video calling except Skype and they charge now. The browsing experience could be better. Google would be better because they're loads of apps you can use where as Alexa is pretty much limited to Amazon - music video, and services. It's not what I thought it was. The droo-in feature only works for the default user and not on guest/shared accounts. You will not like this unless you use mostly Amazon services, and even then it is still inconvenient. Will be returning. Just gonna go with google hub max like I started to. Speakers do sound great though.",Should've went with google.

I do like the feature of a manual camera switch to shut the lens off.
Fairly easy to program but don't mumble your words. Overtime it does seem to learn from what you tell it.
Still playing with the different features so I still learning as I go.
My kid is much better at electronic devices than I am!
Only giving four-stars because you have to buy a separate stand for $20- if you want a different display angle. For the price of this thing compared to how much the stand probably cost to make overseas, it should be included free with the device",Expensive alarm clock. And more...

It does not do many smart things apart from telling you the weather, setting timers/alarms, and controlling smart devices. Furthermore, Alexa hardly ever answers a question with relevant answers and misunderstands almost everyone who speaks to her. The speaker within the device is impressive, and the ability to video chat is great for a dog owner who likes remotely checking in on their pup. The device sits on an angle, though, so the camera points at the ceiling unless you tilt the device down or purchase the additional stand (clever design to force us to purchase more products, I guess).

And getting notifications is another issue. You won't know if you have a notification if you don't watch the screen, or stay within an earshot of this device. The Echo Dot 2 has a light that flashes to let you know that you have a notification. The only way that I have known about notifications since I've had the Show 8 is because of my Echo Dot 2.
The documentation for the Echo Show 8 is terrible or non-existent. Most info tells what Echo devices can do, but does not distinguish specifics of how the different Echo devices work.
This is the message I got from Amazon when I tried to get support:
Thank you for contacting Amazon. While our operations continue, our response times are longer than usual. Unfortunately, we are not providing email support at this time, so you will not receive a reply to your request.",Echo Show 8 purpose?
