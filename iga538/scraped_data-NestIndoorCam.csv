Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Aug 2019,Amazon Customer,"I have always been a big promoter of Nest products. Requiring me to use a bright green flashing light on my cameras changes that. The ability to leave it on was always there. Why change it? Those who wanted it on could leave it on. Those who wanted it off could have it off. Now everyone is stuck with an obnoxious BRIGHT green flashing light when cameras are being viewed. (And yes, I set the light to its dimmest setting. As soon as you view that camera the brightness goes right back up to call attention to itself.) I’ve temporarily solved this by covering the light with some black electrical tape, hoping that this new “update” is reversed. If not, I’ll have no choice but to switch products. Terrible, Google Nest. Terrible.",Obnoxious Aug 2019 update
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Oct 2017,Memphis GG,"We have invested heavily in Nest equipment due to reviews. The thermostats are quirky and undependable. The camera has now started to not recognize when I am at home with my cell, thereby sending endless reports of activity whenever we walk by. I finally had to turn the camera off. I have had to re-do settings on my outdoor camera over and over. Also, when i click on the alert to see the activity, it just spins and spins. I have to save it as a clip and then view it. Pathetic. The camera clarity is fine, but the technology behind it is flawed and undependable. This is a serious flaw when you purchase these in most cases for viewing when you are away. If you can't depend on them . . . Update: alerts are a little better; apparently it is learning. However, it just is not dependable. Sometimes it turns off when I'm in the house with the cell phone which is designated to trigger turning the camera off, sometimes it doesn't. The software is just not dependable yet, on either the cameras or the thermostats. We have two houses and it is very irritating when I have to keep resetting, re-entering info, manually turning cameras off, etc.","Unfortunately, not ready for prime time"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2019,Porcupine racer,"These cameras worked fairly well when they were on. I paid for the subscription and they recorded, caught a decent enough picture and sound. The location ability of their app in correlation with my iPhone X was terrible. They would sometimes not turn on (despite the app indicating I was not at home) and they would sometimes turn on (while the app indicated I was at home). This first issue was more prevalent with all 3 cameras, while I did have an issue with 2 cameras turning on while I was home. Nothing in location had changed, in fact, my phone was still sitting on my desk the whole time. I realized it had turned on when I stood up from my meeting and got a notification that there was motion (I guess the motion detection works, but the noise coming from my speaker phone did not notify me, you could at least hear it on the recordings). Nest's technical support answer was to uninstall/reinstall, unplug, reset, blah blah blah. They ended up with not having a true solution and credited me with $50. Which I will not use because I cannot use a service where my expectation of privacy is violated and no true solution developed.",Privacy is of no concern
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Nov 2019,Julieanne,"Exactly what I expected. Works fine, easily integrated into the NEST system and easily viewed remotely on smart phone. Disappointing that you have to subscribe to have access to the recordings, but that was spelled out in the description. Can buy that cloud service, but cannot used any of the equipment I have to achieve the same results. Cannot combine with my other surveillance cams or the DVR. FOV is wide and therefore makes a difficult image if you are using with a shorter focal length such as under 20 feet. Example: When in use as a doggie cam in the house, image is distorted.  Motion detection and setting options are good. You have excellent options when setting sensitivity and ability to select region to include/exclude from motion detection. Definitely want to exclude ceiling fans and TV from the motion detection zone. Or externally exclude any street traffic or blowing tree limbs. Software also seems to be able to discriminate between humans and not when choosing to ""detect"". Audio functional, but not great. What can one expect from a small camera with built in speaker? Would be nice to have an audio-out option for plugging in better speaker or ability to record. Probably easy to connect with Google Home Hub (base unit) -- had to have my wife do it as it was more involved than I had patience. These cameras are still a little expensive for the function--compared to what you can have with options that do not have a NEST/ RING/ALEXA base unit compatibility-- and you still get the shake down to buy cloud space if you want the recordings archived at all. Had very short trial period and you get to test drive the community function which would be great for security conscious people. Ability to see what ""events"" have been reported by other participants around your vicinity. The NEST system (doorbell included) was handy during trial period when someone crashed their car into my front yard and I could watch the people, police, and tow-truck tearing up my front yard. I was also able to communicate with police who came to my door to inform me, but I was grocery shopping. Would recommend, but may wait until price comes down to buy again. Would really get excited about this if there were options to record directly to my own equipment, without giving Google (and who knows who else) access to images (and audio) from inside my home. You definitely want to remain aware of when it is ON/OFF.","Works good, works with NEST software"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2017,Michelle,"What a great indoor cam. It goes great with my Nest Secure.  Very easy to setup and link with our Nest Secure. The cam can pick up the slightest sound.You can hear and speak through it. Yes you can talk to your pets through the mic and or if someone is in your home, you can say something to them right through the cam. It will pick up my cat eating her food and it can hear us talking on the second floor!! It will send you a notification that your camera hears a noise. My cat got busted doing things I never thought she would be doing when we aren't home.  You can also view your camera at the Nest website or the app when you log in and you can turn it on and off and schedule a time to turn it on and off if you like.  While our Nest camera is connected to our Nest Secure, you can use the camera separately.  Make sure there is nothing obstructing the view of the camera such as plants, books etc.  My only grip is the monthly fee if you want to save your videos to the cloud. It cost 10.00 a month.The app works great with it and although many complain about the pricing of this cam. You can find coupon codes online. I got mine on Cyber Monday and got it for a excellent price! The infrared night view is very clear and can see everything. You can pan around the area, picture quality is pretty good but not great but clear enough you can see details of the room you are viewing.",What a great indoor cam

Maybe the sun? The cameras connector constantly breaks. We’ve gone through a couple already, and although nest has replaced the cameras we are now outside of our warranty window (I believe) and the connector is breaking again so it’ll be interesting to see if nest is going to replace it again. Also.. after years of waiting nest still has not even announced plans to integrate Apple home kit, and they have now disabled the Apple Watch app, and the entire works with nest program (ifttt and others). They are constantly withdrawing from everything except for google which seems to be their new business strategy, perhaps to get you to jump into the google eco system. For me, however, it’s having just the opposite effect. I’m highly disappointed in this because I really liked nest from the very beginning (the first nest protects and thermostat) and we have several nest products.. but now I feel like they are abandoning their entire Apple fan base. So i do not want to purchase anything from nest anymore and I’m about to need another camera. Instead of buying another nest I’m likely going to replace my two cameras With arlo and buy an additional third with arlo which is providing homekit integration. This is a huge disappointment to me and I cannot understand why it makes business sense to just throw away a huge chunk of their customer base (Apple users). My review will be updated if homekit is ever further considered by the company but I have high doubts.",Been waiting for homekit for years.

I use them in windows looking outside because if a camera is outside it is vulnerable to vandalism and I bought these before they repackaged for outside.  Now I have been scrutinizing for the last few months and see it FAILS TO ALERT RANDOM ACTIVITIES TOO MUCH!!  UPS or mail deliveries - even me driving into the driveway. It alerts for swaying branches of trees yet completely misses some deliveries and vehicles.  Well, it only needs to miss alerting THE ONE WHERE THEY STEAL OR VANDALIZE  for the thing to become somewhat worthless. 'Night vision' sucks so I have motion activated floodlights in several critical areas.  I have to use an ipad to really review later at home (because the software for viewing on PC sorta sucks in comparison - and I would rather view while at work on a PC...) So, I paid $30 for a minion cam and have spent the last few days with them side by side. View is actually a tad better on the cheaper cam - and the cheaper cam picks up more than the $200 cam. AND, the subscription is $10 per month with unlimited number of cameras!!  bye bye nest.",poor performance when compared with LOT cheaper ones out there
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2016,Steve Cahill,"Couple of big issues, and some minor stuff as well. Biggest issue is that it is not suitable for customers whose internet service comes over a DSL line. This is because video quality is quite poor when bandwidth-limited by the DSL line's upload rate, which is slow. As in, moving faces at distances greater than a few feet are just blobs of pixelated color, and even close up, it takes a few seconds for the details of the face to fill in as the video compression algorithm gets the data, and then only if the face is completely motionless. If you're using this camera for security, you won't be able to identify people in its field-of-view if the camera is getting internet service through a DSL line unless the faces are completely motionless. Forget reading license plates, unless the plate is 1 foot from the camera and not moving for at least a few seconds. See the video-snapshot examples. This was tested at 360p, which was the only setting that worked on the DSL line; 720p just locked up the camera. This poor video quality is not inherent in low-bandwidth DSL; rather, it seems to be a limitation of the video compression algorithm being used in the Nest cam, since comparision-testing Skype works fine over the same line. Fast-bandwidth cable internet will be different, I'm certain, and having excellent video is a capability of the system ... but not on a modest-upload-speed DSL line. Another important issue is that the audio in the user-to-camera end is of very poor quality. Think: the worst cellular phone call you've ever listened to. I tried joining a family meeting with the Nest cam; the oldest generation said ""Can't understand, just ruuuba-ruuba-ruuba"", the kids could get a word now and then, and the middle generation said ""...Ethiopia??"" Volume adjustment of the camera or at my talking end did not help the audio quality. In addition the camera has substantial audio delay when used over a DSL line; various trials were in the 1 - to - 10 second range. Forget carrying on a conversation through the camera; unusable. And, on top of these ""not fit for purpose"" issues, the video-review/control web user interface is buggy. Examples include: the camera scheduler turns it on at 6AM and I get a notification in email that motion has been detected at 6:05AM, but there's no marker at that time in the motion-detection indicator on the UI. There was motion, review showed deer in the frame, but where's the marker? Or: the camera has a power-outage because it was deliberately unplugged. I tried to watch the video leading up to the unplug. The low-detail sampled-frame popup in the UI showed the event, but when I tried to play the video of the event through the UI, as the view approached the time of the unplug, it would halt and move the ""play"" timepoint to a point much earlier in time. The only way I could see the unplug event was to make a clip of it and view that. Or: random crash/reboot events when trying to use the configuration controls in the UI: adjust the zoom and occasionally crash. Change the video setting from 360 to 720, and lock up. If the system doesn't have the capability to do something that the controls are enabled for, it should communicate, rather than just crash. Or: after running for some time, clicking on the playpoint selector doesn't move the ""play"" cursor there; I have to pop up the low-detail popup and click that to get a particular time-to-play selected. And, finally: issues with support. During setup I posted a request to the help-desk for info regarding configuring the audio routing on the monitoring PC. It's 2 weeks later, and there's no reply. For reference: Nest cam is software version 205-600052, serial number is 18b430556xxx. Remote interface is PC Win7, up to date, and Chrome browser, up to date. Nest cam's local internet service is through a DSL line on a conventional home system that has no other high-bandwidth usage running, and is otherwise normally functionally, with as-expected upload and download speeds. In summary: lots of issues, for a high-end ""no problems"" price. In hindsight, I shouldn't have bought it.",Not for use with internet access over DSL. Very poor remote-to-camera audio quality. Buggy. Poor support.
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Aug 2019,Greg,I regret buying all my Nest products. They keep randomly implementing mandatory updates without any care for the customer. First they remove the works with Nest program killing all integration with my devices using homebridge and fragmenting my smart home.

Yang,"I'm pretty disappointed in this product. It keeps going ""offline"" even though I know the internet is working (since I'm using other devices that are connected to the same wifi). Neither the camera nor the router have moved so there is no reason why the connectivity should be dropping so frequently. And our apartment is NOT large. It's only 625 sq feet total so range should not be an issue at all. The rare times it IS working, it works just fine. Video quality is nice. I would prefer the microphone to be a little more sensitive, but oh well. The set-up was easy. But for the price, I expect a little more reliability. Disconnecting from Wifi is not acceptable.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Aug 2019,Hildegard,"I bought these cameras after Lighthouse closed shop, thinking it was the next best option to the Lighthouse camera I loved. After 8 months, I wish I had chosen differently partly, but only partly, because of Google’s recent changes to the status light. After the first few months, I bought a different model of Nest camera thinking I had just bought the wrong type, as a more expensive model is supposed to have facial recognition so that it sounded more like the Lighthouse camera I had had before. But none of them really were what I was hoping for. The motion detection does not distinguish between humans and pets, and it sometimes is triggered by things like a light coming on. As shown in the image I uploaded, the cameras cannot distinguish a cat from a “person,” and I get alerts of a “person” multiple times a day triggered by a cat. I have read that this happens unless you pay for a subscription. But I did pay for the expensive subscription for all 4 cameras, and I still had that problem. The facial recognition of the more expensive camera isn’t very good either. The first time it alerted, the “unidentified face” was actually a shadow on the ceiling caused by a ceiling fan, it was not programmed well enough for the software to understand faces do not appear disembodied on people’s ceilings. Since then, it picks up images of 2 dimensional TV news casters easily when a pet sitter is watching TV, and gives me a clear, beautiful image of whichever news reporter she is watching — but pick up the 3 dimensional pet sitter’s face with a recognizable image? Barely. One sitter was in and out, walking past that camera multiple times per day for several days, and I think I finally got one image. And now that Google bought the company, they have apparently decided you can’t turn off the green light on each camera any more. I never thought the status light showing the camera was on was that big a problem, although it does make the cameras more uncomfortable for anyone in my home — but people who bought it as a baby monitor are reporting real problems from the green light bothering their babies. What bothers me more is that it is not possible to prevent the green status light from flashing whenever the owner is looking at the videos. To my thinking, that renders it nearly unusable as a security camera (after I bought 4 cameras and 4 subscriptions!). All a burglar has to do is watch for the flashing status light to tell them when the homeowner is looking st the video and rest assured that no one has likely phoned the police until then. I am still hoping Google will respond to the objections of its customers and back off if its new plan for the status light. But even if not for that, I am looking for another brand.",A purchase I regret for multiple reasons
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Sep 2017,Nick,"While Nest doesn't advertise this as a nursery camera, let me assure you that it makes a stellar camera for watching your little one. It's also entirely unique from dedicated nursery monitors that support video for the reasons described below. We purchased the Nest when we realized that when my wife goes back to work overnight as a Nurse, she would of course be missing her baby. I did a lot of research and settled on the fact the Nest can stream video to any device on any internet connection. My wife could open the Nest app on her iPhone while taking a break and watching our baby sleeping soundly in her crib. It brought her some comfort, and on hard evenings she would sit and watch the baby sleeping to make her feel more connected. Not only does the Nest video streaming work on any popular phone, tablet, PC etc, but it even has a microphone feature where we could talk into our devices and it would pipe through the Nest camera. We used this to talk to our baby when she was upset, yet we were indisposed (using the restroom comes to mind). Nothing like singing to your baby from the comfort of your toilet. Of course there were other more reasonable examples, like Mommy talking to baby when she was sitting in her car before returning home. Another huge feature is that it detects ""movement"". An intended home security feature, but actually a really great way to analyze your baby's sleep patterns. You can rewind and observe how your baby slept the next morning, how much they were moving and when they were in their deepest sleep because no movement would be detected for a long stretch. This was extremely revealing and it actually helped us figure out our baby's 4 month sleep regression when it was happening. A hidden benefit if when you forgot what time your baby woke up from her nap, it's easy to rewind back and see when a big amount of movement was detected and know the time of her last wakeup. Of course there are benefits if the Nest being always on, and always recording. Like the fact we caught her very first roll in her crib and was able to save it as a clip to download. The Nest Subscription service has been useful in recording back and capturing moments we thought were special. A couple of cons to be aware of: 1. Always on, streaming to the internet means security concerns. While Nest has password protection by default llimits sharing to just you, the very fact it's an internet based service means it's going to be vulnerable to hacking. I think hackers would grow bored of watching a baby sleep but maybe that's just me. 2. Nest Aware is $10 a month while optional, is valuable for capturing moments and makes the camera much more useful overall. This adds up in cost significantly over the course of a year. 3. Needs to be used in conjunction with a real audio baby monitor. It's not going to replace the traditional baby monitor. It's vulnerable to hiccups with internet connection and power outages, and not super reliable overall.",Forget about Security - Top 3 Nursery Purchase
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 May 2017,TK,"I purchased four of these cameras to be used at two separate locations - primarily because of the notification feature that will send you an email if a camera detects movement or a noise.  What Nest fails to mention in their promotional material is that their software that minimizes false alerts is only active if you subscribe to their Nest Aware monthly subscription service. Without this software active, minute movements (a small bug, sunlight, shadows, etc) will trigger a false email activity alert. I literally get dozens of erroneous email alerts a day.  I spoke with Joshua in Nest's product support group.  He's confirmed the only fix to the problem is to subscribe to Nest's monthly service.  Subscription to Nest Aware would cost more in one year than I paid for the cameras. What's worse is that they include one month of Nest Aware with your initial hardware purchase so the multitude of false email alerts doesn't begin until you've passed your 30 refund period. There are better options available.","Buyer Beware - good product, lousy business strategy."

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jun 2019,N. E.,"I purchased this camera about a year ago and I've been using it indoors ever since. There are two types of issues that had I known I would not have opted for it. First, my settings are always the same - once I am away from home, turn on the camera automatically, based on the GPS coordinates of my cell phone. That function seems to change on its own every so often, by itself. The only way I know that it's not working is because I stop getting my usual daily notifications when my cats trigger the camera by walking within the motion detection zone. Then I manually need to turn on the camera, if I am away. That to me is a big flaw as, again, I do not change any settings, yet sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. The second flaw is that the other day I gently tried to unplug the camera from the electrical outlet and the box where the wiring is, came loose and would no longer hold the camera plugged. There is no screw that holds the box together and it appears that the cover of it was glued to the rest of the box. I find that hard to believe, but there is absolutely nothing visible that would prove opposite. I glued the cover back together and I am just hoping that I do not need to unplug the camera anytime soon. Seeing what this camera cost (around $180 in 2018), I would not buy it again, nor would I recommend it. These two flaws are significant enough not to find the product worth the cost.",Broke

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2018,eight1178,"I chose this camera over all the other web cameras out there because I have the Nest Pro thermostat and wanted everything to be managed under the same Nest ecosystem.  It's a premium camera for sure.  Everything from the boxing, materials, looks and software makes it feel ""top of the line"".  It was easy to set up, and image quality is amazing.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is the subscription pricing to Nest Aware, which is the service that allows you to record and keep data footage in the cloud for ""X"" period of time.  There are other cameras out there that offer this service for free and others that offer at a lower price.  This is just an optional service, so you don't have to subscribe to it.  If you don't subscribe to Nest Aware, you will still get motion alerts and instead of accessing a video recording of that particular moment through the Nest app, you'll will get a still image.  Also keep in mind,  Nest does allow you to try it out for free for the first 30 days.  Overall, it's an awesome web camera.  I doubt I'll be subscribing to Nest Aware, as I don't think it's something I really need.  If someone does break into my condo, I'll have a crystal clear image of their face.

Sahni,"We've used these cameras for about two years. The UI for the mobile app and the website are good and much better than what Arlo Pros had two years ago. The constant recording is also nice. But Google recently decided that you should no longer be able to disable the status light on these cameras, which limits their usefulness. Now everyone will always see the cameras and also know when the feed is actively being watched. This limits the application of these cameras for a multitude of purposes that are all reasonable for a security camera. Yes, you could put some tape over the LED, and that is exactly what I have done. But the bigger issue is that Google changed how this camera operates two years after I bought it and decided that it was the right change for me without giving me a choice. That speaks volumes.

Even when they were new they were unreliable. When I bought the 4 cams Nest was the only game in town. Thankfully the market has matured around Nest and there is no reason to go with a product/vendor this unreliable. Their video storage service is abusively expensive and you are forced to use their service if you want to record. Finally, you cannot connect to your cameras locally, i.e. to view your camera(s) you must go to their website; this is just a foundationally flawed architecture that is either a total lack of interest in making a flexible product or clumsy attempt to capture Nest Cam customers in their buggy, over priced ecosystem.

However, Nest really tries to nickel and dime their customers by charging a hefty monthly subscription for Nest Aware with each camera. For residential users who might periodically use a camera to check on their home during vacation or on a pet when away these cameras aren’t worth the cost. Like all of Nest’s other products, the camera integrates seamlessly into the website and has a slew of controls. The weighted stand allows for simple placement throughout your house as long as it’s in close proximity to an electrical outlet. The motion alert feature is great for when you are away, but I wish Nest would concede some short amount of video history for casual users.",Pricey compact design

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Oct 2016,Jessica Weissenburger,"This is an amazing camera.  The quality is great and it was super easy to link the camera to my phone.  I decided to subscribe to Nest because it gives notifications and it saves 7 days of video.  The subscription is $100 for a year or $10 per month for 7 days of storage or $300 for a year or $30 a month for 30 days of storage. You can have the option of getting a phone or email notification anytime the Nest detects activity or sound.  I decided to only get notifications by phone for activity because it does pick up pet movement.  So if you have a lot of pets you will get a lot of notifications if they're moving around a lot.  There are sometimes when I see movement from my pets and I did not get a notification, but so far I have gotten a notification anytime a person is moving around. The night vision camera makes it very easy to view movement at night.  It's very simple to navigate through footage and it uses bars for lengths of time where there was activity so you can skip past inactive time.  You can watch the feed live and even use the mic on your phone to talk through the camera, which can potentially be fun. The camera does pick up sound but there is a slight delay in the sound if you're watching live.  You can have the option to turn off the camera using your phone or to have it not give notifications if you're home.  You can use this on multiple phones with no problems.  I have it set up on an iPhone and Android. The camera is stationary, so you will want to position it to where you want to see activity.  It does have a very wide view.  I have it on top of a bookshelf in the corner and it gets about 2/3 of the room on the camera.  The only part it misses is the space directly to the side and behind where the camera is positioned. Update: I've had this camera for several months now and have had no issues.  Works great and it even gives you a notification when the camera goes offline because of a power outage or if your internet goes down.  It does need internet to function.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jan 2019,Jose,"I wanted this to work, I truly did. But without Nest Aware this camera is useless. There needs to be a big disclaimer that there is NO RECORDING without the MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION to NEST AWARE. New customers don't truly realize what comes with the purchase until after the first month because Nest gives you 1 month subscription to their Cloud services and then try to suck you into a monthly or yearly subscription just to view basic cameras functionalities. The whole idea of any camera is to record and playback. Nest monetized the entire ""playback"" functionality because without their cloud service the Cam becomes a basic webcam; all you can do is stream live footage but you CANNOT rewind or play back anything! Nest advertises that they give you the last 3 hours for free but even that is not actually recording. Instead you get still images for the past 3 hours about any ""motion"" or ""sound"" detected but you can't play any of it. It's not even useful stills at that, you get maybe 1 still frame for every 1-2 minutes or so. So if someone breaks into your house and the entire time it happens in front of the camera, you may only get to see 1 still photo of the burglary and it may not even be a good one. As for the time where there is nothing moving or making sound, the Cam is still recording everything but Nest blurs everything out in the app so that you can't view anything (again requiring Nest Aware to ""unlock"" this video footage). It would have been nice to give all customers at least 12 hours or even 3 hours of COMPLETE previous recordings. But to give nothing and require everyone to pay at least $50 a year on top of your already expensive camera is rediculous considering that Wyze cam does everything Nest cam does for only $26 PERIOD. And Wyze includes 14 days cloud storage (with actual video playback) for FREE and you get the ability to insert an SD Card for local storage.  Luckily I bought this Nest Cam during Christmas shopping and Amazon extended my return window. They already approved my return and it should be evident which unit will be my replacement.

Why would you force people to move over if you don't have all the features yet? Anyway, eventually our registered credit card expired and we were asked to update (in a not very friendly manner btw), which we tried to do that but frankly could not figure out how. Needless to say, the experience was not very user friendly (and frankly we were not especially motivated to jump through hoops anyway). So we unplugged the camera, sighed a little with relief that we won't be constantly using part of our internet bandwidth anymore or paying a subscription fee for something we don't use all that much), and said goodbye to the camera as we put it in a drawer. We are looking for a better camera to use moving forward, hopefully one that won't require a subscription. Oh, and we were finally inspired to write this review today when we received this not-so-friendly e-mail from Nest: ""We haven’t gotten your Nest Aware subscription payment for the last 60 days. We’ve canceled your subscription and deleted your Video History. Still need Nest Aware? You can purchase it again with a valid credit card here. If you have any questions, contact Nest Support.""

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Nov 2019,Dennis Eichenlaub,"I have three major complaints with most security cameras. First, it’s easy for hackers to attack them. Manufacturers are too busy developing new models to fix bugs in the old ones. Nest is a Google company. Google is very good with security. Of course, you must secure your Google account with a strong password and preferably with 2-factor authentication. If somebody breaks into your Google account, they can turn the camera off. Or they can turn it on, look around your home, and even talk to the babysitter. This would totally freak out any teenager I know, and rightfully so. My second complaint is that the cameras work fine until a glitch or power failure causes the camera to drop the Wi-Fi connection. After that, they won’t work until you unplug the camera to reset it. The Nest camera is excellent hardware and very robust. After a glitch, the Nest camera reconnects to the Wi-Fi without fail. It also sends a notification so you know if the camera is disconnected from the Wi-Fi. My third complaint is that most cameras are stupid. I had a camera send dozens of notifications a day because the answering machine light was blinking. Nest does intrusion detection on the server, not in the camera. Nest Aware is an option (with a monthly fee) that adds smart intrusion detection. “Sound” becomes “Person talking”, “Dog barking”, and “All other sounds”. “Motion” becomes “People” and “All other motion”.  “People” detection works very well. If a person walks into the room, Nest servers will trigger a person event. As long as the person stays in the room, there are no more person events. If the person exits the room, then re-enters it a few seconds later, Nest triggers another person event. Nest Aware also records video and lets you make video clips. Events don’t always trigger notifications. This drove me nuts. I was waving my arms in front of the camera and not getting notifications. The first 3 Nest support people I talked with didn’t know why. After a notification is sent, there are no additional notifications until a 10 to 15 minute “cool down” period is over. If a second event is detected halfway through the cool down, the timer starts over again. There must be no events for the entire cool down period before Nest sends another notification. Also, one can watch the video, see that events are declared, and receive no notifications (as I did). If someone is watching the video, they don’t need notifications. So says Nest. Notifications can be sent to your smart phone as a push notification and/or sent to your Email. Email notifications come with an attached picture. If other family members install the Nest ap on their phone, they can share camera control and notifications using their Google account. I like the privacy that Nest provides. A green light, which cannot be disabled, indicates when the camera is sending video to the server. Here’s some things I don’t like about Nest. Because intrusion detection is done at the server, Nest continuously sends video when the camera is on. You can set “Bandwidth/Quality” to low, medium, or high. But if your internet service has restricted bandwidth or data limits, Nest may not be for you. The “pictures” attached to Email notifications are actually frame grabs from a compressed video. Even if video quality is set to High, there is not much detail in a person’s face. If you don’t use the monthly service, intrusion detection is stupid. You won’t get dozens of notifications a day from a blinking light. But you will get a notification every time the timer turns the lights on. Finally, Nest support people are friendly and helpful with normal setup options. But they don’t have good in-depth knowledge of how Nest works. (Hence this long review.) Here’s a small nit that Google might eventually fix. My Nest ap is on my Android phone. If I turn on “Do not Disturb”, I don’t get a sound when I receive a notification. Do Not Disturb does not have a way of allowing Nest push notifications through. If I’m wrong about this, please let me know in the comments, because I would love to have this feature. Nest is a great product. In my opinion, most of the negative reviews it has received are not warranted. Many of its important features are not appreciated. Buy the Nest and turn it on. It will do what you want it to do. But don’t try to figure out why it does what it does. It will drive you nuts.",Nest Knows Best

I was one of the first people to start with nest years ago. I had 2 cams at the time. One started showing in monochrome colors and though it was out of warrantee they sent me a refurbished replacement. That one suddenly stopped working within the year or less. The other I had in issue with because IT GOT HACKED!!!! Yes, admittedly by Nest because there was no way around what happen. The camera should have been off while I was home and as I walked by one day I realized the light was blue. I was shocked because I KNEW i had it turned off. I approached the camera and as I got closer and i was looking into it and it turned off. The person was looking into my loft as I was approaching. That freaked me out. Soon after that one suddenly stopped working as well. So, recently I had an issue with crazy excessive noise from the upstairs neighbors and torturous retaliation they took because of my complaining to management, Its almost impossible to get someone evicted in the state of California so I needed proof of all the things they were doing to us so I bought 3 NestCams. Unfortunately NestCams COULD NOT not pick up the terribly loud banging that iPhone picked up clearly. I don't understand why, so disappointing because that's what I bought them for. You could hear someone whisper on these cams but NO major sounds, it was BEYOND disappointing. I could only use them to visually capture us being startled awake at 5am each morning - luckily it was obvious by watching but it did not have the most important component I needed. Also, the output mic sucks. My dog is skittish to say the least and she cannot hear when I speak into the mic...i don't understand why the audio/sound is SO BAD on these. I ended up keeping them but I must say I still fear for my privacy and feel like I have to babysit them and flipping them downward when home or turning them off/unplugged. Oh, that reminds me...the home/away option doesn't work, I have all the settings correctly programmed. They never turn off when we are home, ever, so you keep getting notifications every moment wheel they are on and the censors go off. The ones I had a few years ago didnt have the home/away working either. I thought by now that would have been fixed but no. I hope these get better soon, they aren't cheap.",Disappointing.

When you are talking on it, it mutes the sound you hear and you cannot carry a conversation on it like you can on a walkie talkie or phone. Why it mutes the sound from you hearing what people are speaking back to you?  I don't know, but this was a deal breaker for me because I have 2 3 and 5 year olds. When I'm in the garage working out, and I see them doing something and I need to say something to them, they can only hear me but I can't hear what my kids area saying back.  Plus, the volume of my voice is very low.  I should of bought the outdoor cam because it had bigger speakers, plus being made for outdoors makes it more durable. THE MAJOR DEAL BREAKER is the forced monthly subscription price.  If you opt out, you only get 3 hours of rollback time, and it continuously deletes everything every minute it passes 3 hours.  I mean, who buys an expensive piece of equipment for 3hours of playback? I would of kept it if it allowed 1 week of free cloud memory playback access, but combination of bad talk-back and subscription makes this a dud. I was planning on buying 5 more Nest Cameras too total close to $1000. I decided to steer away from NEST CAM. I am looking into Wyze Cam. 14 days free cloud memory, no monthly subscriptions and it has all the features this has.  Right now it is flying off the shelves for $25 bucks a cam.

It's a fantastic product that works extremely well, but the subscription service behind these cameras is unscalable and expensive at $10/mo per device with no quantity discount. I bought two of them, and found myself facing the daunting prospect of paying $240/yr on subscription service alone just to use them. Without the subscription service, most of the useful features are *disabled*. Until the service is brought in line with competitors pricing (like Ring, which is $99/yr for unlimited devices), Nest cameras should be avoided. Not sure what they're trying to pull here, but as a longtime Nest customer this is my first return and I am profoundly disappointed in the company for the awful and greedy contract. We bought them sight unseen just on the basis of the house full of Nest equipment we have had nothing bus positive experiences with, but the service makes these untenable. We will be seriously rethinking whether or not to continue buying Nest products after this. Bad show Nest. Get it together. As a longtime customer, I am returning these, and will be seriously rethinking whether or not to continue to support you as a business after this poor performance.

Especially when you consider the total lack of quantity discount for multiple devices. Honestly, I was outraged, and felt completely ripped off. I strong encourage others to avoid then.

The part where it all comes crashing down is when you try to deal with subscriptions. Problem number 1: You have to CANCEL your subscription and lose all your saved footage before you can upgrade to a new subscription with longer storage. This is a huge problem because it leaves you with gaps in your surveillance. Problem number 2: It takes Nest systems a long time to synchronize subscription information with cameras. You cannot simply cancel and resubscribe. You will have to cancel and wait hours or days for the subscription information to be synchronized, and only then will Nest accept your payment for a new subscription. This is an incredibly bad way to run a business in today's marketplace where payments are, and should be, immediate. Do a google search and you will find these problems with their subscription service are widespread and ongoing, also well known to their tech support people, whom I have spoken with. Otherwise everything else about these cameras is great. It's really too bad that Nest shoots itself in the foot with the subscriptions.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2018,Raymond L.,"I did a lot of research before choosing the NEST cams.  And I really wanted to like them… But after using them (one indoor, one outdoor) for two months I simply cannot recommend.  It was a very frustrating experience and I wouldn’t buy if I had to do it all over again.  I tried to be as specific as possible to clearly define my exact issues and complaints.  Perhaps folks can suggest solutions/workarounds. The NEST app is not intuitive, difficult to navigate, and buggy --- to the point of being maddening when you first start using it.  My whole reason for going with NEST is that I thought the interface and features would be well-designed.  I was wrong.  I expected better from them.  Here are my main issues: 1.  After initial setup I had to delete & reinstall both my cameras because each was under a different ‘Home’.  If you use the “+” button in upper right corner it will add a 2nd Home…  you must go under 1st Home and choose “Add Product” under the tools pulldown in order to add additional cameras --- completely non-intuitive and not how most apps use the “+” button (eg.  TP-Link KASA app uses the same “+” button to add devices).  I would think that many users would fall into this same trap.  The only way out is to delete everything and start over.  Not a good way to start… 2.  NEST has ensured that this camera is not useful unless you pay for a subscription.  They do this by eliminating most of the features if you don’t have one (Zone motion triggers, person detection, see past video, etc).  Without a subscription you get ZERO video archive (some reviewers were saying it was limited to 3hrs or 12hrs, but this is false).  You only get a still picture of motion or generic sound alarm that occurred WITHIN THE LAST 3 HOURS, and the still may or may not actually have the image of what generated the alarm.  So if something happens in the middle of the night you won’t have a record of it the next morning.  They are trying very hard to make this camera equivalent to a live-only camera unless you buy their subscription! 3.  This is a cloud-based system, meaning that you have NO WAY to view any video unless sending to the cloud.  The bandwidth usage is completely outrageous!  I got an email from my internet provider after two weeks stating that I exceeded my quota of 300GB/mo.  I was uploading 5GB per day for ‘Medium’ quality!  For two cameras on high quality it consumes 600GB per month!  The app gives data/bandwidth requirements under “Quality and Bandwidth” pulldown, along with data hog warning – see screencap below.  This is ridiculous and will exceed most internet provider data plans.  So I can only turn on the cameras for a few hours each day and reduce the video quality --- so what’s the point of paying for “high def” cameras if I can’t use them?  And why pay even more for a subscription if I can’t fully utilize it?  And it isn’t possible to use cameras at all without sending to cloud, so now I am wishing I had bought something else… 4.  The NEST app provides integration with the TP-Link ‘KASA’ app, specifically:  When toggling between “Home/Away” mode you can trigger specific SCENES.  I have my TP-Link color LED bulb in Foyer turn GREEN or RED (RED=Away, GREEN=Home) anytime the NEST app sees that I physically leave my house (linked to my phone location) or someone manually toggles  “Home/Away” which also turns my cameras ON/OFF.  This manual toggle can be done either within NEST app OR the KASA app (icon added under devices—see screencap below).  In KASA, my wife can see the color of the bulb and shows what time I left (or arrived) at the house. - Note:  You can independently schedule cam ON/OFF times and this does not impact “Home/Away” status (ie.  lights do not change status) - Warning:  Periodically my indoor cam does not shut off when status changes to “Home”.  If I don’t notice right away, eats up a lot of my data quota! - Warning:  Every time you logout and log back in you will have to reconfigure the “Home/Away” settings – no way around this.  Bad software! - Warning:  The linkage between the KASA and the NEST app keeps breaking… doesn’t work as advertised.  I completely wasted my money… 5.  Software issues on the NEST side --- all day 1/4/18 I was unable to view live video or turn the cameras ON or OFF.  The cams were indeed working and could view past video from this timeframe.  After more than 1hr of troubleshooting I gave up.  Today everything is suddenly working properly again.  I figure it must have been an issue on the NEST side…  That is the problem with cloud-based systems, you are dependent on their systems to work as well as yours. 6.  Not a big deal, but every time you install a new camera (or delete and reinstall existing camera) as I have had to do numerous times, it gives completion error msg: “Oh No!  Something has gone wrong”, even though everything has installed correctly.  I really hate this software. In summary, the NEST cameras are not reliable and I will avoid NEST products in the future.",Buggy software and you must buy a subscription to make these cameras useful

I purchased a 3 pack and a single camera (total 4 cameras) for my mother's apartment. My Mom is 86 years old and is in stage 3 of Alzheimer's disease. She forgets everything all of the time. We live 1200 miles apart. The Nest Cam has helped me help her with her daily routines. We do not use the Nest Cam with a video tape. We just use it as a live camera so I can check in with her & help her follow through on her chores. The picture quality is excellent. There is even sound so you can have a full conversation over the Nest Cam. You can talk and be heard and listen to what the person at the other end of the camera is saying. Cameras were very fast and easy to set up and move around. Setting up your on line account was simple. Anyone can do it. You need ""0"" experience to set up & use. When using the camera this way, there is no monthly charge of any kind. If you want to move the camera around frequently, just purchase an extension cord. I frequently help my mother while she is on the computer. My mother moves the camera directly in front of her computer screen so I can see what she is doing, read her computer screen & assist her with tasks she finds difficult. I can make sure she turns off the oven after she cooks. The customer service at Nest is among the best I have ever come across. They are friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and available 24/7. I called them a few time before purchasing the Nest Cam and 2X afterwards.I was speaking to someone at Nest within 1-2 minutes each time I called which was very impressive. I am used to being put on hold listening to bad music for 10-15 minutes when calling customer service at other companies. Another good feature is that Nest e-mails you every time there is a break in Wi-Fi service. The Nest camera system would be a great security camera system but it is also ideal to help and keep track of elderly parents. I highly recommend the Nest Cam system.",Nest Cam is a MUST HAVE for those living far away from elderly parents
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 May 2016,dd71,"I purchased the Nest Cam Security Camera 3-pack. It arrived on time and was beautifully packaged. Set-up took a little time, but was made easier thanks to smart use of bar codes on the back of each camera, in conjunction with the Nest App. So far so good. For most home users, the cameras are useless without a cloud storage subscription. With a subscription, video is stored in the cloud, and you can review historic activity at any point in your history (10 or 30 days) or upon events for example if motion or sound was detected. Without a subscription, you can only watch the video live. Not very useful for security purposes. Nest will not allow you to use third party cloud storage providers so you're locked into using their facility, which is priced much higher than regular cloud storage. So I purchased a 3-pack of licenses to go with the three cameras. Unfortunately, Nest only associated two of the licenses with two of my cameras, leaving the third camera without a storage ability, despite paying for it. The third license, according to my account, will be applied to my next camera purchase, essentially rendering one of my three cameras useless. I have no plans to buy another camera. Clearly a bug in their system caused one of my cameras and licenses not to be matched. I contacted Nest support and they would not associate the unmatched license and camera. They told me they may re-review the case once the camera storage trial storage period expired. Despite buying three cameras and three licenses, I have one camera which i useless one license which Nest are trying to get me to buy a fourth camera to use it. Worse, for a business in the security business, they will only review this case once my home is unsecure. Up to this point I've loved Nest's smoke alarm product. I have five of them and they have served me well. But I'd warn people away from the nest security cams until Nest have fixed the bugs and improved the level of their support, which is close to non-existant. I'm very disappointed with this product.",Bugs and lousy support - Not recommended

I was looking for one for a while that records continuously. I also didn't want one that I would have to worry about charging all the time. I have it place in my puppy's room to check up on him when I'm at work. First time mom to a fur baby and I worry! The free trail nest aware subscription was nice, but not worth $10 a month. If they ever make a $5 a month plan I would get that. The feed is clear on the app and on a computer. The camera picks up sound clearly and using the microphone to speak is pretty nice. The feed does seem to have a 3 second delay and will become distorted if you zoom in. It's get very warm at times, but it's plugged in so I expect that. Overall a good camera for my needs.

The camera itself seems to be very good quality. The set up was a breeze and camera was operational in just a couple of minutes. The reason for the 1 star review is that if you don't subscribe to their Nest aware that starts at $10 a month you will have to stare at a banner ad on all of your devices that you have the Nest app installed on nagging you to subscribe to it. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Nest support this morning and was even transferred to a senior level tech who told me the only way to get rid of the banner ad was to subscribe to Nest aware. Guess what? I figured out another way to get rid of the banner ad. I am boxing it up and returning it! Nest should be ashamed to subject customers who have spent good money on their products to this. I am still within my 30 days on my other items I may just box it all up and go with a different brand.,Banner Ad? Are you kidding me?

However, the nest cam app is very user friendly and intuitively designed. Kinda makes sense since it was originally founded by an engineer who worked at Apple and it is now owned by Google. The motion and sound alerts work very well too. This camera is definitely better than one of those cheap, never-heard-of-companys' security cameras. I know because I owned one before. The app UI was crappy, some options were only available in Chinese, etc, etc. In order to fully take advantage of this camera, you will need $50/year subscription + good wifi in your home because it will eat up your data at least 300GB per month if you decide to record everything in high quality. Without the subscription, I wouldn't recommend it as you can only view videos in live mode (no recording). The set up was super simple and it probably took me about 5 minutes from opening the box to fully operational nestcam.",Expensive but excellent product

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2017,Elizabeth,"The cameras work fine but the customer service and self-service options on the account dashboard have to be the absolute worst of any subscription-service I've seen.  Every issue requires a 20-40 minute phone conversation (or more accurately, sitting on hold waiting for an agent) for such simple issues as de-activating and then re-activating a subscription (why is this not possible via self-service on the dashboard?), or re-charging a payment method that didn't go through at first (again, why do I need to call customer service to get this done?).  I have not had an exchange with customer service that has not frustrated the absolute life out of me which is amazing as it seems their issues could very simply be solved by a) hiring more staff, b) better training that staff, and c) integrating more functionality into their dashboard so customers can solve extremely simple issues on their own. I have been subscribing to the camera history feature for over a year now but given my difficulties in reaching a competent agent (please, Nest, just recharge the credit card - that is literally all that needs to be done, just re-run the card), I'm giving up and sticking to the free streaming as it is just too frustrating to continue to try to get help.  Congrats on talking yourself out of my $20/month subscription, I guess.  If I had to do it all over again I would certainly avoid purchasing cameras from Nest for the sole reason that their customer service is frustrating to deal with beyond belief.","Cameras are fine, customer service is so terrible as to make the service mostly unusable"

I cannot tell you how much I have come to hate the Nest Cam. I don't think the camera, itself, is even workable anymore. It goes offline at random. And when it is online, it pauses at any sign of movement, which is really beside the point. My dog gets out of her bed, the camera freezes. Someone breaks into my apartment, the camera freezes. So, yeah ... get a different camera. v v v v v I purchased this camera to watch over my senior dog while I was away from home, and while the camera is pretty good in terms of range and resolution, it's impossible to give five stars to this product because the Nest app that controls it is far too unreliable. It kinda sucks, actually. The app crashes far too often (there's been an outage for the last 10 minutes, and I can't access either my camera or my thermostat remotely ... and I know it's not my wifi, because my other smart home apps are still connected and working). I can no longer get good resolution when I zoom ... it simply hyper zooms beyond the point I've established, and all I see is pixelation. Let's talk alerts. I'm not getting any, despite setting very specific alerts. One day, I got tons of alerts, every time my dog got out of her crate ... but I didn't get an alert when the maintenance guy entered my home. If I were relying on it as a security device, I'd give it a big, fat fail. UPDATE: I can no longer recommend the Nest Indoor Cam. Any movement causes the screen to freeze. And that kind of defeats the purpose of the camera. If you're looking for an indoor security cam, look elsewhere.",Good camera with very disappointing app
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 May 2017,Your Huckleberry,"I have had the camera for a month now and love it. It came with a month free of ""Nest Aware"" and I can say that I felt it was worth it enough to get a subscription at the end of the trial period. The video quality is excellent. That's honestly the best part about the camera. If anyone was to come into my house when I'm not there, I would be able to easily identify them.  I can also push a button and talk to whoever is in my house through the camera. This camera provides peace of mind when we are away from the house or on vacation. We have an alarm system, but the ability to check in on things is great. I have pets, so I don't use the motion alerts, I use the ""person alerts"" that come with the nest aware subscription. I've tested it and it works every time I've tested it. The only time I get a false alarm is when my cat jumps up on the back of the couch to look out the window because the camera sees him as a 4 foot tall cat man I suppose. The Nest Aware subscription is $100 a year for the first camera and then $50 a year for each additional camera. A lot of the 1 star reviews I've read like the camera, but people seem pretty irate about the cost of the plan. Maybe I'm missing something, but I actually see that as a good value. Not sure if the other people writing reviews have any experience with how much home security costs, but in the realm of monthly subscriptions, that is cheap and the product is worth it. Call me crazy, but I don't find it unacceptable, evil, or taking advantage of me to charge $100 a year for 24/7 HD monitoring that I can access for up to 10 days. To each their own. If you disagree, just make sure to leave a comment about how dumb I am. That will really show me. People mention ""Arlo"" as the cheaper option if you have a problem with the monthly subscription. I'm not saying anything about Arlo because I don't know anything about it, just make sure you do your research and know the difference of what you miss out on, if anything. I have a friend who uses Arlo and they love it. She showed me on her phone and the video quality looked good. A tip to parents of young kids...this camera is much better quality than the baby monitor we bought for around the same price, HOWEVER, you would need to utilize the motion/audio sensor or just constantly monitor your phone or computer. I've not used it as a baby monitor so I'm not sure the drawbacks, but like I said, the image quality is amazing.",Love the quality. Going to get the outdoor ones as well.
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jan 2016,Chris S.,"I wish I could get a refund. I have three Nest Cams, and these cameras constantly register false alarms to the point of me simply turning them off.  They run burning hot, as well.  I have numerous Nest protects and Nest thermostats, and they are great, but the Nest Cam is a horrible product crippled by Google Greed. Over two years, you can either have a single Nest camera+two years of Nest Aware subscriptions, or FIVE Arlo cameras, plus $40 left in your wallet.  Are you better covered by one corded camera, or five cordless cameras that can be placed anywhere? I now have two Netgear Arlo units, as well.  Zero false alarms (they have an actual heat-based motion sensor instead of the Nest ghetto-hack of using the camera sensor to detect motion, which is triggered by anything from falling leaves to birds casting shadows through windows as they fly.) Just as important, Arlo gives you a WEEK of streaming recording for FREE.  Got motion triggered?  You can look it up on the Arlo site, and you can even download the offending video if you need it later (or if it's a cute video of something you want to keep, which is more often the case). You can pay Google...er Alphabet more money (anywhere from $100 to $300 per year, forever) to get the ability to hopefully reduce false alarms and video storage, or they could just make their stuff suck less without bleeding all of us for more cash.  If you don't pay their ransom, the cameras are essentially useless.  You can't even see a still picture of what triggered the motion alert!  Deviously, the free trial ends just as the return period ends, so you're stuck with this piece of crap.  There's also the question of if you want Google/Alphabet to hear and see everything in your house.  They claim that cameras turned off don't transmit anything, but they sure run hot for something that is just waiting for an online wakeup call. Given the high end of $300 Nest/Google wants per year for Nest Aware subscriptions, you should ask yourself if you would be safer and better covered by one Nest ($199 + $300) or THREE Arlo cameras ($159 + $150 + $150, all with 7 days of free motion recording).  By year two of suffering through constant Nest false alarms, you could have bought two more Arlo cameras for the $300 Nest Aware subscription.  There's of course the much better Arlo motion detection, as well, because staring at hours of motionless footage isn't especially useful. Over two years, then, you can either have one Nest camera+two years of Nest Aware subscriptions, or FIVE Arlo cameras, plus $40 left in your wallet.  Do you really think one Nest Cam is going to cover you better than five Arlo cameras?  Keep in mind that the Arlo cameras have no wires, are weatherproof for indoor/outdoor use, and don't get hot enough to fry an egg on.  They can also be used with rechargeable batteries.  If you have your wifi router and Arlo base on a battery backup (~$100), Arlo cams will keep recording even if the power is cut (vs putting every single Nest Cam on a separate UPS... add another ~$100 per Nest plus the ~$100 for your router).  Arlos are definitely not perfect (they should add an external USB port and an SD card slot for offline recording, and they should have more settings available on their website), but they are a 4.5 out of 5 vs the Nest's 1 out of 5. iPhone and iPad users, you should also know that the Nest app is broken and doesn't stream video about 40% of the time.  Instead, you get a lovely blue spinner when you're frantically trying to check what false alarm the Nest Cam is sending you.  Is that a big surprise from the company that also owns Android? Nest reps, I'd be thrilled to send these three back to you for a refund.",I have 3.  Buy ARLO and save yourselves!  It's too late for me...
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jul 2017,Pismo,I am very much in the NEST eco-system and this is by far their worst device. It quite frequently disconnects from the wifi and spontaneously reboots itself. This is problematic because then the app on the phone shows no activity and goes to sleep. Given we use this as a baby monitor it makes it useless to us. The frequent nagging to get their subscription service is also really frustrating. If I opt out of it stop asking me to sign up! I was initially concerned that the wifi disconnection was on my end but I've placed an Arlo camera in the room to see if it disconnected from my wifi too. After 3 weeks we've seen no disconnects from the Arlo and the NEST disconnects at least once a day. Needless to say the NEST is getting taken down now especially since it doesn't work with the new Echo Show and the competing Arlo does. Love the thermostat and protect but this camera is overpriced and unreliable.,Unreliable

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2018,Tyler Baruch,"We purchased a Nest camera to use as a baby monitor when we transitioned our 5-month-old into her own bedroom. Although the Nest is not designed for this specific purpose, we LOVE using it as a monitor and plan to use it as a security camera when we no longer need it for our baby. We have been using it for three months. There are a few downsides (see below) to plan for but the Pros by far outweigh the Cons in our view. Pros: -The night vision is incredibly clear on our Nest. We have it hanging right above our baby's crib and can clearly see her regardless of the amount of light in her room. -The phone alerts make it so easy to tell when our baby wakes from her naps and from sleep. We can be a floor away, get an alert, and pull up the camera to decide whether we should give her a minute to self-soothe or go upstairs to get her. In the morning, when I am sleeping lightly anyway, my phone vibrates with a Nest alert and I know the baby is starting to stir. -We appreciate that Nest doesn't necessitate lugging an additional device around to monitor our baby since it works through our phones. -When one or both of us is away from home and there is another caregiver with her we can still access our Nest to check in on naps, etc. -When the app is opened the audio is crystal clear. We know if she is babbling, crying, or stirring. Since we sleep in a room close enough to hear her without a monitor at night, we LOVE that we don't have the sounds of a full-time audio monitor blaring into our bedroom (see Con below). Cons: -There is no ""full time"" audio function with the Nest since it was not initially designed as a baby monitor. As a result, if you want to ""listen"" to what is happening in the baby's room, you have to go into the app on your phone to tune in. This is a potential downfall for anyone who does not sleep in a bedroom close enough to hear their baby's cries without the aid of a monitor. The workaround for this is to turn your alerts on high when you go to bed, but then you are alerted every time there is a minor noise which may get annoying considering how many noises babies make at night that don't necessitate you waking up. So, if you want a monitor that allows you full-time hearing access in their room without turning on the app this may not be for you. -It definitely looks like a camera (duh) and considering our baby's room is mostly neutral-colored it does stand out. The white cam might have been a little better but this is a minor issue and the camera does not take away from the overall aesthetic of the room.",Nest = Great Baby Monitor

The reasons why I rated it 2 rather than 5 is that there is no local storage or viewing. - If the internet goes out it is useless. - With Comcast's new data cap it makes it an even harder sell. It uploads 24-7, so if you have it set on 1080p (which looks awesome, by the way) it will eat up close to 500GB of data on its's own. You can set it to only be on during certain times, but that is not realistic for my application. - Also, if you want to take advantage of any of its features (besides live viewing) you MUST pay a monthly fee which makes an expensive product even more expensive. Like I said, the build quality and picture quality is awesome, but be prepared to keep paying for it through the subscription service and additional data if you have a cap.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2018,Allan R,"First of all, the picture quality on this camera is not good.  I have top of the line high speed internet, and even set to the highest resolution, the picture quality is very poor.  It seems to correct itself once in a while, but keeps reverting back to very blocky, blurry picture.  Almost unusable. However, the worst part of Nest is their support products, such as the app and website.  If I had known what I know now about them, I would have NEVER EVER EVER purchased a camera from Nest. The app is a straight up joke. Virtually none of the features work, including the Home/Away assist feature, which is only sort of important! It's supposed to work with phone location, and change your notification preferences depending on whether you are home or not. I do not want constant notifications when I am home, but more importantly, I DO want notifications when a person approaches my house and I am away. But of course this feature simply does not work. I have to manually change it every time. Also, even when I am away, and I have it set properly, many times it does not work. I will go back and review the activity from the app, and I will see a time when a person or something should have triggered a notification to my phone, and it did not happen. The solution from customer support is always to ""uninstall the app"" or attempt some other ridiculous ways to try and fix problems. It's almost as if they are sitting around laughing, seeing how many different stupid hoops they can make users jump through, as a joke. ""Sir, the solution to this is you need to stand on your head and eat your shoe, this should clear up the problem"". Despite repeated please to Nest customer support to add custom notification sounds, it still has not been added. As with any smartphone, I am bombarded by various notifications throughout the day, from text messages, phone calls, emails, other apps, etc. It would be nice to be able to personalize a chime so that I know it's a Nest notification, and I can view it right away. As far as the website goes, I recently tried to input a new payment method. Did not work properly, and did not make the new card the default payment method. The solution offered is to unsubscribe to my Nest Aware, then get a partial refund on the unused portion of my subscription, delete my old payment method, then input a new card, and re-subscribe. Of course be sure to pay in full for the new subscription, even though this is our fault for our website not working properly! I could write a 100-page book on the many problems with their app and website, but I think you get the idea. It's a complete nightmare, and clearly they have no idea how to fix their many problems, as the solution is always to ""just start over"". Delete everything, uninstall everything, see if that helps. Save yourself the headache and find another ""smart"" camera system that works better. It's not a high bar to clear.","Camera video quality is terrible, but their app and website are even WORSE!"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Apr 2017,el,"The Nest Cam is a great camera for someone who isn't technically savy or doesn't have actual security needs to address. I'll summarize the pros and cons below and give a mor thorough review after that. Pros: • easy setup • decent picture and sound • one of the more intuitive apps • two-way audio • nice mounting bracket Cons: • no local stream • no local storage option • paid subscription isn't very economical • no POE or POE adapter from Nest • USB only of power • pricey for what it does • would not consider this a security device Before I go any further, I want to say I like this camera and I will probably buy another down the road when I have spare money for novelty items. That being said, if you need something to address actual security issues this might not be the best camera for you. It is 100% reliant on the internet to do anything. It has no local options at the time of this review and if you want recorded footage you have to pay a monthly fee. For those out there who aren't as technical and might wonder ""why does this matter?"", consider the following point - if you are genuinely concerned with security or reliability of seeing the camera at any given time, do you really want to depend on having a camera that can only be viewed when your internet connection is working? Think about service outages with bad weather or general issues with internet providers where you still have power at your house or office but the internet goes out. Real security devices have to be reliable and highly available. This is neither. It is as reliable and available as your connection to the internet. Nest could do a few things to improve this, such as add a local streaming option that would allow you to at least view the camera on local wifi, or add edge recording that would let you record to a micro SD card for redundancy. I'm not sure that fits into their business model of IoT paid subscriptions though. The lack or power options also makes it hard to take this camera serious. It's great that any one can simply plug it into the wall and it's ready to go, but that works the same in the sense that if you're putting this camera in a easily accessible spot by a plug, it would be too hard for someone to unplug it either intentionally or accidentally. You can resolve this with third party USB POE injectors, but this would require a little more work than most people would want to do. I understand this camera is marketed as an easy to use, ready to go out of the box solution, but it's not a real security device and for all intensive purposes it is a glorified web cam that only works through the internet.",Nice but shouldn't be considered for actual security needs

It's all cloud based so it's why they're charging you for it. Personally I have an 8TB HDD that I could store the video files in but then of course Nest won't be bringing in revenue. Basically after the free trials, the cameras are paperweight and are only feesible when you're actually watching them 24/7. Otherwise someone could walk in front of them and break into your house, steal something off your front door, or anything else, and you get no notification or video capture. You do get ""snapshots"" every 4 hours or so...but if something happened between those other hours...you're basically SOL. For the price of these cameras individually...I should be able to save the video capture myself if I wanted to or put them on the cloud for $100-$300 per camera.

The camera arrived same day with my Prime membership.  It took about a minute to set up, in part because I already have a Nest account, but it wouldn’t take much longer without one.  It is basically, plug it in, click on add a device in the app, scan the barcode on the back of the camera and it connects to your account and your Wi-Fi… it is up and running. The camera is easy to control in the app.  We have our set up to turn off automatically when we are home (it knows by the proximity of our cell phones), and it notifies us if the dogs bark or if the camera sees a person (not a dog).  The camera has an extremely wide viewing angle (130 degrees – but seems wider) and the 1080P resolution is phenomenal.  While the camera itself does not pan zoom or tilt, the picture can be “zoomed in” on by using normal phone gestures on the smartphone app.  You will obviously lose some resolution, but we have found it to be quite acceptable still. The couple of negatives on this camera are 1) video storage is not free after the initial trial and 2) the app somehow recognizes dogs less than 10 pounds as people and we get some false alerts on our phone app.  The video storage is not an issue for us as I am using the camera as a doggie cam, not a security cam.  The alerts can be a bit annoying, but we just use them as an excuse to check in on our two dogs. In addition to the camera, I bought a AC Outlet Mount by Wasserstein (also from Amazon) for $16.99 – in part because I hate cords!  The camera snaps into it just like it mounts in the OEM base.  The outlet mount comes with its own AC adapter and a short (~6”) micro USB cable.  Using this setup, we could plug the camera in directly across from our dogs’ ex pen at their level and get a great view of them with the Nest Cam.  I love that this really cleaned up the installation and look of the camera.  Since our camera is mounted in a high traffic area, I wish the mount had a way to screw it to the outlet the way some surge protectors do, but thus far we have not had an issue with bumping it. Overall, we love the Nest Cam and the Wasserstein AC Outlet Mount.  I would give both 4-1/2 stars.",Great for our doggie cam & another easy to use Nest product!

We also own the thermostat and several smoke detectors. This camera has a great picture and is very quick and easy to set up. I like that I can see the video on any device just by logging into my Nest account. It has a wide field of view that allows me to see the entire room. I also like that I can zoom in and the video quality pretty much stays the same. I also like that it is able to sense activity and can record a clip. The only thing I don't like is that after the 30 day trial period I will lose the ability to see the video history and to record clips. A Nest Aware subscription costs $10 a month. I would like this product much better if Nest Aware was included. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",Great Camera! Nest Aware Subscription is Extra $ :(

Rendleman,"I just installed a Nest Cam and so far am loving it.  I originally got it so I could check on the animals when we weren't home and as a ""fun"" gadget.  But, I discovered that it is a great way for me to check on my husband when I am away from the house for short periods of time.  My husband is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and has short term memory loss and is also losing his ability to handle simple tasks around the house, i.e. feeding himself.  He is fine physically so I do leave him for short periods of time but have worried in the past if he was coping okay as I doubt he could call me if he needed me.  So now I am able to check on him when he is in the office at our home while I am gone.  In fact I am going to get another camera for our living room since he spends most of his time in these two rooms.  I am extremely pleased with the clarity of the video and the fact I can talk to him via the microphone if necessary.",Cam is giving me more peace of mind while I am away from home

The picture is amazing. There's sound, you can speak through it, and the motion detector is very sensitive. However, the problem is that cloud storage is really necessary to see anything that has happened. They give a 30-day trial of the cloud storage (which starts immediately) and I thought that if I didn't sign up for it I would at least have 7-days worth of stored history. Not so. After the 30-days are up there is no ability to see anything except what's happening live. That really diminishes the usefulness of this camera. Cloud storage costs $10 a month or $100 a year. I also just purchased the Ring doorbell/camera. While it is also amazing, it came with 1-year of free cloud storage. The cost of this doorbell/camera was about the same as this Nest cam, however it's a little different application. One other thing. If you're looking at the various cameras available, it seems like the best would be one that is completely wireless. While some say they are wireless, in reality they're not completely wireless. So read closely. The most interesting to me is the Arlo camera. It is completely wireless, but it uses those expensive watch-type batteries and a lot of the reviews say the battery life is short especially if pointed outside.","Very good, to a point..."

Key points that led to my return: 1) Watermark logo on images blocked robber's face. My car was burgled; caught it on camera, robber walk right at the camera... into the watermark. Whoops. 2) Not that easy to set up. No where near the one minute setup they claim. 3) All traffic goes through their Amazon EC2 instances. EC2 went down one morning, taking the camera down with it. I couldn't access video on a camera 25 feet away from me... 4) On the day that EC2 went down, Nest sent me an email saying that I would lose my video history unless I paid for a $10/month subscription. Bad timing... whoops. Sorry Nest, $500+ for this camera over a 3 year period is really not worth it. 5) Camera overheated and stopped working in direct sunlight. 6) No local storage. Things I liked about this camera: 1) Fantastic streaming quality (1080). The quality of the recorded history seemed to not be as good. Great night vision. 2) Nice mobile app. Better than almost all the other ones I've seen, not perfect, but still very good. 3) Nice footprint. If they had dropped the subscription price to $5/month, I would have considered keeping it. However, the real downside of this camera seems to be bad product decisions. The hardware is fantastic, the software is good, it's the overall product that isn't good. Case in point - the watermark on the image screams product manager ego, at the expense of usability.","Great hardware, but has several blind spots"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jan 2019,Justin Reinman,"I recently had a not so good experience with a cheap baby monitor that was gifted to us, so I decided to invest in a Nest.  I  heard great things about the cameras and our home is already integrated with Google Home devices and a Nest Thermostat.  The video is great quality.  Was not expecting it to capture such a wide picture, which covers the whole room.  So no need to have pivot controls.  It picks up audio no problem and I can stream the video to any mobile device or Cast display.  We were gifted a Google Home Hub and that works perfect as a receiver to watch the baby on.  The best part is you don't lose the video feed like you would with a lot of these cheaper cameras.  Even if your internet goes out for a moment, once its back, the camera feed will come back. PLUS, after there is no need for a baby monitor, this becomes an indoor security camera.  So it still serves a purpose, which is what deterred me from purchasing an actual baby monitor.  You might be thinking, Nest Camera with a Google Home Hub sounds like an expensive baby monitor, but it's worth it when you can still use them for security monitoring afterwards, vs paying $120+ for an actual baby monitor that can't serve any other purpose.",Great product. Works fantastic as a baby monitor.

While the camera & software works, they are geoblocking setting your home address. You have to first put in a US based address, then move the pin on the map to your real location. I really do not understand why they are doing this. NestAware starts getting very expensive when you start adding more cameras ($150 a year for each additional camera) You can not use this easily with your own NVR.I haven't been able to get it to work with QNAP Surveillance Station, but it sort of works with TinyCam on Android.

It says 1080p, but it certainly is not. It's grainy and blurry, even in well lit areas. Don't even get me started on when the lights are off. Good luck seeing anything. On top of that, I only get three hours of storage for that $160. Nest expects you to pony up for a monthly subscription if you want any kind of actual utility here. With Nest Aware it's supposed to be able to learn who goes in and out of the area, and give you notifications based on ""unfamiliar"" faces. Yeah well when my dog rolls over on the couch for the 4th time that day, you better believe I'm getting my fourth notification. Nest sells products it calls ""Smart"". They ""learn"". Well, neither the Cam nor the Thermostat learn anything. If I wanted a stupid cam so that I could see what's going on, I would have taped an old phone to the wall and used that camera. At least I'd have higher resolution. After owning this for a year and a half, the Cam developed some sort of black line across the camera, blocking part of the view. No worries right? I'll call up support and do some trouble shooting. No way. Even though I'm a paying customer of their BS Nest Aware subscription, I get put on hold for HOURS with their tech support. Does that mean they don't care, or that they have so many customers with problems that they can't keep up? Either way, doesn't sound like a company I want to give my money to. Now the black line is gone, but it's even more blurry than before. Some 13 year old uploaded a video to YouTube in 2009 that was taken on their Moto Razr that is higher res than my Nest Cam stream. So, overall, don't buy this or any Nest product. It's trash and you will be expected to pay a premium several times over just to get left out in the wind.",I've never liked this thing

We cannot use the outdoor versions because wiring 2 on the second floor with outdoor outlets would require serious contractor work (magnets won't work and drilling into the synthetic insulation would ruin the insulation). Thankfully these ""indoor"" versions work very well as behind the front window security cameras. A plus for the indoor sec cams is that they are far less conspicuous than a big white bulbous outdoor nest cam. They are just little black circles peering on the edge of our living room and kitchen windows. The app works great on my phone and the nest website never has an issue whenever I want to see what is going on. I also recently caught a city public worker throw an entire lunch out of his pickup truck window onto the street and saving the 10 second recording was easy peasy. One day I got home and I just saw a bunch of food and a brown bag in the middle of the street, thanks to our nest cams, we know the culprit lol.  The saved clips are also fairly compact files (that clip was only around 500 kb). We live in a bad neighborhood (Destroyed our doorbell on our gate, destroyed our cute houseplant pots along our driveway, randomly coming up onto our driveway and littering/shaking our front gate for no reason, etc.) and I am positive that an outdoor camera would be vandalized too (Someone could cut the power cord). Our cameras are probably safer indoors lol. A perfect setup would be an indoor and professionally installed outdoor nest cam but for now we have overlapping fields of vision with 2 indoor cams at a sub $500 pricepoint. It would be nice to have a way to stick these onto windows. As of now I used a speaker stand to have it up against one of our windows.",Great camera for outdoor security as well (through a window)

So it's no surprise that I purchase the indoor camera. I have three of their outdoor cameras and they are great! I highly recommend them for the video quality and style. Their cloud storage though is really expensive compared to the competitors. But if you can swing it, the Nest Aware is an awesome app. I chose the 10-day option which is really plenty of days. If something should happen, it alerts you and you get to choose whether you want to download the event to keep for further investigation or if you need to provide evidence to the police. Nest plans are as follows: Basic is 10-day video history, intelligent alerts, clips and time-lapse and you get to set activity zones. That will run you 10/month (100/yr) each additional camera is $50 on top of that. So I have a total of four. I pay $250/yr for cloud storage. Not bad because I have video surveillance and peace of mind. They also have the Extended which is 30-day video history which is 30/mo (300yr). I dont recommend it. Nest makes it super easy to setup and start recording in no time. That's what makes this so appealing. And you may ask why Nest and not a POE system? Well, I like the fact that they are wireless (easier to install) and also you can communicate two-way with the Nest cameras.That was the reasoning.",The Best Wireless Camera right now!!

This camera is bad though.  It is constantly buffering and Nest makes you stare at an ad for their ""nest aware"" service. 1.  The video frequently is buffering:  Blue circle spins, video lags, pixelates and freezes.  We have fast internet and should be able to easily support the highest quality video but are forced to go to the lowest and even then it still buffers all the time.  I attempted to contact nest about this and spent an hour trying a few things and nothing worked to fix the issue. 2. The banner ad for ""nest aware"" is completely obnoxious.  You can't use the camera as a live feed and not see the banner on a computer (without paying $$$ to subscribe).  If you want to take a browser window down to a small size so you can work but have the video up in the corner, the banner ad takes up a large portion of the screen.  I attached a screen shot of this. If you are looking for something that just gives you a live feed I'd definitely recommend trying something else. EDIT: 1/3/18:  I'd like to add to my initial review.  Unfortunately nothing has improved.  We traveled for the holidays and brought this nest camera with us and had the same issues with poor reception and laggy video exactly like it is in our home.  The internet service is the similar to ours.. similar speeds, similar reception throughout the house.  Basically all devices seem to work fine throughout the house except the nest camera.  Right now as I write this, I'm not able to see my baby on the video.  It's a blue spinning wheel.  I'm sitting in a room right next to the baby's room (farther away from the router) and I'm getting 90mbps download on the WIFI so it's not an issue with our internet.",Banner Ads and Laggy Video

I made sure I'm running the latest version of Firefox but found that switching to Chrome or Internet Explorer (and their invasive user tracking and ads) alleviates the playback issues. So, I can either use IE and put up with Microsoft watching my webcam, or use Google and hope my video history doesn't wind up in their cloud somewhere so I can use Nest as intended.  Or, just drop Nest and purchase a security system with local storage ..... Disappointed in my second nest cam.  The first cam worked flawlessly - immediate alerts, and video history ""on demand"".  My second cam hasn't been so reliable.  After a few days of use it still captures video, and you can see the history in the (tiny) thumbnail view but it will not load 'full screen' (I don't have this issue with the original cam - it continues to work as expected).  I contacted Nest support and was told to disconnect and re-connect the cam to my wifi network (odd, since the history is stored on their cloud and I can view it in the thumbnail but can't view full-screen - how is reconnecting to my wifi going to resolve that???)

If the subject you are monitoring is anything more than about 5' away, I would recommend getting an IR emitter to really shed some light on the subject. I ended up buying the LIFX + bulb and pointing it towards my door so that people are more visible when the lights are off.  The LIFX bulb has an IR emitter built in so even if the light is turned ""off"", it is still bathing my front door in non-visible infrared light. I would also warn you about a quirk in the camera's design. There is a setting to make it only turn on when you are away, based on proximity to a cell phone. (Not sure it works if multiple people are in the home with cell phones - but irrelevant for me). However, once I drive away, the camera recognizes I'm out of the home geo-fencing area and turns on. However, rather than getting an alert that says the camera just turned on, you will get an alert that says the camera ""noticed some motion"" which seems a little silly to me.",I would recommend getting an IR emitter to really shed some light ...

People seemed to like the Nest as a replacement, so we tried it out. Overall it's slightly worse in our experience for video quality, though daytime looks better than the Amazon camera (not a huge deal for baby monitors). There are some other weird things. First, the field of view is really wide, so we have to place the camera very close to the crib (hung ~4 feet away). This might be better for some people, but it certainly makes the camera front-and-center to the crib (including it's lights). Second, the delay is significantly worse than our Amazon camera. The Nest web interface is maybe 10 seconds behind, which is a bit annoying if you're watching for the puke-up or to try an preempt a screaming kid.

I do not question the customers who claim their Nest cameras stopped working, have poor talk-back capability, or otherwise malfunctioned. But my use of this product has had no such issues thus far. I actually now regret buying a nanny camera of obviously far lesser quality, because I frequently use the Nest camera I have assigned to the kid's bedroom for weekends, when the kid is asleep and other activities demand my attention.

I have a lot of ambient light coming in my living room windows, but the image is still grainy and largely indistinguishable.

So it is correct you pay more for the camera but the service overall is better and the app has many functions other app do not have. Another great advantage, in my opinion, is that the nest website is a perfect option for remote control.",Satisfied with this camera
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jun 2016,SP,"I've had the Nest Cam and have used it as one of my children's monitor. I have to say, this is a great camera! Yes, the price is steep but the term, ""you get what you pay for"" definitely applies to security cameras in my opinion. We will have a nanny starting soon to watch our two children. Naturally, this prompted me to set up cameras in the home. After researching for a while, I decided to try getting a few more Nests Cams to get the house covered. In this process, here are a few things for you to consider if you are wanting to do the same: Price. You should get it while the cameras are still $50 off. $200 for this camera is quite expensive. The $50 off makes it a little more bearable. You can only purchase two with this deal, unfortunately. If you need to buy more than two, you should buy two on amazon and two on their website. Cord: Like all security cameras, the cord is always an issue. You can purchase a 25 ft long cord on Amazon. But you still need to deal with the intrusiveness of the cord. I've looked at wireless cameras because of this and it just seems like all the ones that are out currently doesn't have the image and build quality that comes with Nest. Fortunately for me, I have placements for all of my cameras where the cord is not going to be an issue nor an eye sore. But, keep this in mind. App: The Nest app is well designed and easy to use! I love the features I have for my thermostat. However, a huge feature that the app is missing is being able to view multiple screens at once. For a security camera, this is incredibly disappointing and almost a deal breaker for me. My only hope is that Nest will update the software to support this!!! I hope their listening! Overall, a great product. With a few tweaks and additions, it really could be one of the best.",this is a great camera! Yes
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2015,Suzy Parish,"We use it to monitor our grands when they come to visit. I keep my i-phone by my bed and I can check on them as they sleep without running down the hall. The screen is clear and detailed and I can even see my grandson's chest rise and fall as he sleeps. The audio is clear and very sensitive. Night vision is excellent. The only complaint I have is that they disable the motion detection playback after a 30 day trial and want you to subscribe for a fee. I think we should be given one screen at least of playback and I have notified the company about this.Other than that minor issue I highly recommend this product as it has given us huge peace of mind. The cam is portable and can be moved anywhere you have a power outlet. The cord is long enough that we have not had to use extension cords.The app works seamlessly with my phone with no glitches. I am able to pull up the cam when away from home and see and hear how our home is. ( I forgot to add that we have purchased 3 of these! Our son-on-law requested if for Christmas with their first born and when our second grand baby was born we bought his mom and dad one. I then purchased one for our home.) Update: January 15, 2016 We just returned from a trip several states away and I was able to monitor our inside dog as she slept on the couch, etc. It gave me peace of mind to see her even though we had family checking up on her daily and feeding and playing with her.

I liked the Sri camera, which we had initially. It stopped working though. I'm sure from being dropped on the floor and not taking better care of it with little children around. We tried the Amazon Cloud Cam, which had the best picture quality and sound sensitivity of all four cameras, however it disconnected too often. We just got the Nest Cam and have had no issues with connectivity, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. The picture quality and sound sensitivity are similar to the Sri Camera which is good, just not as AMAZING as the Amazon Cloud Cam, hence 4 instead of 5 stars. This Nest Cam also has a lot of neat features on it's app(my husband tells me), which also makes it 4 star noteworthy. Overall, the Nest Cam is a great camera. I realize I didn't mention Arlo. The Arlo Camera would sometimes emit a bright light which I thought was waking my baby and we started having connectivity issues with it. Picture quality was good on the Arlo, the same or a tad better than Sri and Nest.","No connectivity issues, a must when used as a baby monitor"

Expensive, software can be buggy, and monthly fee's. That said, mine is also terribly unreliable. I do own two of the outdoor nest units and they work basically 90-100%. This indoor one, despite being within feet of the router and MUCH closer than the outdoor units, simply fails to connect or go offline. This is with Googles own Fiber 1000 router. Not sure if the internal ones are old models or what, but this thing only connects properly maybe 30% of the time if you lose power or move it.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2016,LB,"*UPDATE* When I posted my original review (below) Nest recommended decreasing the zone sizes to improve accuracy.  So I kept the original zone and added 2 smaller ones on either end over top to see if this resolved the issue.  Unfortunately, it has not so I have removed a star. Original Review: 3 Stars At first I loved this thing and was ready to by several more. The quality of video is great, the sounds made in close proximity comes through and once set up its really easy to use. I bought this primarily because you can edit zones and notification settings and that it plugs in (instead of batteries).  The motion and sound only indicators in the history make reviewing long time periods a lot easier. I also like being able to save and download video clips. I do have it inside a window, so at night the night vision does not really work with ambient indoor light reflecting off the window.  This was easily resolved as the porch light outside reduces the reflection and turns off the night vision. But of course my distance at night is a little more limited. The most concerning issue is with zones not consistently picking up activity.  At first I thought it was a contrast issue (e.g. black car driving through a zone's area of shade) but have determined that isn't the issue.  In the beginning I wasn't as concerned about this as it seemed to be showing at least that there was motion in the history. But the other day I had an unknown car come through a zone and it never even showed a motion on the history, I happened to be looking at the live stream when it happened otherwise I would never have known. To make matters worse, there are times that I received a zone alert only to find out that it was a change in sunlight/cloud coverage or that its a car driving by at night (headlight halo seems to be the trigger).  So now I am really questioning how much I am missing by relying on the motion and zone alerts in the history. Combine this with the cost of not only the camera but the Nest Aware (stores the history for 7+ days depending on your subscription) and this seems overpriced at best.",Some big issues

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Oct 2017,Naveed A,"What I like about nest cam: 1) very wide angle lense 2) low profile, these cameras are very small and hard to notice 3) setup is very easy. It really is plug and play. I've used many cameras in the past and i'm amazed how easy they have made it now. 4) you can setup alerts and zones. Zone is an area you can draw in your house that will send you alerts when there is motion detected in it. You can also setup alerts when you hear something loud or unexpected (window breaking, someone falling, etc.) 5) you can talk through your camera. You can communicate with others at the house directly from your camera by holding the talk button. 6) all videos and communication is encrypted 7) mounting is easy as it has a magnetic base 8) all your videos are stored in the cloud in real time. So if someone were to break the cameras, you will still have all your videos upto that point. I have subscription to save for 10 days. 9) they work very well in dark. they use infra light to capture footage. Things I don't like: 1) its expensive. 2) if you want to save videos in the cloud, you have to pay subscription. $10 for the first camera and $5 for each camera after that. This is per month. I have 4 cameras so I pay $25 / month. 3) they are wired. You need to have a wire to power the cameras","Good purpose, but expensive (cost to buy as well as subscription)"

As usual the camera comes in a well packaged box and the setup is so easy a child can do it in minutes.  If you can manage to use a smart phone you can set this up. The image quality has improved massively and there doesn't appear to be problems with bandwidth of having multiple cameras on one network that I was concerned about.  The step up from my old camera is a world apart - such a good improvement.  The colours are so much better and the low light performance is just astounding compared to the older model. The only issue I have is with the storage side.  I have no problems with paying or anything like that or even the tiers.  The issue is for goodness sakes why is it not available for us in more countries - sort this out as to me its the most limiting problem.

The sound is OK, not great, but certainly adequate for most purposes.  The camera setup was very easy, and the app has a simple user interface. My biggest concern was what features would be available without a paid subscription.  Without a subscription you can view the live feed remotely, view the past feed (not sure how far back), get notifications based on sound and/or movement, have an intercom between the app and camera.  For me, that's every feature I needed. The features available without a subscription, and the quality of the camera and app have been great.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 May 2018,MelC,"This is my second nest cam. I have had one for years that I used to spy on my dogs all day that I never had any issues with. However it had been sitting in a drawer for a while because I was home on maternity leave and wasn’t really needing to use it. But now I have twins and needed a second camera for a nanny cam setup (one for their bedroom and another for the living room). Because my first camera is about 4 years old and i don’t know how much life it has left in it, I was hesitant to fork over another $200 for an additional nest camera. Also, I do find the subscription for extra features and the ability to store footage for two cameras pricey. Because of this I decided to forego my old nest cam (that still worked fine) and purchased two cameras made by a certain retailer that offers two day shipping. I used them a very short time and ended up sending them back to get the second nest cam despite the cheaper subscription and overall cost. Another reason I went back to nest is that I really liked the feature that allows you to turn off the status light (more on that in a moment), the ability to review the full day by scrolling through footage instead of having to watch individual movie clips like some other camera systems, and reliability as I have never really had any issues with the nest cam randomly going out (unlike the other cameras that will remain nameless). My favorite feature with this camera, which I think makes it a particularly good nanny cam, is the ability to turn off the status light. Maybe it was motherly instincts but i left the status light off the other day and my nanny assumed the camera was off. I didn’t have any issues with her before but it caught her on the phone, completely ignoring my 5m old daughter for 30 minutes, and then when her twin woke up, she laid them on the floor and shook toys in their faces, but lied to me and said she had done tummy time with them. She was obviously fired. I regret not having purchased the second camera sooner and setting it up with my other camera. I think it’s well worth the money for the features, clear picture and reliability. It can obviously be used for many purposes but it’s particularly good for keeping tabs on your kids/nanny. Also, considering my old camera (purchased in 2014) is still working without issues, I believe that I’ll get a lot of use out of this new one as well.",Very good nanny cam!

I subscribed to the Nest Aware program so that I could have 10 days of video history...this does not bother me as much as it bothers some of the other reviewers. $15 per month is not too much to pay for peace of mind.

There are other available options (such as face recognition) that I have not yet used, but plan to. I recommend this system.

The installation (both physical and the software, including the connection to Wi-Fi AP/router) was pretty easy and user-friendly and the video quality is excellent for both day and night. The built-in microphone (and the speaker) is just ok - audio quality is not great but is still usable. However, there's a very big issue (which I did know about but it is still an ""issue"") - it does not have any kind of on-board storage,such as user-expandable microSD cards, and instead the greedy Nest/Google heavily ""encourages"" you to PAY for video storage through their cloud service. Yes, cloud storage is convenient (and if that's what matters most to you - go ahead and pay for it), however not giving a customer a choice of storage (local or remote) is just morally wrong and screams of ""greed"". Not to mention it is not very reliable in terms of security. Think about it: this camera NEEDS a constant internet connection in order to store (and for you to retrieve) files, meaning that if you have internet outage (which does happen frequently enough if you live in third-world country like USA and use a highly unreliable, overpriced broadband connection from your local greedy cable TV monopolist) - the videos won't be recorded, same thing will happen if you could not pay your internet bill in time. Even during a power outage - there's a chance that you will still lose your internet connection even if you'll plug your cable modem/router/ONT into dedicated UPS units, and once again, without internet connection this camera is USELESS as a security device. Having an on-board or removable storage (like microSD cards) would've at least helped to prevent such possible recording ""outages"" and would've provided a choice for people who still want to use this cam for video recording but cannot or simply don't want to pay for Nest/Google's cloud storage service. So yea, TL;DR version: this cam has great hardware design and great video quality however it's not good (not reliable and FORCES you into single option) if you want/need to record the video and re-watch it later.","Decent for live viewing, not really good as security device"

It has nice features and all that. I'm leaving one star because the Nest/Google service is a total bait-and-switch. The camera comes with a 30 day trial of ""Nest Aware"", which stores 30 days of video history and runs analytics on your video so it can send you alerts if certain things happen. E.g., a package gets delivered, or someone walks through the frame, it can tell you that. I knew that going in, and didn't really want those features -- they're cool but I get enough alerts as it is. The problem is that once your Nest Aware trial lapses, so does the reliability of the video stream. In the first 30 days it worked great - sometimes had minor loading issues but never for a long time. Now? Lol. It's a complete joke. I maybe get 2 seconds out of every 15 of video. The rest of the time it's just sitting there as a still image, ""loading"". Also there's an ad for nest aware in the web viewer and you can't close it... a nice reminder that if you just accept the shakedown of an additional monthly payment the thing you paid $200 for could work like it's supposed to.

It’s now June 2018 so now is a good time. The product is beautiful, but aside from aesthetics, I think it’s a good product. The one piece of feedback that is consistent across all reviews and what you must consider is the price for Nest Aware, their subscription that allows you to review footage. When I originally signed up, they only had one subscription available at $100/year for a 10 day history, but now they added a less expensive version: $5/month or $50/year for 5 day video history. I’m sure the new option was the result of all the complaints, so that’s good that they heard and responded to feedback. The video quality is great, the app works well and the ability to view the history through the phone is pretty turn-key and simple.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2020,Ray Winn,"efore I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system",Why does the cam not integrate with ring alarm system? (Review later updated)
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jun 2016,Mike K,"The positives: - Pretty good video quality. Looks like they're using some heavy compression though (and my own bandwidth isn't an issue), so that can make it a bit blocky/blurry. I am extremely impressed with its low-light performance. I can't use the night vision mode because I'm behind a window, but I almost don't even need it! - The size and mounting options are excellent! - Very long usb/power cable. The negatives: - They require a subscription for even basic features that other WiFi cams have built-in, like setting up zones for motion alerts. - Cloud-based ONLY. There's NO option for local storage at all! - Motion detection is all over the place. Sometimes it works well, and sometimes it tells me when a single leaf blows across the yard. Other times it's missed a human being walking on the far end of my yard. - Proprietary. It's not a true IP cam. That means their app is the only possible way to use this thing, and in addition to the first 2 negatives I've mentioned this far, that means a subscription is practically a requirement just to make this thing usable. It's a good camera, but I don't like being artificially locked into their apps and services. It should be a camera, first and foremost. I don't know who they think they are by doing that, but they'll be quickly surpassed by the competition if it keeps up. I'd be buying a few more at the drop of a hat if it was an actual IP cam instead of a glorified excuse to sell you a subscription, even with the higher price over most competitors. But hey, if you don't mind the subscriptions and lack of open IP cam protocols, it's ease of setup and quality should make you happy.",- Pretty good video quality

My father in law got us a dropCam when my son was a baby 8 yrs ago. We loved it. Got his first walk on camera and sent the clip to family as well as the grandparents all live in different states. This gave them the opportunity to see him and watch him grow too. We now have that one in the living room since I have a 18month old who gets into everything and I can watch her from the other room.  But I have been wanting another one for her room because the baby monitor we have is horrible and not going to spend hundreds of dollars on another when I could get better camera for the same price. I heard beat bought out dropcam so I was reading reviews and was hesitant on buying it. For example people stated you can’t connect echo show. You totally can and it’s super easy to set up. After you install your camera and your monitor in the Alexa app. You just go to settings under your Alexa app and link the monitor it’s super easy. People also stated you can’t use the camera without buying the yr plan for live video recording. Not true. You can totally still use the camera in live mode without purchasing anything. If you keep the motion settings on it takes clips of those moments for about an hr or two so you can still technically go back and see. Like I totally saw which dog got into the trash lol. You can talk through the nest app through the camera. I catch the dogs getting into trash and have to tell them no. The night vision is great quality. It’s super clear and perfect lighting. My only negative is I wish it came with the wall mount instead Of having to purchase it separate and I wish it could rotate around the room. Otherwise, I love this camera and glad I went with my guts and continued with this camera.",Great camera!

The material seems durable, does not feel cheaply made.  The Picture quality is very good, even has night vision with a clear picture.  The sound quality I have not really tried using the two way talk, I have tried using with me in the room with the cam and the quality does not sound clear.  The app is easy to use, you can also see a live feed from a desktop/laptop by going to Nest, the camera was easy to setup.  As far as the functionality of the camera, I will echo what everyone else is saying in that you will need to purchase a subscription to use to its full potential.  Once the 30 day trial ends, you only get still pictures when the camera detects motion, sometimes not even that.  The camera motion could go off for any little thing, wind gust, an insect flying in front of the camera, etc..  Due to needing to purchase a subscription to keep a log of the videos I am giving it 3 stars.  I did notice that Nest has come up with a new lower priced subscription plan but I will probably just use the live video feed feature for now.",Solid Camera

Through a lot of investigating, messing around, talking with support I found out there is a 30 minute ""cooling period"" for notifications. In other words if your baby is crying and you get them to go back to bed if they wake up 5 minutes later you wont know about it for another 25 minutes. There is no way to turn the cooling period off or adjust it. This product is absolutely useless in this application.

It is really easy to use and works very well.  I also own a Piper, but nest cam is a much better product.  Nest cam is super reliable when it comes to motion detection, because it uses both hardware and software to detect motion while Piper only has hardware motion detection.  My nest cam picks up every motion correctly and even works through glass, but I get a lot of false positives with my Piper and it would not even work behind a window. Pros: - Easy to setup - Great quality - Accurate motion detection - Keeps recording history Cons: - Need to subscribe in order to keep longer recording history (really should allow you to save it to your local hard drive instead for free)",It's the best home cam in the market

It has easy set up. The picture in full light is nice. The alerts seem timely for motion. It never sent for sound which surprises me.  But the main negative is the night vision is pathetic.  I uploaded a screen grab of its view will all the lights off. Also you would be wise to take a picture of the back of the camera.  I had to restart the camera a few times to the app and you need to scan the back or entered the code on the back which is a pain if the camera is mounted high in the corner of a room.,Night vision is a joke.

Although I like the original better the Nest Cams have so far performed fine.  Camera is not as wide angle and 1080p is not supported but 720 is fine and reduces the network load.  Eventually you'll be charged for how much data you transfer on your network (some already are) so the reduced picture quality so far is acceptable for me. I like the cloud storage, yes a bit costly but I use (2) of these camera for security at work and (2) others to monitor elderly parents.  I especially like being able to playback earlier day events to make sure caregivers are treating my parents properly.  I also have (3) higher end Panasonic camera's for monitoring vacation property.  Their picture quality is far worse and the cameras cost more.  The setup of the Panasonic was difficult as well and not for the average person.  Nest setup was only a couple of minutes for the first and maybe 30 seconds for the others after you get use to it.  Am using the standard Verizon Actiontec wireless router and it works fine with that, have not tried any others yet. The Panasonic cameras are better with motion detection and emailing pictures, Nest great with streaming and playback.  Depends on your needs but this camera is far easier to setup than any others I've seen, including Foscam. Edit:  Just dropped it a star.  Got another camera and could not set it up on the Verizon Fios network that I use the Dropcam on.  Had to use my iPhone to do the setup.  Now working fine but could not set it up using my laptop.

I have these plus a couple different brands of home security cameras. These probably are my favorites for the fact that I can talk through the camera to my kids or pets. And there is a ""ding"" noise to let them know when I'm going to speak and are done. I have regular ""face-to-face"" talks with my four year old with these. I think he randomly talks to the camera even when I'm not watching. The picture and sound quality is amazing, I don't know how retailers have that crappy old grainy black and white video when this amazing product is available! Even in the night view these things show great picture. Now, I will say, if you've got two pointing towards each other, it will appear as though there is a flashlight shining at the camera from the other camera, but not really a big deal. If you're using it facing out a window, you'll want to take into account for night time reflections when interior lights are on. I have one of these looking out the window of my front door, and the picture is great even though it's looking through glass. The only time the view is obstructed is at night when the lights are on inside, but even then I still see enough to get the job done. Once everyone is in bed and the lights are off, its a perfect view of the front steps again. No one will be sneaking up on my front porch without my knowing anymore!",Even great if it's looking out a window!

Cunningham,"The camera itself is great. HD video is clear, super wide angle lens captures everything, digital zoom is clear, and the night vision is fantastic. The built in speaker to talk to someone in the room is also a great feature. The problem is the subscription Nest requires for the motion alerts. During the Nest Aware trial, you get motion alerts in color with video clips and older history. Once the subscription lapses, the alerts are just a  still photo in black and white (because Google thinks making them color should cost more). Be ready to pay between $5-$10 month to get the most out of this.",Beware of the lost features without a subscription

I didn't have to mess with my router or need awesome tech skills to make this work. You just install the app on your phone, plug it in and it walks you through the setup in minutes. Video logging must go through Nest and it does cost money but it also works wonderfully. Daily activity can be pulled up on your phone or computer and motion events are easy to sort through. Thanks to low resolution moving thumbnails in the activity list you can see the whole days activity in minutes. You can open ones of interest to see the full resolution video with a click/thumb press. Make sure you have internet bandwidth as these require internet which is different than most basic cameras. All video goes to Nest servers before it goes to your phone even if you are home on your network. For this reason Nestcam might not be the best choice if you are building a many camera system for local network viewing (not over the internet). Probably not an issue most people will face.",Incredibly simple and full featured.
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jan 2018,Katie Clark,"Overall this is a good camera and we are happy with our purchase. It was a simple set up, plug in, scan barcode on your phone to link the camera to your Nest account, and then connect to WiFi and it was up and working. They let you try Nest Aware for 30 days for free, after that is is $10/month for 10 days of footage or $30/month for 30 days of footage. With Nest Aware you get notifications on your phone is motion,sound, or a person is spotted, and obviously the footage for whatever you pay for. In my opinion you don’t need anything more than the $10 option, I see many complain about the price but if you’re going to compare it to other security systems and pricing it is a steal and well worth it. We have this Camera set up in our living room and it gets a good picture of our mud room that connects to the garage, kitchen, dining room, and living room. It can easily detect when someone is coming and going through the door to the garage(which is the furthest place from the camera). The sound is pretty good on this camera, however ours is next to our TV so you cannot hear background noises as well due to the TV being so close when on. But when it is off it works great. When watching your camera through the app it tends to freeze if you are looking at previous activity I’ve noticed, there is an option to click 15 seconds at a time and if you click that it tends to freeze up and takes a little while to get back, which is a tad annoying but not the worst thing. The app lets you turn the camera light on and off, there is a green light on the camera that lets you know if someone is watching, it goes dark to light, you also can click that feature off if you don’t want someone to know you’re looking. There is also a microphone on the app that lets you talk through the camera. This has come in handy before when I needed to get ahold of my husband who wasn’t answering his phone due to it being on silent! Night vision is so-so in my opinion, if you have any sort of light on it tends to mess with the clarity of the picture. And by light I mean a microwave light, light above/under  the cabinets or above the kitchen sink. Overall I am very satisfied with this camera, and with Nest in general. We also have the thermostat, and I’m currently awaiting the doorbell to be released, it is nice to have everything on one app.",Good camera!

Kaufman,"This product is worthless unless you subscribe to their $100/year service where you can review recordings.  Yes it will notify you if there is motion detected.  However, if you view it even one minute later you cannot see the movement, hence worthless as a security/monitoring device.  There are good images on viewing direct or real time, but that is not why you buy a product like this. I spoke to Nest/Google and they would not refund the purchase price of the product.  I bought the product for my vacation home, for obvious reasons to monitor any unexpected activity.  I am now back home and expected to be able to use it for that purpose.  It is useless (except for $100/year) and they will not refund purchase price except within 30 days which is not possible as I am no longer at my vacation home. Do not consider this product unless you want to spend an extra $100/year.  Lorex (FlirFX) and Samsung both have outstanding equivalent product that will notify you if there is motion detected and take a 1 minute recording that you can then view at your convenience.

We absolutely love this camera. Pros: -Both day and night vision are very clear.  You can clearly see what is going on in the room. -Can access from anywhere in the house, no more cutting in and out due to being too far away from the child unit. -Don't need multiple parent units.  Both guardians can access the video if they are on the Nest account (if a grandparent or other caregiver is watching them you can also choose to grant them access so they can check in on the child). -Audio is clear as well. Cons: -If you want to be able to look back on the video from overnight it requires a subscription.  Real time video doesn't have an extra cost though. -Can't just leave it  on like a traditional baby monitor (so we also use an audio monitor at night to make sure we can hear the child) Would highly recommend this monitor to any family looking for a good quality video camera for a child's room.",Great alternative to a baby monitor!

Motion alerts either don't work or are only sent to a single phone on the account, night-vision blinks in and out if it's flashed with the slightest bit of ambient light from an external source, picture quality at 1080p isn't as good as my Samsung hardmounted cams at 720p. I won't even go into the wildly overpriced subscription service you'd need for this thing to be a legit security camera solution (or the fact it would be completely useless if the internet failed.) I bought this to be a ""floater"" or to keep an eye on things like pets and it feels like a solid piece of equipment but it just can't even deliver on its most basic promises.

The interface was excellent, easy to use, straightforward. Even one broke and they just sent me a new one, no questions asked. Now since Google bought it, its just a nightmare. They force you to migrate to the google home platform, but still works on the previous app. My Nest Aware service was working just right until I migrated. Then it stopped, I ""re subscribed many times and eventually stopped many times again"" When I switch email account, things went really sour. Now I've been trying to subscribe to more than 2 hours of video for 2 days and no success.

Support has troubleshoot this issue repeatedly with no results.  What irritates me is at the end of each troubleshooting and it is determined that they cannot find a solution they playfully wish me to have a nice day.

However the 5 GHz signal is not as powerful as the outdoor version so the signal drops out about once a day and you get an email saying it's off line.  I've seen this problem in two different houses and with the cameras fairly close to the WiFi router.  I never have this problem with my Nest outdoor cameras.  I suspect the smaller size of this camera has made the 5 GHz antenna and/or signal less reliable.  However I would never buy a camera that is not ""dual band"" like the Nest cameras are.  IMHO the 2.4 GHz band is too prone to interference due to it being longer range and with more interfering signals from microwave ovens, neighbor WiFi signals, etc.  But 5 GHz works great with all my cameras and of course works at vastly higher speed.

I noticed that my controls in Red Dead Redemption 2 lagged when the camera was turned on.  I unplugged the camera and the controls were fine.  When I moved the camera upstairs, the controls were fine.  We did intend to keep the camera upstairs, but I'm hoping Nest comes out with a fix for this problem someday.  I believe the issue is that the Bluetooth for the camera is turned on mainly to help the camera initially connect to a Wifi network.  They should include an option in the app to turn off and on Bluetooth once the camera is on Wifi (and only automatically turn it on when it's no longer on Wifi).  This logic doesn't seem to difficult to implement so I'm hopeful Nest will do it so I can someday move the camera downstairs.","Great camera, but will interfere with PS4 controller if nearby"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Apr 2016,Sashy,"Setup is easy, it always detects motion, and it's easy to tell it to ignore certain areas. But considering the high price of the camera as well as the Nest Aware recording service, there are some annoying glitches: - In the Android app's history section, there are little animated thumbnails for each motion event. But when you tap a thumbnail to play the video full size, the timing is usually off so you miss the beginning or end of the event. - There's a similar problem on the website (although you can work around it easily); the little dots on the timeline for motion events are not quite in the right spot; if you click directly on the dot, the playback won't show the entire event; you have to click a a little bit to one side. - One of the touted benefits of Nest Aware subscription, in addition to the continuous recording, is that it's supposed to be better at ignoring things like moving shadows and reflections that can cause false motion events. But I still get those things recorded frequently. - The Android app often shows a message complaining about my phone's location. But none of my other apps ever mention this, or ever seem to have problems with location. - Posting a video clip to YouTube never works. It acts like it did, but no video ever shows up in my YouTube account. Posting to Facebook is OK (you can also post to Twitter but I haven't tried that). - You can turn off the camera LED in settings - but if the camera loses its internet connection, the LED will turn on anyway. This could clue savvy criminals that the camera isn't working. None of these issues would be a big deal in a less expensive product. When my annual subscription runs out in about 9 months, I'm going to start looking carefully at the competition; it shouldn't be that hard for someone to build something cheaper that's just as good. I've tried the Yi camera and though it's cheaper, it's not as good (yet), and since video is stored in the camera instead of the cloud, if something happens to the camera your video is gone too.",Works well but some minor glitches and expensive subscription

I got an extender put on that side of the house. This is where it got weird. I needed to change the SSID of the network in the Nest cam. This was not easy. Trying to do it through the Nest app was a waste of 30 mins. It never took me to the network configuration and kept using the old configuration. I finally brought the Nest cam into the house and wired it to the Mac and used the app on the Nest cam to reconfigure the SSID. Either they removed the configuration change from the Nest app as all the help said I could change the SSID settings through the app or the help is plainly not in synch with the Nest app capabilities. So beware when you need to change the network configuration you will need to haul the cam over to a computer.",Works as advertised

I have the Nest Aware subscription, I love it because it continuously I can go back through The whole entire day and see everything that has happened, from the birds at the feeder to what the mail man delivers in the mail box.  Nest Aware is so worth the money.  I've tried other smart cams (both are pan & tilt) also the can that uses the Smart life app.  Yeah it's nice they rotate, but the quality and playback are NOTHING compared to Nest.  I will not but any other brand except nest.  I do wish they'd come out with a rotating cam. Original review I compared all of the brands and these by far had the best reviews so I tried them.

I bought the nestcam because it seemed the easiest to set up and the cloud storage makes more sense than storing locally ( I had my computer stolen in a break in before). Set up really was super easy--download app, scan code, and complete settings.  The device is powered by long micro usb cord. The camera is black and the cord/plug white--I don't really like that. I tried using a shorter cord and a battery pack with success. A decent battery pack and judicious use of on/off allows it to be placed virtually anywhere. I tried the camera in the house and facing out the front window. In both cases, picture is sharp--really quite impressive-- at both 1080 and 720.  I really only notice the difference when zooming. I tested night vision in the house and it worked very well. It does not work in the window pointing out due to the glass. Quality of picture is better on my iPhone 6 than on my iPad Air, which is probably due to the devices. Of importance to me is the distance it can capture detail. My porch is about 20 feet deep with another 20 feet to the street. While all activity is captured up to the horizon (houses on the opposite row), zooming in on details beyond about 30 feet will lack clarity. In other words, I can zoom in on a car license plate but not make out the numbers. With the camera in the window, most of the motion activated is passing cars and people, but every so often I cannot make out a trigger--seems to be wind in the trees or maybe a bird. I am not sure how long the software keeps history without a ""nest aware"" subscription; I signed up for the trial about 36 hours in, and all the history was still available. I was successful at taking screenshots of cars, etc on the iPad or iPhone, so that is an option if you don't need a week of history--you can take stills, just not video clips--for free. Signing up for nest aware was glitchy--after trying the iPad, iPhone, and then computer with chrome, I was able to complete the transaction in internet explorer. The interface changes only on the computer--allowing you to make clips and set zones. The software does not work well in chrome--activated motion time does not show up. I took off one star because remote access does not always work--sometimes it said camera was not connected or it could not reach Nest. I would close app and try again in a bit and it would usually work. I imagine with the new launch they are working out kinks, so I will re-assess and change rating accordingly in the future.",Nestcam Is working for me so far

I did not buy this camera for recording or storing video or photos.  I simply want to watch my pets in real-time.  So the NEST camera is automatically set up for the free trial of AWARE, which records and saves video. As I do not want to use the recording option, or the NEST Aware, I found it impossible to locate a setting to stop the recording and the NEST Aware 30 day trial.  Searching the settings and finding no way to stop the recording, I was forced to call NEST tech support. Long story short, I spend 2 hours on the phone with tech support trying to find out how to turn off the NEST Aware trial.  The first day, the rep told me to sign in, go to the NEST Aware trial, and cancel it, which I did.  24 hours later, the camera is still recording and saving video. So the next day, I call tech support again, give them the case # from the day before, they tell me the case number, which I wrote down correctly, is not valid.  So I had to start from scratch with tech support.  The first person I talked to was clueless, and totally unable to help me.  I asked for the higher level of tech support. Finally, after 2 hours over 2 days, the higher tier tech support was able to stop the NEST Aware trial, and the recording.  This is not something the user can do themselves, which I think is BS.  Plus, every time you go into the app to view your camera, there are constant banners popping up telling you to subscribe to Aware. When I pay $180 for a camera, as the user, I should be able to modify ALL of the setting myself.  Knowing now that Google owns NEST again, as told to me by tech support, this explains why they don't want you to be able to stop the recording and the Aware trial.  We all now how horrible Google is at collecting, saving, and selling our personal information. So be forewarned, if you purchase this camera, it is automatically going to have a NEST Aware 30 day trial, which is going to record and save all of your video, unless you contact tech support to stop the trial and the recording.",They really push the NEST Aware subscription....Google owns NEST again

This thing requires WI-FI (which is fine) but if it can't store multiple wi-fi locations if I move it from place to place with me/  Let me store multiple wifi's so its easy to connect. Not reliable- Nest went down (the website and service) as I am trying to explain to my wife and mother-in-law the value of this unit.  The app wouldn't explain why I couldn't connect.  It just kept saying- try later.  In reading the Nest status widget, looks like there's been an outage every week.  Why make us use the almighty cloud if it isn't reliable? Unit would get really hot.  I'm concerned on the longevity of the unit if it can't be on for a couple of hours without burning up. Only comes in black?  Baby first just starred the camera down like a focal point.  Our newest white monitor is in the same position, and baby doesn't even see it. No on/off switch- as stated early, unit gets real hot.  The only way to turn unit on or off is from the app or unplug the power.. Pro: Loved that it could be mounted to a gorillapod Pretty high quality video compared to most baby cams But in this case- the Cons severely outweighed the Pros, so we went with Infant Optics DXR-8 Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens, White/Biege , and we are pretty happy with the selection.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jun 2016,Blue Apple,"I really want to love the nestcam. The picture quality is amazing, and it was super easy to set up. If you are planning on using this as a baby monitor, I would keep looking. I NEVER get any alerts sent to mobile devices for sound. I mean, that's why I got this thing, to let me know when my baby is crying. It'll send me notifications for movement, but I don't want those, just sound. So I'm stuck having my iphone or ipad on all the time, open in the app, which obviously kills the device rather quickly. Oh, and even if it was working, you only get 1 alert every 30 minutes, not alerts as they occur. After dealing with their incredibly nice customer service for 3 days and not being able to figure out the problem, they finally told me, that this device isn't really intended for use as a baby monitor, and I'd be better off buying a different product! UPDATE: ok after talking for HOURS with several different technicians, I finally got the sound notifications to work! We actually had to totally delete my old profile and set up a different account with a different email address. So now I feel like I can give a better review after having successfully used the monitor for a month. The picture quality is great, and it looks great even zoomed in. I can check in on my baby at anytime, anywhere and I never have an issue with it dropping service. My biggest problem with this device is still with the notifications. Nest will only send an alert for a sound or motion detection every 30 minutes because they say they ""don't want to annoy you with constant notifications"".  However, this is such a major flaw in so many ways. I should be able to say whether or not this is annoying to me, and be able to adjust how often I receive notifications. We're not living in 2001, the technology is there to do this.... it's just lazy engineering, or computer programming or whatnot. If they fixed this, I would probably give it 5 stars. However as it is, it's not a perfect baby monitor.",not a true baby monitor/ notifications are problematic

I have zero complaints about it. I've used 3 different types of security cam setups over the past 7 years and Nest is by far my favorite.  (Others have been your standard pan/tilt cams that do not record but have mobile viewing, as well as a full CCTV DVR setup.) I do subscribe to Nest Aware because of the cloud based recording and the ability to save clips.  (I travel a lot for business and like to see what my cats are doing... and often enough they are bouncing off the walls, so totally worthy of saving clips to share with friends and family.)  It also helps for when my wife is ignoring her phone.  I can let her know through the cam that I'm trying to get a hold of her.  It's only $10 a month for the 10 day revolving recording.  Very worth it. The biggest benefit is that I can see when someone enters my apartment.  More importantly I can see and hear when there is a problem.  An example is in October 2016 our upstairs neighbors had their water heater pop.  The Nest Cam sent me a notification when it noticed my cat staring up at the ceiling.  The damage could have been much, much worse since our neighbors were gone for the week and no one was going to be home at my apartment for 3 more days.  Because of the cam notification I was able to contact the office and have maintenance there within 5 mins.  We only had to get the carpet replaced.  Everything else (tables, piano, sofa, etc) was saved. Sure, there are hiccups here and there when I've had issues with wifi, but I get both an email and a notification on my phone letting me know if the camera has been off for 10 mins due to a drop in network signal.  This would be the case with any security setup these days. I'm currently thinking about getting a 2nd Nest Cam and getting rid of our pan/tilts so that all of my cameras are accessible through the same app.","The best, hands down"

I have 4 different cams including 2 Belkin NetCams, 2 Panasonic BL-C230's (tough to configure), 3 DropCams and now 1 Nest Cam. The Nest Cam and the Drop Cams are the easiest to configure followed by the Belkin NetCams and lastly the Panasonic BL-C230's (not quite plug and play, not even close). The Dropcams and Nest Cam are literally plug and play so setup is fast and easy. The Nest Cam transmits in 1080p and the DropCams are rated at 720p max. The Panasonic and Blekin units are 640x480 pixels and 720p respectively. Only the Panasonic can pan and scan and none of them really have zoom other than software driven. The Nest and DropCam units do offer online recording (7 or 30 days) and notification when something enters a user selectable zone. Not cheap at $10/mo (7day) with $5/mo for each additional camera. The user cannot record the video other tha through the Nest service. The Belkin does offer notification of humans in the picture for $2.99/mo but I don't have any experience with this.

It has worked well with or without a subscription. I tried both ways. Least for my intent of being able to watch my pet when I not at home. My co worker enjoys it too when I was watching my pet who she likes. Security of needing a phone confirmation code is nice for logins and a good method to protect account. However lately the nest server goes down a few times making the camera useless and a paper weight. This is a big opportunity as there doesn’t seem to be any redundancy unlike the nest thermostat that can be used without any internet or service. Contacting customer service via chat during an outage or upgrade. Didn’t get a clear answer to what was happening. To me the conversation was mostly fluff and taking my comments to higher management. I didn’t feel that they were doing anything as mentioned above and to them it has happened a few times with there server going down.,Great camera when nest server is up.

I noticed a huge difference after using it for a few days.

Pro: The field of view is much larger than the wemoNetCam.  I am able to cover the area of my home where I had two (2) wemoNetCam covering due to their narrow view. I get a better App user experience with notices.  The capture of photos along with a push notice is a nice feature. Live views are quick without delays, it does not have the Lag that I've experienced with the wemoNetCam by Belkin. Camera triggers itself on when the Nest Smoke detector alert goes off. Image capture is quicker than the wemoNetCam.

I had other Nest products, so this made buying Nest more of a known quantity. It was (what I thought) to be the best solution for me, which was to provide a level of security, and also monitor pets while away. A decent investment, but not a replacement for a security system. Pros: -Undoubtedly well made: these are solid metal frames with tightly-fitting camera bezels and strong mounting magnets. Theoretically, these will stand up to years of (indoor) abuse, which they should not face anyway. -Flawless set-up: I was up and running very quickly, and using the basic features in minutes. -Compatibility: As with other Nest products, these are compatible with nearly every hub and system out there. Cons: -Resolution: It's just not as crisp as I would have expected for the price. In many cases under the ""auto"" resolution this could be due to the selection based on the internet speed, but even manually at 1080p, the picture isn't crystal clear as I expected. It's not bad, but it's just not great. -Recurring cost: $150 per year ($100 for first camera, $50 for second) is just ridiculous to pay for a Nest Aware subscription. Alas, I did it, but I'm not happy about it. At that ongoing price, you could get a basic security monitoring system, with many more features. Also, I knew that the Nest Aware subscription would come at a price, but I did not know that ""zones"" are also only available with a subscription. I feel as though I have to pay for a neat, but key piece of basic monitoring software. -Notifications: For me, these just do not work properly, and hours of support from Nest have not been able to resolve it. Basically, there are many manual and automatic options of when you turn your cameras on and off, what decides when you are home and away. In short, I want my cameras always on, but to only receive activity notifications (possible intruders, etc.) when I am away. There is a perfect option to disable notifications when home (yay!), but it just doesn't work (boo!). I get notifications all the time when I am home, despite many attempts to alter settings and correct the issue. Nest won't admit it's a flaw, but has said they are working on a number of enhancements, of which this may (or may not) be one. In the end, I still like the promise of the Nest cam. It has simplicity on its side, but it is only as capable as _you_ make it and are willing to fiddle with it on an ongoing basis. In the end, for the price, there are perhaps other security cameras that are better for others.","Good, but a few flaws and pricey."

Burns-Dyson,"I was looking at cameras for my home for a while, the Nest cams were a little out of my price range. A recent event made me commit to getting cameras and after thoroughly reading a ton of reviews across many different cameras, I sucked it up and bought three Nest cams. I normally focus on peoples negative reviews so as to see what problems I may have. Among these negative items were ""hard to set up, would not connect"", ""constant issues with Nest being unavailable"". These two were my biggest concerns, I wanted reliable and I wanted easy because I couldn't sell my wife on multiple cameras that weren't easy for her to look at and involved logging in to some crazy web portal. Within 30 minutes of receiving the cameras I had set them up, attached them in the corners of the rooms they were going in and was looking at them on the app on my wife's phone. You plug the camera into your laptop, use the installer to set it up. Register the camera with your account and off you go. The cameras are connected to my 5Ghz wireless network, but in places that are normally spotty. I have no issue viewing the cameras at 720p at all. The only negative moment I have had came last week when I got a notification of motion and went to log in to find the site was down and I couldn't view the cameras. This lasted at most 10 minutes. Afterward, I was able to log in and it didn't appear to have lost 10 minutes of video, so it doesn't look like the site being unavailable is necessarily lost video footage.

But I tired of waiting for the professions to give a decent response to my non-commercial, residential needs. I looked at the Nest zcsm and the Netgear and decided to give the fan-favorite a try. I live in a house with multiple Wi-Fi access points. And I learned not to configure it where you open the box, but to configure it to be mounted. Otherwise, you might have trouble reaching the access point you configured it to use. It must be looking for more than SSID and password, and I had to delete and re-add the camera after I moved it or the viewing application clocked.  I have limited experience in moving this around, and I hope I don't have similar issues with the Outdoor version if I do add one. Once properly connected, the application keeps showing a banner to get you to subscribe to their retention service.  I did see I had some Free Trial that expires in a month, and would have liked to opt-in to that trial when I had more time to play, rather than have it start without my knowledge. But the advertisement for the subscription is annoying, at best, and aggravating over time. Well, the daylight images are excellent, and I like the ability to zoom in, even if it isn't the best quality on my viewing device. I placed this on my basement wall in a powered wall clock receptical, and the wide-angle was outstanding from the corner of a large area. At night with the ligts out, the large surfaces of ceiling and wall become an issue, since the night vision lighting reflects back and the other areas look much too dim.  You are warned about this in the materials, so I was not surprised; I just did not have a choice. At just under US$200 this seems pricey for a basic HD camera and a basic app.  There is no obvious troubleshooting or debugging feature for connectivity, and having to delete and add it when you want to change the wireless configuration seems crazy. I purchased this as a test before ai made a more substantial multi-unit purchase, outdoor and indoor, and it has not caused me to jump back on and fill my cart - at least at this price point. It is a nice visual design, in any color as long as it's black. It needs to come in some shade of white. The camera can't swivel, so your stand must and not many do exactly what you want.  But, all in all, it's an approachable, novice-skill, wireless camera that has quite a few fans, even before it was acquired by Nest.","Almost a Perfect, but Premium Priced"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2017,David S.,"Very easy set up. Sturdy product. I highly recommend for all people. Our house was broken into a few months back, and despite the enormous financial loss to us, my wife and I were dumbfounded that in this day in age, why the heck didn't we have cameras?!?! Especially since we are somewhat tech-savvy. Decided to purchase this 3-pack and for 3 months now we're very pleased. In the beginning we had minor difficulties changing the different notifications because our iPhones and emails would constantly get alerts. But after fiddling around with the settings, we got things under control. You may experience at times WiFi issues (loss of signal) depending on the distance between your router and camera. On days when AT&T has weak home internet service due to weather or other circumstances, you may get bombarded with email notifications because each time the camera loses signal, you get an alert the camera is off. It's not a big deal, and I'd rather get the alerts than none at all. Because I travel a lot, I like the fact I can use their simple App on iPhone or iPad and randomly check the inside my house to ensure the family is safe. $10 per month for 10-days of cloud recording storage, and $5 for each additional camera. So you're basically looking at a combined $20 fee for all 3 cams. A discount of roughly 2 months is offered if you pay 12 months in advance (meaning I paid $100 for the first camera for 10-days recording for the year and $50 per year for each additional camera -- for a total of $200 for all 3 cams for the year).",Love it!

I'm happy to say to we are satisfied with the capabilities of this camera. The wireless access for both iOS and Android are very easy to setup and we've had very little issues. Originally intended as an out the window camera, we've successfully used the camera in just about every place we've had it. The only issue we've had is that sometimes it'll turn itself off but a quick check and reset of your wireless modem and your back in business. Another feature wee definitely enjoy is the notification software you can configure through the website. This allows you to be notified for everything or just events that you choose. The Nest Aware subscription is a MUST! There has been plenty of times when we've had to scroll back through the footage to look for anything and are glad the camera caught it. As long as you have phone reception, you can check this camera anywhere, even at work or on the go. Definitely recommended and you get what you pay for.","Great image, features, capabilities"

I can see our pet when were not home. We have a wireless alarm system, but wanted the ease of being able to see what’s going on when were not home and to be notified with any movement while were not home. The only feature I’m not really crazy about is that you don’t have the option to turn off the notifications when your home without shutting it off entirely. You should be able to have an away button while your gone that’s easy. If you leave it on you get texted constantly with your own movement when your home. It is doing what we needed it for.

When I received the notice that Drop Cam was now the nest, and that I needed to download the new app, I didn't think it was a problem. I was wrong.  It's cumbersome to say the least.  It takes more steps to get what I need than it did the previous App.  It's frustrating because really, why ""fix"" what was never broken.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Mar 2016,Ben,"The good: My Nest Cam sends me notifications when it sees motion or hears sound. It seems to be very accurate; it'll identify the roomba and cat but ignores the swaying tree branches out the window. I can look through those alerts immediately from my smartphone or I can wait until later and browse through the video history (video history is only available through their subscription; notifications work without). The cam provides a live feed viewable from your smartphone or pc where you can also manage features like video quality and notifications. With the new away assist feature Nest just launched, the camera turns on when I leave the house and off when I'm home. It's worked pretty much flawlessly since the launch. The bad: Nest Cam has no onboard battery or memory; if your wifi goes down or you lose power, you won't be recording. For the price tag, I expect more for a security camera system. The subscription is justifiable, but I would rather have the ability to store my videos locally than pay to keep them in the cloud. Additionally, a small amount of free cloud space should be allotted to every cam. Connecting the camera to a new wifi network is a major pain and difficult to do through the software. The camera doesn't have motors but can be angled in almost any direction and has a wide lens. The ugly: The super long usb cable is necessary but hideous. I'm still figuring out how to hide it.","Great concept, good execution, hefty price, room to improve"

When you click to ""play"" a live stream, it just goes black and won't play. This problem is happening from multiple locations. The problem is on the nest service side. 8 days ago, EVERY stream was broken. Then a couple days later they all started working again, for about a day. Now, they are stopping working one by one.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jan 2016,J. Hill,"I purchased this product to augment 2 Dropcam cameras I already had. Nest, the smart thermostat people, bought Dropcam and now market their cameras under the Nest brand. I had the Dropcam app, which controlled the 2 older cameras, but in order to add this camera I had to download the Nest app. The camera is essentially the same as camera in the the Dropcams, except the device that holds the actual camera is fancier. It takes video of whatever you want and, for $50/year per camera, uploads it to the cloud so that you can retrieve ten days worth of video. The problem with this camera is not so much the camera, but the mobile app that you use to control it. Setup is relatively easy, though the time it takes the camera to connect to wifi is so long you may think it's not going to connect. Also the setup instructions are bare bones at best, so if you haven't installed one before you may want to do some online research to find some hints. I also had to add a modem extender, since the camera didn't want to connect to wifi where I put it, even though other mobile devices connect in that area just fine. There is allegedly a Home/Away feature, where you can click AWAY to turn on the cameras when you leave home, and then click HOME when you return home to turn them off. I have yet to get this to work, and based on comments in Nest online forums, I'm not the only one. Since these cameras upload 24/7 you need fast wifi to handle the bandwidth. This was not a problem at all with the older 2 cameras using the Dropcam mobile app, but adding the 3rd camera and using the Nest app appears to use substantially more bandwidth. All in all, the camera is certainly usable, and if you have a ton of bandwidth you can even see the video in 1080p. The rest of us are in 360p.  But these cameras worked better under the Dropcam app than they do with the new Nest app, and when you access Support, you get the strange sensation that the entire Support menu is nothing but an upsale for the Nest thermostat. Basically Nest took a good product and made it worse.","Nest is the new Dropcam, but not nearly as good"

Setup was easy and fast. I now have the Nestcam, Nest protect and of course the nest thermostat. All integrate well with one another. This being a cloud based WI-Fi cam, it DEPENDS on the company's website/server to be working constantly to be effective and thus far (2 months now) its been reliable for my $100 a year cloud storage fee. Recording constantly at 1080P, the camera does get a bit warm but no big deal. Compared to my ring doorbell pro, the resolution (both are supposed to be 1080p), the nest cam wins hands down and WAAAY easier to set up. Once you get it set up however and your preferences dialed in like you like them, it's a set it and forget it appliance. Motion sensors are good, night vision is good, notifications are within a reasonable time and unlike ring, it records 24/7 so your notifications or movement includes 3 seconds before the movement, the movement and as much as you wish to watch after the movement. Ring turns on and records when there is movement so you usually get the ""after shot"" which is irritating. Well done NEST.

Nest provides a warranty with these cameras, but they absolutely would not replace one of my cameras when it failed.  They kept wanting me to get on tech support calls that would each last a minimum of 30 minutes.  When they could not solve the problem, you would think they would agree to replace the camera, but no--instead they would say that there were going to need to have someone else run me through more tests.

I have the camera placed at the top head board of my sons crib...a foot to 2 feet from where he lays? The image is horribly pixelated. I can’t even see him breathing, which is the main reason why I bought this camera, because everyone I know (who has Nest) stated that the picture quality is “amazing.”  Motion is delayed 3-6 seconds.

The problems below still persist after the recent iOS Nest app update. It has been months since I bought them in November 2016 and they still have not resolved this basic issue. I very much regret buying four of these expensive cameras. Edit: 04/02/2017. Chatted with Nest support about my snapshot history for the last three hours being totally blank (I don’t have a NestAware subscription and am limited to these snapshots). This has happened quite often since getting these cameras. I know there should be activity there. They tried some things like remotely resetting my camera which didn’t make much difference. During the chat with them, my history will suddenly be viewable on the iPhone. Then a few minutes later, it will be totally blank. This is true for multiple cameras. This gives me zero confidence that I’ll be able to view my history in a timely fashion in the event of an emergency. Also doesn't encourage me to give them any money for NestAware when I'm so often disappointed with how things work as it is. Edit: 04/14/2017. Tried getting notifications working again as I periodically do since my original bad support experience in late 2016. The menus have changed slightly in the iPhone app and on the website which makes me think they attempted to improve notifications. Long story short...they still don't work. After walking around in front of the camera on and off for a half hour (alerts set to ""only when away"" and I currently have it set to Away), I finally got one single email to come in SEVEN MINUTES AFTER THE MOTION ACTIVITY EVENT. This is with me on wifi and monitoring my (push) email, so the problem definitely is with Nest and not my email. Ugh. Sigh sigh sigh. Please see my original review below for even more reasons not to invest in Nest. Will attempt to get notifications working again in a couple months. Not at all reliable now. Original Review: 2+ weeks of dealing with Nest senior level support has left me beyond frustrated. I'm getting notifications for activity when I'm home despite ""only when no one's home"" being enabled in settings. After jumping through a ton of troubleshooting hoops and ultimately creating an entire new Nest account, the problem persists. Got a final phone call today after the ""engineers reviewed my case"" and senior support passed along the word from up top that the engineers say I need to have location services on for my issue to be resolved (which does not have anything to do with my problem as I've described it countless times). After explaining (for the 10th time) that I have the problem with location services both on and off, he proceeded to tell me that ""it's a known issue and they're working on it."" I bought FOUR of these expensive cameras for several reason but notification support was a huge one, and now I've been asked to ""keep an eye on updates"" for an indeterminate time to see if it is fixed. (Also found out after buying them that notifications only show up ONCE every 30-minute interval for each camera, which is totally unacceptable.) Except for this frustrating experience, the iOS and web apps are pretty good. But that does not ameliorate all of the other issues here and I refuse to rate the app more than one star until this is fixed. Will update this review if something changes. PS: What you're viewing ""live"" on your cameras is sometimes 5-10 seconds delayed. I have fast internet with excellent wifi. This is ridiculous. Does not make me want to pay the monthly subscription for Nest Aware when they can't even get free functionality performing well. PPS: My cameras go ""offline"" sporadically quite often. There's nothing else I can do to optimize their location or wifi settings. All cameras are within 10-15 feet of an 802.11ac wifi router. The one that goes offline most is actually about 5 feet from the router. I wish I had the option to plug in a cat6 ethernet cable, but it's wifi only. I'm at a loss with this product.","""That's a known problem"" (Notifications broken)"

That's good, right?  If what you are looking for is a camera that is always on and you don't want to tweak any settings.  Read no further, this is a great cam for you.  If you are going to want to tweak settings, here are the cons: - the ""home/away"" feature hasn't worked since Nest acquired Dropcam, it's now 100% unreliable.  I've been waiting for this to be fixed for months.  I've given up hope. - the scheduling feature of when the camera should be on/off is surprisingly difficult.  It should be as simple as ""turn on at this time and turn off at that time"" but sometimes it reinterprets my times as ""turn off the next day"" and sometimes it doesn't.  Also beyond hoping this will be fixed. - the camera boasts that it can detect and notify you of movement in your ""activity zones.""  I've adjusted and readjusted mine and I typically get notified for any activity in my camera at all.  I'm not stupid, I have turned off notifications for all but my activity zone.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2016,whatsupdate,"Edit to add: There is a new ""outdoor"" model being released in September. If you are like me and are planning to use some of these outside it may be worth waiting for the new model. To use this model outside you will have to put it in a weatherproof enclosure which may reduce night vision or sound quality. These things are delightfully simple to setup, and offer a good option for home monitoring to those of us who don't want to configure a router or run cables all over a house. There are trade offs to this simple solution however...a lot of them. First, if you have more than one or two, expect that video quality may intermittently degrade due to wifi/internet bandwidth issues. We use these in two homes, one home uses one and the other uses seven. The home with one is much more reliable and more often has good clear video. The home with seven has frequent episodes where video will pixelate and is prone to have cameras off line. Another trade off is that these things are expensive relative to standard home security type cameras. While I am really grateful that these cameras allow us to easily monitor a house 3000 miles away, it can also be an exercise in frustration. The software often hangs (you will get very used to swing a blue circle spinning in your screen) and requires a desktop computer and a paid subscription to use all features. Speaking of which, if you want to record any video wou will have to pay a subscription for each camera (discounted rates for each camera on the same plan after the first). Overall the cameras do work well, there is a 2-3 second lag but the quality is good. Audio works but two way conversation is clunky due to the lag. For me, this is an amazing product because it functions well enough and was easy enough that I could install 7 cameras in a day and a half (we installed many in outdoor/difficult to reach  areas using weather proof enclosures which work great but added difficulty to the setup). Remember these are not totally wireless, you still need to provide power.",Easy enough that anyone can set one up!

The cost is comparable so I'm hoping this lasts longer than the Motorola did (2 years).  We already had the Nest Thermostat and so we're familiar with connecting the product and the phone app - both are extremely easy and intuitive.  The camera works both in light as well as in the dark so we're happy to find this as a ""baby monitor"" alternative. In reading a few other reviews it sounds like there was a significant delay, but we tested ours and found about only 1 second - similar to the Motorola so I'm led to believe delays may be dependent on internet wifi speed within the house.

McNeil,"I purchased a drop cam a few years ago and I love it.  However, since Nest took over, not so much.  I recently took the plunge and purchased a second camera, this time a Nest indoor camera (to go with my older Drop cam).  I always viewed my drop cam through the Drop Cam app and have rarely had any problems.  However, now with the Nest Cam, I can only view both cameras through the Nest Website and App.  Over the course of the last 5 days, I've called Nest support 3 times by phone and have been on hold for a total of 3 hours and never got through.  I contacted them on Twitter but they told me I had to call by phone.  Their support department does not have an email address - or if they do, they don't advertise it - that is ludicrous!  Therefore, I have no choice but to return my nest cam.  It's a shame because it is a nice camera and has everything that I want and transmits beautiful video.  But it doesn't do any good if you cannot view the cameras while you are away from home.  It has been this way ever since NEST purchased Drop Cam.  I would never buy any of the Nest integrated systems.  They are very expensive and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get support.  Guess I'll have to find a new security camera product.  For all the money their products cost, shame on Nest for not being there for its customers!!!",Nest - NEVER AGAIN...

There is a circular wall mount which attaches with three provided screws. Secure said mount to wall and simply place flat base stand on/against wall mount and it will hold there because they are magnetic. Super easy and mobile. Just remember that you need a power outlet(110) within about 25ft unless you run an extension cord, to power the cam.

The problem is with the nest billing department. I have addressed my issue with them  multiple times with many agents. I always get a technical agent when I call.

The reason being, they're easy to install, (all you do is plug them in), it doesn't get simpler than that?!!  Nest offers two programs, (10 day or 30 day), to record & retain your picture security information at reasonable rates that vary depending on the number of indoor or outdoor cameras you have?  Regardless, the rates are incredibly cheap and can be modified, started or stopped at any time, we find this very consumer service oriented.  Some people complain that they are continually notified via mobile phone of movement around the house?  We don't have that problem, believe us when we say we LOVE THE SECURITY and piece of mind Nest security cameras provide when we're on the road or home!

I recently had 2 Drop cams that we installed and worked flawlessly for a long time. When the Nest Cam came out I was excited by the increase in resolution and so bought 2 more to install. The main problem behind the Nest Cam is the significant change in the interface software. Things just don't seem as intuitive to set up or access. Access seems a bit more clunky. As an example of the new technical complications, we had 2 drop cams that were both subscribed to the recording service. I wanted to replace one of the drop cams (to get the higher resolution in that area) and move the drop cam in that location to a new location were I would not require the recording service. In order to switch the recording service from one device to the other I had to completely disconnect all the devices from my account and then reconnect them in order, starting with the ones that wanted to be on the recording system first. Now this wasn't a big hassle as I was only playing with 3 cameras, but it is a huge oversight in terms of integrated functionality in my view. If I had more cameras and wanted to move around the subscription this would become a fairly arduous task. Anecdotally we also seem to be having more problems with the Nest Cam server service these days than we used to. Of course as these cams only work when they are connected to the server that kills all functionality pretty much straight away. The cameras do still provide a great quality picture and the widest angle I have found anywhere, but as a security device I am starting to weight up other options as there are just too many issues for the premium price associated with this device.",A step down from the previous iteration of this device

But the lack of a motion sensor just leads to a constant barrage of notifications about ""activity"" which gets triggered by any changes in the light. In my case the trigger has been the fact that it gets dark outside in the evening (hello Nest, are you aware of that basic fact???) and an outside light that comes on around dusk. I ONLY want to get a notification when there is a physical object moving around in my house (a.k.a burglar). I will be returning the nest cam and will get another brand that has a motion sensor so I don't have to get freaked out four times a day about a message telling me that there is some ""activity"".

Location based recording works about 25% of the time, the app crashes to a white screen that requires a complete reboot, I have to manually turn on/off cameras one-by-one (because the automated on/off glitches out), and the subscriptions (CVR) didn't reliably transfer when they forced Nest integration.  You can still use the DropCam app to continue using the features that they've been removing, but support for the app clearly ended, as it's COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE.  I think Google just wants iOS to be unreliable in order to push Android, which is a poor business decision.

We have the highest speed internet and our other IoT devices don't have this problem including streaming devices (the resolution on the Nest cam is not close to quality as other video). I don't understand why this product fails us. We try all the trouble shooting and the only thing that works is unplugging and plugging back in for it to fail again. And doing that fix is not easy when the baby is asleep in his room where the camera is. Basically the camera does the job. When it works. But it's not a reliable option whatsoever. Especially given the cost. Also when the camera goes offline, and comes back eventually on its own, it has some blinking lights that wake up our baby.

From the simple set-up to the easy to use interface, this product is top notch. Replaced a commercial grade camera with a nest recently and the image and responsiveness is beyond reproach. It does only work indoors which can be a problem for some installations. With the availability of after-market products the outdoor problem can be solved but it will require further investment from you. I still give it 5 stars as they do plainly state this in the product description but I think this was a missed opportunity for them to make it weatherproof. I do look forward to a ""pro"" version of this camera that will allow scan, tilt, and/or manual panning.

For night, you have to turn off the IR lights or it will reflect off glass, but it still works. When I have movement outside of my house, my night light goes on and the camera picks up a fair amount of detail. Edit: Since I wrote the review Nest has changed it's programming.

It works great for indoor use, I actually aim it through a window for outdoor use (from inside the house).  The biggest limitation with type of use is that the LED emitters do not pass through glass, so you need to turn them off (in the settings, this is easy).  It works GREAT for indoor use, it works Pretty Well they way I use it.  (referring to image quality - mostly suffers at night due to the emitter issue above).  The software I found very easy to setup, even with little tech know how. The ability to play back/record is great - I used their trial and really grew to love it.  You should be aware there is a significant cost to the service to maintain full functionality.  So - these units are not cheap and then there is a fee for the full recording functionality.

The good: I like that the camera is now fully integrated in my Nest environment - I have Nest thermostat, Nest Protect and now Nest Cam. What I dislike is that while the camera is pretty well made, the good quality hardware is spoiled by some questionable software choices - the mandatory cloud storage (paid) is a real downer - I wish I could opt to store my stuff locally. I know Google/Nest is known for the cloud, but in the first week of use, their cloud was down twice. When down, I can't remotely access my camera, I can't control my thermostat, and I don't know whether my smoke alarms are all working right. Then there is the fact that the camera only works on Wi-Fi. While I like the ease of this, I wish I could opt to go wired. Wi-Fi is nice, but hardly reliable. Additional negatives are for the price - at $199, I can buy three Foscam or Hikvision cameras AND have money left to buy a good quality remote management/viewing package. That said, there is something to be said for plug and play. You never have to mess with IP addresses or other stuff to make a Nestcam work - so it is clearly for an audience that just wants ease of use, and prefers a good looking camera over something that needs some tinkering.","An excellent camera if you just want plug and play. Priced too high, with a paid monthly membership required for full use."

The app was user friendly and the install was a breeze.  The same is true for the Nest Cam, unless you intend to use it to monitor the stream using a PC or Mac.  Unless you are willing to pay for a Nest Aware subscription or don't care about storing the video, I would recommend a different product . . . there are many available that do not require a subscription. My biggest disappointment came from attempting to use the camera to monitor another room in the house using my office PC, an application that is baseline for anyone wanting to use it to monitor children.  I made multiple attempts to stream to a PC running Windows 10 and Google Chrome.  Forget it.  Chrome has a built-in Flash Player that is NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nest software.  This forces you to change browsers, which I did with limited success.  The only reason I'm giving this product two stars is the image quality on my iPhone, which is very good.  In every other respect, I would give it a single star. One last thing . . . the in-app pressure to purchase the Nest Aware subscription is relentless and you cannot make it go away.",Forget about streaming LIVE video to a PC or MAC . . . unless you like the Flash Player logo in the middle of the image

It has a steady red light and according to Nest it means the LED light is malfunctioning. Fortunately for Nest, this happened right after the warranty had expired, so they wouldn't do anything. I guess they make products just good enough to last the warranty period. I set up to receive notifications when the camera spotted a person. However, I would say 70% of the time when the camera spots a person, I do not receive notifications. Such crappy technology.",defective hardware & unreliable notifications

Simple scan with my phone of the QR code on the back to set up, pushes wifi config to cam, works with any variety of my routers -- Apple included, and I access from the same app I use to control thermostats.

The online (web-based; ie Safari or Chrome) viewing is a little buggy, but overall it's a great camera. Image quality is much sharper than the original DropCam. There were occasional reliability issues in the past, but we haven't had those issues in over a year now. We primarily used it as a baby cam and with another on the way, we didn't hesitate to get the upgraded camera. Also used it as a pet cam. We have a yellow lab with occasional separation anxiety. On a recent day trip to the beach we spied in to make sure she wasn't doing something like eating a cardboard box or whatever else she can get her paws on to. There's a microphone button in the app and a speaker on the camera, that allows you to talk your dog off the proverbial ledge and calm the hell down.",Baby Cam AND Dog Cam

Setup has been a nightmare! Components meant for Nest Cam don't fit. Cords recommended by Amazon break after the first day. The suction cup window option doesn't work if you have window blinds. The largest amount of bandwidth my Internet supplier can provide is not enough to run these three cameras. The app is terrible. It's so simple, you have no control. I signed up for the Aware subscription and it applied it to the the main camera and the camera we don't have setup right now! No option to fix it. Terrible. Flawed. Motion sensor cuts off mid incident if the person in question takes a stutter step, missing the act in question. The camera does its job at high resolution, but the support software and components are AWFUL. The company wants you to pay for an installer on top of the purchase price.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jan 2016,Ensō,"Excellent features, but service drops make it difficult to rely on. We were looking for alternatives to other baby monitors since we live in a condo with lots of wireless activity. A lot of monitors do not have the signal strength to compete with all the other connections, so we thought trying to utilize a drop cam that makes use of our Wi-Fi instead of competing against it would be a good option. It worked great at first, but we noticed while testing it during the day that the nest service itself would cut out unexpectedly. The camera image is sent to Nest's online servers and then back to your phone, it's not a direct connection. When this happens we would have to restart the app and login again. The app does not try to reestablish connection on its own or make any type of warning noise when the connection is lost. It is for this reason that we could not rely on it to work throughout the night as a baby monitor. I think this service has a lot of potential, but not if the service cuts out unexpectedly. I will keep an eye on reviews for Nest in the future and hope some of these issues are addressed.","Robust features, but not dependable. Do not recommend as a baby monitor."

Both the phone and web app interface are extremely limited. You can't review past footage on desktop website without monthly membership and viewing/saving footage from last 24 hrs using the phone app is clunky. Picture quality and motion detection is good.

Anyway, bought this “like new” and it was pretty much brand new. Couldn’t tell it was ever opened actually. A little bit concerning is that this was a contractor version (which is the same as retail) but it clearly says “not for retail sale” on the box.

I've bragged on them for a long time and have been happy with them. I bought this nestcam with the same expectations. As far as the camera does, it's great and similar in style. A little thinner. If you're looking to split screen multiple cameras then do not buy this. Nest took away the feature that made Dropcam so great (after they merged). Had I known, I would have gone anther route. Nothing worse then having 2 for your babies (in different rooms) and having to toggle back and forth between them instead of bringing both up at the same time. There's a lot of ppl complaining about this on their site, but nest doesn't seem to be as customer service friendly as dropcam was. If you're getting just one end know you'll never get another then go for it. Quality is subpar. Could be better. Having multiple ones gives you the ""quality may not be great"" message.  There are probably better options out there so do your homework. Just kind of sad because I was the biggest Dropcam advocate, sharing it everywhere and telling friends and family to buy. Now I'm just disappointed.",Don't buy if you plan to steam more than one!

The thing already costs way too much for me to also have to shell out $120 a year to Nest just to ""record"" video. They try to add gimmicks to their subscription (motion tracking, special area detection, door recognition), but my $10 USB camera from Walmart has those features.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2016,C. Brendel,"The new stands for the Nest Cams are great, much improved over the Dropcam design. I have three cameras set up around our house, one in the nursery, one outside housed in a Dropcase, and a third looking out our front window to the yard and street. Video quality at 1080p is good, but not great. Night vision works well, and having two-coms is great. My only complaint is that sometimes the cameras turn off when we arrive home, despite the settings for home/away being disabled. I may need to do a hard reset on the cameras. By the way, if you own Nest Thermostat you HAVE to download Skylark, which creates a geofence around your house so the Nest knows when you're actually home and away based on phones location. Not really part of the camera, but a major ""accessory"", Nest Aware subscription. I feel like $200/year for three cameras and 10-day recording history is a little high compared to the competition, especially since Nest doesn't offer any sort of free 1-day or 12-hour options like some others do. Additionally, you are not allowed to set zone priorities unless you have a Nest Aware subscription for that specific camera. The zone priorities should be allowed on all cameras as long as you have a subscription. Without the zones, I would receive a lot of false notifications. All-in-all I'm happy with the cameras and tolerant of the subscription given that a full blown security system would be astronomically higher.","The new stands for the Nest Cams are great, much improved over the Dropcam design"

I purchased this cam to monitor my secondary residence entryway when I am hundreds of miles away. The association management has a key to my condo for emergencies. Since I am there only a few weeks a year I wanted a way to check the inside temperature as well as make sure management is not going into my condo. It's set to face the only entryway/exit and has performed flawlessly so far. I have gotten a few false alarms due to a moth buzzing the camera or a loud noise like a thunder clap. Recently I received an alert for motion and when I reviewed the clip I can hear someone unlocking the dead bolt then I clearly see the property mgr open the door but never step in then relocking the door. So it's doing exactly what I need it to do and I find the sound to be pretty good on listening as well as speaking. I also have a digital clock with a temperature reading facing the nest cam to keep an eye on the interior temp from a far. I plan on getting a second cam to view the yard outside the condo as well. Overall I am very pleased on how easy it was to set up and use. I like the 720P setting and find the 1080P not required.  Overall picture quality is excellent day or night. I like when my phone is present the cam turns itself off. The only con for me is I need to keep my wifi running 24//7 to keep this, what I call security cam running. It's a worth while expense for me. I definitely would recommend this cam for any viewing needs.",Works Great!

My only complaint is the cameras think there is movement when the sun comes out or the lighting in the house changes.

I found the motion and sound detector works great, you have to turn the volume up all the way to hear anything but it works well, the record feature works well and I like the fact that I can talk back.  The ADT cameras do not have these functions.  Further the night camera works well but the range is short.  Like 15 - 20 ft. Still I am happy with my purchase.  $199 is a little high. The cost of storage of the videos is high.  $50 per camera per year for 10 days storage.  That is a giant rip off. But it does work.  So I am spending $200 per year extra.

Newman,"It's ok. The pros: Great to be able to see my home entryway and other areas when away, and get notifications when something is happening. It's a neat service in that regard. The cons: 1) 4 out of 5 times (or more) the motion detector notices motion it is a false alarm, usually a fly or moth buzzing past. It's so annoying that it becomes a ""cry wolf"" situation and you have the option to either a) turn off the notifications (which defeats the entire purpose) b) keep checking the phone every time and just waste a bunch of time c) ignore it.  It's a great shame this thing cannot tell the difference between a person walking up my steps and a moth, but I suppose in a few years time they will have figured it out. In the meantime, it's quite frustrating. 2) Vast mountains of packaging. 1) Amazon box. 2) Shrink wrap 3) cardboard box. 4) another cardboard box 5) plastic shell.

Super easy to set up. I use the app on my phone. I do get a lot of alerts for lights from cars passing by but better than it missing something important! Without the Nest Aware subscription, you basically get a screenshot with an alert but it's hard to tell from a still photo. You also get only 3 hours of stored footage. So if your house gets robbed and you're on a flight with no WiFi you might be screwed. With Nest Aware subscription (I STRONGLY RECOMMEND), you get notifications with a little gif/clip to see exactly what moved to caused the alert (example: reflections from a car driving by outside, spouse/kids coming home from work/school, burglars, ghostly apparition, etc.) With Nest Aware Basic ($10/month or $100/year): 10 day video history, intelligent alerts (motion/lights vs. person), clips and time lapses, activity zones. (I don't think anyone needs to get the 30 day video history plan.) Personally, I bought Nest Cam for home security and it's great peace of mind.

Vu,"I've ordered and received my Nest Cam today, despite all the negative reviews I've just read recently on this product.  I had high hopes for this cam based on the specs and visual appearance of the product.  I was willing to pay the $10/month for the cloud recording service.  Unfortunately, this darn thing is far from a simple 1 minute setup as advertised.  I spent over 3 hours trying to add it to my Nest account.  It kept failing to connect.  I've reset it, reset my Apple Extreme(router), deleted and reinstalled the Nest app, moved it to within 5 feet of my router, and tried the setup on the computer.  I've used the QR code, entered the key/serial manually, and direct connected to both PC and mac with the supplied usb cable....many times!  Still failed to connect.  It has the potential to be a great product, too bad, I couldn't even get pass the setup part.  Something is definitely flawed, either the camera itself, or the setup software/process.  It's going back to Amazon first thing in the morning.","It has the potential to be a great product, too bad"

The cameras work great - BUT THE NEST APP IS HORRIBLE!!!  CONSTANT CRASHES SINCE GOOGLE ACQUIRED NEST LABS. Just look at the reviews on the Apple App Store.  It is shameful what Google has done to a great brand - it is unbelievable.  You would think that a company with the all the resources of Google would add value instead of DESTROY value.

Ended up buying two of them.  They are super easy to set up.  I unboxed the camera, plugged it in, scanned the code on the back and within 30 seconds the camera was up and running!  The picture is clear and crisp.  It is easy to adjust for optimal view.  I was pleasantly surprised by the night vision capabilities of the camera.  I was able to see all the kitty shenanigans that happened all night long.  On a serious note though, it gave me reassurance if someone was in my house at night, it would pick that up!

This is our third. We use them as a baby monitor and we pay for the subscription service so we can watch back videos and save videos... like when the cameras caught my daughters first steps! I truly want these in every corner of my house. Also I love that it sends me notifications at night when it sees movement. This helps me know how restless my daughters sleep was.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2016,BobbyB,"As a baby monitor..... This works perfect!  Anyone that has an issue with this is a baby monitor is not seeing this product as it is and are most likely experiencing an separate,  albeit related issue, with a limitation they have, not one the product has.  First off, you do not need 1080P for a baby monitor, you just don't!  720p is more than sufficient and will help alleviate the problems I will touch on below.  It is a baby monitor, you are not recording HD video of your babies sleeping moments and/or your time away from them. Next, I have heard mention of people having issues seeing the camera due to the nest service or whatever reason so lets clear that up.  The service itself works fine; your internet service might not.  If you are the type of person that established your internet connection to casually surf the web then you are going to need to change your service.  My service provides up to 100 Mbps and it works just fine.  If you have a high speed internet connection you might need a faster WiFi router if you haven't gotten one in that past few years.  At the end of the day, if you have a dual band/N router with a high speed connection and you will be just fine. So now lets say you don't want the high speed connection and you are not willing to spring for the new router.  First off you are cheap, this is a $200 camera and upgrading other tech items in your life should not be a hurdle for you here.  But, if that is you and are having an issue with connection try changing the resolution of the camera to 720P.  Again it is a baby monitor and if you don't want to get more bandwidth you have to shrink the amount of data you are looking to use.  Once again, these are all issues that you might have, but are not caused by the camera itself. This is by far and away to easy to set up and use.  At the end of the day get one, try it out and if it doesn't work for you return it.  Pretty simple so stop beating around the bush and dive in.",Baby Monitor and Everything else!

Nest support and “customer service” is abominabley bad. Tried to subscribe to Nest Aware storage and nope.

It only takes about an hour on hold to get a useless lemming in the Nest call center. 2nd call on hold for 43min with another useless Nest lemming who only extended this hold time finally saying, “I’m going to transfer you to a “senior support anilyst.”  Upon being transfered to this “senior” lemming I was told that Nest is having some problems and that he’d look into the issue further and call me the next day with an update. It’s now been three days and I haven’t heard anything. Emailed Nest support to complain and was replied to with nothing more than an automated request for me to fill out a satisfaction survey.

I have this camera installed indoor but overlooking the whole front of the house. Someone tried to get into my car in my driveway and the camera captured the whole thing. The guy saw the camera and ran away. Showed the video clip to the police officer who came after I reported the incident. He was amazed at the quality of the capture. He said typically there was nothing they can do but since the clip that I showed him was really good, they would definitely use it to look for the guy in case there are other incidents with similar description of the perpetrator.

DeZearn,"This device is fantastic.  It did a great job of monitoring the house during our August vacation.  It is very sensitive to changes, sending notifications when the ambient light changes due to clouds passing by.  The nigh vision views are just as clear as during the day and the field of view is more than adequate for my needs.  The only downside is that the standard mounting is either on the wall or on a free-standing base.  This was fixed with neat product from another vendor that allows me to mount the camera directly to the wall socket.  One caveat to the set-up. make sure you have a computer handy in order to connect the NEST camera to the internet since the Bluetooth connection through my phone didn't work.",Very good product.

I have a much less expensive cam as well and the image quality of the Nest is considerably better. I use the cam to watch the front of my lake house as we do not live there. The cam is placed in an upstairs window overlooking the yard and driveway. Some things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. Data usage is high as it sends the video history ""upstream"" to the cloud, and can eat several MB per month. As the house is remote we have a limited data plan and after adding the cam, leaving it on, and uploading even at the lowest quality setting it still edged us close to 10MB for the month. Second issue is the camera sitting in a window and looking out through the glass is useless at night. The IR light for night viewing reflects too brightly against the glass and there is no image. Get the outdoor version if you are planning to use it for monitoring outside and not through a window. Camera is well built, heavy duty, and overall the best one I have used.","The video quality is excellent, setup is easy"

The aware cloud recording service is a bonus, but I don't use it for all of my cameras.  The fact that they interoperate with Nest thermostats and Wink software is a real plus, so you can use the motion detection to turn on lights, ring chimes,etc. and if your Nest smoke detector is triggered, it will tell the camera to begin recording. I have the Nest thermostats, smoke detectors, and cameras, and they work well together.  With their integration with Wink, and hence Amazon Echo, which I also have, I can simply tell Alexa to change the temperature.  You can even hook other thermostats into one account.

It was the inability to save the video locally that was a show stopper for me.  I did not want to subscribe to their service and considering the price of the camera, I think it should provide the option of saving video to a local server or storage device.  Saving video off site has great advantage for some situations but not all.  When off site storage is not required spending $100 to $300 every year feels like a waste to me.

Internet Connectivity:  I would give that 3 out of 5 stars.  We have battled lately over getting the camera to connect well.  Our internet connection at home is strong.  We have spoken to customer service many times, but they are unable to do anything for us except recommend router settings which didn't help. Setup: This is improved with this version of the camera and doesn't require a computer.  You can just connect with your phone and set it up through the app. Phone Application:  I would give this area negative stars if I could.  The notifications come in double (the same notification twice), the notifications don't come in the way we programmed them in settings, the app is very buggy and requires restart, and is slow in general overall.  We have also talked to customer service about these issues and we were promised they are working on them but they really haven't done anything about it. Customer Service:  Nest customer service is nice, but don't ever email them.  If you have a problem, they will write you back 4 days later (no exaggeration) and have you do things you already mentioned in your first email.  You can call them (which does require a 10 minute wait at least) and they are friendly and helpful, but don't usually have the answers. Performance: When the camera does work, I do like it.  It gives a clear picture, has good night vision, and has a good area of view. Overall, I wouldn't know what other camera to recommend, but if you are very particular in how your electronics work, then this camera is not for you.","Needs much improvement, but probably the best camera out there"

I do like that it differentiates between sounds and motion detected. The app only stores video for free for about a month, and afterward it's subscription based. But all in all it's a great little camera.",Great picture
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Aug 2015,Timothy,"I own 1 nest camera, 1 dropcam pro, and 2 nest protects. (1 version 1 and one version 2). I also have a separate monitored system through Alarm Force Video Relay that costs $30 per month for the service. I have had no problems from any of my Nest equipment. I have purchased each item individually and added them thinking I would start to see some of the problems that I have seen others complain about here but so far I have had no problems at all. I did have problems with the Nest app until I cleared the cache and ever since it has worked fine. In fact, it has quicker response to view live video than my Alarm force system. I don't use the audio on either system because I know from trying to use it on Alarm Force there is too much latency.  The only other issue I have had is my nest protect version 1 gave one false alarm for smoke over a 4 month period of usage and it sucks that you can't remotely silence a version 1 device.  I don't use the paid recording feature they offer only email notifications for motion and that has worked pretty well so far. Im giving 4 stars because I think the cameras are too expensive. I think they should be under $150 for sure and the nest software needs more features such as location based activation and deactivation like it had before Dropcam sold to nest. In addition the time and day scheduling needs to be simplified and I would like to see a snooze feature on the cameras in 1,2,4, and 8 hour increments that way if you are doing something that would trigger a camera you can snooze them and not worry about forgetting to turn them back on. Also as others have mentioned, the per camera storage fee for archiving video is too much. The whole reason I am buying Nest cameras is to get away from per month fees. I think there are several variables that could be the cause of the problems people are having to include wifi signal strength, wifi reliability, internet speed, and clearing the cache in the nest app.  I just ordered 2 more Nest Cams so I can go ahead with the switch over and replace my Video Relay cameras and stop paying $30/month for the service through Alarm Force.",Either a good product or I'm lucky

They then called Nest Customer service and got them to both remove the camera from my account and delete all of the video history. This basically means that Nest Aware (the $100 per year service that stores the video records) is pathetically useless if you are using it for security footage. I had a 16 digit, nonsensical password on my account as well as nonsensical security questions, and they got Nest to delete the video history is about an hour from the time I was alerted to the time I got to my office to see what happened to the Nest cam.",Thieves Stole Cam & Deleted Video History

She is a care giver and used the camera to be able to ""see"" her father-in-law when she has to be out for a few minutes.  This is what I'm using it for also.  I thought I was going to have to find someone to sit with my husband any time I needed to do an errand.  The Nest camera has given both my husband and I more independence.  With the app on the smart phone, I now know when my husband is trying to move around the room.  I can watch him, check in after a few minutes and/or see if he needs help.  The ability to use a microphone to talk to him is also invaluable.  This product has really met a need in our lives.","With the app on the smart phone, I now know when my husband is ..."

Extremely easy to set up and works great.  Good app on for iPhones, and easy to monitor cameras on iPad and Mac.  Cameras have good night vision, too.  Cameras monitor locations of two cell phones so multiple cameras only turn on when we are both gone, and turn off as soon as one of us comes home.  Alerts have been accurate and timely on our cell phones (saw our Labrador Retriever ""patrolling"" the house when we're not home.)  Gives us an opportunity to assess what's going on when we get a very occasional false alarm from our monitored built-in security system that we couldn't explain.  You do have to purchase the video monitoring after the 30 day free trial, but it seems pretty cost-effective over an entire year.",Seems to Work as Advertised

The video quality is a bit better on the Nest Cam, as it should be. When using the app, it seems like the Nest Cam buffers more than our other two when streaming, perhaps because of the better video quality. They're all connected to the same wifi and, weirdly, it's actually the second closest to the router, so that's certainly not the issue with the buffering. It's pretty much the same aesthetically, merely a slightly more tapered stem than the DropCam Pro. All in all, I'm pleased with the quality, taking into account being able to compare to the DropCam Pro. Had we not already owned any of the previous iterations, I would probably be even more pleased just because I would think the buffering is just part of using it.","On par with DropCam Pro, better video quality leads to increased buffering when streaming"

I am really happy with the Nest platform. I and my wife both use the Nest app which we have on our mobile phones. I really like the ability to turn on and off the cameras based on our phone locations. So when the last person leaves the house, the cameras are automatically turned on. And when we arrive home, the cameras are turned off. We use the cameras with the paid Nest Aware subscription. This allows us to easily go back in time to see what has been going on outside of our house. It also gives more intelligent alerts, it does not only alert you if a motion is detected, but also indicates if it detected a person. Buyers should be aware that the cameras are very demanding on upload bandwidth. So make sure you have good enough Internet connection and good wifi signal where you intend to place your camera.","Good quality camera, really happy with the Nest platform"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2016,Brent P.,"I researched home security camera systems for weeks before choosing Nestcam. I bought the 3 camera system. It takes about forty-five minutes  to an hour to have a fully operational home security. The price, while not cheap, provides excellent per-dollar value. I think that Nestcam is the probably the best and simplest home security camera system on the market. Set up is relatively easy. Just down load the Nestcam to your iPhone (or other cell phone), open a Nestcam account, and enter the camera serial number and entry key  #.  If you encounter problems or just need help, customer service is excellent (or at least it was the 2 times I called in setting up my  camera). They are knowledgable, friendly, patient, and speak clear concise English. Video image is very good. The magnetic mounting plate is easy to use. If Nestcam maintains this level of product quality, keeps installation and setup this simple, and continues to provide this level of customer service they will capture a major share of the market.",Nestcam is Best Home Security Camera System
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jun 2016,Aliza Hausman,"For almost a year, the camera worked for us without fail. We started using this in lieu of a baby monitor after many fails with the Motorola MBP36S Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor . We love being able to check in via our phones and on the web while at work, on-the-go and during dates. We signed up for the Nest Aware subscription service as well and we can watch video playback whenever we want and we can even make clips to show relatives our now toddler son's funny antics. As we previously wrote, we use an Apple iPod touch 16GB Blue (6th Generation) for an iPod but we kept having playback issues. It turned out that all the issues were having with that AND the Nest Cam were due to wifi dead zones in our home. We recently upgraded our router to the Google Wifi system (set of 3) - Router replacement for whole home coverage and our wifi is now at lightning speed above 100 mps. I do not get this camera unless you have very good, stable wifi. When we were just about to hit the year mark when we started to have problems with the camera going offline by itself without reason. When we tried to reset it, we'd get error C102 repeatedly which isn't mentioned on their website. It's incredibly frustrating as we depend on this camera and we paid a great deal for it (more than its now listed price). We called customer service and they were incredibly helpful. As it turns out, we needed a replacement wall power adapter and they sent a replacement out quickly. We haven't had any problems with the Nest Cam since even when our son pushed it off the corner of his crib where we used to keep it before he learned to stand up. We now keep the Nest Cam across the room with an eye on his crib and we've set up zone alerts to tell us when there's movement in the crib specifically. We also get alerts in the Nest app and to our emails when it sees ""someone"" in the room outside of the zone we created around the crib or when someone is heard in the room. The Nest app has improved since we first got this camera two years ago. When you log in now to the Nest app, you the video right away and you can press on it for sound and close-ups. Even though the Nest Cam doesn't pan or tilt like many baby monitors, it has captures a view of the entire room (see attached photos). The picture quality in daylight is incredible. It feels like I'm in the room with my son. As for the night vision, I think it's pretty good. The picture is clearer when I sign onto the web for night vision than on my iPhone. I've recently started using the microphone more now that my son is getting closer to age two. If he wakes up during the night and thinks it's morning, I gently tell him to go back to sleep because it's night time and he will turn right over and do that. I don't like that you can't hear what you're saying as you talk into the microphone. You hold down the microphone on the app to speak and you're heard on the other end. I know I've been heard because I instantly get an alert that someone was heard in the room. If I could afford it, I would put cameras up in all the rooms. And not for security. The Nest Cam has captured incredibly gorgeously rendered moments in my son's life. From the time we discovered he could (gulp) climb onto his dresser, to the time he learned to climb up onto his changing table and the play dates with his friend where they sit on the adult and toddler sized recliners in his room to read. This wasn't offered when I first bought mine but it's very handy if you're looking to have more cameras at a discounted price: Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera 3 Pack . I have been so impressed with this product that I have since purchased a Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera because we had such a great time using the regular indoor Nest Cam as a security camera when we were away from home. The microphone sensitivity can be adjusted and we put it on high while we were on vacation and placed it in our dining room by the window. It let us know when it heard and/or saw both the mailman and handyman and we were able to communicate to the latter that we weren't home. We also plan to invest in the Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa .",Worked great for almost a year before going bananas
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Feb 2016,M. Wong,"Unfortunately, the Nest Cam is possibly killing our Internet access and the only suspect is a drop in upstream speed after switching to a different Internet Service Provider. After dropping from 2.0Mbps to 1.5Mbps, we apparently no longer have sufficient upstream speeds to support even a 360p video despite what is documented by Nest [...]. If upstream is truly the culprit, the Nest Cam is not a usable product for everyone unless you have 2.0Mbps or better upstream speeds. Unless we spend the time testing different networks and Nest Cams, all we have is what Nest and our ISP can assess for us so there could be a chance that we could have a bad camera. Maybe someone else with low upstream speeds will chime in. Interestingly too, we don't seem to have a upstream problem with three online gamers using three different Skype connections while two parents are surfing the Internet. On a positive note, for a quick ""plug-n-play"" camera, it is a good product for monitoring like to keep an eye on your porch for disappearing packages. The Wi-Fi issues that we had before seems to be related with hidden networks created by AT&T router+modem (aka Residential Gateway). We solve the problem by using a spare Wi-Fi router that we bridged to the AT&T router. [UPDATE - NOV 30, 2016] Nest Cam is working once more (sorta)!! Figured out that the gateway provided by my service provider had a unstable DNS service so I thought I give the Nest Cam one more go. Bumped up the review to three stars from two specifically because of Sightline history when you don't opt for Nest Aware. However, the few snaps that are saved might not provide a sufficient recording history for some. What is preventing a 4 star review is the quality for the $200 price that I paid. What was thought to be a Wi-Fi problem for me since Day 1 turned out the be a power issue. The power is cutting out when the power cord is shifted especially the bumping of wandering cats. In fact, it takes a bit of wiggling just to get the power on now. Hopefully its the cord which can be easily replaced and not a bad port.",You may need to be upstream wealthy to use this camera

Biggest problems are: 1) Camera has disappeared from my apps which necessitates reinstalling the camera from scratch.  Unfortunately, when you go through Nest's recommended process you are notified that your camera is already associated with an account (most likely from the first time you set it up) and that you must plug it into your computer to attempt a burdensome debug process.  A quick google search for 'Nestcam disappears' returns ample links showing that Nest has known about this issue for some time and has done absolutely nothing to resolve it.  I've now been waiting for a Nest customer service representative to pick up the phone for over 20 minutes with no help in sight. 2) Occasional lag in picking up the camera feed initially.  Basically, you cannot count on this camera to be available when you need it which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a security camera (or in my case, baby monitor) in the first place. These issues are completely UNACCEPTABLE for a camera at this price point and not what I expect from a Google subsidiary!  Anybody looking for camera/security products should seriously consider competitors like Canary, Get Piper, SimpliSafe, Samsung and others.

We have to dropcams at our house; a Dropcam HD and a Dropcam Pro. They have been fantastic! We have used them religiously with the Dropcam app for over a year to watch our two boys. When the Nest Cam came out, I thought it would be a good idea to put in the playroom. I had nothing but problems with it from the first moment I started it up. To put it simply, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because when it worked, the video looked great. However, it rarely ever worked for me. I tried the Nest app on a Nexus 7, a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, an iPad Mini 2, a Samsung Galaxy S3, as well as through the website. I was determined to get this to work somewhere. I reset it numerous times and it's still just had problems. The nail in the coffin was when this camera was on the network, the Drop Cams started having issues. When I finally removed the Nest Cam from the network completely, everything returned back to normal and the videos from the Drop Cams worked great.

At 720 the lag is about 20 seconds. Only 3 alerts were sent to my iPhone over several hours of incidents The alert problem resulted in the 4 star review.  We tried everything from Notifications settings to reinstalling.  The weird thing is that both the laptop app and the iPhone app were recording the ""alert"" incident, just no audible alarm.

At a certain price point, it would be cheaper to go with ADT. *****update of review  the Nest aware program only really follows one person/cellphone.

You simply plug in the camera and download the app. In the Play Store search ""nest"" and then enter your email and a password then download and accept all the agreement stuff and you are ready to view. The camera shot is very clear and it picked up my voice from two rooms away. If you have a pet like we do and want to check up on him when you are away this is the way to do it. You can view history so you don't have to be watching the very moment someone or something is happening; you can review it later.

The night vision is also noticeably better. Device is easy to mount and setup was very easy. We have had two issues with the camera. First, the USB power adapter died a slow death shortly after we received the camera. Second, the location we placed this camera had a weak Wi-Fi signal from our Apple Time Capsule. I purchased an additional Apple AirPort Express Wi-Fi device to extend the wireless network, which worked seamlessly with all devices except the Nest Cam. For some reason it was not intelligent enough to automatically associate with the new device that was providing better signal strength.

Nest Aware is a buy up service that Nest offers that gives you better alerts on your phone of activity, plays back video clips, and stores it in their cloud services for 30 days.  Without it, the camera just snags 1 still image, which usually doesn't show what's going on in the frame hardly at all. For example, it took a picture of someone running away from my front door (turns out it was a delivery guy trying to stay out of the rain).  If it was suspicious activity however, it wouldn't have given me a view of the person's face.  So not helpful.  I also have no idea if I'd be able to ""download"" that image to provide it to the police (assuming there was a crime involved) For this price, to have to pay an additional $10/month for this thing to actually be useful is a crime.  The minimum Nest should be offering here without Nest Aware is playing back clips/images, with high resolution downloads, and storage for 1-3 days. Your money can be better spent elsewhere",Waste of money without Nest Aware

The cameras are good, would rate them a 4.  But in order to use the cameras, you need the Nest App on your phone and/or access to the internet to get to the Nest.com website.  I would rate the Nest service a 2 star. The Nest service is often down which is very frustrating given that I use the cameras for home security.  My internet speed is also 400 mbps download and 20 upload, so my bandwidth is not a problem.  I also have a couple RING cameras.  The RING cameras are similar when it comes to resolution, but the service is soooo much more reliable and much cheaper. The downside of the RING cameras is that it only records when something or someone is detected.  The Nest service records for days at a time depending on your plan...but really terrible that the Nest service is so unreliable. Nest worked great prior to Google buying them out.

If you close the App or move to other tasks (email, web, etc.), then it closes the connection to the camera. The video has to be playing the whole time for monitoring. Plus the connection is unstable. Tried different positions for 2 different iPhones running the App and both would lose connection to the camera multiple times overnight (3-8 times in 7hr timeframe).

I use it to monitor my dog while I'm at work to make sure he is behaving and not disrupting the neighbors by barking or whining loudly.  The camera is a little odd shaped so it does stand out when mounted or placed on a shelf or table, but it is small so slightly better than displaying a big, bulky camera.  I did notice that after my free trial subscription expired I began receiving fewer notifications of sound and motion, which is disappointing.  For my use I would prefer the sound sensors to be more sensitive, often I will access the app when leaving my neighborhood and find my dog barking but I did not receive a notification.  Also I found that when using the mobile app at work I have to first disable Wifi connections in order to see the video. This is not an issue when logging on through a computer.  I highly recommend the nest cam if you have children or pets that you want to keep an eye on while you are away.

There should be an option for a longer wire. I should have simply bought all outdoor camera's. - The app delay points to the notifications for person's or motion being recorded. Notifications came nearly immediate when home but, most reasons for this function are for when you are not home and that delay, for us, was around 10-12 minutes which made the talking function obsolete.

I really liked the concept that my wife and I could use my Android phone, or her iPhone and iPad as monitors to check on our baby with the Nest Cam.  When we were able to get an image on our phones and iPad the image quality was amazing, definitely HD quality and probably far superior to any other Baby Monitors out there.  However the connectivity frequently dropped, and the Nest Inferface was super glitchy on all our devices.  We couldn't reliably check in on our baby at all times with this device, as our devices would time out and we would have to frequently log back in.  We live in a modest size home where connectivity isn't a problem, we have the newest Android phones and iPhones and great internet connectivity in our house with Download speeds of >150 Mbps and upload speeds greater than 12 Mbps. I am returning mine as the Nest interface and connectivity makes the product practically unusable.  I'll give it 2 Stars because it's a light non-bulky piece of equipment, and the image quality is really impressive, when it works.  But essentially functions as image and video capturing device, and not a continuous monitor.

It worked great for about a month, and then I started receiving messages, several times a day, that the camera had been offline for 10 minutes or more. I contacted Nest Support and asked for an exchange. To my surprise, I was told that disconnection of the camera several times a day is ""expected and normal product behavior."" They said that since the camera eventually re-pairs, it isn't considered defective and Nest won't replace it. The End. This is unbelievably bad customer support.  I have 40 other devices connected to my WiFi LAN - including several other Nest products, and several other webcams - none of them exhibits this behavior. And the camera is about 20 feet away from the main WiFi AP - literally one room over - not far away or on the other side of the house. Every other device in that same room has a perfectly strong signal. I can't believe Nest would treat its customers this way. As it happens, I have three Nest Protects arriving today... which I'm now canceling and shipping right back to Amazon.","Camera disconnecting from local network several times a day is ""expected and normal product behavior"""

There are some things that can defiantly be worked on to make them better. One would be catching motion in the dark. On one of the cams, I can literally jump around in front of it and it will not pick up the motion. I love how it interfaces with my Wink hub to make some sweet home automation going on. I plan on buying more. Update after a month into it. I still love the cams and wonder why the poor reviews. I use it for a baby cam and it works well. I have it connected to my wink hub and get alerts every time she moves been if it's 1 min apart. I also love the fact I can make clips from the stored feed so I will compress the past night into a 2 min clip (program is with nest protect).  Makes for great memories!

If you receive a text or any alert on your phone, which is also where you're accessing the video form the camera, it kicks you out of the camera view, so you have to click into the view again to be seeing & hearing- that work okay during the daytime for naps etc, because you're already up and can check when you want. But at night, I'm relying on the ""baby monitor"" to alert me if my child wakes up and cries, which, if it has kicked me out of view, doesn't happen.

However since the switch from Dropcam all the cameras have much more lag. Before there was about a 2 second delay now that Nest runs things there is a 4 second delay. The audio intercom is so delayed that it's functionally useless. I have a 175/25 connection, 11ms ping and excellent WiFi performance. It's not me. They still haven't released the promised software update to existing Dropcam Pro's to return their advertised capability to stream 1080P. It is my understanding that the new Nest cams are the same on the inside as the Dropcam Pro's they just say Nest and have the much improved stand. pros Very attractive sleek design. Heavy enough to feel solid. Excellent stand with screw tripod capability and magnetic base. Great night vision however I would recommend an IR light source for larger rooms. Subscription video storage available is very simple. Cloud video can't be stolen and is time coded. This could be very useful. cons Alerts don't come, or come after 30 minutes offline making them a poor choice for security. makes a clicking sound that you can hear on the stream at night. 4 sec delay on stream when it used to be 2 Hosting ?

Baby monitor was jamming my WiFi signal badly. Having a newborn w/o good WiFi is agony. I thought that this ip camera would be useful in the long run beyond being a just baby monitor. You always need to keep an eye on kids. I'm also a tech junky :) Good: - Video quality is good most of the time given that it's most likely using cell phone-sized sensor. Knowing few things about camera sensor sensitivity I think it's doing a decent job with IR elimination as well. - Being able to use my own tripod (especially flexible one that you can wrap around anything) was a very welcome feature. - Motion detection areas is a very welcome feature Not so good: - Camera is very warm all the time regardless of whether it's ON or OFF (you can turn it off in the Nest app of through web interface). Video sensor is tiny and should not generate that much heat in the first place. Why the camera remains very warm when it's supposed to be off is beyond me. Yes, it has to maintain WiFi connection even when it's off; however, my cell phone never gets that warm when idle and constantly connected to WiFi. I hope this can be fixed or improved with firmware. - Nest App and web interface need a lot of improvements. For ex. turning on/off motion or sound detection shouldn't be buried in the last position of settings menu. Also, I'm expecting for the video to be of the highest possible quality when I zoom in without needing to press another button. - A simple feature of monitoring background sound through mobile app would make it true baby monitor. This feature remained among the top requested ones for more than 2 years on Dropcam feature request page. It's sad to see that it has fallen on a deaf ear. - The biggest drawback is the lack of ability to stream video over the local network. Because of that, user interface is sluggish and video is delayed (by about 4-5 sec on my FIOS 5up/30down connection). - One other gripe I have is the Micro USB socket located directly under the back side of the camera. This way the stand (or tripod base) is directly in the way of the socket. I had to bent the cable hard in order to make it fit into the socket and go around the base - not convenient and a potential to damage the socket.","Good potential, currently needs lots of improvements."

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Oct 2015,EP,"Really like the camera, provides a good picture and pretty nice features.  Better for general security than for a monitor (e.g., baby monitor).  The alert from the app isn't great for overnight baby-monitoring - the notification is quick and doesn't wake you up, and when the phone locks/sleeps, it take some time to get the image back on the screen (both iPhone and Andriod).  The up-side is that no data storage is needed if you're using it as a monitor.  Also, since it's priced around what the fancy baby monitors are priced at, it's really nice that it will have a life after baby monitoring. Also, since it's dependent on the internet, the provider reliability and speed can obviously make a big difference in how easily the camera works for you.  Not Nest's fault, of course, but something to consider.",Great camera

I really liked the fact that i could get alerts based on my location so that I only got alerts when I was not home - They completely removed the geolocation features. I have a nest Thermostat and thought maybe i could set the cam to only alert me when the thermostat is set to away but - nope. you only have the option to set it to record/not record based on location.

Nest's acquisition of DropCam has caused many problems with transferring accounts and subscriptions. The irony is that most of my problems have occurred while I am away from home for extended vacations and the remedies suggested by support staff involves being at home in order to re-install the camera and reconnect to wifi. It's an oxymoron instrinsic in home monitoring systems: when they fail to work when you are away (which is when you rely on them), you can't be there to fix them (reset or reinstall) until you have returned home again (which is when you stop needing them).

Now with these cameras I can see where I last had the item I misplaced. I can view my home when I get alerts on my phone from Nest Aware and communicate to people in the room. For example:  My son forgot his phone at a friends house and I needed him to be ready to leave when I got home. So I contacted him over the camera to let him know.  There are so many other possibilities with these camera shots than just putting them up for home security. I love the functionality of them.  I couldn’t be more happier with this product. The only con is when you get an alert that someone is spotted in the kitchen or the area where the nest Cam is... it takes about 10 seconds for the app to load to show you the movement.,I almost went with Arlo but these had better reviews!

With dropcam you can set a geo fence that turns the drop cam off when you are in the fence (home) and turns it on when you out of that fence (away)  Nestcam is connected to the Nest Thermostat where it works off of away / home - in practice that's not useful especially since I only use my Nest stat for A/C and I sometime what it recording when I am away but my house is not. Also since it moved over to google it constantly buffers when viewing over the web or app.  It's not usable for realtime monitoring because of the constant buffering.

Forget the fact that it does work 60 to 80% of the time and I know other people that it seems to work for.  Asked if there could be any issue with the camera...nope not a possibility according to the tech.

We bought the camera since we also have the nest thermostat and wanted to keep everything on the same ecosystem.  In hindsight, we should have looked elsewhere.  Here are my two biggest complaints: 1.  With no built in storage, the camera is essentially worthless unless you also subscribe to the nest aware plan.  I'm sure there is value there for some, but it's more than I want to commit just to spy on my dog.  If I were buying again, I'd look for something with enough built in storage to cover 24 hours. 2.  The app (and tech support) has been terrible.  Specifically, the home/away assist.  We set the camera up to turn on when we leave and turn off when we get home, but it doesn't register when we leave so I end up having to turn it on manually.  I've spent hours on chat support with nest and all they do is walk you through the settings and make you keep sending screen shots of every step.

Original drop cam and current generation.  They were great up until about 3-4 months ago when their service bandwidth started to degrade.  I’m guessing they can’t keep up with demand.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Aug 2016,Rick S,"I have several Nest cameras.  Generally speaking, the hardware design is decent - fairly easy to setup, though a minor quibble is the version I have support on 2.4 ghz.  In a fairly dense area (with considerable activity on 2.4 ghz band) this can be an issue.  I had one camera that was DOA out of the box, and I returned.  The hardware isn't as fully featured as even the most basic of my fleet of Axis web cameras, but for quick surveillance apps, you won't go wrong with the Nest. The software, in my experience, falls well short of the potential of the camera hardware.  Motion detection is quite poor - it is overly sensitive and generates many false triggering events.  In particular, it is quite sensitive in outdoor applications to diurnal changes in sunlight, or even passing clouds.  It pretty clearly needs a more advanced algorithm than what the camera seems to implement.  Several ideas come to mind, but I didn't design this thing, so I'll leave it to nest to figure this out. One particular sore point in the software is the applications software.  This is borderline amateurish, to say the least.  I use multiple computing platforms, from Ubuntu Linux, Apple OSX, iPad (iOS), various Android devices.  The software works differently on each platform, and each has its host of bugs and nuances.  To my eye, seems to be the work of teams that loosely coordinate with one another, versus borne of a single UI and user experience design (sure, OS differences force some of this, but try navigating history or setting motion zones and note how each platform implements this). The history service is fairly expensive, IMO - $100 per camera per year (edit: per Nest support, this is for first camera, second camera is 50% off).  If you have multiple IP cameras monitoring a property (typically, I have 5-6 cameras in each of our houses), this pricing schedule is clearly the ""razor blades"" to their razor (reference to Gilette biz plan) in their method of extracting money.  If you have just one camera, fine, but with multiple cameras, this is not your solution.  A local DVR would pay for itself inside of a year. If you do mount the camera outdoors (say for monitoring an entryway), you'll have to resort to a third party housing ($$) and solve the limitations of the USB powering method they use.  Any decent IP camera will offer IEEE PoE, which solves connectivity and power in one cable bundle. Also, be aware of the bandwidth used by the camera system - during daylight hours, for moderate complexity outdoor environment, the camera is raising my upstream utilization by a constant ~300 kbit/sec. I give this three stars for any user looking for a fast/quick single camera solution, indoors.  Three stars because the software solution is poor, and the cost of 10 day retention is very high (eg consider what Dropbox costs for similar storage requirement).  If you need more than one camera or want to use an outdoor camera, look elsewhere.","Barely ""okay"", for single camera use"

I am fortunate enough to own and operate various manufacturers cams and their interfaces.(desktop, mobile phone etc...) I am currently using Ezviz, Amcrest, Sunba and Abode cameras. Also for comparison, I have an el cheapo depstech endoscope cam for cell phone, a teslong endoscope cam and lastly a Upair One drone with a camera. Well, let me tell ya, these indoor nest cams are, to my surprise, absolutely the worst cams I've used. I don't know if the following is applicable but so ya know, I am currently using 20 Mbps up and down internet, I7-7700 intel at 3.6 Ghz with the dual drives, solid state and hd. The nest cams: video quality is the worst I've seen and so is their web interface. It has the worst lag rendering the ""Talk"" feature useless. One click on the"" zoom in button"" and then the click to focus feature and it looks like the picture you'd see from a 2000 model year $99 camcorder at full """"digital"""" zoom being held by a person in a rocking chair. They take forever to pair, the ""listen"" feature is intermittent at best, I could go on and on..... I even disabled all other devices that could possibly be interfering, made no difference..... Then I thought, ya know what, I'll just hook up everything I have, run them all and see what happens. Well, ""ALL"" other devices perform as they should but still the same terrible quality on the nests. I even have a far better picture coming from the $300 drone I for-mentioned when it's literally 3/4 of a mile away. ?? NO, they were not used, damaged or otherwise. They are brand new and in factory packaging. I even tried running them on the 5  Ghz instead of 2.4 , no difference..... I have absolutely ""no"" problems at all with my other equipment. Even the cheapy endoscope produces a better picture on my old, worn out cell phone. (that's no joke). I also have absolutely no idea how these cams got their current rating.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2015,James Unterreiner,"Avoid Nest Cam.  I purchased 12 cameras, some for home and some for business, when they were Dropcam and things worked great which I expect is where the good ratings have come from.  However Dropcam was purchased by Nest and things have gone downhill quickly.  Here are the issues: They have rewritten the applications (iPad, iPhone and web) removing some key features which were the reasons I bought the cameras in the first place.  There was no notification, just one day things stopped working.  Unfortunately support is unhelpful just saying the feature has been eliminated and there is no way to escalate or address the fact that I need the feature for the cameras to work for me.  So I now have 12 cameras that really do not meet my needs.  So keep in mind if you buy this for any of the software features they can be eliminated with no notice and there is nothing you can do about it.  Suggest only buying this if you believe the camera alone is worth the $200 asking price. Many of the changes they are making are to integrate the cameras with the Nest thermostats.  Unfortunately, although popular, Nest thermostats do not work very well.  I looked into them for my vacation home and they have issues with power outages and turning heat on full blast, etc. that made them a non-starter.  I went with Ecobee which has proven to be an excellent thermostat but unfortunately Dropcam is doing nothing to integrate with Ecobee so the features they are providing are worthless to me.  Just causing me a hassle to learn new applications and with disappearing features I mentioned above. One of my cameras stopped working while under warranty.  They replaced it quickly which is good, however they replaced it with a refurbished camera which does not feel right.  Tells me they value saving a little money over their customers, Nest could easy send new replacement cameras and sell the refurbished ones as refurbished for a slight discount. Overall I feel this company no longer values its customers and there are better cameras for $200.  What made Dropcam appealing to me is the now removed software features and now missing customer service that really engaged to provide solutions for me.  Disappointing, I thought Dropcam had an excellent future.  This space is now wide open for a new competitor if anyone reading this is in the camera/software business.",Avoid Nest Cam!!!!

The cameras have great picture quality and the night view is clear as well.  Yes you do have to pay to save the data, but I preferred this option over t tint to select a system that records that I could install myself.  And as far as it not being a good security camera, Don't worry about that.  I get alerts about every ten minutes for movement.  And you can really zoom and adjust these cameras to avoid alerts such as your dog.  I may not be able to call 911 immediately but that is what a standard security alarm is for.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Apr 2016,Miranda Jae,"We have 2 of these. The idea for this is great. Really, it is. I love the fact that we can watch our home when we are gone on vacation or even out for the night.  When we leave for vacation we move the cameras to our living room and entryway. However, the main reason we got these was to use them in our kids' rooms as nursery cameras. One huge drawback - there's no setting to change the alert tone when you receive alerts on your phone through the app. It is SO FRUSTRATING! They market these things as nursery cameras but the alert tone you get when your baby is crying or moving around is the same ding you get for emails, texts, and other alerts you're already desensitized to when you're sleeping at night. You CAN go through your phone and change every single app's alert tone so Nest is the only one using your phones default tone (if all of your apps allow this option, which some don't). But what a pain!! Not to mention it still doesn't solve the fact that it's still a tone you're already used to. Not an alarm-type tone that would actually wake you up if there's something going on in the room the camera is in. If you change your phones default tone to an alarm-type tone, then you risk having that go off if you have other apps that don't allow tone changes (or if you get a new app and forget to change the tone from default). Also, there seems to be a big lag between the camera and real life sometimes. I understand that there's always going to be a little lag. But sometimes the lag is seconds or even more. As in, our 2 year old daughter has already gotten up, scooted out of her bed, out of the door and in our bedroom before we even get an alert.  And sometimes, it doesn't alert us at all. One night she couldn't get her door open and sat there screaming. I was actually up but in another area of the house. I never got an alert of movement or noise (and yes, both settings were ON). When I looked back at the history (that you have to pay for monthly, by the way) she had been screaming there for almost 5 minutes straight!  I've talked with our internet provider and even purchased a brand new, really nice upgraded wireless router. It's not an issue on our end. Every time I contact Nest about these issues (especially the custom tone alert issue), they basically say ""Oh, sorry to hear that, give us a call."" When I call they say ""Oh, sorry about that. We're thinking about doing these things and take your guys' suggestions seriously."" Right....",Good in theory but sometimes a huge PITA!

I bought the Dropcam to replace my D-Link a few months ago and I have been loving it. I use this camera strictly for the purpose of spying on my cat when I'm not home for a couple of days to make sure she's alright.

Paired with an iPad as the viewing medium this camera has lived up to the quality I have expected from Nest products. We also have the thermostats in our house and the integration for us was smooth. Setup was simple, scan the bar code in the back and it will prompt for wifi configuration. The quality of video is excellent, with 360, 720, and 1080p available. I tend to keep at 720p and the picture is clear and the delay is slight. I find on average the delay is around 1 second. This likely is dependent on wifi router and or you connection speed for watching when not home. I have 75/75 Mbps speeds. The wide angle lens leaves no need to have ability to pan camera, zoom is adequate for the need as a baby camera. Ability to talk through camera is nice, however it is limited. You can only talk one at s time. This is understandable as it might be hard for hardware to both play audio and receive without crossover or feedback. Camera had nice light at top to indicate status, blinks if someone is watching. Not a big selling point but a nice small feature. The ability to watch back video is awesome. However not really worth the price for us at $100/year. As a baby cam I don't feel like this is really needed. Pethaps if they added a cheaper option that allows for 1 day 24 hour increments, I'd consider for the right price. Currently they have only 10 and 30 day options. As a baby monitor I really only care about the current day's feed. Overall a 4 out of 5. Great quality product, do far no network issues internal or external. Just my one issue is the playback service does not offer a plan that meets my needs.",Great for Baby Camera.

This is not a camera that will use your local storage to save video, and requires the subscription service to save history from the camera.  If you understand that, this product does an outstanding job!  I purchased 2 Nest Cams to monitor my home to 1) security monitoring of my office and equipment, and 2) monitor pets. The app allows me to receive alerts with noise and motion in configured regions of the view.  I have not had any issues with these features and regularly receive updates on my iPhone.  Since I use all of the Nest products, I love how I can integrate with the Nest Aware feature to enable and disable the cameras.  To take it a step further, I use the Automatic Driving Assistant, and use that to trigger the Away status on my Nest to enable the cameras.  I have found this very reliable, and there are other ways to use integrations (e.g. IFTTT) to enable and disable the cameras in addition to the app.  My only ask would be to add the IFTTT integration directly with the cameras at some point. The video streaming has been very consistent and reliable.  I am using it on a home network with Time Warner Cable RoadRunner 30 MB connection and an Apple Airport Extreme.  There have been no issues with losing the stream or dropped connections with the camera.  My phone is an iPhone 6 Plus on the Verizon LTE network.  As long as I have a good signal, viewing the cameras has not been an issue, and does not seem to use a lot of my data. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and find the product worth the money.  Nest continues to create innovative and smartly interconnected services to enable the smart home.  I find the quality exceptional and the features impressive.",Outstanding Product!

If you add a camera your new camera won't appear in the dropcam app or web login :-( Features that no longer work with the nest app are: - The nest app gave a nice preview of the room, the nest app...

Great for a kids room. Cons: unless the object is within 5 feet, expect blurry images, especially in low light or even night mode. No tap to focus, digital zoom is poor, might as well set it for max view and zoom in during playback. 3 megapixel camera doesn't cut it, cell phones have better cameras nowadays and even ones from a few years back can stream and record for free with at least 8 megapixels.

However, the Nest products are well-built and perform well. I have 4 of these and am able to cover all entries into my house with strategic placement. You don't need an installer if you have basic skills, but to make the power cord hidden you will have to be creative.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2015,CT Music,"I have 3 nest thermostats and finally jumped in and paid the premium price (higher than every competitor) for the Nest Cam.  I don't like my current security service and I thought this would be a gateway to an exit to that service which does not have remote surveillance.  And I must admit - set up is very easy.  Less than 5 minutes.  But in almost every other way, this thing has been a waste of time, and if I signed up for the subscription service it would be a waste of money too. Here's why you should not purchase this product. Aesthetics:  Yes, it looks pretty cool, all space grey etc.  But it's still a highly visible camera that is attached by a long USB wire.  You can't hide it.  You can't really put it anywhere without looking paranoid or geeky or both.  I put it in our kitchen but how warm is a kitchen going to feel with a long wire from the socket rising to the top of cabinets with a giant eye looking down on the room.  It's ugly for a home.  No way to avoid it.  I can see certain applications like for the elderly where it doesn't matter, but for a family this think looks weird in a family room or kitchen - and it's not made for outdoor use. Tech:  I have been on the phone with Nest tech for more hours than I have actually used the device.  When I initially installed it, my Nest thermostats started disconnecting randomly and I spent hours on the phone resetting every nest thermostat until finally it stablilized.  Then my Nest cam would work on my laptop but not in the app.  No video.  I could literally watch the video from the camera on my laptop while my iphone app would see nothing.  The details actually don't matter much but I have the newest apple router and a turbo version ISP connection and all of these Nest devices just don't play nice with each other or the network.  I don't know why and neither does Nest.  All I know is that they were easy to install but unreliable to use.  Tech support super nice and USA based but be prepared for LONG waits.  If you call in eve prepare for 30 minute waits and 30 minute calls.  Bottom line is that these tools are supposed to make life easier not harder.  Can't say that about this device - and it's the most expensive one in the category.  Also, the Nest web site is filled with useful information (at least that's what the recording when you are on hold for 30 minutes will tell you) but the reality is that the ""useful information"" is so basic that it's pretty useless. Subscription:  Yes, that's how they really make the money here is charging a monthly fee to archive your video for you.  You may need this for a variety of reasons and Nest gives you no other storage alternative (such as a simple SD card which would cost less than $10 one time).  In the end the Nest cam costs $189 to buy, $120/year to use correctly with the storage option and for me, hours on the phone with tech to get it working. I know the signature line for Nest products is their design and simplicity but while I was an early early adopter of the Nest therms and now have 3, after living with them for 3 years and the cam for a week -- it's not worth it.  These devices all rely on network connectivity and remote servers and mobile apps and that's a lot of tech to work correctly at the same time and even more tech for someone to troubleshoot when there's a problem.  I feel like a beta tester and I have over $1000 invested in Nest products.  Do not buy unless you are up for constant tinkering and calls to tech support.",Owner of 3 Nest Thermostats but Can't Recommend the Camera or Nest any longer

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 May 2016,Alan R,"Phenomenal camera. With the ability to pivot on two axis and 360 degree rotation of the view, alongside an in-app 180 degree flip, plus a heavy-bottomed base that is capable of mounting in just about any position, makes the camera amazingly versatile. While the price tag for a rather simplistic motion detection IP camera may seem unreasonable, there are a few things to consider. The setup is one of the least painful processes for an IP camera I have ever seen (as expected with any Alphabet/Google product, which I currently own half a dozen of). Having owned a D-Link cloud cam, I expected an hour's worth of setup. I literally did nothing but scan a QR code and type my WiFi password in, then follow the simple wizard which can be entirely avoided. There are not many advanced features, however, so users seeking to go beyond the camera's base functions will find no luck without custom firmware. Alongside with having a beautiful design and fantastic app design, the accurate motion detection system, talk-back feature, and zoom enhance features round out the camera. Night vision is fantastic too, and the switch-over is quite subtle. My only gripe is that the automatic home-switch assistant frequently fails to switch the camera when I get home, and sometimes when I leave. I attribute this to a phone issue and a battery-saving function, thus any user's experience will vary. My Project Fi Nexus 6P is NOT conservative in GPS at the least, which unnerves me because the app should be able to retrieve location painlessly. Yet, I do know from experiences with other apps that the GPS does not like sharing unless asked specifically, even if the Google Maps Timeline and High Accuracy Location is always on. Overall, great camera, highly recommended.",Fantastic

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Jul 2016,ANZicCO,"I had originally rated this cam highly but after several months of use with 2 cameras, experience has altered my view. There are several cameras on the market that do a better job with features as automatic zoom and SD Card recording.  Nest Cam has neither of these.  In fact, the basic NestCam gives you only about 3 previous hours of sporadic still images and scrolling through video is choppy and impossible to find a particular event easily.  That's because  nest is all about feeding the Google Piggy Bank and subscribing to its recording services for $10/month for one camera and additional $5 month for additional.  Even when paying for the Nest Aware service, the user interface is like scrolling through an old video tape recorder.  The notification system is just totally flawed and often fails to even notify you that ""it thinks it saw a person"" when there is a person but often will trigger false alarms. The cameras also get very HOT to the touch when using HD mode, and Nests solution is turn off HD mode.  The Night Vision feature has many flaws and if there is any kind of glare from a glass shelving unit or window, you will end up only with video of the camera's own glow. Manual Zoom must be done only from the software and it only focuses on a select area which it stays at until you manually go back and zoom back out. Also the NEST AWARE service is very expensive and there are constant billing errors that you will spend many many hours to try and get resolved and then they will pass you to a senior agent who is your last point of contact and then he or she will disappear without resolving your issue! Until or unless Google gives a less expensive way to save more recordings, Nest Cam is not recommended.",MEDIOCRE cam and features- HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT!

There is no external memory so if you want to go back and look at footage you need to subscribe to the manufacturer's service. I had no need for these features so these were not deal breakers for me.

Willing to be optimistic, I gave then a fair shake.  The software was not all that good and seemed to have many bugs.  I agree with many the subscription was and is hard to swallow but hear me out.  I have expanded my ""nest"" to a system, I have 3 cameras, a thermostat and 3 smoke/carbon dioxide detectors.  The whole system was not cheap but well worth it.  I get one touch access to my whole house when home or away.  Quick reasons it made me happy... When I leave the house my thermostat changes to save me money and my cams become active.  When I come home again, thermostat changes and cameras go off.  If there is a fire, my detectors tell my a/c-furnace to shut down and will send emergency message out to me and another contact I supplied the system.  My mom/dad have access to the house, I get a message when some enters the house and I can watch live or go back to see what was going on.  One night I heard a loud noise in the basement, I picked up my phone, turned on camera system and put my self and wife at ease to find no one in the house but a picture had fallen from the wall.  What great feeling of safety knowing that I was not walking into a bad situation.  I have much better feeling when home or away.  I have built my system little by little due to cost, some were off set due to a drop in home owner insurance.  The only cons I really have is #1 is cost of units, 2nd is wi-fi range (good not great) and 3rd is subscription cost. Other cool features: camera can zoom, HD or standard def., motion and or sound activated, good solid stand/mounts, easy to set up using code on back of camera (just follow instruction in app).

We do not have high-speed internet.  Setup was very simple.  Plug it in, put the app on my phone, scan the bar code, and done.  I did have to lower the video quality due to our internet speed, but still the picture is quite clear and there is only a lag of a few seconds.  Once in a while there is a break in the video when the internet has to catch up, but not for long.  If I were using it for home security I'd want to pay for the service to get more frequent movement notifications, and history.  But I am only watching my pets on live camera, so it's free.  It's comforting to know I can check on them while I am at work.","Great camera, simple to setup and use"

So far I absolutely love it! The quality is excellent and I love watching my baby girl while I am at work. Granted this is not meant to be used as a baby monitor and needs a dedicated device (we just use an old iphone) where you can keep streaming if you want to hear baby in real time  - I still think its worth it.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jul 2016,Parmenides,"As far as hardware goes, this camera is fine, but having bought one several months ago, I have three big gripes with it (from software/user experience issues) that make it unusable and would be easy to fix if nest actually wanted to (it's clear they don't). 1) You must be online to use this camera. The video all goes through nest.com, which means that if your internet is out, you cannot see the feed, regardless of whether your power is on, your wifi network is functioning, etc.  Big negative points here.  The only reason for this problem to exist is that nest wants all your video to go through their site, the least crappy reason for this is that they want to sell you a subscription to their video monitoring service, something that you should be able to do for free on your own computer. 2) Let's assume that having to use their website to watch your vid feed doesn't bother you.  Well, let me go on to way that the feed from their site regularly experiences a delay that adds up over time.  After an hour or two, the delay might only be five or ten seconds.  After a day, this can add up to minutes. 2) You cannot record your own video.  Again, you must pay for their service to do this despite having perfectly good equipment of your own to do it, namely your computer. 3) And finally, the window in which you watch your vid feed has a giant annoying banner ad across the bottom, which obscures the feed.  The banner stays a constant size regardless of the size of the window, which means that if you have the window in fullscreen, it's not a big deal, but the smaller the window gets, the more of it is taken up by the banner, to the point at which the feed completely disappears in order to make room for the giant annoying banner. What is the banner an ad for, you ask?  Their crappy needless video monitoring service, of course.  Here is proof that they know that people hate this and don't care at all: [...] And no, the person who raised the question is not me.  I found that link when trying to find a way to get rid of the banner, something that is apparently impossible. All these issues would be very simple to fix.  There isn't any reason for them to even exist, in fact - except that this camera is really just a ploy to get you to sign up for their service.  Buy something else that is just as good and that will let your computer do for free what their service offers.","A crippled camera, DO NOT BUY"

The iOS app is garbage and I can't believe it was made by experienced developers. For instance, commands to turn the camera on or off are dropped completely unless you keep the app in the foreground for several seconds after.

To have this product be anything other than a glorified baby monitor will cost you: $10/month or $100/year for 10 days of video history, or $300/year for 30 days.

So impressed! Right out of the gate I got an alert that the backyard camera picked up someone in the backyard. I looked at the footage via the app on my phone then on my computer to verify that there was indeed a person in my backyard! I called the police immediately and they went over to do a walk around. They also asked if I could email them the clip that showed the person. It was very easy to grab the clip and email to the officer. Turns out it was a land surveyor and all was well...but perhaps the most impressive feedback was from the police department.

I love that when you're at work or out of town you can remotely watch your baby wake up and check in on him/her.  I like that you can watch the highlights (10-30 second snippets of video when the monitor detects motion or sound). HOWEVER, it is unreliable.  For two nights in a row, it just went out and was unable to connect for hours at a time with no warning.  Our wifi was working just fine, so I'm not sure why the connectivity was so poor.  We have decided to return it because this is a deal breaker.  It is unacceptable for a product you purchased solely to function as a baby monitor to go out for an entire night without warning or notification. Nest needs a backup alarm that activates you to notify you the camera is not connected and it needs a backup mode of some sort where it can connect to bluetooth or a wired internet connection or landline or the NSA backup server or something when the signal goes out.",Unreliable as a baby monitor -went out for two nights in a row without notification

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2017,Tim F,"I’m really disappointed with these cameras. By all rights they should be the best in class home security cameras. However problems I’ve encountered with their software, hardware, and customer service over the past few months stop me from recommending these to anyone. I bought an outdoor and indoor camera to create a basic home security setup, and intended to use the indoor camera as a baby monitor in a few months. I set up both cameras and was pretty amazed by the quality of video, thumbnailing, and alerting we were getting. However I had a problem with the “home” and “away” setting. I wanted alerting only to happen when the cameras were set to “away”, and to just passively record when we were home. This was very flakey, and I spent about an hour debugging it with Nest customer support. Resetting cameras would occasionally allow the alerting to function properly but it would immediately get out of sync. Look online - apparently this issue has existed for months. Now, every time we or anyone would walk near either camera I would get notifications and emails. This goes from mildly irritating to infuriating really quickly. So, I turned off alerts altogether. This removes about 30% of the value for me. My second issue is my indoor camera would drop offline for 20 minutes at a time every week or so. I reached out to nest support (again) and ended up with a support tech who argued with me for some time that a) it wasn’t a big deal and b) just move it around some more to see if it still happens. Trust me it’s a big deal if a baby monitor isn’t reliable. I got a lot of attitude from this guy. Since I had my two cameras equidistant from my wifi (with line of sight) and only one was dropping it seemed clear to me there was a problem outside of positioning. When I suggested I would just return the camera the tech said instead he’d do a camera swap. Great! Except he shipped it to the wrong address with a different name (but close enough to my name that I felt like he was griefing me). OK, I reached out a third (!!!) time to support to correct the address, this time over the phone. This tech was somewhat upset that the address was so badly botched and assured me she would get it fixed. I’m sure she tried, but it wasn’t fixed. Fortunately it went to my neighbor who I am friends with, so I at least got the camera. I sent the old camera back a few days later (weeks ago) via the included USPS sticker. Now I’ve gotten multiple harass mails saying they will need to charge me if they don’t get it. It’s been weeks in transit USPS ground…and they have the tracking number. Seriously, what the heck? I now have my new indoor camera, which has the same 20 minute dropout issues (this time in the same location my other, working fine, outdoor camera was in for months). And I can’t use alerting. And at this point I’m too weary to contact Nest again for anything. I paid for a year of service for each camera which I will just grin and bear. But the software, hardware, and customer service of this product just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",Really disappointed with these cameras

They're small, easy to install, unobtrusive (though I wish they came in white), and their app is easy to use. The one issue I have with these--and maybe it's my network--is that the service does go down about once a night (on average). The video on the cameras just shows a ""waiting"" spinner for anywhere from a minute to many minutes. This wouldn't be such a huge deal (I don't pay for ""Nest Aware"" recording), except that they don't work without an internet connection. Nest needs to update these with local viewing/control. If they did, it'd be 10 stars all day.","Great cameras, need local viewing/control"

Quality is 1080p and the camara rarely, if ever, gives me a problem. The bad: After your initial trial month you lose the ability to view video and are only provided with ""snaps"" which honestly arent that useful. Especially if you REALLY need to record something for security purposes. The ugly: In order to get video even if it's just 10 days you have to pay 100$ PER YEAR/ PER CAMARA. This seems EXTREMELY expensive. Additional commentary: Other products allow you to place a micro sd card to record and allow playback of video without using their servers providing an alternative and cheaper way to view videos.

But on March 17, 2017 Nest revise their policy and the company does not accept payments for subscriptions  from users that live outside of the 48 stares continuos territory. So I live in US territory with a US zip code, a card issue from a US bank and they will not accept my credit cards because I'm not in the US continuous territory. Therefore I have invested approximately $800 dollars on monitoring cameras that will only give me real time view.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2015,Mike Freeman,"--UPDATE-- I wanted to take a moment and make an update to my original review I gave this product. The original review was made prior to the new app update, which really does an amazing job in increasing overall functionality of the camera as a whole. As you can see in my original review of the product, I was not happy with using the camera as a baby monitor. The previous version didn't make it conducive to having it in a baby's room due to limited notifications. That has sense been changed. Now, the camera will give us alerts whenever our child moves around. Very nice. I'd also mention that I really appreciate that Nest took the time to update a previous gen product. All-to-often companies will leave an older product to focus on making it appealing to purchase new products. Not so with nest and I'm glad I made the decision to go with them. While many of the issues I had with the camera have been fixed, the grainy picture is still an issue. Perhaps I need a degree in network engineering to really get the best picture. It's good, but it just doesn't have a crisp clear picture. But, for what it is, it's more than enough. I can't say enough good things about the new app. The feature to scrub through a timeline to quickly see activities is perfect. There's no load time / buffering when going back, I don't know how the engineers at Nest were able to do this, but their video compression algorithm is really top notch. Maybe they're using the middle out compression. Regardless...a tip of the hat to them. I'm planning on buying the new outdoor camera soon and possibly another indoor camera. I've also updated my previous review from a 4 star to a 5 star. Well worth the investment. By updating the app they have given new life to this product! --ORIGINAL REVIEW-- While the nest cam is ""cool"" and works as it should, I simply can't give it 5 stars. We invested entirely into the nest ecosystem. We purchased 2 thermostats, the smoke alarms and the nest cam. Like other nest products it's a design gem! Small, attractive and website and app are very well designed and work great! It's ease of use and functionality are the few shining stars in this product. Through the app, setup was done very quickly, and it starts working fast as well. The picture quality is ok, not amazing by any means (not sure how they call it 1080). It is somewhat grainy, the night vision works great, but the overall picture is just grainy. Also, you can't really keep it in 1080 or it'll freeze. The ""alert"" system is oddly conceived. You only get alerts every 30 minutes. So, since we use the unit as a baby monitor, we have to constantly keep an eye on it. It won't alert you again until you enter into a new 30 minute window. Remotely viewing the camera (which technically is the only way) works okay as well. Sometimes it freezes and you have to reset the app and start over. But I've never just not been able to join it. Although sometimes it seems like it takes a while, but I'll chalk that up to a bad network connection. The dvr function or cloud storage is great. The monthly fee is a bummer but it's a good service and worth it. Overall I give it 4 stars. It's pricy for what it is, but it's still cool. If you are looking for this as your baby monitor I suggest you keep looking, until they update the app to be a better baby monitor.

Granted, the video is very clear, but there are several things I don't like about it. First, it only alerts you every 30 min if there is sound or motion in baby's room. This is a problem since it will alert you when you go in to put baby down, but if baby makes noise or moves within 30 min it won't alert you. You have to have the app running to know. Also- you have to leave the app running all night in order to hear baby cry. Most nights, it disconnects which left me with no monitor. With my older one I wouldn't mind, but with my new baby this isn't ok. Finally, it freezes a lot. One night my baby was crying in his room but the screen showed him sleeping peacefully. I just can't get past this. What if something were wrong but I think it's fine because the screen shows a sleeping baby? For a security camera this might be ok, but not for baby monitor.",Not a good baby monitor

It has adjustable pixel count to accommodate internet connection via satellite up to the high speeds connection some people have access to.

It is easy to install with out professional help.  The picture is very clear and you can enlarge hard to see spots.  The indicator light can be turned off to not call attention to it's location.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jul 2016,Mark Hammitt,"The pros:  Really easy set up, excellent picture quality. The cons:  Outrageous pricing for storage and annoying software glitches, each of which I'll expand upon. You need Nest Aware if you're going to use the camera in anything other than a real-time sense, but Nest's pricing is way beyond anything justified by cloud storage costs.  Let's do the math: Nest itself says to expect bandwidth requirements of 60 Gb/month, so 10 days of storage would be about a third of this, or 20 Gb. If the company were to use Amazon's S3 service, storing this would cost 2.75 cents per Gb, or 55 cents/month (see https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) for those 60 Gb. This includes everything: hardware, maintenance, admin, doughnuts on Friday, electricity, profits, etc.  Since Nest is part of Google which has its own server farms, I'd imagine their actual storage costs would be considerably lower... let's say 40 cents/month for 60 Gb.  There are also costs for downloading data (none for uploading) at 2 cents per Gb, so let's add on another 10 cents per month for that, making it 50 cents/month. But Nest charges $10/month, which is 20 times their costs!  I could see paying $3/month (that would be a mere 500% markup), but $10/month just seems greedy.  I'll reluctantly pay this for a month (using it to investigate nightly raids by a family of raccoons), but will shut it down afterward until another pressing needs emerges, or until competition forces Nest to come up with a more reasonable pricing model. Re software glitches:  I've already signed up for their 30 day Nest Aware plan.  Nevertheless, Nest keeps presenting a banner reading ""Subscribe to Nest Aware to record and store up to 30 days of video history"" every time I log in to my account or open up the iPad app.  Then, when I open the Nest Aware settings, it tells me that ""Billing for your 10 day Nest Aware with Video History subscription will begin when you free trial ends.""  And it's only when I hit the big blue Manage Subscription button at the bottom of the Nest Aware settings screen that they confirm that I'm in fact signed up for the 30 day Nest Aware plan.  Nest customer support confirms that I'm on a 30-day plan, and tells me that there's nothing they can do about these mixed messages. Since they're practically printing money with their egregious Nest Aware mark-ups, I'd think they'd be able to afford getting someone to write a pretty basic set of conditional upgrade messages.","Great camera, greedy pricing, sloppy software"

I wanted to be able to check on my kids while with the babysitter and keep an eye on the house when I'm out or on vacation.  It took me less than 5 minutes to set up each camera after downloading the app onto my iphone.  And they've been up and running and playing nice with all the other devices I have on our Verizon FIOS wifi.  We have the new FIOS Quantum Gateway modem which has two networks (one slower and covers more space, the other faster but shorter wifi coverage).  I also have an extender installed in the furthest part of the house to maximize coverage and that extender picks up both networks.  So basically I have 4 networks along with two kindles, two iphones, two ipads, a Roku, two laptops on wifi and two Fire amazon sticks.  And the Nest Cams work great.  I have one in a bedroom across the house from the FIOS Gateway router and I have it configured to pickup the modem's slow/broad wifi signal which is does beautifully.  I also got the Wifi Nest Protect and that is working perfectly.  Quality is very clear both night and day and I love the voice feature.

First it was the ""1-minute"" install.  Nothing happened automatically and it took a 45-minute call.  Nest assumed I was using a strange computer.  In reality, it is Win 8.1.  So much for the auto detect and setup.  When finally operating I discovered the lens aim is off line some 20 degrees.  Weird for a camera to not aim properly. point it straight ahead and it ""see's"" off to one side.  Today I attempted to make a video clip.  Completed the video and a screen popped up to save or post.  The screen disappeared and cannot be located from the available lame commands.  It appears the video was saved but in a black hole somewhere.  No thanks Nest, you are getting my camera back.  Just ordered a Samsung cam that allows free saving of videos.  Unlike the Nest that you must pay a monthly subscription.  Hey, Google, in my opinion Nest is ruining your reputation for selling quality hardware.",$200 for this?

I am a new mom with a newborn. I bought this camera to be used in our baby's room. It was my third camera in just four weeks.  When I bought it, I loved it instantly. I liked that you could use it on all your devices, the picture was great and it was very easy to set up.  I told multiple friends go buy one because it was the best on the market.  My experience now is quite simply that this camera is unreliable. It goes out multiple times a day, the camera disappears in the app, sometimes for hours, and at times the only thing I see is the spinning wheel. On top of all the issues, customer service is horrific. the first time the camera went down, I emailed the company. I was told that there was a company issue and that it had since been resolved. The second time it went down at 330am, I called the next morning, waited on hold for 1 hour and 50 minutes and was hung up on. I preceded to email and never received a response.  I just purchased a new camera. I would not recommend this camera. Please do your research. You will see I am not alone. I hope this is helpful when making your decision on this purchase.",Unreliable

All that the Nest Cam has to offer is superb in regards to set-up, mounting, WiFi use, and the app are the reasons to buy it. Where I believe improvements can be made would be more functionality in the app and website interface in regards to managing Zones and notification in a way that is more user friendly. The biggest downside is when you use the Nest Cam to monitor an outside area from within through a window. The Nest Cam's IR LEDs reflect back off the window glass and make any night vision viewing impossible. I have turned off the night vision , and any additional purchases, for this purpose for the time being until I figure this issue out. I asked Nest about this almost to two weeks ago and have not heard anything back...

The reason I give it 2 stars is not for the functionality, but because I think that Nest should give some kind of free subscription option to it's customers, even if it's storing only 1 day or 12 hours of video.  The camera is virtually useless if you don't pay for the subscription, and it's expensive especially considering the cost of the camera itself.","Great camera, expensive video subscription cost."

We live in a small NYC apartment and the Nestcam has significant trouble with a smooth feed from one side of the apartment to the other.  We actually have a picture of the baby (we use it as a baby monitor) watching a delayed picture of herself on the monitor.  Additionally, we find the app to be buggy - spinning circle to indicate thinking, says the camera is not connected when it is (going back and forth to the app landing screen fixes), crashes, etc.  The alerts also do not work well.  We sometimes hear the baby crying or turn on the camera and see her moving about and no alert has triggered.

I just had my baby and got the nest camera as a baby monitor that I can later use as a security camera for my home.  I love the design and the idea of the camera, that's why I invested in it, and was hoping to purchase a few more later down the line to complete my home security system.  However, the camera has not worked to the standard as it claims.  It is quite frustrating when sometimes the picture freezes when a text comes in on my phone and I don't realize I'm staring at the same picture until I hear my baby cry.  Sometimes I'm monitoring on my ipad and it freezes for no reason.  Sometimes it'll go offline for more than 15 minutes which is even more infuriating because what if sometime happened to my baby and I didn't even know or my house was being burglarized but it couldn't capture anything because it was offline? How am I supposed to trust in a product that's supposed to protect my home?! It is horrible and gives me no confidence in this product at all which I had so much hope for.

It is a great camera because of its versatility.  Has to be the easiest camera to install...takes about 2-3 minutes maybe at most to set them up and be up and running.  They also are easy to move around if you want to try them somewhere else.  The alerts they send when they either hear or see something is very helpful. The clarity is terrific for both sound and video.  The night vision is awesome...very clear and bright. Some people complain that the camera gets hot...my suggestion is not to touch it then.  Yes, its warm but lots of things that are plugged in get warm (like your cell phone if you are using it).  It's not a big deal to me that they get warm to the touch.  I am now subscribing (the recording options) on 3 of my cameras and soon probably on the 4th.  Going with the 10 day program, paying monthly in case I want to stop recording a camera or 2 for a while.  ONLY THING THAT COULD BE IMPROVED...being able to handle 3 locations on one app...the limit is 2.  I have 3 locations the nest cams are located at; a home; a lake house, and a place of business and I have to create 2 log in's under 2 different email addresses to access my cameras.  That is inconvenient, especially using the app on my phone.  I have 2 locations on one ID but have to sign out and sign back in under another ID (and email address) to sign in to my 3rd location.That would be a tremendous fix for the near future...to be able to access 3 or more locations on the app under one ID.",I'm a big Fan!

The cameras are good, they are nice looking, easy to mount on the wall, they cut out now and again but generally have a good range and have great quality of image and zoom and night vision.  For a while I thought we had really found the perfect wifi monitor and I loved it, recommending it to family, friends, colleagues.  My issue is now with the reliability of the network, since the Nest/Google acquisition of Dropcam the reliability has been getting worse and worse.  The last month has been particularly bad which makes me feel like Nest is not on top of the issues. We use this as a baby monitor and it is not ok to have it not work for hours on end.  Worse, customer support is terrible, usually not acknowledging a problem until it becomes a serious widespread issue or until after they have resolved it.  I have not once been able to speak to someone there, all I can do is send emails which they answer within a day, or two (!). Overall I can no longer recommend this product, I would prefer worse quality video but with a reliable network so it doesn't just go dark for hours and I have zero monitor.  I don't know what better options are out there--maybe someone else will make some suggestions.  Or maybe Nest will actually fix the problem!

I needed something that could be used indoors, but would have good picture quality if I decided to have it view outdoors (from a window sill) as well.  The convenience of having everything controlled by the Nest app is pretty great.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I have to restart the app pretty frequently.  The picture will freeze from time to time.  A restart gets it working again.  The sound function will not work from time to time. A restart gets it working again.  Every now and then the picture won't go live when you hit the 'on' button via the app.  A restart gets it working again.  You get the point. I haven't tried the monthly subscription, so I can't speak to that.  The motion detection works great.","Overall good, however restarts are frequent"

The nest cameras provide great hardware, good night time visibility, and decent picture quality. The software, however, can be frustrating at times. The Nest app is clearly bulky and cumbersome to phones and PC's compared to the Dropcam application. The software also doesn't utilize the geofence features that dropcam does. Setup is easy, however the dropcam setup process was the easiest. The nest setup requires serial number scans where dropcam allowed direct connection and instant setup. There is lots of potential because the groundwork is already there with the dropcam software and product. These cameras are still the BEST solution on the market if you don't want to spend tons on a security system. I feel this product could be much better, but still the best available.",Strong hardware.

For clarification, the cam was set up in the infant room with black out curtain and it never ONCE gave false notification during the free trail period. I clearly expressed the concern to the customer representative but the answer I got was 1. Nest only becomes smarter AFTER the clients subscribe to its services ( so why it never happen during the first 30 days of free trail ? Customer representative could never answer without directing me to subscribe to the service ) 2. After I ask how to improve or stop the false notification he gave the answer I could not believe... He told me to stop using it !!! So he is advising me through his professional opinion that even though me I purchased one of the more expensive wifi home cam on the market for the safety of my infant but I should just turn it off ????

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2015,Luis,"Awesome camera, good features, easy to use app, simple setup and makes home automation simple. I have wanted a camera for the home for a while but was on the fence for some time.  I currently have the Nest Thermostat and a few Nest Protects in the home, which I have been really pleased with and when Nest came out with the camera it was a no brainer.  I have to say I am very surprised by the negative reviews, which I don't understand. So these are my thoughts: Pros: Easy to setup, clear picture, awesome night vision, great app, easy to use app, love the notifications and full integration Cons: The unit gets a bit warm, an outdoor version would be nice If you are on the fence about getting a camera this is the chance you've been waiting for, or at least it has been for me.  The price is what it is, at this time they are $200, but all things considered that is great I think.  With it being new I think they can get away with charging $200 but $150 would be just right.  Take a step back and realize what you are getting... a tiny camera, that hooks up to wi-fi, small foot print, gets awesome wide views and great picture... all while delivering it straight to your phone... that is phenomenal.  Think about where this possibility was 10 years ago or even 15... the setup, hardware and it was terrible... now for a small cost you get a tiny footprint, small hardware, great video quality straight to your phone all while being able to set it up yourself in less than 30 seconds!!!  What else do you want? Are there other products like this?  Yes.  Are they cheaper?  Yes.  But I would put my money on Nest and Google as a company to put some serious R&D and continue to add features to it and believe they will do a better job than any competitor out there.  If they don't then they'll probably buy them out, LOL. Let me say this though about the complaints I have seen, specifically with connection issues.  Before I set off on my home automation journey I realized I would have to have a killer wi-fi connection in order to pull this off, no taking short cuts on this at all.  The wi-fi router in my opinion is the heart of the system you want to install.  I went with what I thought was the best router out there at the time which was the Linksys WRT AC1900 dual band wi-fi router.  http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-Dual-Band-Wireless-Anywhere-WRT1900AC-FFP/dp/B00K91DB7Y It is not cheap but you don't want to go cheap in this category and if you even begin to think that your cable provided router is good, it is not.  You have to realize whatever they provide you are light years behind the Linksys by far.  When I had the Verizon provided junk router I kept having connection issues with my Nest Thermostat and the Nest protects.  In the evening with the family on their devices we would have two iPads, two iPhones, computer and all the wireless systems (printers, Nest Protects, Thermostats, Camera, cloud drives) and always had issues because of the demand on the router.  Now with dual bands, I setup automation on one and family devices on the other and the system is flawless. I can't stress to take your router in to consideration when you hear these complaints.  If you want a good experience not only with this camera but whatever you do with home automation the router quality will have to be at the heart of the system, invest money there.  As for folks who say they have 75/75 internet, lets be real... that is at best... after that the signal has to be put out thru your router and that is the weak point, you don't actually get the true power. I hope this review is helpful to some and answers your concerns posed by others. Thank you!","Finally A Solid Camera, Awesome Night Vision, Great Integration, Great App & Simple to Setup Camera!"

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2016,V. M.,"This is named a ""security camera"" but a combination of high image compression and motion blur render the effective resolution far less than the advertised 1080P (2 megapixel). I originally attached representative images to my review, but the review was rejected presumably because it contained ""personally identifying"" information. But honestly the image quality is so low you couldn't identify anyone with it. To describe the two images, in one a lady is 5' from the camera and her face is a featureless blur throughout the video. In another a car passes close by my house, and the license plate is illegible. I risked attaching that one here. Given the low image quality, it really doesn't matter that the Nest Cam doesn't support ONVIF --an open IP video surveillance standard-- because it wouldn't provide useful imagery even if it did. Without ONVIF support, the camera can't be linked with crime camera networks like a well known one here in New Orleans. This camera doesn't provide any meaningful level of security as advertised, so I'm returning it.","blurry image quality, doesn't support ONVIF crime camera standard"

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2015,HungryCats,"I see some positive raters are poo-pooing the negative reviews. Here's mine, and I'll be clear and comprehensive in outlining why I don't like the Nest Cam: BOTTOM LINE: SO, the Nest Cam looks nice but for what I paid I could have gotten much more. If you're shopping for a security/monitoring cam, do the math: Nest cam is $300 the first year (w/subscription), and compare it to other systems in that price range. I suspect it will fall short of the others. DETAILS: 1. Setup was not quick or easy: Plugged camera into outlet and setup several feet below Nest Protect monitor which works fine (connected to Nest network, etc.). after several attempts of trying to get camera to connect (have 3/4 bars for home wireless signal, which seems sufficient), will not connect to network (only see flashing or solid blue light). Moved the camera to another spot, light turned green almost immediately. However, Nest system did not recognize camera. I moved camera to room with router, plugged into computer with USB cord that came with it (other USB cables do not seem to work) and was finally able to get the camera to display the view and be recognized by the system. 2. Poor customer service: Nest customer support took EIGHT DAYS to respond to my initial service request by email (instead of the stated ""3 to 5"" days). When they did respond, they suggested setting up the camera in the same room as the router (despite having full bars in the second position). I plugged it in to my computer at the same time, and at some point a dialogue box popped up to allow me to install the camera. It had not done so earlier when I plugged it in, so I'm not sure why it worked the last time. 3. Poor user guide:  It doesn't explain whether I will receive alerts if motion is detected, and it does not explain whether there is any way to keep the camera from detecting constant motion like a fan. For example, whether there is any way to restrict motion detection to a certain zone. 4. No personalized settings for notification: Alerts are transmitted each half hour--NOT for every alert/motion detection. Notifications are sent to phone, and not email. What happens if you are somewhere w/o your phone during the day? SOL. 5. Subscription expensive: $10/mo or $99/year mean you're paying $300 for one camera that has limited functionality, and which is certainly not significantly superior in features to other cameras on the market. Nice of Nest to decide that I don't want to save the video on a home system, but it would have been nice to have that option. Either way, I have 5GB free storage w/Google, so why should I be paying Nest to save a few hundred megabytes? 6. Video and bandwidth issues: I have a 50/50 MB plan w/my provider which I frequently test for throughput. the connection actually exceeds those figures in both directions. However, the connection with the Nest Cam is laggy on 720, and almost glacial on 1080. Picture satisfactory, but giving a monochrome option would cut down on bandwidth requirement (just watch IR footage if you want to see a responsive cam). 7. Camera operation unreliable: Camera has frequently been ""off"" when I have recently accessed it remotely, despite the fact that I've NEVER switched it off. So, not effective as a security cam. 8. Microphone quiet: have spoken into cell phone and could barely hear voice coming out of camera. I see no adjustment for volume, and nothing in manual, of course.",Pretty...but not much more than looks
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2016,Chuck,"I bought a 3-pack of these here on Amazon.  My experience has been less than satisfactory at this price point. Reliability: POOR Upon arrival, 1 of the 3 cameras quit working within minutes of setting it up.  I sent it back thinking it was just a fluke.  Amazon's system didn't allow me to order a single camera replacement, so I ordered a 3-pack again in the return process.  I swapped only a single camera and dutifully labeled the bad one, returning 2 of the 3 brand new cameras.  Things were pretty good for 6 weeks or so, but now another of the cameras just randomly drops.  Sometimes it comes back by cycling the power, sometimes it does not. Let me stress that this is NOT a WiFi issue.  The signal at the camera is strong.  I've swapped cameras and it's always the same one that stops working, never the other 2.  Software is the same version for all 3 cams: 205-600052.  At this point, I don't feel right returning it again to Amazon. Setup: GREAT One strong point of Nest is the ease of setup.  Scan the QCode and it walks you through everything on iPhone.  Even though I'm fairly technical, I can appreciate the ease of setup.  Nest has done a better job than any camera I've seen -- and I've seen several. Compatibility: POOR Buyers are locked into using Nest software to view an image or get a screen cap.  I expected them to work with third party software or direct HTTP frame grabs like nearly every other brand does.  But, Nest doesn't support any integration other than with their own platform. It certainly can't be for better reliability!  Perhaps it's in the hope that buyers will pay even more to subscribe to the service.  Hint:  I'd never consider paying for a service when the camera goes offline randomly.  Further, internal networks are much faster than Internet uploads.  So why exactly is Nest not offering a Windows app that stores video locally?  I'd pay a one-time fee for that, I suppose. Image Quality: GREAT The camera really does have a decent quality image with a nice wide angle of view. Dropcam was a good acquisition!  At this price point, a good image is to be expected -- and Nest delivers. SUMMARY A video monitoring system must do 2 things in my opinion.  It must deliver a clear image and it must do so reliably.  Nest has failed me at the latter.  As a result, I can't depend on it to be running when I need it to be.  That makes it a poor choice if you are considering Nest for monitoring and will depend on it to be up and running 24/7.",Great Image - Unacceptably Low Reliability

Called Nest who said the app's interaction with cellphone was 'finicky'.  Nest suggested reinstalling app or restarting phone. Not a useful solution every time you want to view video.

Lacks a lot of basic features you would hope for in a security cam.  Not designed to be used outside (isn't that where most security camps are pointed?)

These cameras are great. We are using them for security and as a baby monitor and we couldn't be happier.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jul 2015,Reviewer,"I inquired about the temperature of my Nest Cam and received a total BS answer. I was told: ""The operating temperature is anything from 32 to 104F, as detailed under the tech specs option"". First off, this is the ambient temperature range the device should operate normally under. Not the temperature range of the device itself. I clipped a thermocouple to the back of the camera. With the camera in the off state and plugged in, the temperature peaked at 117.2 F. After turning on and waiting several minutes, the temp climbed to 119.6 F before I stopped measuring. This device is like a miniature heater. Having several in a house will increase my already high utility cost. I researched other's reviews and discovered many people complaining about the device temperature.  Several Nest technician responses claimed it's because the internal WiFi antenna is always on.  News flash: every smartphone uses an internal WiFi antenna and can record and broadcast video (just like a Nest Cam).  My personal smartphone never gets warm with WiFi connected at all times. This temperature issue and the outrageous cost for recording video to the cloud has made me think twice about this product. I will seek an alternate method for my security. For what it's worth, the camera did easily connect and work fine with the Nest App that I use for my Nest thermostat.  I was hoping the camera would be as good as the thermostat - oh well...",Miniture Heater

Still defaults to 720P  resolution though you can change it to 1080P but it has a warning on the setting page saying it will use high bandwidth and camera will become very warm.

All in all, this is definitely a step up from our last video monitor in terms of quality and ease of setup. Also, The app has useful featured like 2-way communication. However, there are two major things I wish were different. 1) I would prefer it to be more portable. Maybe Nest could sell additional power cords/stands so you can move the camera around your house without needing to unplug it every time. (although maybe this is intentional-to get you to buy multiple cameras!) 2) It only functions properly when you have the app fully open. This is hard to do reliably overnight especially when the auto power save on my iphone kicks on.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Aug 2015,Rene,"I really wanted to love this camera, i really did. Here is why i can't recommend it. The hardware of the new Nest Cam is both beautiful and practical. It feel solid and the build quality is outstanding. The only gripe i had on the physical, hardware-side was that the USB cable they included was very thick and stubborn to bend and hard to get into the micro-USB connector. I don't get why they could include a white cable and power adapter when the camera has a dark metallic look to it. feels like the cable belongs to some other product. I used one of my existing, thin and flexible high quality micro USB cables and that worked a lot better. To finish the brief section about the hardware on a high note, the lens angle and quality are great. the picture is crisp and clear both day and night. Unfortunately this great hardware is paired with terrible, absolutely mind boggling bad software, both on the mobile device as well as on the web portal. Come on, NEST, you can do better. First of all, what bothered me the most, was that for their web stream, one needs flash. It's 2015 and everyone is dropping flash and NEST launched a new product with FLASH as a requirement? Are you kidding me? So if you want to share the video of your kids with your grandparents who have an iOS device, forget it, they won't be able to watch the flash stream. The web client is equally terrible. Instead of just a clean web video view that's based on HTML5, you get a flash container and a bunch of ads around it. terrible. But what finally was the killer for me was the web stream quality. This camera advertises itself as 1080p, yet the web stream is not. Dear NEST, please take a deep breath and re-think the software side of this great cam. Let me know when you have an easy to share HTML full 1080p stream interface.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2016,Don Draper,"UPDATE 9/3/2019  This has to be said. Most of the time I'm the type of person who says:  ""If you can't say anything good about a product, don't say anything at all.""  The problem is that there is so much wrong with this product now that I feel I'm obligated to update this review. Google bought Nest back in 2015.  Until recently, Nest customers didn't really notice this fact.  I'm sure many of them didn't even realize that Nest was a Google-owned company.  Google has now ""taken the reigns"" of Nest and has been systematically dismantling it.  The former customers are irate (App Store rating of 1.9 currently) and Google does not seem to care. They started off small by updating the software to no longer allow the camera LEDs to be turned off.  This was an absurd ""privacy"" move.  Anyone who purchased a Nest cam for discrete security purposes was very upset at this decision.  I was one of these customers.  I use a Nest cam for a security camera which is placed inside on a windowsill facing out to view the yard.  Nest cameras formerly worked well for this purpose because you could turn off the LED and the night mode function.  Now you can no longer turn off the LED and it reflects back from the glass in the image.  This problem can be remedied by covering it with a small piece of electrical tape, but you should not have to do this on a $200.00 camera.  I should note that the tape fix does not work if you need to use the camera's night mode function because it interferes with the light sensor. The next genius move by Google was to remove IFTTT support.  If you are not familiar with with it, IFTTT is an applet service you can use to link your smart home devices and give them autonomous functionality.  This is an awesome free service that really makes smart home products ""smart.""  For example, you could link your Nest cam to IFTTT and have it send an e-mail to your work e-mail address if your camera was triggered by a person entering your house. Google nixed IFTTT support on August 31, 2019. Nest introduced the Nest Secure alarm system back in 2017.  This was a nice little DIY wireless alarm system.  It was attractive and discrete albeit a little pricey.  They even introduced a cellular backup feature for people who wished to self-monitor their alarm systems.  Even if someone cut the internet feed to your home, you would still get an alert on your phone when the alarm was triggered via the cellular service.  Google has announced they will discontinue the cellular backup service in August 2020. Therefore I cannot recommend anyone purchase Google Nest devices for their homes.  Your purchase may end up being something completely different in the future.  This would be like purchasing a refrigerator with an ice maker.  A rep. from the company sneaks into your house in the middle of the night and removes the ice maker.  The response you get is:  ""Sorry we are no longer offering that feature.  Your appliance has been updated to reflect this product change.""  I think the only way to stop this type of business practice is in the courts.  We need laws preventing companies from making feature-removing software/firmware changes to their products without owner consent. *PREVIOUS REVIEWS* October, 2016 So far so good for the Nest Cam.  I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to purchase this cam after reading some of the negative reviews.  I suspect the problems people have had are not the camera's fault because my install and first impressions are very good.  I purchased the camera to keep an eye (and ear) on my home when I'm away. The camera was a snap to install.  You just plug it in, download the app to your phone or tablet, and follow the on-screen app instructions for install.  I did have a failure on the very first attempt to connect to my WiFi, but the second ""retry"" attempt connected immediately and I have not experienced any other connect failures. Before you purchase a Nest Cam, I would highly recommend downloading WiFi signal strength and speed test apps.  Hold your phone in the location you intend to install the cam and run the signal strength and speed test apps.  If your signal is weak, you may need to re-position your router or get a range extender.  If you plan on running your Nest Cam at 1080p resolution, the cam will use up to 1.2 Mbps of bandwidth.  The default quality setting is 720p.  I found the default quality to be more than adequate for a security cam so I just left it alone. One of the features I really like about the Nest Cam is the sound alert function.  The camera will monitor sound in the room and send you an alert if it hears a sound that is different from the normal background noise (i.e. a smoke alarm or a breaking window).  It also looks for motion and will send an alert if the camera sees someone moving in the room.  You can even use the sound function to talk to anyone who happens to be in the room.  ""The police have been notified.  I suggest you get out of my house.""  Sound alerts are disabled by default so be sure you turn it on in the settings if you want this feature. Now for the cons.  One complaint I have is with the cam response time for turning on and connecting to the app.  I want my cam to be on when I'm away and off when I'm home.  I've found that it takes about 30 seconds for the cam to come on-line after touching the ""Away"" button.  The only other solution for me is to have the cam on all the time, but I don't have the desire for this. There is a scheduler function that you can use to turn your cam on for a defined period of time each day, but that will only be useful if your schedule is very consistent. The best option I've found is to use the scheduler function for my work days and the ""Home/Away"" function for my days off or when my work schedule varies.  This is a nuisance considering the high-tech. nature of this device.  In my opinion it really shouldn't require so much manual intervention by the user.  (I deducted 1 star for this.)  It seems that Nest wants you to leave your camera on 24/7, but this seems really unnecessary to me.  I don't want to waste bandwidth recording every minute of my life when I'm at home.  A geo-fencing ability for the cam to automatically come online when it senses your mobile devices are away would be a very welcome feature. Overall, I would say the Nest Cam is a really cool product.  Its features provide a lot of versatility for use and It adds another layer of security to your home even if you already have an alarm system.  I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on its long term reliability yet, but I'll update my review if I have any problems. UPDATE 7/17/16 No Problems The Nest Cam is still working.  I'm pleased to update that they have added geo-fencing (+1 star).  This resolves my biggest complaint about having to manually enable the cam if you don't want it recording 24/7.  You can link the cam to one or more smartphones or tablets and have the camera automatically turn on when the camera detects that the devices are not in the area.  So far, it seems to be working pretty well.  Whenever I'm not at home and I check my phone, the cam is on.  When I return with my phone, the cam automatically turns off. It probably isn't the best choice for someone interested in a ultra high-security application.  The cam is dependent on WiFi so if someone cuts your internet connection or jams the signal, the cam won't see a thing.  However, if the cam has lost internet connectivity for at least 30 minutes, the Nest server will notify you.  You can increase the security of your connection by using a cellular WiFi hotspot for the cam and a UPS for the power adapters. If you need a cam that lets you check in on your home when you're on vacation to make sure it's not burning down, flooding or broken-into, Nest Cam does the job.  I think it is a useful product and I'm eagerly awaiting the outdoor version. UPDATE 2/26/17 The Nest cams are still working well.  I added 2 additional cams for a total of 3 to monitor the interior of the house as well as the front and back yards.  I decided to go with indoor cams pointed out windows instead of the outdoor cam for convenience and ease of installation.  I have some high mounted sun windows in the house that are perfect for putting a camera in.  As long as you have decent lighting outside, the cams work just fine even after dark.  All I had to do was disable the front LEDs and turn off night vision.  If you are home with the lights on, the reflection from the interior lights may make it difficult to see outside, but with the interior lights off they work really well.  This is just fine for me because I wanted the cameras to monitor my house when I'm not at home.  Nest also continues to improve the software.  You can now view multiple cams in one window, and they've added an image quality function that automatically selects the best quality based on your connection. I did have remove one star from my rating due to the competition that Nest Cam has now.  Unfortunately, Nest continues to gouge its customers with pricey subscription fees to get cloud storage when its competitors are offering free cloud storage.  Therefore, my next cam will probably not be a Nest Cam. 12/30/18 I've been living with these cameras for almost 3 yrs now. All of my cameras are still working and overall I'm pleased with this product.  Nest devices are quality products and I've even added a thermostat and the Nest protect smoke/CO detectors. I've all but eliminated the app delays by upgrading my wifi router.  The cameras turn on automatically via the application's home/away feature. I even bit the bullet and subscribed to the Nest Aware service for 2 of my cameras to get full functionality. Rarely, the home/away function fails to turn on or off the cameras. This used to happen more often so they must be fixing bugs on a regular basis. Overall, the reliability for the cameras and app have been very good. My #1 complaint with the Nest cams would be that they force you into a subscription service to obtain full camera functionality. You must have a Nest Aware subscription to create activity zones and have the person recognition feature. Personally I feel that they should give a 24hr subscription for free and charge extra if you want more storage time. If you don't subscribe, in 30 days, you will have a crippled version of the camera. It's not like Nest is some struggling startup that needs the money.

(Nest is still working some of the bugs out of the online and mobile applications - since the company transition/buyout, but even now with a few hiccups, to me it is still much better than before). Setting up the new Nest Cam was nearly a breeze. The wizard walks you thru everything (for Windows or Apple).  There was a little bit of a snag in the beginning (as I was trying to add the cam to my account) but I called customer support and they immediately talked me through an issue - no problem. (They're avail 24/7) Turns out I was able to use the app on the smartphone rather than the PC to setup the new cam and add it to my existing account. I love having everything (Nest Protect and Nest Cam) all in one place when I log-in - wether on the Internet or my phone app. I'm real pleased with this new Nest Cam. I like the viewing ability, and more importantly having Nest Aware, where I can go back and see snippets of video history when motion is detected; that's the best thing ever!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Feb 2016,C. Stahl,"I bought these to keep an eye on a property that I own but don't live at. It took a bit of fiddling, but at the moment I have 5 cameras, all of which work pretty well. Some of the initial problems I ran into were not down to the cameras, but the conditions at the location where I installed them. First, I was hoping to be able to get away with a low-bandwidth/low-cost internet package from my cable company to support the cameras, but this wasn't possible. At a bandwidth requirement of ~200Kbps per camera, i had to upgrade to an internet package that gave me more bandwidth. The second issue I ran into was that I was getting poor signal to the cameras from the wifi router. Again, this is no fault of the cameras, but due to the fact that the house has plaster walls with metal mesh lath, which degrades the wifi signal across rooms much more than sheetrock walls. This was causing some of the cameras to constantly lose their connection.  **Protip: You can use an Android phone (not an iPhone) with a wifi analyzer app to check the signal strength at your cameras' locations. Once the bandwidth issue was resolved, I determined that I needed a wifi extender to get the wifi signal to reach the cameras located far away from the wifi router (again, the signal degradation was mostly due to the plaster walls in the house). Once the extender was up and running and the cameras getting a strong signal, I haven't had a single problem with them disconnecting. The image quality is fairly good. Although I do have to say that I have one camera pointing out a window. There is a streetlight across the street, and the streetlight alone provides enough light that I have a fairly good view even with Night Vision off. I was also able to set up activity zones so that the camera looking out the window only notifies me when there is activity in my yard and driveway, but not when a car drives by on the street. Nice. I do agree with reviewers that the cameras do get quite hot. Not hot enough to burn, but enough that I made sure there was plenty of room for air circulate around it. Not sure I'd want to put it anywhere where it'd be cramped. So far so good, at least for my purposes, which admittedly are probably different than most people's who use it in their homes.",all of which work pretty well. Some of the initial problems I ran ...

We purchased 3 Nest Cams and are absolutely thrilled at the results.  Hookup to our wi-fi took only moments.

However, one of my DropCam's died so Nest, to their credit, sent me a 'no charge' replacement.  Great. This camera is in my 'other' location about 400 miles away. It has been performing well; until this morning.  Now I get the 'Camera is Disconnected' message.  I checked with my internet provider and all is well.  I checked with my wifi enabled home security system and all is well.  It looks like Nest just disconnected for no reason. The rest of the bad news is that tech support tells me that I have to be 'on site' to 'reinstall' the camera to get it working.  Really?!  That means I have to drive 800 miles, round trip, to get my camera working and there is no guarantee that it won't disconnect again on the return trip; or anytime thereafter.  In my opinion having to be 'present' to reset the camera defeats the purpose of buying the camera in the first place.  I need the ability to reliably view my property; not drive 800 miles to make it work!  Is this the best that Google/Nest can do? I told support that the inability to reset the camera from a distance and they said ""we are working on it"".

I am using this as a baby monitor, and it is very unsettling to go to sleep at night and wonder if the camera is going to work the whole night through.

We've had it a couple months and it's much better than any of the other ones we've had. The only issue I have with it is that after the first month you have to pay $100 a year to see any past events.

It's frustrating when I get a notification on my phone that there's been motion, but when I click on it I can't see anything because I can't pay for the yearly subscription.

Not worth it considering you have to pay to get any kind of cloud service. This is how Nest makes their money (the subscription service) not the sale of the camera itself. Audio quality that it picks up compared to Arlo Q is very poor. Image quality is great and nighttime image is better than the Arlo Q or LogiCircle. But again, requiring subscription service to even get any of the historical clips just kills it (at least offer 2-3 days of free cloud recording). Oh btw, the cloud service is PER CAMERA which is absurd.",Expensive if you factor in cloud service requirement; do not buy.

Just try again. However, I have very good WiFi at home, but the 1080 image quality is just flat out bad. It is not good quality. Nowhere near what the hype would have you believe. I am seriously considering getting rid of these and investing in some wired cameras with a local hard drive system that backs up to the internet. The image quality is not good enough to clearly identify a stranger's face. The night vision is good if you have a camera that is not facing out a window (the infrared emitters reflect off the glass, ruining the image), and if you do, you can turn off the night-vision and still get a decent image if there is some light source. If it was just to see comings and goings, I would be satisfied. However, I really was expecting to be able to clearly identify people at a little distance, and these seem to struggle to provide good quality images, let alone 1080 images. plus, the 10 day history is a little expensive at $100 a year for one camera (then $50 per). For the cost and hype, I expected to see HD. Almost never actually get it. I've even tried turning down the quality on some cameras to see if it gives the others more bandwidth or something...still no joy.",Not quite as good as the hype

The design is sleek, the hardware feels solidly built but the performance leaves much to be desired.

However it is not worth it if you are looking for quality security with a way to record and store activity for more than 24 hours.  If you use the NEST you have to pay PER CAMERA  for 10 days worth of storage.  It would cost me over $250 a year(paid in advance) to use their cloud storage service for 4 cameras.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2018,BWS,"We’re using it as a baby monitor (I know the company claims that’s not what it’s for but come on - that’s clearly how LOTS of people are using it) and it works ok but not great for this. We’ve had both a Summer video monitor and Motorola video monitor previously, so I’m writing my review as a comparison to those: PROS:  using internet connection to view means the range isn’t limited (I can be in the farthest room in my house or even backyard and it works - with the Summer and Motorola monitors the handheld viewer had a limited range so I could only be 2 rooms away.) The fisheye lens lets me view the whole room so panning/tilting isn’t necessary. Lets me speak through the camera (although honestly I don’t use this function much). MUCH better picture quality than any “real” baby monitor. Also good sound quality. Able to get several cameras for same account, so can see multiple children at once.  Once we no longer need a baby monitor I can easily repurpose it as a home security camera.  It’s actually cheaper than the Summer or Motorola baby monitors with WiFi capability. The Summer and Motorola WiFi apps to view through the camera on your phone are glitchy, often fail to load, and even if they do load they time out after a minute or 2, so you can’t use their phone apps as an actual monitor, you have to use the base instead. However with the Nest cam the phone app doesn’t time out so my husband and I can be in 2 separate rooms and both keep an eye on children. The Nest app works with both iPhone and Android, and my old iPhone battery lasts a lot longer than the battery in the Summer or Motorola handheld viewers. CONS: Only works through WiFi, so if your internet goes out for some reason, so does your baby monitor. No dedicated handheld viewer unit means you have to have an old phone or tablet dedicated to using as a monitor if you want to be able to use your phone at the same time - I’m using an old iPhone 5. Other reviews noted that the app doesn’t stay open, but I’ve found that if I open the app and keep the phone plugged into a charger it stays on, otherwise if I use guided access it keeps the app open too. The camera keeps going offline or losing connection though which is frustrating. It usually only happens for a few minutes and then comes back on, but I’ve also woken up in the morning to see a notification that the camera is offline and it worries me - who knows how long it was down and what if anything did I miss? A new router with only the camera connected didn’t solve the problem, so I’m pretty sure it’s the camera not my internet connection. We started using a sound-only monitor in addition to the camera so that if the camera goes offline - especially in the middle of the night - we can still hear if the little one starts crying or something. BOTTOM LINE: works better than the actual video baby monitors I’ve used, but still not perfect and the company says it’s not meant to be used in this capacity. I still haven’t found an ideal video baby monitor. 😞","Works ok but not great, problems with connectivity"

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jun 2017,TMB,"We got the Indoor security camera after first buying the Outdoor camera and using it for a couple of weeks. Both worked brilliantly. I knew anytime someone was around my front door or when my dogs were up to anything. The images are really nice. The only funky thing we've noticed is that you can make it through the front door and entry without the camera picking up an image, if you're quick enough (without even trying). The alerts worked so well and we liked all of the options with the trial period so much that we bought the subscription after only a few days of the trial expiring because we missed the alerts and - to be honest - knowing when our puppies were up and about with video clips. Also, my husband comes home to the pups lunch and I would get the alert and chat with him and the pups. I knew when my husband and daughter got home and could have a quick chat using the microphone. It made being gone all day a little easier. Unfortunately, once we actually paid for a year of service... we get zero alerts. All the things I loved about the trial, don't work. I mean, I can see the images when my dogs move, but I have to go into it to see if anything's going on. I get ZERO alerts now. We've reset them. We've changed and tweaked every setting. Nothing matters. To be fair, I do see the video clips when I go into Nest to look at them, I just don't get a single alert when something happens to create those clips. Why does it matter? Here's why - We got it because we ""crate"" our dogs, otherwise, one of our dogs can be incredibly destructive. The pups are very happy to have their treat and be crated, but our little one disagrees with the whole mess and is pretty clever about busting them all out on occasion. When he does that, my husband can switch his day around and come home to re-crate them. Our dog has cost us hundreds of dollars of damage - not to mention the crap she'll eat if she's unsupervised. Without alerts, I have no way of knowing when my escape artist busts them out. One last complaint: During the trial, I set the cameras to go on and off as needed using their different options when using the trial - they all worked. My favorite was the Home/Away feature. If you're home, the cameras turn off. It wasn't perfect, even on the trial, but now that we've paid, they either go off and stay off or never turn off. I'll wake up at 5am and realize I'm staring into a live camera. My cameras were $199 each and if they worked as well as it did during the trial, I'd be okay with the subscription price. But honestly - I will think twice about spending another $100/$150+ to renew the subscriptions. Without the subscription the cameras still work and you can go in and see live, but it only takes snapshots with movement. Summary: The cameras work great - subscription - not so much. (Full disclosure: I haven't contacted customer service, yet) **Edit: My notifications were set for push notifications without mail notifications. After playing with it - I turned mail notifications back on and suddenly the push notifications are working again. Clearly this is bugged, but at least it's a way to turn it back on. - changed from 3 to 4 stars since it's working - even if notifications are buggy. Also - the ""Home Away"" part - rarely works. Which is why we turned off the email portion to begin with. We've come up with a solution that works for us - M-F we're sort of set hours - on the weekends - we just turn it off and on as needed. I wish the Home Away worked as advertised.",Excellent Camera - Overpriced Subscription that doesn't work as advertised**

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2015,D. Stamatis,"I wasted hours trying to connect my 2 Nest Cams to my Nest account. After almost 2 hours, and 2 phone calls, to Nest's customer service, they escalated me to their advanced tech support. We exhausted every possible cause. Finally, he mentioned that Nest Cams have problems connecting to tri-band routers, and asked me what kind of router I had. I said the D-Link AC3200... a tri-band router! He casually explained that Nest never tested their cameras using tri-band routers, like the D-Link AC3200 or the Nighthawk. I was shocked by his admission. He said the only reliable way for Nest Cam to connect to a tri-band router is if the router has a separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz network (rather than having the router auto-manage both frequencies under the same network name). But now that I think about it, something doesn't smell right, because even if that were true, why wasn't the camera's WiFi scan able to detect OTHER networks on my street? Clearly something's goofy with Nest Cam's internal WiFi's firmware... beyond just the tri-band issue. Anyway, after a lot of headaches, one cam allowed me to manually enter my network and password, and the other cam (after many error messages) finally managed to show a list of networks and allowed me to select mine and log into it. So, both cams are finally running, but not without a lot of effort. The software is also very user-friendly, allowing you to easily navigate back and forth between your 10-30 days of footage, by highlighting only the parts of the timeline that had activity. Very useful. In the end, though, I decided to return the cameras for a refund, as they consumed way too much of my Comcast/Xfinity monthly bandwidth. A nice interface and good video quality mean little if they'll cause your to exceed your monthly bandwidth limits. Hope this helps someone.",Nest Cam has problems with Tri-Band routers

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jun 2017,Matt Eland,"The good: Quick setup (though significant bugs encountered that Nest seemed to not be interested in learning more about), auto switch to IR mode, 1080p quality is nice. Microphone and speaker features. Off-site storage. Very simple. The bad: During setup, Nest automatically activated a free trial of their Nest Aware for two of the three cameras, leaving the third without video history. I attempted to purchase a year subscription for this service and Nest made that subscription not activate until after the free trials they issued for the other two cameras expired, effectively leaving me with a large gap in coverage regardless of paying them on a yearly basis. Support was prompt but ultimately not very helpful and promised to make a request to get a trial added to fix the issue, though this could take a week. They also appeared to be looking for ways of blaming the user for the defect. There's no way of setting a schedule to have the cameras on but only alerting during certain hours or when I'm not home (though you can have it only alert when you're not at home and you can completely disable the cameras during certain hours). Ultimately, the configurability options are lacking. These cameras are going to be bandwidth hogs. Make sure your router is up to the task. All video storage is handled via Nest and not available locally. If you want history, be prepared to pay $200 / yearly for all three cameras (total). Their web viewer warns you that Chrome on Windows is not supported. How long have you guys been up and you don't technically support Chrome for Windows? Seriously? Bottom line: You're probably better off with another vendor, though the setup is easy (if buggy)","Decent cameras, poor support, buggy software, and bad customer experience, plus $200 / year fees."

First off the item I received was not a retail version. Meaning no warranty if you don't get it installed by a Nest cam pro which can cost 100s of dollars. No worries I thought I would reach out to customer service ( 01840307 ) , I am 4 emails deep and takes 24-48 hours for a response. First response was, we don't have a pro version. There tech support doesn't even know the product. Fair enough maybe they outsource no biggie, I sent photos to clarify. Second response, oh don't worry its just as easy to install. I than responded saying my original question was about the warranty. NO RESPONSE. Followed up with them again. NO RESPONSE. Call them, ON HOLD FOR HOURS. I did a lot of research on the product before I purchased and based it on everything I learned about DropCam. But now that is Nest, everything you read doesn't apply. I should have took the time to read the negative reviews, I was just overly excited about making the purchase.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Sep 2015,E. Garcia,"Right so.  This is a camera for monitoring your home or office. The Nest Cam connects to the Internet via WiFi, so if you want to use it, you need to have Wireless Internet to hook it into.  And yes, Internet access is REQUIRED. No, you can't just hook it into your local area network and monitor it that way.  It uses the Internet connection to sync up to Nest's (aka Google's) servers.  Those servers then server your video to you over the Nest App. Yes, you not only MUST have Internet for this to work, you must also use their app on your iPhone or Android phone. All that aside, the camera itself will give you an image from 360 pixels tall to 1080 tall. The camera also features: - Mic & speaker - so you can listen in and talk to folks through the camera - Night vision - so you can watch what's happening even at night - Digital zoom - just pinch to zoom on your phone While the camera is powered via USB, don't think that you can hook it into your computer and use it that way... cuz that doesn't work either. The camera gets warm, but not overly hot. Now, the app:  The app gets 3 stars.  It takes FOREVER to initialize, FOREVER to find the Nest Cam, and is more finicky than a spoiled cat.  It drops signal for no apparent reason.  Oh, and worse:  If I get a notification that the camera picked up sound or movement and I don't check immediately: it won't load.  I then have to go to the live feed and search back to see the event. Worse of all: if you want to keep more than 12 hours of footage, you need to subscribe their service for $100 a year.  That's not too bad of a subscription fee, but be sure to add it to the cost of the device when considering it. I love the camera, but I'm not a fan of the app.  Maybe someone will find a way to make it work locally.","Great camera, lousy [required] app."

Frustrating that the computer based setup was a fail, but was able to get it going mobile.  I have an older Dropcam which means I have Dropcam app on my phone which won't work with the new NestCam.  Needed to download new Nest app and then was able to setup via phone.  May be a corner case but would it be that hard for Nest to upgrade Dropcam customers to the new software or tell them they need to in the new Nest Cam setup?  Regardless, it works and seems to be good - time will tell.  (and hey NestCam, how about an outdoor version, pan and tilt and POE???) Get acquired by Nest / Google - go straight into the toilet.  I have another Dropcam so know how this works, but this one won't even set up.  I'll try to call Nest support but given that their only upgrade to this camera in over ~18 months is to make it 1080p (yippee! how about outdoor or tilt/pan or POE????) and they can' even make that work, I don't hold out a lot of hope.

This one by far surpasses the Vimtag.  One feature in particular has made this purchase a better choice an that is that you have the ability to turn it on and off without having to remove the power chord!  The audio and picture is also far superior than the Vimtag and there's no competing with the size.  While Nest does offer a subscription service to record and keep the data on their cloud server it is not a requirement. There is about a 5-10 second delay but other than that I highly recommend.,Love my new Nest!

But in the midst of this upgrade, there was a huge change (from ""Dropcam"" to ""Nest Cam""). Mostly positive as it integrates with your nest thermostats (I have 3 nest thermostats and 5 dropcams). But the only negative I would say is that in the midst of the upgrade, some functionalities were lost. For example, ""sharing"" video. I ""share"" the videos from my office to my personal account so I can see everything. Now theres no way to share or view other videos (PLEASE FIX THIS!!!). A second one is that the old ""Dropcam"" app can't view videos from new ""NestCam"" and you're basically forced to use ""Nest"" cam. So its a bit of a mess right now until they fix this. Also, this isn't much of a negative, but the NestCam and its 1080 resolution has a slightly wider angle and so, while the viewing area increased dramatically, due to the wide angle, you won't see a huge increase in the resolution, on, say, a person's face. Lastly, for the users who plan on using multiple cameras, plan your bandwidth carefully. On normal dsl/cable connections, anything more than 2 cameras will tax your system (on the upload part). If you don't upgrade your internet, the nest cam will ""downcovert"" and upload low res videos (even tho you might be at 1080). I've had to upgrade my cable connection, which is basically a hidden $20-30/mo cost. But either way, $50-100/yr nest cloud service is pretty good deal.",Decent upgrade from Dropcam but have some shortcomings.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2016,Ming,"I must say I am disappointment with this considering the price and the reviews it received. The camera quality is good and the picture quality is also very good. It maintains good contact and speed with my wireless router, whereas previous cameras I tried did not. The set-up was very easy including the mounting hardware, which is very good and the software, which took only a few minutes. The microphone works OK, which is better than I expected given other cameras I have used. What has caused me to rate it three stars is the software. First, there is no way to schedule the detection zones to be active during certain times and not active during others. For example, I only need them to be active when the business is closed, not while it is open. Therefore, I must activate and deactivate them manually each day, which is a pain. Second there is no way to share access with only certain people without giving them complete access to my Nest account (e.g. my username and password). The problem with this is that if they accidentally change a setting, etc, it will cause me grief. The only way to share it without giving away my account password is to share it with the whole world. Really? Nest could not imagine a scenario where you would want to share access with someone else and not the whole world? How about sharing access with my wife or parents so they can access when we are away? Overall, I am disappointment with this product. Given the accolades in the press and review, the software, although reliable and easy to use, is lacking common sense features that limit it's usefulness. For the premium price of this product, I expected more. UPDATE: The new/improved Nest Aware function isn't very helpful. What is need is a function that allows one to schedule alerts AND that is INDEPENDENT of the Nest Aware/Home Away function. For example, I want to only receive alerts between 9PM and 8AM, independently of me being home or away. This is pretty basic. Why not just add it.",A good camera that suffers from lack of basic software features.

The design is so sleek and cool.... It is really easy to setup and I love being able to check in on my house when I am at work.  I already had the app on my iPhone as I have the thermostat so it was simple to add a second product.  Now when I open the app a picture of the room shows up on the homepage!  You can zoom in on the image and talk through it.  They have a cloud service that you can subscribe to to backup your videos so that you can go back and review what happened in you house for weeks! The bummer is that the subscription is PER CAMERA so if you have a few of these in your house your monthly cloud backup fee can get expensive quickly!!!  I wish there was another way to hook the camera up to a backup device like an external hard drive.... It broadcasts at both 720p & 1080p .... but you need to have very fast internet to use the 1080p feature.  Oh it also has night vision camera!!!  which is cool....

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2016,Tri,"UPDATE: Moved from 4 stars down to 1.  After 1 month of registering this sweet security camera, it went from us being able to view up to 12 hours of history to none.  So, WARNING:  If you're looking for a camera you can access while you're away to see ""live"" footage, get this!  If you're looking for a camera to record movement and keep history (even if it was seconds or hours ago), be prepared to spend $100/year to have ANY history.  This may have been mentioned in the description when we bought it and I overlooked it.  I was okay having just the past 12 hours of history when I set this up.  I'm not ok paying more money to be able to see history and wouldn't have purchased this for $195. Original post: Many of my family members have this at their homes (and 2nd homes, rental properties).  They all love it! I wanted something that could provide a little more piece of mind to the coming and goings in our neighborhood.  While this is ok, I wish the quality was a little bit better.  For example, I can see a white truck drive by, however, wouldn't be able to see the license place or know if it's a Ford, Chevy, Toyota, unless I knew the body shape was a Ford (for example).  We have the camera in the window. Therefore, at night, there is a reflection of the light against the glass, so all we see is headlights of a car when it drives through. Nothing else. We don't have the option of placing it outside, but may need to look into placing it somewhere else, so we can have more peace of mind at night.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Aug 2017,Paul,"Canary is better.  After the 30-day trial of nest aware, these cameras turn into live-feed only cameras, with crummy snapshots that do not necessarily capture the person or event that triggered the motion, rendering the photo useless.  What's worse, the snapshots only go back to midnight from that particular calendar day -- it's not a trailing 24-hour feed of snapshots.  So, for example, if you wake up at 6 am, you will only have 6 hours of (potentially useless) snapshots.  You will not have access to anything that happened before midnight, say at 11 p.m.  You'll have to pay $10/mo if you want to see any video history whatsoever. Canary offers a subscription-free trailing 24-hour video clip feed.  I started with Canary, and mistakenly thought Nest would offer a similar feed access.  I bought these Nest cameras because I like my Nest thermostat and wanted to transition more to Nest.  I now have 3 Nest cams and 1 Canary camera, and the Canary cam is the only one that's useful to me now because I am not interested in signing up for a recurring monthly plan/fee per camera for any of these. Also, two of the Nest cams work fine, one keeps disconnecting and going offline.  I have tested this with Nest support, and I have plugged all three Nest cameras in next to one another directly next to the router, and not sure why the one cam keeps going down. I wish I would have realized how useless these cams are without a paid subscription while there was time to return them.  I'm sticking with Canary moving forward. @Nest, stick to thermostats.",Canary is better. After the 30-day trial of nest aware

She cannot answer the telephone by herself anymore and I wanted to be able to check on her. The camera is very good. I can zoom in on her face and the picture is good enough for me to be able to tell how she is doing -- at least in a general sense. Today, for example, I saw what I thought was a bruise on mom's arm. A quick call to the nurse got mom an ice bag and some TLC in short order. We use the walkie-talkie feature, sometimes multiple times a day. The speaker / microphone is surprisingly good. I can easily hear her and be heard by her, even over moderate ambient sound levels that include an oxygen concentrator and hallway noise from the nursing home. My sisters, who live out of town, also check on her frequently and interact with her. We all have much more interaction with her and can share our lives more easily. It is good to be able to SEE her -- especially for my sister living out of country. My mom feels much more connected, and this device combined with her new Alexa/Echo, have substantially increased her quality of life. And her mood. Every time I contact her she has a new joke to tell (or two). Way to go, Amazon and Nest! There is a bit of delay in transmission sometimes, which can complicate the walkie-talkie feature. We have started saying ""out"" when we are ready to listen. That has prevented us from talking over each other. A great suggestion from my sister. Overall, extremely satisfied -- and looking forward to future improvements in technology that make interacting even easier...",A Nest in every nursing home room...

Recently moved into a new apartment, and decided to get a Nest Cam.  I ended up returning it though, because Nest removed a few features that were critical for me.  Here's my review. The Good -Sleek new hardware design -Similarly sleek new Nest website and iPhone app The Bad -Confusing, redundant UI's.  There's the new Nest website and iPhone app, and there's also (still) the old Dropcam website and iPhone app.  Why both?  Finish the transition already!  Get rid of the old one.  It only causes confusion -Notifications are unreliable.  I setup my new Nest Cam in my living room, waved my arms around like a lunatic, but didn't immediately get a notification on my phone or via e-mail.  That's kind of important.  I don't want a burglar to have a 10 minute head start. -Oh, and e-mail notifications... they dropped that feature!  Whaaaat, right???? -Another feature they dropped, the one where you could choose to have the camera turn off automatically when you're around.  Now, you have to MANUALLY turn it on/off.  What year is this?  1992?  Ain't nobody got time for that!! Nest, you made a great piece of hardware, and a great sleek new website and iPhone app, but you RUINED it by removing some critical features, and failing on the simple things (like sending immediate notifications).",Useless

They are easy to setup.  The picture quality is generally good.  One camera (the one closest to the router) did drop off line several times for no apparent reason.  We received many false alerts from the camera facing outside even though we had almost eliminated the alert zone and had it placed on an area with no bushes and turned off the sound feature.  This is close to being a good product except for two features; one being the alerts can not be fine tuned enough so that passing clouds/changes in light cause alerts and most importantly the cost for cloud storage is outrageous!  The cameras do not have SD card slots or provide for any other type of storage unless you use their very expensive cloud storage.  There are many other cameras out there that either use an SD card, have limited free cloud storage, or use a recording device via WIFI.  We returned these cameras because of the average picture quality, the false alerts and mainly because of the cost of storage, which is absolutely needed if there is a break-in.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Dec 2016,Erin Eldrenkamp,"We absolutely love this camera. We currently use it as a baby monitor and the talk function as well as the night vision are key features for that. The motion and sound alerts are perfect too. It is a little more expensive than what you would pay for an actual baby monitor that would accomplish the same task, however, I've gone though many monitors and they all either don't work properly or stop working after a month or won't connect. The only problem I've had with this camera is the fact that sometimes the night vision will not click over entirely. The lights turn on and you will audibly hear the click, but the photo sensor does not change over, which leaves the view pitch black.  I looked all over for ways to fix the issue, watched videos from other owners, etc and the only remedy is to unplug the camera. This is difficult bc our camera is plugged in behind the crib, which would disturb our sleeping baby. I have been extremely frustrated with this and almost returned the camera bc of this issue. * I did come up with a remote fix... we have the camera plugged into a smart plug that I can control remotely with my phone. If we have the issue, I'll power off the plug, which essentially unplugs the camera. Powering back on, after a few minutes, the night vision will work again. Even though I have found a fix, this is an extremely common issue that needs to be fixed asap.",Just one issue...

As usual with nest products the packaging was very neat and everything was in its own place. The setup, once unbound, took almost second (I used the qr code on the back with the Google goggles app).  The video quality is great though there isn't a huge difference between 720 and 1080. What is impressive about the video is the ability to zoom and enhance the picture, which works almost like those amazing hackers on TV crime shows. The distance that the camera picks up sound from is amazing, while quiet, I could hear a conversation from at least 40 ft away and then another 10 ft around a corner. The motion detection zone ser-up is really neat, works exactly like it should, and is easy to set-up. My one and only complaint about the nest cam is that (as far as I can tell) you can schedule when the camera will turn off and on but that you can't have the camera on all of the time and only schedule when to receiver alerts. I'm using mine now as a surveillance/security camera in a retail space. Surveillance during hours and security after so the camera needs to be on all the time but I don't need an alert during hours. Sure I could manually set the camera not to send me alerts to my email/tablet/phone when it detects motion or sound and then reconfigure it again later but it seems like a hassle for something that, in my opinion, could easily be added to the software. Again, though, the camera is definitely worth the money, the set-up was super easy, and I'm extremely impressed and satisfied with this product!",This camera is great!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2015,deerock,"Let me clarify my 1 star review - when it was a Dropcam product and corresponding App, it was 5 stars and I would have rated it higher!  But now that it is owned by Nest, it is just tortuous at best.  I would have expected Nest to do things well especially since they have such great products over the years, but they seemed to have put their C-team on this product.  The camera is now just plain crap.  When it works, it's a miracle.  Then there is the App - wow did they mess this up.  It's probably the worst app for an iPhone - period.  No joke.  I am thoroughly disappointed and will move on to the new Arlo system in January, plus I won't have to pay for the overpriced subscriptions anymore.  Wait for the newest Arlo coming out January 29th, don't buy this POS. update:  Nest commented that they 'are here 24/7 for support'.  This might be true, but getting anybody that knows what they are doing on the phone as well as actually completing request(s)...is a minor miracle like I said above.  I have also had so many problems with a NEST Thermostat and never received any concrete answers, so it's sitting in a box in the closet for a long time now.  I'm really glad that the Dropcam people made some $ from the Nest buyout, but with that I'm sorry to say I'm done with Nest as a company as soon as it is convenient to move to something else.","When it was Dropcam, It was awesome!

Just got off a chat with Nest and basically... The Cam won't work with any extender despite them showing 'solutions' in their FAQs. Wish I had known this (and wish their FAQs wouldn't make you think it should work) since I wouldn't have gotten the cams under those circumstances. Also, I wouldn't have spent hours on trying to make it work. Here's the chat: Nest: Thank you for holding for me. In this case, unfortunately the camera would not be supported on an extended connection. One thing that was recommended was to try moving the router closer to the camera itself and then using the extender for the other areas of your network if they are working with that device. It is unfortunate, but that Nest Cam requires a fairly fast and very steady connection, which cannot be supplied by that extender. Me: Do you have a list of extenders that would work with the cam? Nest: I do not, that was what brought about the answer of the Nest Cam will not work with extenders. I had hoped to check yours against a list of incompatible units, but was told they are all incompatible units. Me: So the Nest Cam won't work with any extender at all? Nest: That is correct. Me: Wow. Ok. That is a bummer. Thank you. Nest: I agree, and I do apologize again. I will pass this case up to our engineers, I am quite certain others have wanted to do as you are doing now. Nest: The more information we can get the better for changing things like this. Nest: Did you have any other questions? Me: Nope, that's it. Would've been great to read about this online or in the handbook or anywhere. Would've saved me a lot of time. Nest: I do apologize again and you are right. I will add that notation as well.",Won't work with any WiFi extenders Nest says!!!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 May 2016,HealthIT,"Another case of ""you get what you pay for"".  This truly is the best of the best.  It actually needs 4.9 stars... because for $200 frickin dollars, you'd expect the ability to move the camera (motorized).  This, in my view, it its only flaw. I've used several cameras, the $30 HooToo with overly complicated setup, the $110 Amcrest, hope their servers are up so you can view your camera remotely, and the Nest.  The nest is by far the easiest setup, great picture, great response.  I can get App notifications of motion or sound.  For viewing outside, I have one in an upstairs room and leave on my porchlight and it looks great. While it's not motorized, it has a panoramic view that sees way more of a viewing angle than you'd expect.  While viewing, you can zoom in and focus on an area. I've tried several options: android phones with free webcam apps, Hootoos with my own local storage option, Amcrest with their hit-or-miss servers, and the Nest.  It's really the best of the best.  Plug it in, scan the code, done.  The online storage is on par with most services. It's expensive.  But you're getting a durable, high-quality, best of the best, camera.

But, if you're like me and just want to check in on your home (dog) when you're at work (9am-5pm) scheduling the camera to automatically turn on is infuriating (1 star). Why? The UI has you schedule it to turn on from the day prior and then shut off that day. Completely un-intuitive and there's not an option to simply not record some days. It completely befuddles me and they should fire whichever UX Designer signed off on this. So, I'll be unplugging the camera every day and plugging it back in before I go which is exactly what Nest says not to do. (And I'm going to unplug it right now.)",Absolutely. Infuriating.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Sep 2016,New York,"Easy setup, means that you really do not need technical knowledge to set it up. I only had to consider purchasing an additional 6 feet USB 3.0 cable male to female as an extension (6-7-8$), because the 10 feet USB cable provided in the box for electricity was about 4 feet short to reach my outlet. And I am using it with Windows 10. For setup, I only had to download the app for Windows to set it up. BUT the Windows app only works with Windows LAPTOP, because Edge has Adobe Flash preinstalled. But Nest does not offer (yet) app for Windows 10 phones. At least not yet. I hope they are working on it! So, on the phone in order to see the camera I could have go to the online (browser) to view the Nest camera, but Windows 10 mobile does not have Adobe Flash installed because Adobe does not support it. So, on the phone I am using the DropCam Pro app, which is quite good, but it does not provide microphone for me to speak into the place of the camera, when I am looking at the camera view while away. And also, it alerts me about 15 minutes after the event, which is quite late. On the other hand the Nest alert from the camera via the clouds arrives very quick, in about 30 seconds, or maybe 1 minute in worst case. So, in total I get alerts for the same event twice: from the Nest cloud, directly from the Nest camera via clouds very quick, and also from the phone app (DropCam Pro) about 15 minutes later. I really wish Nest would offer an app for Windows 10 phones too, which could be synchronized with the cloud system of camera. All in all, I love the camera, and I already purchased a second. And, I almost forgot, the web based Nest app for the camera is really great. This is where you see it's value (beyond alerting). You can easily, see LIVE view, and to preview the history; and you can see on the time line where activities took place, and then to make your own video, save it online onto your Nest account on the web which will remain there even after your 10/30 days subscription, or download it into your computer. Usually these are not big files, mp4 format and less than 4MByte, so easy to store it on your computer too. I hope you found my experience helpful. Enjoy it!",Really ease of use and alerts you very quick

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Dec 2016,Sidewinder,"This camera wasn't even under consideration in the past due to the subscription based cloud storage but bought it due to the new 3 hours of history that was advertised.  Come to find out this is only movement triggered snapshots and no video.  Even worse, snapshots are very low resolution and can only be viewed in the app in portrait mode with both sides cutoff.  So what you end up with is grainy picture with a very narrow field of view which is basically useless.  I mean really??? They can offer unlimited history for free and it would still be useless..  Granted live streaming is nice but thats not why I bought this camera.  This is like those inkjet printer deals where you pay for the printer then have to shell out $$$ on ink.  At least with inkjets you can use generic ink but with Nest you have no options.  I have no complaints about the hardware but subscription and useless free timeline history kills the deal for me. I have since sold this camera and now trying out Canary which seems promising so far.  Canary recently increased the free cloud storage from 12 hours to 24 hours and now offers unlimited downloads of actual videos clips unlike useless stills on Nest.","Even worse, snapshots are very low resolution and can only ..."

The Dropcam app main screen was a four camera split view, so you could watch multiple cameras or click the one you want to see. I bought a second camera.  But Dropcam is now owned by Nest so it's a Nest Cam.  And it uses the Nest app.  The Dropcam app doesn't work with it. So I downloaded the Nest app.  And since Nest is more than just cameras they decided to make the app pretty instead of useful.  The main screen shows both cameras in little circles, about the size of a nickel on an iPad.  There is no split view for cameras.  Most of the screen is a fancy moving background simulating your local weather conditions. So don't buy this camera.

I loved it so much on day one I ordered two more. The subscription however will most likely result in me moving on to another product and company while ridding myself of the nest cameras. The camera itself is great. Sturdy metal with a strong magnetic base. The camera does run hot,  all three of mine measure around the 102 degree area on a regular day. The picture is very nice. The nightvision is extremely clear as is the day picture.  The mic feature also works well, I am able to easily communicate commands to my dogs when im not home which is a great tool. The app is also great. I use the ios version both on my iphone and ipad. It is simple clear and very easy to use. Perfect for an app,  no slogging through teirs of menus, very well designed app. Set up was extremely easy. Unbox, make a free account, scan cameras, imput wifi, all set.  In three months i have not had a single issue with connectivity.  Those are the positives and they are strong like I said I really like this camera a lot. Then there is the subscription service.  Ridiculous. My free trial expired and i wanted to test the cameras as stand alone items and in my opinion they are almost useless.  Without the Nest Aware service the cameras wont even let you rewind a few hours of time.  This becomes hilarious when a camera pings my phone with a motion notice and I turn the app on and and watch an empty room.  Without even a basic sixty second replay function by the time I open the app most motion has passed and I have no ability to check what it was.  The app offers absolutly no control without a subscription. Simply 100% realtime scene no slight replay no way to check a recent notification at all. Now I purchased this camera prepared to buy a subscription.  I understand Nest needs to keep its cloud floating if you will and I was willing to pay the monthly fee for the 10 day plan. What I did not realize is the monthly plan winds up being per camera!  Nest offers a token discount for multiple cameras but if you have any intention of using multiple cameras do some quick math the yearly fees will quickly add up to hundreds of dollars.  In the end I was planning on four camers with the 10 day subscription but finding out that each camera needs its own plan and that in total I would pay a 300 dollars a year for their cheapest monthly plan I could not condone that subscription fee.  Unfortunately I will move on to a different company with hardware I'm less impressed by but whose service is not so suffocating.",Great hardware ridiculous subscription.

I have to say, with the latest application updates the nest app has gotten a lot better, I am not having any issues with streaming quality any more and the app is becoming more feature-rich with each new release.  I still think the home screen should have bigger camera views but other than that most of my original complaints below have been solved!  Keep up the great work Nest! Original Review: So much potential! I have had 2 dropcam pros for 2 years that were working great, I mostly used the old dropcam app because I could see bigger previews of what was going on and they streamed smoothly.  I have very fast bandwidth (5 MB up/30 MB down) and both cameras are set at 720p.  When I added the new nest cam a few days ago (also set to 720p) I now have to use the new nest app and it is constantly crashing and telling me I don't have enough bandwidth, despite the old dropcam app working fine with my old cameras and very high speedtests.  I should have just bought another dropcam pro but even then they wont let me setup new cameras with the old app that works. Nest/Google: I sent this on your survey and the product forum: Please make the camera previews (the tiny round pictures) bigger rectangles (leave the protect and thermostat ones as little round ones at the top), fix the streaming in the app/bandwidth issues and fix the streaming warnings.  I was one of the biggest nest promoters, I got my brother and my father in law and 2 friends to buy one, not so much any more....","New: Great product!

I finally decided to purchased the Nest Cam and Nest Outdoor Cam at the same time This is my first experience with WIFI cameras. Overall the setup was flawless. I had both cameras setup and functional within 10 minutes. I’d recommend setting up the Outdoor Cam near your WIFI router before taking it outside. Once setup easy to place and make operational , seems to have good day and night video on both cameras. I do worry the Nest Outdoor is an target for theft . There isn’t any way to secure the camera to the base. The Outdoor is running on 40% WIFI signal strength the doesn’t miss a beat. The recording zones Nest needs a lot of improvement… outside zones are triggered from light shadows from cars driving by and by light changes from shadows, even though the camera is not facing the street pointed at my front door, it sends email alerts when my porch light turns on each night and random as passing. I use Wemo to turn off the lights, using wemo schedules, you would thing these two items could alert each other. My Nest Cam inside the house has the same failure, the camera zone triggers alerts when the room is dark and a light is turned on by wemo . The inside camera is not facing the light I’ve tried moving and reshaping the zones. To no success.. I shouldn’t have to work this hard for lights turning on. Out of frustration I’ve deleted all zones. Which leads me to trying to rationalize the value of recording if the zone performance is this bad, when I called nest their input is move the cameras and after a long conversation I hear this is a common complaint ..my plan has been to install 2 more cameras. I’ve nixed that idea Nest is a long way from solving these zones and I’m concerned Nest will address it the same as the wave off function on my 6 nest protects. Last Nest needs to address the cost of recording. I'm considering sending the cameras back.",Cameras work great.. Zone feature is not as good as expected

All of them have stopped sending motion notifications. In most cases they reported motion for a while although my most recent unit only reported motion for about 10 days before stopping. As reported here in other posts, my units self select ""Activity not in a Zone"" randomly although It doesn't really matter when the units aren't reporting any motion in any zone. I have had some success with getting the reporting going again with a hard reset of the camera however this is not practical as my cameras are geographically dispersed by hundreds of miles. If the software would allow a remote reboot it would help, a reliable product would be even better. Tech support is pretty bad. After wading through several time wasters who clearly had no technical skills other than repeating back your questions, I finally got to the ""head"" of technical support who wasn't even familier with their own app on an iOS platform. I spent my career in IT and it is becoming impossible to find technical expertise on a technical support line. This is my experience with Nest support.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 May 2017,JP,"We bought 2 sets of these cameras to install inside our home. We recently had to hire a nanny for a few months to take care of our boys during the day,so we needed something to help us keep an eye on them. I've found that I use it for much more than that. For example, recording an impromptu dance party, finding out what made our blinds fall off the wall (gravity I guess), and for helping me check on the boys at night without getting out of bed. It also allows me to find my wife when she doesn't have her phone near her. I was once at the store ready to check out when I called her to make sure she didn't need anything. She didn't answer so I checked the Nests and saw her in the kitchen making something on the stove. I activated the voice through and told her to get her phone. I'm glad I did because she was making tacos and ran out of seasoning. Nest cam with the HUGE SAVE!! I love the ability to record for 30 days, but am not sure if I will keep that option for all 6 cameras. Since the Nest cameras only record when there is movement, I can quickly scroll back to see when someone got out of bed, got home, or did something specific in that sector. I also love how ""secure"" our home is now because I can set alerts for movement when I'm away. We also plan on bringing one or two when we travel so we can keep an eye on napping kids, the pool area, or whatever we need to keep an eye on. The website works best on Internet Explorer, but it can be glitchy. I leave it on at work sometimes so I can see what my boys are up to but sometimes it's very laggy. It's fairly easy to go back to specific events and record them. I upload them to Youtube and share them with friends and family. One of the best reasons to buy these for Amazon is their AMAZING customer service. One of my cameras was having malfunctions with the night vision. At night, you can clearly see the red glow of the IR lasers, but one camera would not work. I called customer service at 9:30 pm and by 9:45, the problem was (mostly) solved. They ended up sending me another 3 pack from which I simply took out one camera, and replaced it with the malfunctioning one. Then I packed it in a box, used the free return label they sent me and dropped it at the local mail store. Awesome job Amazon customer service! In the future, I plan to add to our cameras with at least 2 outdoor cameras. I am NOT saying these are a substitute for direct supervision, but I can't watch my son on the swing every second. I like knowing that I can run inside for a few minutes to check on dinner or grab something but still have an ""eye"" on him. We also get a lot of wildlife in our area so it will be cool to share those moments with my sons. In summary - FIVE STARS for Nest cameras. My only wish is that they could bring down the price of the Nest Aware program. 6 indoor and (in the future) 2 outdoor cameras would be a lot to keep up with on top of our other security system fees.",Great cameras - Endless uses
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Oct 2015,SinnerForgivn,"I actually ended up returning the camera.  One of the biggest selling points for me was that it could track my location, so it would know when I left my house and automatically turn on (and automatically turn off when I came home).  Apparently that's not the case - it's a feature that's been disabled from Nest.  In addition, I found that the camera wasn't working too well.  I had it propped up in an area where there was plenty of air getting to it (as I'd heard that they can get a bit hot) but even still I got the spinning disc nine times out of ten when I tried to open the app.  Then, on top of that, the camera wouldn't automatically switch from regular mode to night vision.  I'd actually have to turn the camera off and then turn it back on for the switch to occur. While it seemed like a good investment at the time I quickly realized that it was a very expensive gadget ($199) that still has way too many bugs to actually be worthwhile.  If it doesn't work on its own and I have to manually reset it, it's definitely not worth the cash.",Fan of Nest products - not a fan of this camera

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Mar 2017,JimConsumer,"I bought this Nest Cam when I knew I was going to be out of my house for an extended period of time. Generally the Nest Cam works well. The images it captures are decent, although I'm not sure if they are crisp enough for identifying someone if I have a break-in. I have set the camera up so that it only records when I am away, using my cell phone to trigger the away event. That has worked well. I also have it send me alerts when the camera detects movements while I'm away: I get a few false positives from the camera when evening lights (on a timer) come on, or light in the house changes as the day goes by. Still, I appreciate the vigilance, and it doesn't happen often. After the initial 30-day trial of Nest Aware (their cloud based video storage) I did opt to pay the $100/yr fee for storage of a 10-day history. I don't like paying an extra fee, but it is quite convenient and I fell necessary in case there is a security incident that needs capturing. As for the mobile app and web site, they work quite well and it's easy to monitor the house while I'm away. I would recommend this camera.","Easy install, easy to use, great app and web site"

I had tried a brand that I ordered on line that was ""compared to"" Nest but I never could get it set up with my internet.  This literally takes 2 minutes for set up - it is truly that easy.  I wish instead of a white cord that comes with it, it included a black cord.  There may be one you can buy to switch out.  If setting up to where it isn't seen you can make it to where the light doesn't come on with movement which is nice.  I love being able to see what my animals are up to when I'm not home and also if someone is dog sitting, making sure they are being taken care of.  The price on Amazon is much better than at the retail store that I've found.  Lowes was the highest but Home Depot was significantly lower - however Amazon had the best price.  Originally set this up for a family member and then got these off of Amazon for myself.  Very pleased.  Also want to add.....  (the company may not like me adding this - but one of my cameras got thrown in the toilet.  Was in the toilet all night long.  When I realized it the next day I got it out and cleaned it up and just let it dry.  About a week later I hooked it up to see if it worked and it works like a charm.  I know it's not water proof and its not made for outside unless you have a case for it - but I was blown away that it still worked after that!!  Love my nest cameras...  PS...

The false alerts are ridiculous. Do not buy this product!!! There is no way to adjust sensitivity to light levels. If a light on a timer comes on or goes off ... boom ... a false alert. If someone approaches your front door where you have a light with a motion sensor ... boom ... a false alert. I've tried everything I can think of to stop the false alerts ... but the Nest product is just dumb. I had a security camera from TrendNet that eventually failed after 6 years and I mistakenly replaced it with the much more expensive Nest ... but the Nest just doesn't work as well. Unfortunately I also got a Nest thermostat as a gift and it's equally dumb ... it doesn't support basic features like a ""hold"" function ... or more than one schedule. The Nest company (now Google) are just arrogant. They simply don't listen to customers.

Ribar,"We have three of these cameras now - replacing our foscam cameras slowly.  A couple of things that differentiate the two solutions: Nest is so very easy to setup... my Mom could do it.  No more adjusting rules in your firewall, adding dynamic DNS, and all of that jazz.  Just scan the QR code, put in your wireless password and you're running. 3 minutes tops. Second big thing is that the image quality is amazing.  To me it looks like the fish-eye super wide angle look of a go-pro. Simply amazing. We have one camera in our kitchen with alert zones set on the refrigerator door, and the door to the lanai.  One of the kids touches wither thing and we get an alert. Very cool.  We also subscribed to the 10 day video storage. Most people don't know that the price drops in half when you add the second (and other) cameras. We're getting rid of camcloud that we were using on the foscams that wasn't as cool. Good luck.  These things rock.",Way easier than foscams and much better quality video.

While I'm pleased with the quality of the hardware, the software app's zoom and enhance image features (a must) need to be more intuitive. And yes, the Nest Aware Subscription banner is a constant distraction. While the live feed is great for watching events in real time, the cameras are worthless as a security device without the Nest Aware Subscription. You'd literally need to check your timeline every 3 hours to catch critical events and even then, all you'll get is a SNAPSHOT.  To make matters worse, viewing your snapshots on your phone's relatively small screen is less then optimal (the web app does not support the timeline) Nest's own FAQ says it all: ""And with your PHONE or TABLET, you can see SNAPSHOTS of what your camera saw when it detected motion or sound for up to THREE hours in the past"" ""If you’d like to automatically record your video to the cloud and view it later, you’ll NEED TO BUY a Nest Aware subscription"" As I think about it, I'm being generous giving it two stars instead of one.",Almost Worthless without Nest Aware Subscription

I wished to closely monitor the well-being of the young puppies. While my iPhone-6 easily makes use of the WiFi system here, the Nest camera can not make contact with the router. I assigned a MAC-Address fixed IP to it and this did not help ... as expected. Because my iPhone was able to routinely make use of the WiFi here, from much much farther away, I felt confident in adding the Nest product to my existing Nest thermostat.

Compared to the last camera we had, the quality of the image, ease of use and installation, sound quality, everything else is far better, but the drawback is it only sends alerts to your phone every thirty minutes.  For new parents, this is terrible!  Imagine shutting the door, walking to another part of the house, and having something happen five minutes after you get the 'sound alert' that you entered and left the room.  I've emailed customer service to see if you can alter the frequency of alerts (i.e., I want an alert any time ANYTHING happens in the baby's room, even if the alerts are two minutes apart), but if you can't, then this definitely won't work as a baby monitor.",Probably not a baby monitor

Even the latest model I had from Motorola used ni-cad batteries, low-res displays, was completely irritating in various ways (lousy battery life, annoying beeping, etc). The Nest put an end to all of the frustration.  We now have HD feeds of our baby coming to any Mac, PC, Android, or iOS device in the house.  And outside of the house -- we get notifications when noise or motion is detected and instant video feeds anywhere.  Using the motion-triggered video recordings that get saved in the cloud, we can review noises and alerts from the night, and get insight into how our children are sleeping.  When we leave the house for extended periods, we move the Nest to a central location to keep an eye on what's going on.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jul 2016,Knott Family,"I am reluctantly writing a very negative review about the Nest Cam after months of frustrating work to have this product work smoothly.  I have used a Nest thermostat for many years and based on that experience I decided to purchase two Nest Cams to cover my house during periods I am away for extended periods of time.  At this point, I am so frustrated with this product I simply do not know what else to do other than throw them in the trash and go to a different product. So the specifics. 1.  There have been two instances when one or both cameras went ""offline"" for no good reason.  The solution per the website was to connect the cameras hardwired to the internet and re set up the cameras.  Given that I most need this product when I am out of town, this is a simply ridiculous solution.  And, since i have the cameras mounted near the ceiling to get maximum coverage, this is very frustrating and difficult to accomplish.  Climbing a ladder, unplugging the camera, connecting to my computer, resetting the camera, climbing back up the ladder and re mounting the camera. 2.  While Nest was in independent company, their telephone support was excellent.  Now that Nest, and Nest Cam, are owned by Google, telephone support is non existent.  Web solutions are very rudimentary and when they don't work or are difficult to implement, the owner has no alternative but to spend endless hours trying different solutions found by ""Googling"" the problem.  Google management needs to be out in the real world to understand what a customer is. 3.  Even simple solutions often require the owner to scan a QR code on the back of the camera.  Again, this requires getting on a ladder, un mounting the camera and scanning the code. 4.  The motion detection which on paper is a great feature is so worthless that I have had to turn it off.  When I had motion detection turned on, I found I received multiple emails indicating motion each day, only to find no issues when I logged into the cameras (if they were working).  What I learned was my cameras detected sunshine shining in the windows and lights on timers coming on as motion and sent me an alert.  I know this because the alerts come every day at the time the timers are set to come on. If this product was reliable, these acrobatics would be reasonable.  I have owned two cameras for not quite a year and am very frustrated with their unreliability and difficulty in correcting problems.",Very unreliable product with difficult solutions for problems

Almost didn't buy them, based on the total stupidness of the Nest thermostats (we bought two, and can't imagine a bigger waste of money) but so glad we gave Nest a second chance with the cameras.  We have one mounted on the inside of our front door (looking out through double-glass to our entryway), and the two others in various parts of the house.  The night vision is great (though we have to have it turned off on the front door camera, because the infrared lights reflect on the glass and mess up the image).  Oh, and don't forget, they're wireless (though each one requires electric power) so you can move them around inside or outside wherever there is power.  The software that runs these things is unbelievable (too involved to go into here, but look at the information provided by the manufacturer, and just know that what they say is true).  We were looking at having a professional $3500 security system installed in our house with a multi-channel DVR and a bunch of cameras hard-wired through our attic, but instead we ended up with $500 for 3 cameras, and have never looked back.  Pay the annual subscription for the long-term cloud storage for the video (which records 24/7).  It's worth it.",These cameras are exceptional

The new Nest app isn't as good as DropCams which is why I don't use it. I also have the Nest thermostat but still use the old Nest app for that too.  The Viewing area shrunk unless u turn ur phone sideways. The were other changes but I gave up and didn't upgrade to the new app in hopes of holding on to what I had with DropCam.  I pray they read these reviews and take heed because Id hate to see a great product ruined.  I have recommend  DropCam so many times and my friends have taken my word to buy the product. Because my account isnt fully integrated yet, I still have great service. I hope once they do integrate me I still have all the things I promote.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Feb 2017,Margaret,"I Love my Nest Cam!!!!  I purchased this camera last year  to use as a baby cam when my infant and toddler grandkids come to visit. When it arrived I took it out of the box and within 4 minutes had it connected, up and running. I downloaded the Nest app, scanned the barcode on the back of the camera, plugged the camera in, chose the wifi signal to connect to, typed in my wifi password when prompted and that was it! Easy and fast! The camera does a great job in low light situations and captures clear pictures in low light and regular light. The app notifies me of any movement or sound so I can pay attention to what the babies are doing. I like that you can not only see and hear them but that there is the capability for two way communication so I can tell them to get back into their beds or lay down in their cribs from my iphone app. It's so easy to move the camera to a different location. When I need to move it from the nursery to the bunk room or to the back hall- I just unplug it from the nursery or bunk room and plug it into my back hall to monitor my dogs when I'm not home. It automatically re-accesses the internet and is back up and running without doing a thing. I will be purchasing a couple of the outdoor version to monitor the front porch and the driveway.  This camera is worth every dollar!",Easy to use and worth the price! You get what you pay for!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2016,Populist Pen,"I really love my Nest Cam.  I shopped and shopped for which one to buy.  After about three months I decided on this one. I was impressed at the good engineering and the quality of the materials - it is not all plastic and uses relatively heavy duty metal for the camera and the mounting bracket - unusual in this day and age. It was easy to set up.  My network found it, app worked fine, iPad, I mounted it inside my house on the jamb by my front window that faces the street and that has a view of my front door.  Although I cannot use the sound pick up or mic for communicating with someone outside, I mainly am using it as a watch cam kind of thing - it picks up motion outside very quickly. I like the history the app maintains for motion detection events. I am planning on getting one or two more, one to put literally outside, in an outdoor case made for the Nest Cam, and maybe one out on my backyard side of the house. I can be anywhere and see what is going on in the front, including I have even seen a couple of rats at night that scurry around surveying their kingdom. One thing about night vision - this was noted by reviewers of the outdoor case makers for the Nest Cam and even other cameras, the infared ""lights"" or whatever those sensors are that pick up light to give the camera night vision - they create a light halo that bounces off the glass in front of the camera and feeds back into the picture that you receive from the camera.  It does it even when it is mounted like I have it, just in front of a regular house window.  It doesn't obscure everything, but it is annoying. My solution is I turned off the night vision setting - this only works for me however because I have a mercury vapor light by the front of my house that provides ample light to light up the area that I am covering with the camera's field of vision.",Buy With Confidence

Sorry, we can't find the live stream you're looking for.

The true issue we are having is that I have an iPhone, an iPad Pro, and an Android phone. When we test the Private Link with Password, because those devices do not support Flash, do not have the Flash Plug-in, the video will not stream. It is NOT that the camera is offline or not available, it is that your web browser interface requires the Flash Plug-in to view the video streaming in a web browser. Since mobile web browsers do not support the Flash Plug-in, your Share a Private Link with Password will not work for anyone using a mobile device to view video by the Private Link with Password. Please correct the error message so that it is accurate and not waste everyone’s time troubleshooting the cameras, the wifi, the Nest settings, etc., etc. If your web interface for video streaming requires the Flash Plug-in, then state so correctly in the error message, otherwise it is entirely misleading and you are pissing off your customer base who are ALL going to try and view their video on a mobile device. For private rooms that you want to be viewable on a mobile device, you must set up a separate account for each room, with its own email address and password, and you must view that room using the mobile Nest App or download the Puffin Browser: [...] for iPhone, iPad, browsers that do not support Flash on mobile devices.

I had originally bought a D-Link outdoor camera because I was having issues with someone coming into my backyard when I wasn't home. The D-Link was an abysmal failure (I posted a review on it). I decided that despite the higher cost and the need to buy an additional outdoor casing, I'd try the Nest. I already had a Nest thermostat, so it just made sense. It took literally 5 mins to set up the camera and hook it up to my wireless network. Within fewer than 10 mins I was watching streaming video from my back yard on my tablet and on my phone. The video quality is good and I've not had any problems with connectivity or the device going offline that others have described. I used this outdoor casing: https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Case-Flexible-Mount-Dropcam/dp/B0151I6DHE/ and so far it's been on my back patio mounted just under the roof overhang for almost a year now.

It's wonderful to see and talk with her! The facility placed a sign on her door that states ""this room is being monitored by surveillance camera,"" which we feel lets everyone know that we expect the highest standards possible in her care. This makes the staff aware, as well as mom. Her room is private, thus we have had no issues; however, if she shared a room the other occupant would have to sign a waiver, so keep that in mind. Up to 10 people can have access to viewing. I can't imagine not having it and highly recommend it.",Nursing home use

First I will start with the positives. -Camera view angle and setback is amazing. -Quality is great. -Easy to setup and use with the Nest app. Now whey I dont like this device. -Constantly disconnects and requires a reboot, even this it will only work for a day or two before another reboot is required. -The fact that you can not backup photos or images to a computer locally. Must subscribe to googles cloud backup solution. -The night vision quality is decent at best. -Does not seem to have any integration with nest thermostat. Expected more out of googles acquisition. Which is surprising because I heard such good things about drop cams, seems google made this product worse so far. The good news is that all these issues could be fixed software updates. Hopefully this stuff gets better in the future.",... never write a product review but I am so disappointed with this product I feel like I must warn ...

What a waste of time that was ,you can not scrub through the video like in the nest cam app. Samsung's app is lacking first always reverts to low rez ,it won't stay on hd ( must do this to save bandwidth) then to watch what its continuously recorded it gives you a list of events then you must click on then wait until it access`s the sd card and finally it will play the video.Not what you were looking for? well then you do it all over again and choose a different event this takes a long time, all this to see if the mail man has come or not. With the Nest cam and the Nest aware it take a minute tops to scrub through the entire day .I'm using the 2012- 720p Dropcams and the picture is actually clearer than the new 1080p samsung 1080p pro-cam.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2015,jeffsto,"I bought the nest cam to use in my baby's room. I am very disappointed with the after using it for just a day. My primary complaint is that Nest has completely locked down the NestCam, and only allow you to access to your camera feed through their website and/or apps. In the event that your internet is spotty or unreliable, you will not be able to access your camera. There is no way to save videos or images besides paying for their service, they've been very careful to make sure no one else can access or save the footage. In terms of using the apps and website, I was also disappointed. The video feed on the app will sometimes hang or say it's disconnected, requiring you to completely close the app and open it again. I saw this on both the Android and iOS apps. Additionally, the website for viewing your camera feed has been unreliable for me (both on Firefox and Chrome), showing a black image where the video feed shows, but without any error message, until I refresh the page. Considering this is the only way to access your video feed, it's worrisome to say the least. The most frustrating thing about his camera is that I can't help but feel that they are stealing my video from me. I could buy a webcam for $20-$30 and have access to my video over LAN, on the internet, or anywhere using free software. For $200 Nest sends my video directly to their servers, and won't let me save it until I pay their monthly subscription fee. They're basically holding my own video hostage. For almost $200 after tax, you can do much, much better. Please take my advice and spend less than half the price for something that lets you have access to your own video. Pros - Good quality image - Strong IR night vision - Very simple setup - Build quality feels solid Cons - Very bad lag, even when you're on same wifi network (10+ seconds) - Apps are unreliable (Android, iOS, and web) - Camera is entirely useless if your internet is down/unreliable - No way to view camera feed outside of their provided apps - Not possible to view camera feed over LAN when you're on the same wifi connection as the camera",Disappointing

But right when you return window closes the features go away and your camera will not turn on unless you turn it on or there is specific physical activity that triggers the camera and then you can review it. And the app Nest app seems to be more buggy and not go directly to the live feed unless you open it and close it if it has been opened previously so unless I want to pay $100 or more a year just to be able to look back an hour or two this camera does not provide the purpose that I bought it for me",Deceptive

Love how easy it is to use with the app.  Can check in on the house at any time as long as you leave the cameras on and connected to the network.  My main issue is even though we have the Nest Thermostat (3rd gen) as well we are unable to configure it not to send motion or sound notifications every 30 minutes, even when we are home, unless we pay for a Nest Aware subscription.  I think this is pretty ridiculous.  Paying for a subscription to be able to get full functionality of a product that's already been purchased is bad form and borderline deceptive because Nest doesn't make this absolutely clear to potential customers prior to purchasing.  I would rather pay more for the device so I can fully configure it as I want right out of the box than to buy it and find out I need to pay extra for certain features to be ""unlocked"".  Also prior to purchasing make sure you understand that you also need to purchase a Nest Aware subscription in order to save your video history.","Great camera, but need to purchase secondary subscription in order to get full functionality of device"

Mine are on, and I never get alerts, even though I walk back and forth in front of the camera. 3) I called support, waited over 10 minutes, was never given any indication of how long the wait would be, and was told hundreds of times that I should check the support information on the website.","Long setup time, unreliable alerts, annoying phone support"

I had the cam looking out the kitchen window, aimed at the porch and front yard too see who came and went. My next door neighbor got robbed in the middle of the day. The thief parked right in front of my house! When the police came, I told them that I probably had a video. So we went inside my house and reviewed the video. There was the thief parked in front of my house and getting out of his car and walking up their driveway. 1 min. and 45 sec. later he came out, hopped into his car and left with all of their jewelry in his pocket. The video was SO grainy we couldn't even see what the make of the car was or what race the guy was. I was so embarrassed and disappointed that I couldn't help my neighbors. Thanks Nest Cam. Also, forget about night vision. A week later a car got stolen on my street at night. All we could see was blurred lights going by, not even the car.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Aug 2015,Becca,"I was excited to use this as a baby monitor after the stellar reviews from places like The Nightlight and PCMag, and it does have some great features. Image quality is fantastic and I like having the wide-angle lens. Audio quality is good too, though like other cameras that run through a phone app, you have to have the app open to hear the audio. Other features didn't really work as well. While I'm on board with the push notifications serving as a stand-in for audio when you're not in the app, there's usually a substantial delay before I receive a notification. It's not unusual for me to hear the baby crying on my own and for me to make it upstairs and into the room before I've received that information from the camera, which makes me wonder if the camera registered any motion/sound before I got there. It's far less useful as a baby monitor without these notifications, and there's no option to change the sensitivity. Additionally, it took longer than expected to set up due to problems syncing the camera with our phones. When we tried calling the Nest support line, we were on hold for at least 10-15 minutes and hung up without ever actually connecting with a person. Overall I'm underwhelmed and would probably return it if I knew of a better option.",Best option for a baby monitor?

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2015,Brian Linse,"i purchased the new Nestcam to add on to an existing Dropcam i already had in my home. Camera setup was easy, and the image is impressive at 1080. When i downloaded the Nest App, however, i was disappointed to find that several of the best features of the Dropcam App are not available. There is no multi camera single screen view, and the scrolling timeline at the bottom of the main viewing screen is gone. Reviewing footage is far more difficult in the Nest App, and the older Dropcam App will not add the new Nest Cam. I called customer service and was told that they plan to lose the older Dropcam App completely at some point in the future. I would not recommend Nest to any happy users of the older Dropcam and its App. If you have only Nestcams and don't know what you are missing from the old Dropcam App, you should be happy with the camera, and hopefully they will improve the App in the future. UPDATE: I have now had trouble getting notifications from the Nest Cam, and when I called customer service they told me that the Nest Cam, unlike the old Drop Cam, does not send notifications via email. I have been getting reliable notifications from the Drop Cam for months, but Justin at Nest Support informs me that Nest will be removing email notifications from Drop as well. This leaves only push notifications to Android and iOS devices, and leaves me and my Blackberry out of luck. The mobile App still sucks. No new updates since I first reviewed. Reducing my rating from 2 to 1 star. Wishing 0 stars was an option. Nest took a really great product and completely screwed it up. Anyone wanna buy a couple cameras? 2nd UPDATE Feb 2016: Still no improvement. I am now on an Android phone, and I can say that the additional function now available that were not available ob Blackberry do nothing to improve the experience. The Nest App, on both iOS and Android, is just about the worst application I've ever encountered, and the worst app that I currently use by a long shot. A great cam without a great App is basically useless.","Great camera, awful mobile app."

The negative stars is for not having a free rolling 12hr or 24hr recording period.  You'll have to pay $10/month for a rolling 10-day recording or $30/month for a 30-day rolling recordings. If you don't intend to do any recordings then this cam is probably an excellent device for keeping track of your baby in the room (live feed) or watching your pets, but definitely not good as a security camera because for security you will need the recording feature.  So keep that in mind. Also, it is not easy to change the wifi the camera connects to, you'll have to re-scan the QR code and re-pick a wifi name and password if you change it, this might not be too troublesome since most won't change their wifi name on a regular basis",Fast Setup - not as useful without free recording

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Aug 2015,Adam T. Pridgen,"Simply put, the specifications for a high-resolution camera with night vision, an internal mic and speaker are great until I realized I could not use this device at those maximums.  Buyer beware that your ISP speed and WiFi signal in your home should be heavily scrutinized before you buy this product for its high-definition capabilities. I am disappointed with this camera, mostly because the the camera has frequent disruptions when watching the feed, there is no way to view the video feed locally on my network without going through the Nest site, and there is no POE/Ethernet option, which means a strong WiFi signal is a major necessity.  To be fair, I am not sure if my feed disruptions are caused by poor ISP service (poor upload) or bad a WiFi signal.  But, there also is not a way for me to make these determinations/troubleshoot the problems.  If I could view/listen to the content/feed from a service on the device, I could easily determine the problem and mitigate the poor service while I am in the house or away from the house.  If I were to do it all over again, I would forgo the easy access to the device from anywhere and go with a product like Axis which has similar features and could be viewed locally or externally via an extra network video monitoring solution.  I like what Nest stands for (e.g. interface simplicity and ease of use), but I wholeheartedly regret making this purchase.",I regret this purchase.

I was able to verify from Italy that my house hadn't burned down yet. Setup was easy. I only needed extended cloud-recorded history while I was traveling, and it was easy to start a one-month subscription. However, when it came time to cancel, the account screens wouldn't show up properly in the app for a few days. Only after ~3 days could I bring it up and cancel my subscription. Not cool! The motion sensor goes off when it sees stuff like the shadow of a tree swaying in the breeze. Short of some advanced object recognition AI, I'm not sure how they could fix that. Home/Away assist (an option that supposed to disable the camera when it detects my phone at home) didn't work consistently.

The video quality is very bad when using mobile phone, disconnects every minute. Also it seems that it turns off every time my cat is runs under the smoke detector. When you forget it in zoom mode it can keep recording zoomed video until you notice, so you can miss many things. The web access doesn't allow convenient way to see the events. Motion detection misses a lot of real motion so a lot of things happening I'm not notified. I have cars in the background from the street parallel to ours that I don't want to be triggering motion, but they are and there is no way to exclude this area as in our DVR. Not even talking about paying subscription to get the video recorded. If the things will not improve in few weeks going to return it back and be looking at diferent IP camera solution without hidden fees. 2015-June-10 Update, Things are getting worse, my husband noticed that since we installed the DropCam our Nest thermostat started AC, cooling the house for hours every day while it's actually shows as AWAY in the app. This never happened before we installed the camera and we have Nest thermostat and nest protect for almost 2 years.

I've never had a security camera and have always wanted to be able to monitor what's happening in my home while I'm away. Upon arrival it took less than a minute to install. You plug it into the wall, you download the app, type in your wifi password and you're connected. As far as monitoring it's as easy as bringing up the app and getting a live view or reviewing your recordings. Of course there are improvements that can be made so I'll give a pro/con breakdown below. Pros: Super easy to setup, couldn't imagine making it easier Small in size but large field of view Fairly inexpensive for piece of mind it provides Great night vision Cons: No internal memory card (personally I like that it streams to the cloud automatically but nice to give people an option) A bit of lag (roughly 3 seconds when viewing live). Not a huge deal but would be nice to be real time Doesn't turn off automatically when you come home (I could care less about this since a break-in could occur while you're home). If this is a big deal to you, you can choose to set it to turn off at certain periods of time or you can manually turn it off at anytime.",Love this camera! Pros weigh out the very few cons

C.,"The gold standard for webcam security. Bought two of these to give out at baby showers. People I gave them to love it. They can keep an eye on their kids when they are out of the house. Using smart phones to view the webcam feed through the internet. Instead of being tied down to a proprietary baby monitor video system. Night vision on these is great, and the 1080p resolution makes it easy to digitally zoom in and enhance if need be. These webcams also have a zoom in and enhance feature to increase picture quality when zoomed in. Think CSI:Miami, where people say ""Enhance"" and it magically zooms in without loosing resolution. The one downside is that you can only record content on their cloud services, which are kind of expensive. But if you can live with a live feed only, you will be very happy without cloud recording.",Great baby monitors.
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Mar 2016,Andy,"I have an original Dropcam for in the interior of my house and after my fiancee's tires/wheels were stolen off her car, I bought another camera (now Nest) to point outside. There are a few things I would like Nest to do with their app so I don't have to but that doesn't really have anything to do with the camera. The camera itself works well, no complaints. The picture is great in 1080 mode. I have my cameras record 24/7, regardless if I'm home or not. If I understand the Home/Away Assist feature of the app correctly, when the app realizes your home because your phone is present, the camera turns off. That seems odd because if I'm home and someone breaks in, I want the camera on to record it. What I would like is for the camera to realize I'm home via my phone being present and stop giving me notifications. As it stands now, I have to manually turn on/off the notifications when I leave and return home. Perhaps it works or that I can get it to work this way but it isn't obvious to me. I should look into more when I have time. Or perhaps a nice person can set me straight. Another feature I'd like is to perhaps schedule the resolution. I need to test this more on my home network but I imagine while in 1080 mode, it will hog a lot of bandwidth. Therefore while I'm home streaming Netflix or playing online video games, I'd like the camera to switch to 720. But while no one is home and overnight, it would be nice to have it switch to 1080. So I'd like to be able schedule the camera to be in 1080 mode while I'm away and automatically switch to 720 when I get home. Of course, this all may be moot if my home network can handle the camera and streaming and whatnot all at the same time. Like I said, I need to look into that myself.",Good Camera. Okay App.

They were relatively easy to register and setup. Picture quality and range  is very good. I purchased option to save video to cloud for 10 days for peace of mind. You can access 24 hours of video for 10 or 30 days. I used this feature when service people were in my home while I was traveling. Camera can detect motion and sound. It tells you if motion is a person. You can also remotely talk to person thru camera - pretty cool! Night vision works well but it's not so good in my foyer that gets moonlight at night. Image is very dark but it does detect a person moving. Motion detector alerts at night when headlights pass door is annoying. I have not had any problems with camera in main living area.

At this time, I would not recommend the Nest cam. If you own a Nest cam, you have to use the Nest app. This app is buggy (always shows that camera is disconnected but when you reload the camera it works, constant spinning 'busy' circle) and has a bad user interface. With the Dropcam app I was able to view all cameras on the preview screen, now with the Nest cam app they've made the camera feed so small on the preview screen so that you have to open each camera to see the detail. With the Dropcam cameras (and Dropcam app) I was able to get email images of the motion without having to subscribe to the monthly video subscription recording. This feature is no longer supported with Nest cam (and Nest app). So if you don't subscribe to Nest video recording service this camera is pretty useless...unless you can check the Nest cam as soon as the motion alert goes off on you iPhone (and that's if there are no delays between the motion and notification being sent to your iPhone).",I would not recommend the Nest cam

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2017,K. Stern,"The camera itself is great. I don't think you'll find a better quality indoor monitoring camera out there. The quality is flawless, and the design is sleek. The problem with this camera is that it requires a subscription service. I am 100% anti-subscription. I don't think I've ever met a subscription service that I thought was a good deal for the customer. This one is a particularly BAD deal. You buy one of the highest end cameras on the market only to find out that it's useless unless you subscribe to Nest Aware for at least $10/month. Aside from a couple gimmicks, all that really gets you is cloud storage for your footage. Nest's advertising is misleading and confusing. For example, they make it seem that without the subscription you'll get 3 hours free footage, but that's not true. You only get 3 hours of free snapshots IF there is activity spotted. Not helpful. Also, they give you the first month of the subscription free, and you're automatically enrolled when you activate your camera. I'm guessing they do this so people will leave positive reviews of their product, since most people review products soon after beginning to use them. After the one-month ""honeymoon"" is over, you'll see that this camera doesn't suit your needs. Bottom line, without the subscription, this device is pretty much useless, unless you plan on staring at your live stream all day long.",The Nest trap

Since it operates over Wi-Fi, there are no cords to run beyond the lengthy USB charging cable (supplied), allowing you to pout it almost anywhere. Moving it is also simple. The picture quality is excellent, and the built-in speaker and microphone allow you to carry on a quick conversation if you wish. The iOS software is simply the existing Nest app, the same app used for the Nest thermostat and smoke detector. You can check on the camera the same time you check the other devices. The Nest Protect will send notices to your iOS device when it detects movement, even in the dark, and you can create a schedule of when you want monitoring, and when you do not.",Simple setup

That is not the case. The setup was easy. It did take longer than 60 seconds, but it wasn't a frustratingly long process. Certainly less than 5 minutes to do. We setup the camera and tested it out. The microphone works well- you cannot hear the room while you talk to it and sometimes you have to exit the talk part of the app and come back into it to work, but it works fine. The night vision is clear and automatically shifts with lighting conditions. The motion alerts have worked so far.

No way to directly specify the camera's time zone -- instead you have to run through a stupid wizard interface, that supports only a handful of countries.

The software also freezes from time to time (in the browser and in the iOS client) and then it just shows the picture from minutes/hours ago. So there is no way to trust what you are seeing.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2015,Phonetic Man,"My review is based on using this camera as a baby monitor, which it does not work well as for a few reasons. First is that the audio won't run in the background.  So if you switch apps to check email, facebook, etc., you will no longer hear what's going on in the room.  Doing some research on this, it seems this has been a problem for many years before Nest (Google) bought Dropcam.  Second is that it really drains your battery to have the video streaming.  This is different than another wifi video monitor we had for our other kid that would allow background audio and battery would last at least 2 hours on your iphone.  Lastly, you cannot view more than one camera stream at a time.  So if you have multiple kids, you can't watch them all at the same time.  I was told that this is only on the iphone, but on an iPad, you can view multiple streams.  It's a shame because set up was easy and the viewing angle is great.  Baby monitor is not a good use case for this product, but it probably works well if you are only going to check in from time to time on the video.  Note that I didn't have any setup issues, it took me less than 5 minutes to have it up and running.","NOT a good baby monitor, may work well for other use cases"

It was incredibly easy to install (literally take it out of the box, plug it in and download the app).  My only issue is that I have one of my cameras pointed outside to view my front door, but at night the only thing that is visible is the glare on the window.  This is not the camera's issue - it's clearly designed for indoor use only, but I wanted something to watch outside, so I guess my next purchase will be a Dropcam once that's fully integrated with Nest.  But the video quality is excellent, and you don't have to have a DVR because they use cloud storage, which is pretty cheap at $100/year for 10 days worth of video. Update to my review: a user suggested I turn off the night vision so the camera doesn't capture glare and it works great! I love these cameras.",Great product!

I did a LOT of online research and considered this and a Foscam. The security breaches from the other, and the fact that this is Google-related, helped me decide. We put it in our nursery for our toddler. The room is a FROG, just as big as a 2-car garage, and the camera captures everything in incoming audio/video, night vision, outbound audio, etc etc etc. It's awesome! The night vision works really well, too.  Incredibly easy to install and setup. I can monitor it from anywhere, in and out of the home. It was pricey, but definitely worth the peace of mind. We just transitioned to a toddler bed so LO has more free reign of the room, and we wanted to make sure that she's safe and comfortable when she's in there alone.",One of my fav baby products.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2016,topher81,"After researching everything to death in search of a baby monitor I ended up purchasing three different models, 2 Motorola's and a Samsung and ended up returning all of them and purchasing a Nest Cam. Best decision for several reasons. First of all I found that the video quality was the absolute best. Even night vision looks superb.  Secondly, my wife and I like that we don't have to carry around a separate monitor. We don't have to worry about horror stories of neighbors being able to hear or spy using radio frequency.  The nest runs off of your Wi-Fi and is on all the time. The app is very user-friendly, and gets up and running immediately.  Also with the other monitors we found that we would sit  in bed and simply watch our baby.  When baby sleeps parents should sleep!  We slept great with the nest having peace of mind because every time our little one would move we would get a notification that prompted us to view the video.  And trust me it is very accurate. Hey third feature that is really great is the fact that you can subscribe to a service that keeps your video feed history.  For purposes of a baby monitor, this is good because you can go back and see how well he or she slept.  And as any new parent will experience, your brain and memory goes to crap with a newborn  and you have to remember times specifically for feeding and sleeping and everything else so you forget  sometimes when the baby started a nap.  The history feed makes it easy to go back and review exactly when naptime started (for example). The last part is the investment.  Yes this camera is not cheap but when compared to other video baby monitors this one is definitely comparable and well worth it  especially because  you can use it as a security camera once you don't need the baby monitor.  That said, most parents with  kids that don't use their baby monitor anymore have it thrown into a box and never use it again.  I like knowing that my  investment will be used forever. I will note that this camera is in a fixed position and cannot rotate like some others. That said, it has a very wide viewing angle and a zoom feature controlled from the app on your phone. It also does not do some of the fancy things like report temperature in the room.  While I think that is a cool feature, I don't think it's necessary.  It does have a two-way talk feature, but we have not had much use for it.",Attention Parents: HD Baby Monitor!!

I love my Nest thermostat and Nest smoke alarms and have wanted to try a Nest Cam for awhile.  I have two Belkin cameras and they do alright, but I have just been extremely impressed with the Nest products and experience. I was reluctant after reading reviews here on Amazon.  I was also reluctant after hearing that the camera will only alert you for movement once every 30 minutes.  That is not customizable.  Although that is still a concern, as you will see, it pales in comparison to what you get. I was also concerned about the monthly $10 charge for Nest Aware.  It's not required, but after seeing it's value, I will be purchasing it! Setup was easy and enjoyable.  The camera was up and running quickly.  To test it out, I put it in the same room the Belkin was hanging from the ceiling.  I did a comparison of the night vision.  No contest!  (See photo).  The Nest is perfectly lit in complete darkness.  The only difference is that it's black and white instead of in color when using night vision.  This pretty much won me over by itself. The second thing that I noticed was the history.  Every time there is movement a clip is generated and you can click the history icon to see all the movement clips (Nest Aware required) or go online to see the entire feed for the duration of your Nest Aware subscription (10 days or 30 days depending on what you signed up for).  This sold me on getting the monthly subscription. The thing that totally won me over was the accuracy.  I have had zero false alerts.  Zero.  I only have a clip when someone walked into the room, and I have a ton of clips for the times I walked in the room.  With the Belkin cam on the other hand I had probably 95% false alerts - a difference in lighting from the windows, or whatever.  I can't say, but I even had the setting on low sensitivity.  It seemed every 5 seconds I would be getting an email saying there was movement that I had to check to verify.  Nest cam removes that hassle. I am beyond thrilled with this camera.  Over time I will be replacing all my Belkin cameras with Nest cameras.  I have been completely thrilled with this purchase.  I HIGHLY recommend this camera!",Had concerns but not anymore!

I read mixed reviews on other sites. I should have stuck with my original intuition and gone with a different camera. The picture quality is so so. I figured 1080p would be clear enough to identify an intruder. Not so. The picture is slightly tiled. The camera turns on for no reason. I was getting mad at my wife because I thought she was spying on me. She was not, the camera would start whenever it wanted to. I can live with that. I can't live with it turning it self off when we are gone. It has happened every time. I need the camera to stay on when we are gone. It does not. I do like the fact that I can review footage from the cloud. It does let me know when something is not right. It also is only 50 percent on that. Quite often it says it detected someone, when no one was there. I do feel better having a camera, but not this one.

If they were to start offering a software package that would allow me to record to my home storage solutions I'd change my rating to 5 stars. I knew this was going to be an issue when I bought them, but there aren't many quality consumer/residential options out there that offer local storage options anymore that are as easy to use as the Nest Cam.

Nest provides no customer support. I just got finished holding for over an hour. When I bought these cameras I tried to buy cloud storage, called nest aware, as I was leaving for a trip abroad. That is precisely why I bought the cameras and needed storage. I couldn't get this done online so I called and was told that there was new software that had a glitch. I was assured that if I called back in a few days they could take care it. Called two additional times during the following 10 days, held more than 30 minutes each time, and gave up. When I returned from my trip I made contact with Nest customer support. They apologized and gave me 90 days of 10 day storage in return for the trouble that I had. The only problem was they couldn't connect the front door camera to the cloud. It seems important that I know who's been at my front door. I was told that they didn't know why it wouldn't connect to the cloud but I had to be physically where the cameras were to disconnect them from the account, open a new account and reconnect them.We made an appointment to have technical support call me on the day I arrived back home. No call. I called in, held for 30 mins, gave up, called back in, held for 20 more minutes and reached a person. She said she needed to transfer me to someone else but would stay on the line and took my number in case we got disconnected. Well, we got disconnected and I never received a call back. So here I am on hold again. I reached a representative who said I needed to be transferred....I'm out the price of the cameras plus the $480 I paid to have cameras mounted and wires run.

We monitor the camera on iPhone 6's and a MacBook Pro.  The 5-10 second delay is annoying but tolerable.  Although it proves to be worthless as I'm already on my way to see why our baby is crying.  The worst part is the connection issues.  My home network is definitely not an issue with Cat6e cabling and connections and an internet service running at 150 Mbps.  Our WIFI network is running the latest hardware and firmware, and as an IT professional I am positive our network is not having any issues.  However multiple times every night and all day, our camera can't seem to stay connected or is having ""slow bandwidth problems"".  I'm very disappointed in this product, and will be buying a different baby monitor.",Very Disappointed

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2015,GiGi P,"NOT GOOD FOR A BABY MONITOR! I wanted to love the NestCam, I really did.  Amidst all the negative reviews, I still purchased it with the intention to mainly use it as a baby monitor- and maybe when baby outgrows to use it as a security cam for the house. Well, as a baby monitor, it sucks. It times out the app consistently, closing the feed, and this can happen in the middle of the night.  As you can imagine, that sucks if you're sleeping and rely on it to wake you up if your kid wakes up. When the live feed is closed, the only monitor is that you will get a notification that there is movement or sound (which you can only get ONE alert every 30 minutes), which is only good for however your notification can wake you up. I purchased an extender (to make sure my wi-fi signal was strong), checked the download and upload speed, spoke to the tech support, reinstalled and restarted my devices, and still does the same thing. So SAD! I will agree- picture quality is amazing, the ease of setting up is fantastic, the look and feel of the NestCam is sleek and modern. It's breaking my heart that it doesn't work for what I intended it to do, so I am returning it. Below is the screen that you will wake up to if you leave the video feed running LIVE when you go to sleep.",DO NOT USE AS A BABY MONITOR

I have a Nest thermostat that works really well, so I was excited to integrate the camera, unfortunately it's really not that great.  They claim 1080P video resolution, but the video feed looks very grainy and pixelated (even when set to 1080p on settings). My home network speeds are more than sufficient (100/10 mbps). Also, a huge deal breaker for me was the lack of Geofencing.  I hate having to manually activate/de-activate the camera.  Every time I leave the house,  I have to remember to activate the camera. They do have something where it uses the Nest Thermostat's ""Auto-Away"" feature to activate the camera, but I don't use that feature on my thermostat, so it is a pointless one for me. I've had this for about a week now, but will most likely send it back. Going to try Canary which DOES support Geofencing.  Sorry Nest, I REALLY wanted to like this product, but it's too expensive for the little it does.",Dissapponited  - Lacks features and Video Quality is poor

The camera works great, but once your free 10 days of cloud recording expires, the camera is worthless.  The app will notify you that you had motion or a sound a few minutes ago, but you can go back and see what happened, you can only see the current image.  For a $200.00 camera, I expect at least a few hours to go back and look at the footage.  It is unfortunate Nest is forcing additional money out of its customers if they want a usable product.  I have the Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect and the Nest Cameras.  The thermostat and the protects are fantastic, but Nest has failed with the Camera by forcing you to buy a subscription service.  Nest needs to step up like the Canary Camera did and give at least 12 hours of free cloud recording.",Don't buy unless you want to spend an additional $100.00 per year!

I used mainly for the purpose of checking out my two dogs at home. I have never signed up NestAware service which requires $10/month. I didn't even sign up the trial service, because I don't want to have any hassle of canceling the service if I don't like it.  Though camera was pricy, initially I was impressed by the camera's functionality:  1) the camera sent me motion alerts via WIFI. 2) Nest app allows me to play back continuously of video clips of last events 3) I liked the fact the camera live video can be viewed with status of all my nest thermostats. However, after 30 days, Nest crippled several important functionalities. For example, I'm no longer able to play back continuously videos captures by last alert events. I'm disappointed and felt Nest is doing false/misleading advertisements in alluring users for using its product and then cripple its major software functionalities after 30 days. I reiterate I have never signed up any (nor any trial) nest software features and I expect the system to continue to work as initially advertised. After initial use of indoor camera, I bought two nest outdoor cameras. I'm returning them all to Amazon.",It's a fraud.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2016,John K,Good camera but incredibly excesive video history fees.  I purchased 4 cameras to have around the house and they advertise over $100/year for the ability to keep video history for 10 days.  After i subscribed i realized that they charge $100+ for ONE camera only and that they want an additional $50/year for the video recordings of each ADDITIONAL camera.  What a rip off !! I made a big mistake spending all this money.  No wander the product line is not doing well and they changed CEOs !!!,Be careful of the charges to provide video history.  Incredibly excessive.

Tremblay,"I have had the camera a week now.  The camera is great.  Someone else besides Nest Labs must write a better app to run this superior hardware which is completely abused by its soft failings.  Consider this: 1.  We don't NEED a proprietary ""cloud"".  Most of us have oodles of space we never even use. 2.  The app must give us absolute power over our videos.  Must be able to delete and manage. 3.  The notifications are currently awful.  I get a quiet text saying ""motion has been detected"".  NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  I want it to scream at me that my protected space has someone in it! 4.  Even after being ""notified"" of movement, I go to the application and there is absolutely no message history of movement under ""messages"". I would pay as much for the app that gives me what I really need, as I did for the camera. 5.  Improve text messaging alerts and history.  Video is only necessary for prosecution for those of us using it for guarding our ""stuff"". 6.  WAKE UP Nest Labs.  Deliver a product we can brag about! Consumers are sick of security companies killing us by a thousand cuts of ""small monthly fees"" for services we want to manage for ourselves.","Avoid this purchase, I wish I did.  The app is a horrible design for what it is advertised for."

However, the connection is constantly dropping out. Despite the camera and viewing device being on the same network, all video is routed through the NEST servers. There is a lot (a LOT) of dropping on their end. So you can be looking at video of your child when BAM! no more video. Rinse and repeat. Also, their app seems to be crashing a lot these days. It's not our internet connection. Read some other reviews. Would return but past the 30-days and didn't realize how often this happens until too late. P.O.S.",DO NOT USE FOR LIVE MONITORING!!!

The night vision works really well. Weaknesses:  The design of the power port.  I mostly just have the camera sitting upright on its stand but based on the design of the power port, it is really hard to plug in the power cable in without bending the cable significantly.  Already on the second nest cam I am getting flaky behavior and I am sure it is because the cable is being damaged and/or the port.  I also wanted to place one of the nest cams in a dropcase outdoor enclosure but again the power port issue...  ...so I bought a right angle power adapter.  Bummer since the power port on the bottom of the camera faces the wrong direction for that to work... My suggestions for NEST:  Either place the power port on the back of the camera or at the very lest, face the port the other way around and include an angled power adapter.  That would make me a lot happier!","Lots of strengths, a few weaknesses"

Hardware - four stars. The whole hardware/software complex - one star. Even given the [almost] stellar hardware, the whole thing is next to useless. Here's what you will experience: - Web application motion sensing events inconsistent. One time you're looking at it and there's nothing detected for a day, the other - whole bunch of  event marks appear. - Android app problematic (95% of the time all you will be seeing is ""Connecting..."" message. Regardless of how fast the hardware is (ran on: Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nexus 10). - Hardware gets pretty hot (consistently staying at 50°C/122°F). - WiFi connection drops often, even though the [top of the line] router is within a few meters. - Resolution doesn't stay at 1080, falls back often, and is very reluctant to go back up. Effectively, you'll be lucky to get 360. - No wired connection (which is kinda strange, since it *needs* power and *has* a USB cable already). Yes, it's a documented feature and not a surprise, but it is a major drawback - makes the installation site vulnerable to trivial WiFi jamming. - Dependence on Internet connection. Your Internet goes down - you're blind even when you're at home. - Vendor lock-in. There's nothing you can do with this camera that Nest doesn't want you to do - no local backup, no local observation, no third-party integration. Verdict: returned.",Major disappointment

Emmert,"Rating 1 Star for its effectiveness as a real-time baby monitor. Our first baby monitor handheld device broke, so we liked the idea of using our phones to monitor and skip the extra device. However, unlike a dedicated baby monitor, on which you can see/hear your crying baby instantly, the Nest simply sends a notification to your phone, which is hardly effective in notifying you if you have a large home or sleep soundly. On a positive note - I was impressed by the product and presentation as I unboxed and configured it - everything seems very high quality, from the considerable heft of the camera itself, to the long, high quality USB cable and proprietary plug. Even the mounting screws that came with it were impressive. Disappointed it wouldn't work for us.",Not effective for use as a baby monitor

One can buy a logitech for $50 and get a better image quality and user experience. Here are the major and significant problems of this cam: - I have a super fast internet speed but Nest servers are just so slow that you never get a flawless recording. The app or even their website viewer has to load every few minutes. Sometimes and out of nothing it tells you camera is offline where you have to reload or close and reopen the app. - Image quality is just too bad for $199. Paying so much for a video cam, one expects to have an awesome quality. - Nest app is useless. The dropcam app was somehow acceptable, but this one is just too slow and does not have the features that you need in a cam. Summary: I will stay away from this cam until they have improved image quality, server issues and app.",... its slick design but frankly speaking apart from the nice design this cam is useless

They have a scheduling option for turning the entire camera off or on; they just need to incorporate that into their Activity Zones. I always want my camera on, but only during certain times of the day (or night) do I want to know if Activity is going on in certain zones. At other times, activity in these zones are normal and frequent (Business hours) and I don't need to be alerted every 2-minutes of activity there; only at certain times when activity SHOULD NOT BE THERE do I need to be alerted.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2015,Tayseer,"I recently purchased a Dropcam Pro (from Best Buy about 2 weeks ago) and am still able to return it due to my having their Elite + membership. So I decided to order this Nest Cam because it streams in 1080P and I have 200/20 Mbs internet so I decided why not. I made a big mistake. I received my Nest Camera yesterday and I have no cloud recording. It didn't come with a free trial, and I cannot purchase subscription. So I basically have a live camera that has a 3-5 second delay. If someone were to break into my Apartment, I would have no footage to show Police because I cannot store video locally and I am unable to purchase a cloud subscription (as I said earlier, it didn't even come with a free trial). I'm not a fan of their new website for the Nest cam. To create motion zones you need Nest Aware (not sure why), so I can't even receive motion alerts for certain zones. I knew what I was getting with the Dropcam Pro. It was a working product. I feel like Nest destroyed the Dropcam company by purchasing it (also Google purchased Nest about a year ago). Also I'm a little worried about security. You would think that Nest would have two step authentication to disallow unauthorized users from gaining access to the nest account. Imagine if someone were to gain access to user accounts and passwords, you the consumer would be screwed. If Dropbox has two step authentication for stored files on their servers, why won't Nest support two step authentication to live recording camera of your own house. I have never used other Nest products, but from what I've heard they've gone downhill since Google purchased them.",Such a large disappointment. Nest has ruined Dropcam

BAD,"This was a disappointment to purchase. My # 1 issue is the WiFi. Or should I say that the thing doesn't stay on the Wifi. My house isn't big, just long with steps between each floor. I keep losing my Wifi connection with this thing. I have two extenders both are located at the top of each of the staircases; one is actually a couple of feet from the Nest and I still can't keep a signal on the wifi. All my Wemo products work. Two Wemo lights sit right next to the Nest and the Nest is the only thing that doesn't work and can't stay on the wifi.  Weird because it can't find the Wifi that is sitting right next to it. Could they please remake this thing. I have to keep resetting it. And to do that; I need to get on a chair and take a picture of the back where the QRScan code is.This DAMN thing doesn't stay on longer enough to do anything and it over heats.",It can't stay on the Wifi and it overheats
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2015,NE IntoMetal,"I had bought 3 Dropcams in the past and was very happy with them and was excited when I heard that Nest had bought Dropcam because I expected the product to get better.  Instead they stopped providing a feature called ""sharing"" which allows me to add an email address and have others log in and be able to operate the camera and the history.  We use these cameras for security for our company.  When I contact Nest regarding the sharing feature, they gave me a 'work around' but it will require me to have 3 accounts instead of 1, since not all our managers have access to all the cameras.  To save 10 days of history of the camera (which we need as part of our security) Nest charges $100 for the first camera and then only $50 for every additional camera.  I told them I would manage the three accounts as long as I didn't have to pay the additional money for the other 2 accounts.  After being on on the phone for more than 35 minutes I was given two free months of history (at $50 per year, this is about $8 worth of value).  This is a great camera and all they need to do is re-enable the sharing feature, or in the least make up for the $100 per year and I will manage the three accounts.",Nest drops 'sharing' feature that Dropcam had and doesn't try to make it right.

I started with a Piper cam which was OK but I returned it for this.  With all the negative reviews of the Nest it seems most people want the DropCam back.  I never used one so my experiences are based off the Piper Vs Nest, Nest wins.

I can speak to the person in the house via camera👍 What the company don't tell you is that after 30 day trial your camera is practically worthless unless you pay their monthly fee ($10 or $30).  Their add on amazon is very misleading. In order to maintain what you have during trial that will cost you $30 per month.  I think after spending almost $200 for camera that is un-fair to the consumer. Still debating if going to return to Amazon and look for another camera that does not charge for use of camera.  Very unhappy.  The quality of picture is 5 stars but everything else is not even one star.,Five Stars

I must create clips. In the last few weeks Nest has COMPLETELY ALTERED the format and structure of the timeline, and instead of improving it, has made it IMPOSSIBLE TO USE! It COMPLETELY MALFUNCTIONS IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT. There is zero USABILITY to create clips, go back in time, see the timeline in hrs, mins, or secs ... it just won't let you. It keeps bouncing back to the current time. It's INFURIATING because I must use it often, and now I CAN'T USE IT AT ALL AND I NEED TO. Nest is NOT there for you 24/7, don't believe it. Half the time their reps are shooting in the dark for answers to problems, and reading from manuals. I went from liking this company to HATING it within minutes of them changing it all up. It constantly RE-BOOTS, something you REALLY don't want in a live stream!! Whoever re-designed the functionality must have been a mole trying to undermine the company. He/she is good ... THEY SUCCEEDED. If you choose a high-quality image usability goes down to ZERO. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone unless they revert back to their OLD TIMELINE. It's now IMPOSSIBLE to create a clip. It's a DISASTER and an INFURIATING experience. DO NOT BUY unless you want to be ripped off.",New timeline and clip creating features ARE USELESS AND DO NOT WORK!

But if you are considering purchasing this as a baby monitor I can not recommend AGAINST it enough. We purchased this instead of an actual baby monitor for its WiFi capacity, ability to use existing devices as monitors and positive reviews. However the app turns itself off in the middle of the night every single night. The first night we thought it was a fluke so we reviewed all the settings. The second night it happened again. We realized this was a problem and bought a cheap audio monitor as a back up, thankfully. It happens on our phones and tablets, so it isn’t device specific. We also turned the phone off WiFi and used LTE service and again it still happened, so it isn’t WiFi specific. Unless you want to unintentionally teach your child to cry it out, try a different baby monitor!!!",Terrible as a baby monitor

There's a few second delay in the audio (and most likely video). Nest app randomly turns off sometimes. You can't use your phone and look at best app at same time. The camera gets pretty hot since it's plugged in unlike baby monitors. If you lose internet connection, your monitor won't work. No ""remote control"" function to move or zoom lens like baby monitors. The cord thing that plugs into the camera is so flimsy it's always disconnecting to power randomly and doesn't stay plugged in if you touch it or move it slightly. Pros: you can watch from your phone whenever and wherever you are. You can use it for something else (security camera) once your baby grows and you don't need a monitor anymore. The wide angle lens gives you a shot of the entire room. Quality of picture very sharp at daylight but not at night. You can speak into the camera from your phone and the person can hear you through the camera. I use this function a lot when I'm trying to get my husband to wake up in the morning while I'm downstairs getting ready.",Buy a baby monitor instead

I live outside the US so again I had no issues setting it up even when I selected Asia as my place of residency. The only thing that I noticed is that it should automatically come with a 30 days trial period, and i indeed was able to see the timeline, go back and see previous footage, and are able to highlight the areas of motion sensing. However, last night and all throughout today, I am unable to use this feature because it shows that I ""Need a Nest Aware Subscription"". I contacted Nest support about this, and yet to receive their response. Will give it a few more days and update this review when possible. It is indeed a beautiful camera with many nice perks, I highly recommend it.",Beautiful camera with lots of bells and whistles!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2016,dead0slow0,"I attempted to use the Nest Cam as a security camera for my driveway, mounted high up near the corner of the garage door.  I confirmed a full-strength wi-fi signal in this location using two different phones and a network analyzer app.  I was able to get through the app's camera setup process three times, but only after ridiculously long delays while it hunted for the camera via Bluetooth - despite the fact that my phone was 6 inches from the camera.  Once the app finally found the camera and I was getting a video feed, I found that the camera wouldn't stay connected to wi-fi for more than an hour or so at a time.  After painstakingly troubleshooting the connectivity problem - rebooting the camera and my wireless router, moving the camera closer to the router, swapping out USB cables, trying 2.4GHz vs 5Ghz, deleting and reloading the app, etc. - I tried deleting the camera from the app and starting over.  I went through this same, annoying process two more times.  On the fourth attempt, the camera wouldn't sync up with the app at all - again, with Bluetooth enabled and a piddly 6 inch distance to cover.  What's more, I had purchased the Dropcase outdoor case, and every time I tried to set up the camera, I had to unmount it and extract it from the stupid case just to scan the damn QR code on the back.  I wasted far too many hours trying to get this product to work.  Forget it.",Completely unreliable app-to-camera connectivity

First, the Nest Cam can NOT be setup and configured via a smartphone.  You have to use desktop or laptop that has a USB port.  I use my smartphone for all things internet-related, and this is a needless annoyance in this day and age. Second, the Nest Cam wifi communication failed when a nearby high-wattage LED table lamp was turned on.  If the lamp was on, the Nest Cam was offline. My wifi network is 2.4gHz.  Right next to the Nest Cam was an Infant Optics DXR-8 baby monitor camera which also communicated at 2.4gHz (directly to its portable monitor, not to my wifi LAN.)  It continued to work when the table lamp was on, albeit with a slightly snowy picture.  Sadly, the DXR-8 is only a local monitor, and cannot use the internet for long-range communication. This product is returned.  Will try a Netgear Arlo Q Plus next. EDIT: Bought an Arlo Q Plus.  Setup performed via my smartphone, no desktop or laptop needed.  The Arlo Q Plus worked with the same WiFi signal that the Nest Cam was unable to work with.  The Arlo Q Plus has a microSD card slot for local recording of video, the Nest Cam does not.  I will be keeping the Arlo Q Plus, the Nest Cam has been returned due to non-performance with my WiFi.","Two problems with the Nest Cam, one of them ..."

You're forced to pay a monthly fee to record footage and to even look at your video.  I have no control over my video. A one time fee would be acceptable, I'm not paying a recurring charge for my own video. Pro: Build quality is the first thing you notice. It's phenomenal. It feels good in the hand and you can rotate the camera any way you choose. And it has built in magnet to stick on a metal surface. The setup was simple enough and connected to my home wireless network fairly quick. The video quality was really good. Top notch really. Even the night vision was very good as well. But only being able to see my video after paying a monthly fee is no go for me. I'm returned this camera.",Proprietary cloud storage ONLY

When Nest Cam came out I got one immediately.  It is NOT an improvement.  First off, the company disabled the DropCam HD (black)'s 1080 HD performance quietly from its functionality.  At least give the user a CHOICE if there are bandwidth issues!  NestCam user interface is worse with limited CIRCLE views that may look cleaver but lack in functionality to preview the rooms.  The mini-USB cord that it came with broke off at the seams after a day.  Looks like a bad batch (thus POOR QUALITY CONTROL).  I wish I can buy the DropCam HD but it is discontinued. The camera gets very HOT even with the video tuned down to 720p.  Quality of the images may be slightly better but it doesn't mean much if the functionality, quality, and user interface is worse than the prior version.",DropCam HD is better (the older version is actually better with better ratings)

I cannot stop the midnight notifications. I called Nest support about poor connectivity. The tech and I agreed that I should remove the 4 cameras from my account because they will otherwise wake me up every night. He told me to REMOVE the cameras. He told me that I would get credit. OOPS... that's not actually true. Removing the cameras only puts the the camera's subscription in a holding area.  It does not issue a credit. That's pretty shady, because a credit will actually NEVER come back to me. How do I know this? I called again and was elevated to senior support. They told me that I had to also do one more step in their account system to get that credit issued to me. WOW... Why am I angry? I've removed more than just those 4 cameras today. There were 3 or 4 others that I removed more than a year ago. All this time I had been told that there would be a credit and it would happen automatically. NOT TRUE... Nest has a very complicated scheme that you must follow carefully. Otherwise they will not refund your money. . A PREVIOUS UPDATE:  Before today I gave this app 5 stars for the following. This app is fabulous. It's snappy fast, it allows you to slide through video, even a whole day, very quickly and smoothly. It's simply very nicely done. You can also see all of your cameras at the same time. The app is now quite a lot faster in displaying the videos. Those two or three items were what I needed to see. This brings the NEST app back and even exceeds the quality of the retired DROPCAM app. So I would call this 100% success. Thank You to the new developers for listening to feedback. You have done a great job in bringing this application to a new excellent position. I will definitely recommend Nest equipment to everyone. This is great gear!",Billing issues and Middle of the Night notifications - misinformed techs

It wasn't supposed to pick up cats but that's all I got footage of day and night. Constant alerts. You can't select areas of interest as it states, such as a door or certain location on the screen. It might be ok if you have no pets. I would get a few hundred updates a day to the point I wouldn't even care anymore. It crashes several times an hour and reboots. The interface is a pain to rewind as well. I'd recommend a cheaper higher quality camera.",Easy setup but that's about it

It says on the package that Nest Aware (service) allows you to store 30 days of video. To me, this implies that there is always video even if not 30 days saved. That is not the case. If you don't have Nest Aware ($$$ service) then this is just a still cam, not a video camera.","Only good as a still camera, not a video camera - pony up if you want what it advertises"

Easy to setup, easy to install, having a 1GBps internet really helps though but the camera works flawlessly without any hiccups.  My whole house inside and out is now monitored and I wouldn't mind paying the fee for cloud recording as long as it records everything unlike the Arlos which does record movements primarily.  Since I am in the market for 24/7 security without any local recording requirement, Nest Cam is suited for this purpose.  I see nothing to write negative about. This is just based on experience and would you really think I will buy 13 units (progressively in 2months) if I am not satisfied?  Think! :)",Easy to setup

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2015,NewVoros,"Using it for few days as a baby monitor and really impressed. Setup was really a piece of cake, couple of minutes on Windows then apps were installed on Android and IOs .No issues with association with another account. Everything went really smooth. I am able to watch my baby on all the gadgets we have with no issues. Good picture and voice, good night view, reliable. Mainly we are watching our baby on a dedicated Windows Laptop and it serves our needs. 1080P didn’t really impress me and I didn’t really notice the difference between 720p but I am fine with 720p.  Scheduler is working just fine, no issues so far, switches on and off every time as expected. I am able to turn the cam on/off whenever I want from wherever I want. Not really going to use cloud recording so cannot tell anything about this one. This is my 3rd experience with IP cams which I use to watch my baby. I have the cheapest MyDLINK cam and wouldn’t think to switch to more expensive one until they started having problems with java plugins that running out of support on windows browsers. We are using it now as backup camera. The second one was Simplicam from ArcSoft and I really wanted it to work, but after a week of trying I am returning it coz the software is not reliable and can crash in the middle of the night which is unacceptable when you use it to watch your baby from another room and it costs $150. So my conclusion is that Nest Cam is a good cam to use as a baby monitor, although, it could be cheaper.",Good reliable camera used as a Baby monitor.

One failed and while Nest did honor the warranty, they sent me a refurbished DropCam as a replacement.  I was unhappy with this, but after reading these reviews of the NEST Cam, maybe I should be happy.  But, I suspect the camera is the same but the software is different.  I want to buy two more, but now I am unsure.  I have NEST Thermostats and have mixed feeling about these units plus my AC repair person advises against using them.  Comments that they fail too often to be considered reliable. If NEST can't get it right and soon, then it may be time to move on.  The worst experience was trying to work with the phone support.  A bunch of children who can't make decisions trying to be adults.  Come on.  This is a Google owned company.  You must be able to do better - and NOW.",maybe I should be happy. But

We have ours because we have a new baby sitter coming to watch our kids and this works out well so that I can monitor what is going on while I am away.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2015,STL Mark,"I own 4 dropcam pros and was anxious to try the new product. Dropcam Pro units sold prior to the buyout from Nest were sold as 1080p cameras. after nest purchased they downgraded that to 720p to make it easier to produce a camera that would offer features that the dropcam didn't have. The new Nestcam does have the 1080p option. But you are forced to use the very poorly designed Nest app with these new cameras. Your old dropcam app won't see the new cameras.  Interestingly the Nestcams show up slower in the app than the prior dropcam pros. I don't understand why they would drop a feature like the automatic activation of the cameras when you leave the house, but Nestcams no longer have that. I returned the Nestcams I purchased and purchased another Dropcam Pro from a local retailer. I am able to use that with my better designed dropcam app and hope that nest will sell off the entire camera division back to the original Dropcam owners or a similar motivated group.","Not a well designed copy, terrible app."

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jul 2015,Brent,"We bought the Nest Cam as a replacement baby monitor for an entry level Foscam that had lousy picture quality.  Unfortunately, the Nest Cam doesn't cut it as a stand alone baby monitor and we now use both to monitor one crib.  After my fabulous experience with the Nest themostat, I blindly assumed that they would not bring an unpolished product to market, but was sorely mistaken. Pros: In bright light the picture quality and viewing angle are good. The magnetic base is sturdy and provides good adjustability and mounting options. Setup was easy and I didn't have to download a second app to control the camera and the thermostat. Controlling the camera from my phone is nice, when it works Cons: Low light video quality is poor and grainy. Pixels flicker/move a lot making it difficult to see subtle movements (i.e. the breathing that every parent looks for!).  Screen often shows bright flashes (attempting to auto-focus or adjust for lighting?). The streaming is slow to load, spends a lot of time buffering and sometimes just doesn't work even on a 300 Mbps connection and top of the line wireless router. The communication feature only seems to work on my Android app and not on my wife's iPhone. I can never seem to stream from the camera when I'm not on my home wifi, although my Verizon 4G data connection streams other videos beautifully. No way to do a passive wake on noise/movement.  Just an option for notifications. Other reviewers pointed out the lack of geo-fencing capability, which will severely limit the functionality of this camera when redeployed for security. Waiting for my Nest thermostat to declare us auto-away or having to manually set to away isn't acceptable in today's smart home environment. Unit runs very hot. Power cord is strangely bulky, inflexible and actually interferes with the base at some angles Bottom line: Feels like Nest rushed this to market and leveraged their goodwill for a quick cash infusion  from early adopters.  In doing so they've lost my trust. I'll never pre-order a Nest product again and will instead wait for the reviews to roll in first.",Trusted Nest brand and ended up disappointed

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jun 2015,Brian Wilson,"I have 5 Dropcam Pros, and now 1 Nest Cam (as of today).  Short review: the Nest Cam experience TODAY is pretty terrible, even worse if you have both old Dropcams and the new Nest Cam.  I'm hoping it improves over the next few months? The hardware seems ""fine"" - same form factor as before now with the word ""Nest"" silk screened on the front instead of Dropcam. However, since most of the Dropcam founders and employees all left, clearly the new Nest/Google employees are having trouble integrating it.  If you saved one of the old Dropcam email alerts, you can still log into the old style website by clicking on one of those email alerts, and the old Dropcam website still works the same (thank goodness) but IT ONLY SHOWS YOUR OLD DROPCAM PROS (not the new Nest Cameras you have added to the account).  But if you sign into the Nest homepage, you see all your cameras (both Nest and Dropcam Pro) HOWEVER the billing information is wrong - it says they are all on free trial.  Go back and check the account by clicking on an old dropcam alert email and you get the correct billing state of your old Dropcam Pros. Couple this with the Nest Web Interface is a STRAIGHT DOWNGRADE.  The timeline no longer has clear ""event bars"" when events occurred, I think it lost colors of events, you cannot see the names of the events anymore while watching video (the ""event key"").  IT IS STILL BASED ON FLASH (so you still cannot view the video on an iPad without the special purpose app, effectively making it impossible to share in a mobile world).  The old Dropcam interface was slow but easy to use, the new Nest interface is abysmally slow and really terrible, hard to use.  It's a straight downgrade, except it added the ability to change the Nest cam up to 1080p (oh yeah, it isn't 1080p by default - by default you have yourself a Dropcam Pro with a worse interface).  The login and preview performance is ALARMINGLY BAD - I timed it at 65 seconds to log in and see a video feed.  The old Dropcam Pro wasn't speedy, but it was maybe three or four times faster than that at 15 seconds to log in and see a video feed? So at this point I have no idea what to do, I figure I could: 1) Wait and hope somebody reports this problem to Google and they solve it by migrating my Dropcam account subscription preferences over to Nest. ... or .... 2) Abandon the old Dropcam account info, hope this doesn't kill my roll back history, attempt to license all the Dropcams and the Nest through the new Nest interface.  And hope that Nest/Google improve the performance and the User Interface of the web page. I think I'll give it a few days, hope and pray it gets better (maybe the website is slow for the launch week?) I'm so bummed out that Dropcam sold out to Nest/Google.  They were really good guys, but they are now gone and they left a mediocre team of people who don't care behind.  :-(  If this doesn't improve, I'll have to go struggle to setup some other security camera situation, and I just loved how easy Dropcam was.  On the up side, maybe I can repurpose a GoPro - they have MUCH better resolution than the Nest or Dropcam with a better picture - they just don't have any software that was near as good as the Dropcam web experience used to be.",Muddled deployment of a rebranded product - but I still have hope?

Video seems to be of very good quality and the night vision works well. However we have been seeing several small bugs in the accompanying iOS app (version 5.1.2.8). Upon launch, the app frequently spins indefinitely trying to begin video streaming, and after 30 sec we frequently feel the need to force quit & relaunch. The on/off toggle is also sometimes flaky; turning it on often doesn't start video streaming without force quitting again. There are a few other inconsistencies and UI bugs that are annoying and surprising given the otherwise good attention to detail in the device itself.","Great home camera, with good looking but often-buggy iOS app"

I'll update the review if they are able to eventually resolve the problem, but so far, I'm very unimpressed.  The product, in theory, has all the features that I need, and the initial setup was quite simple.

After Dropcam was bought by Google (Nest), you'd think they would significantly improve things. Problems: - Cannot 2x, 5x, 10x videos.  Really?  Fundamental - Cannot slide the time slider on the web dashboard.  You have to click the forward button which goes every 30 seconds.  Awful.  I'll likely return this product simply on this fact alone as this was one of the functions I expected in my application - The Nest login page doesn't work with lastpass.  Crazy, this is the first site I've ever used that didn't work with lastpass.  Not sure why but really annoying - The motion detect is not so good.  I am monitoring a product that flashes lights when activates, and want to know when this happens and the motion activation doesn't trigger off of it.  Also, it would be great if you could zoom in, leave it zoomed in, create an activation zone, and activate of of motion in that zone.  When you zoom in and create an activation zone, then go back to the unzoomed picture, the activation zone size is enlarged to that screen.  :/ - When I save a clip to the cloud (I have the Nest Aware upgrade service), it automatically condenses it into a 2 minute timelapsed video.  This stinks as I need to see more time resolution for my application.  And, they limit the cloud space to 3 hours of these video clips.  I'd rather have 3 hours of continuous video with the option to speed through it (e.g. 2x, 5x, 10x, etc.) I really expected more from Nest on this one.  Fundamental things are missing, and what's worse, I'm pretty sure Dropcam had some of these features with past products.  The only thing I can say positive about this product is that the hardware seems to be well designed.",Lots of fundamental features missing.  Very disappointed

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jul 2015,TK Horn,"Dropcam (original product before near bought it) was a much better product. Nest's app is terrible for multiple cameras--you can't simultaneously view multiple cameras which renders it useless unless you only have one camera. Also, the feed is slower and there are more interruptions than dropcam had. I have one dropcam and when it came time to buy a second one, I bought a nest cam which I regret. I should have bought a second dropcam so I could continue to use the far superior dropcam app instead of being stuck with the newer and far inferior nest app.","Nest ruined a great product, Dropcam"

So hot that I decided against using it as a baby monitor. Nest says it's normal, but I say it's a design flaw. Maybe you feel comfortable placing overheating electronics  in your child's bedroom, I don't. Also, I don't like that Nest is forcing the video stream to go through the cloud (no local storage option). Competitors usually offer that option. Finally, unlike other cameras, the Nest is not motorized... So I returned my Nest camera and bought a couple of Foscams. I'm so glad I did.",Overheats - dangerous

But after reading the responses by a very courteous and intelligent customer service person, I realized I should give it a try.  I received my Nest Cam today and started installing it.  To my surprise every thing went so smoothly.  The hardware I believe is a good improvement from DropCam Pro (My first unit is a Drocam Pro).  The software and installation process is simple and I'm satisfied with the outcome.  I have high speed internet connection at home( Fios average 20mbs+ for download and upload.) I'm sure there were bugs and problems during the transition period when Google took over.  BTW knowing the Customer Service personnel who was patient and understood the frustration and responed to all the negative emails was not an easy job.  He/she has been caring for their customers.",Still a great security camera !

I had the same issue as other reviewers, seeing the ""this device is already associated with another account"" error during the ""one minute setup"" that turned into a 45 minute attempt (lots of time on hold) with no resolution.  To their credit, the lady at customer support who assisted me was very pleasant.  However, as it stands now, customer support is supposed to call me back within 24 hours to arrange an EXCHANGE of the camera.  REALLY???

I'm pleased to say that thus far the Nest cam is performing at the same level as the DropcamPro and I'm quite pleased.  More to come as our usage increases. Update:  Performing well in concert with the two existing Dropcam Pro units both day and night.  No problems thus far, with the exception of the occasional disconnect from WiFi which could be a Comcast issue as well.  Will likely purchase a second Nest cam to round out the house surveillance bubble with 4 cameras.  Love the wide field of view.",NestCam vs DropcamPro

Sometimes they will be good for weeks on end and some weeks they will disconnect 3-4 times a week and i have to re-add them to my account. The app has many bugs, one is when you zoom in and then zoom out all of the icons disappear. he other bug is when you open they app, in order to connect you have to hit the ""retry connection"" button 3-6 times before it will connect. The most disturbing one of all is when the cameras will turn on in the middle of the night by themselves and record everything you did at night after the lights went out. Its never all of the cameras that turn on just the one in my living room, bedroom and kitchen. I really feel that these are not ready for consumers even though they have been out for years. Its quite scary waking up in the morning to find out youve been recorded all night. I wish i could return these cameras.

If anything happens, you'll know it within 24 hours and you can make a clip of it.  That should be it.  The camera is EXTREMELY sensitive to WiFi signals if its mounted outside and I get many many . . . Many more notices that its ""offline"" than I do that there is something going on.  Just plan on getting a WiFi booster and keeping track of its connection.  Samsun offers a camera, same features, with a 16 gig chip and no subscriptions.  I don't sign contracts for cell phones and I avoid subscriptions.  They should have a better plan. I get more notices that the camera is offline than i do anything else.  Its near the router and I've even bought a booster . . . 1) None of the ""features"" work UNLESS you pay for a subscription. 2) You should be able to use the camera and full ""features"" just by buying and patronizing the manufacturer.  But in this case you pay for the camera and then are charged extra for it to work as promised. 3) I tried to return the two I bought when it was made clear that the camera cannot be used for what I needed, and they refused. 4) I didn't buy the camera for ""as little as 30 cents a day"" in order to get it to work as advertised. 5)  Samsung has one just like it, same features and recording, but you don't pay to make it work.

Easy to setup, if you have difficulty setting up you can use computer. Thinking of buying more if nest aware was free for add on camera's. If if your thinking of getting a camera this is the one. Not sure why people ratting it low. It's simple to use, and it works.",Best camera by far with awesome service!

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jul 2015,AZ Jack,"Just bought this on Amazon right before going on a Cruise and wanted to be able to keep track of the house and the dog while we were away.  It worked great!  Set-up was very easy.  In less than 5 minutes I had it out of the box, plugged in and linked to our nest account (we already have had two Nest thermostats for several years), and was able to monitor the cam on my laptop, iPhone and iPad with no trouble.  You get a free 30-day cloud storage account so I was able to scan back through time at motion triggered events.  Both the web interface and the iPhone interface through the app allow you to do this.  Simply by clicking the skip back button on the interface, I was able to scan through events, or look at a list of them and pick from there.  I like having access to the camera through the same app that we always use to run the Nest thermostats.  While on vacation we were able to check on activity in the house and hear what is going on, both live or recorded. The camera worked flawlessly with no problems.  The only slight issue I had was through the web interface in safari when I tried to activate the microphone.  A flash player pop-up window tries to allow you to grant access to the website to control your computers microphone, but I could not click on the pop-up box to change the settings.  This was easily fixed though by accessing the Flash Player Control panel in system preferences and granting access to the home.nest.com website there.  I also think think the microphone activation screen in the iPhone app could be better designed as it covers up a significant portion of the screen when activated, but this is minor and does not affect how well it works. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. UPDATE:  After 3 weeks with the Nest Cam I'm liking it more and more.  I felt compelled to comment after seeing all these negative reviews.  The cam continues to work flawlessly and I have had no issues at all.  I moved it to our front door and have since purchased a 2nd cam.  Another feature I love is the ability to set up multiple motion zones through the interface.  I noticed it was detecting motion after every car past by in the field of vision which includes the street in front of our house.  I set up a motion zone so it would only flag motion near the front door.  When you go back to the interface and scroll back through time, it puts dots on the progress bar and they are color code to match the zone that was triggered.  So I can actually skip through each event triggered by a car passing by, or the different colored events triggered by someone coming to the front door.  I can also add more trigger zones which are then represented in the progress/history playback bar by their own unique color. I have had no issues with bandwidth.  I do have relatively fast internet service (30Mb down and 2Mb Up) so maybe that's why I have had no bandwidth issues while others have.  I've been running at 720p.  I set it to 1080p for awhile and yes, the picture quality was terrific, but even at 720p it's pretty darn good. Maybe I'm lucky, but the device has been great for me and I remain happy.",Easy Set-up and works great with no problems.  Very happy.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2015,Computerdude1032,"The Nest Cam is expensive.  The camera itself is probably lower quality than the one built into your iPhone.  There is some added infrared lighting for night vision, which does work great.  That being said, it can't cost them more than $40 to make one of these.  I could excuse the insanely high markup, if it was not for the $100/year subscription required to use it. To be fair to Nest, the $100/year price is probably pretty fair.  When you're talking cloud, bandwith is always the most expensive part of the equation. That being said, they could make the subscription feel more valuable by increasing the storage time.  The base option should be 30 days, and the higher option should be a year.  Storage is dirt cheap and that would make the service feel more valuable without costing Nest anything.  Also, there should be a free option that includes 480p video quality stored for a rolling 24 hours.  After all, you did just spend $200 on this camera so it should do something. What's even more frustrating is the lack of common sense features.  Having to manually go into the app and set your home/away status is insane.  Nest is owned by Google and Google knows everything.  There are about a million ways Google could determine whether you are home or not.  The most obvious being - the location of your phone.  Of course, if you buy their $100 smoke detector suddenly they can magically determine whether or not you are home.  That makes sense.  Another poorly implemented feature is the notifications... They do not come right away.  Why would I care if someone was in my house 15 minutes ago?  I care if they are in there now, so I can call the police before they leave.  The delay is a joke. Finally - the video quality is NOT 1080p.  Its pretty horrendous.  It would never be good enough to prove in a court who burgularized your house.  I have 50mbps internet from Comcast and a brand new router, so its NOT my internet causing the poor video quality. The camera just sucks.  Even if you set it to 1080p. All that being said - I knew most of these cons and I bought it anyways.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of competition.  Also, you know Nest isn't going anywhere since they are owned by Google, so there's not really a risk of the cloud recording suddenly going away.  It's sad that I bought something that I knew was a 1 star product just because its the best available.  Entrepreneurs take note - with a more little common sense and a little less greed, you could easily become the best product in this (quickly growing) market. ****UPDATE: PLEASE IGNORE COMMENTS FROM NEST BELOW**** Nest is responding to all negative reviews in an attempt to discredit our reviews.  Please ignore their comments below, because they clearly missed most of my points.  Rather than taking feedback, they are more interested in convincing everyone that everything is fine and dandy.  This is a garbage product and Google should be ashamed.  They have not issued any updates for the Nest Android App since the Nest Cam came out, despite all the hate on here and the app store.","Overpriced, low quality video, and missing common sense features"

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Sep 2015,Austin H.,"TL;DR: For baby monitor usage, this is a dangerous product. While I'd rate the industrial design and user experience design a 5, the service is a horrifying 1 star.  For a product marketed to monitor a baby's safety or a home's security, they are absolutely failing on service reliability. Nest advertises this as a baby cam, numerous online articles support this.  I bought full-in, two cameras for the nursery, excited about the potential of this product.  I love well-designed products, and am excited about the ""connected home"" concepts coming out. Over the past month, I've had numerous issues, chipping away entirely at our confidence in the service.  And you HAVE to use the service to use the camera. Specific examples of issues encountered while attempting to monitor the safety of our baby girl: - Camera randomly goes offline (regular occurrence) - Camera randomly shut down and disappeared from account while in use (rendering Nest Cam unusable for the night) - Image freezes on frame of baby sleeping (while it turns out the baby was awake and moving unbeknownst to me) - Recent entire system outages with zero accessibility to nest accounts, and thus Nest Cams and Dropcams - Communication from Nest about issues is abysmal.  System status page reflects ""no problems"" when there are catastrophic problems.  Zero proactive communication from Nest about issues, vague and delayed communication on twitter account.  Get the feeling they're not being up front about issues. You cannot trust this company's service to be reliable at this time.  And given how problematic this has been, I have to wonder if I can even trust my very private data to them.  What are they doing over there? Get it together.  I REALLY want to believe in your product, I really want to buy all-in, but I cannot place my family's safety in the hands of a company who clearly does not have their act together.",I love well-designed products

We were excited about the product and the fact that we could finally keep an eye on the baby without having to worry about the product functioning properly. After a good first week, the product started giving a major lag. Sometimes, without us realizing, the product would stop streaming and the timer on the view screen would still keep ticking fooling us into believing that its still working. As a result,one unfortunate evening our 9 month old took a tumble from our bed and we realized only when we heard a loud cry coming from the room. The cam did not indicate any motion and was still displaying that our baby was fast asleep.We no longer rely on it and observed the cam malfunctioning several times (screen is cut off, audio is cut off, timer is on but the streaming stops, more than 15 seconds of lag). We are highly dissappointed and plan to return the cam. Our traditional baby monitor is way more reliable and cheaper.",Not worth the heartache and money

In addition you apparently get  banner ads if you do not pay for the stored images. I did not know that the camera has to be attached to the modem.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jun 2015,TheArtOfFussy,"I am so indifferent about this camera right now. Alot of that started with the reviews which I put as much effort into reading as I do writing my own. But, I was one of the early adopters who ordered the camera before it came out, so I missed out on all of that. Two days before mine came in the mail the first reviews started coming out and it turned me off a little bit. What I was so excited to order literally sat on the dining room table for three days. Today (6.28.15) I finally opened it. Here are my initial thoughts. Pros: I seem to be one of the lucky few who didn’t have any issues setting up the Nest Cam. Setup really did take less than a minute. I plugged it in scanned the QR code and everything just connected. The picture is fine for me, but I have it installed in a well lit daylight basement facing the windows, so it is as expected (I thought I was getting an extra security camera). More on that later ... The magnet works really well. I stuck it to a bunch of random things and it connected with a really strong bond. Cons: Night vision for me is pretty fuzzy. It could be the temperature in the basement, but just haven’t experienced this with my other cameras, and not our actual security camera in the basement. Having to pay a monthly fee without even the option to self record is just offensive. I’m no engineer, but I don’t think adding the code to allow for recording to a drive, cloud, etc would have been a bank breaker for Google/Nest, but that’s just me. HOW THE HECK IS THE HOME & AWAY function supposed to cover me if there is a break in? If I chose to use the home and away setting then the Nest cam will shut off when an intruder passes by the thermostat. Uhhh. That’s not how this works, that’s not how any of this works. It gets pretty hot. Like don’t put it near anything else hot. That is something I don’t have an issue with at all with the Foscam and it does run all the time. Indifferent: In replacing the geo-fencing for turning the camera on and off, you can set timers. This is fine if you are always on a schedule, but who is anymore. But that’s helpful to thieves. they love schedules and consistent routines. I purchased this on my LONG journey to self monitoring my home and cutting down the $80+ a month I pay for home security. Nest, and many other companies have a long way to go before I start investing more money in their products in an effort to get rid of that monthly bill. That's one of the reasons that losing geo-fencing was a deal breaker for me, but I’m not sure if I would have loved it that much more with it. I guess I was just expecting to be wowed the way I was with my Nest Thermostat two years ago. Maybe one day.",I am so indifferent about this camera right now

The camera was very warm.  It may have overheated.  I have unplugged it and reconnected it several times.  When it was on, I was able to use the speaker function - I talked into my iPhone and I could hear my voice at the camera, but the microphone function did not work.  I could not hear sound captured by the camera while viewing through the app on my phone.  My phone's volume was turned up.  In conclusion, the Nest Cam is going back.  It does not work at all. Edit: I called Nest tech support and they are going to have an engineer call me tomorrow.  They will most likely have me ship it back to them and send me another one.  The camera is getting power because it is still very warm.  It just won't tun on. Edit 6/28/15:  I received a replacement Nest Cam on Friday.  They sent a return label to ship back the defective one.  The replacement connected easily via the app and the device is working as it should.  It still gets very warm, though.  It's cool device and works as advertised, but I'm not sure it is worth the cost, especially when you factor in the cost of a subscription.  I got it so I can see what my parrot is up to all day and freak him out by talking to him through the camera. I also got it as a security camera.  The wide angle lens can see a lot of my house from the kitchen counter and it instantly gives me an alert whenever there is movement (usually my bird), so it serves its purpose there.  I guess my biggest dislike, aside from the cost, is the power cable.  The cable seems way to thick for such a small device. One would think the cord would be about the thickness of an iPhone cable, but it is as thick as most full size power cords, which makes it rather unsightly sitting on the kitchen counter.  It's not so bad if you position the camera right near a power outlet and tie up the cord, but that's not exactly convenient.  I guess we can forget about ever having a Nest Cam with an internal rechargeable battery.  Based on the power this thing consumes it would drain any battery in a few minutes.  When I was on the phone with the engineer I mentioned that I could not get the sound to work both ways.  He said they had to disable the two way communication and it now has push to talk - you can't hear sound when you are actively using the microphone.  But it does pick up sound well.","Works, but not really worth the cost"

However, due to an ongoing technical glitch it appears that Nest Cam owners are unable to purchase Nest Aware subscriptions, which provide 10- or 30-day video storage. The result is that the Nest Cam is useless. All you are able to do is view a live stream. This is unbelievably frustrating. Nest support has told me that they do not know how long it will take to resolve this issue. They had expected to have it resolved on June 29 or so.","Nest Aware currently unavailable, rendering the Nest Cam useless."

THIS IS NOT HELPFUL. My two year old now talks about the light in his room. This security fix is just a burden to the owner. If people are hacking into the cameras then Nest should fix this vulnerability and not outsource this work to the owner. Now we have electrical tape covering the light. So, if we needed to see the light for some other status issue, it has become useless.

If you read this review until the end, you will know why I get it from Amazon... WHAT I LIKE The design: Impressive build quality and design. The design sleek and minimal compare to its predecessor. Looking at it's appearance, and it's weight, you can tell it built with quality material. It doesn't gives you the plastic feel and a typical 'IP Cam' look and it can easily blend in to your home environment. You don't want to place an ugly IP Cam in front of your baby's cradle or your modern living room. The easiness to setup: This is one of the simplest and easiest setup I have ever gone through. You only need to download app, and key in you network pass code. Right after that, you will be able to access the video feed. There are a lot of similar product out there which require you to change the port forwarding on the router but hey, as a normal home user we don't really care how the technical setup, we just need something that easy to maintain. Nest Cam is the 'Apple product' in IP Cam world. The video quality: The video quality is great with the options to go from 720 to 1080 resolution within get the app. We used to treat IP Cam a tool for surveillance and security purpose but with the 1080 resolution makes you feel you are really presence in that location. Technology no longer serve the basic needs but it's connecting you with your loves one too. (You can even talk and listen - hear the baby or tell your dog to get off the couch!) WHAT I DISLIKE The price tag: It will be really beneficial if Nest willing to lower down the price. I would really willing to purchase a couple more unit for different purpose but the price tag stopping me for doing that. For it to be of any use you need to pay the subscription, and it is a per camera subscription, which can get expensive fast. Come on Nest, is this the best you can offer us? The mobile apps: The mobile app has limited functionality when it comes to history or alerts. So far I have not received any alerts and I think it takes time for the Nest cloud computing algorithm to analyze. Ps. Side notes I do read a reviewer here stating that he got a display unit and it was paired. I am lucky to get a complete new unit from Bestbuy therefore I decide to get my second unit from Amazon although the shipping takes longer. I just want to avoid the problem he is facing. I will constantly update this review as I still need more time to explore and test on it. Thanks.","Not bad at all, But..."

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Nov 2016,Andreas,"There are many reasons to like this camera, which my wife and I have been using primarily as a baby monitor, coupled with a cheap audio-only monitor. The image quality is excellent, and the iOS app is very easy to use (although it is not clear to me that you can customize notification settings for each user—something which would make it much better).  The build quality seems very good and the camera is quite sleek and easy to set up.  Based on these qualities, you might think that I would give it 5 stars. However, our Nest Cam is currently sitting disconnected, unplugged and in its box—serving as a very expensive paperweight—for one very disquieting reason.  We noticed not long after we started using it that, every now and then, the green light would start flashing, indicating that someone was monitoring the video feed.  The problem was that neither myself nor my wife was using the app when the camera would start blinking, suggesting that someone else was watching us. We immediately changed both our passwords, but the occasional blinking continued. Creepy, you say? I agree. We've reached out to Nest customer support, who confirmed that the blinking light is used to indicate that someone is watching the feed.  They assured us almost two weeks ago that they would look into the problem, but we still have no answer (and no follow-up from customer support).  It goes without saying that we have not used the camera since we discovered this issue, and cannot keep using it when there is a risk that somebody is watching our feed (including us and our baby).  I will update this review if and when this problem is resolved.  Until then, we cannot recommend this product.",Very serious privacy concerns

I want to have the control of where my video goes to. This is by no means a useful home security camera, unless you pay them a monthly service fee.  Amazon failed to mention that part.

It was super hot when I went to check on it after the setup process, since it was saying it was offline.  It sounds like other reviewers experienced this as well.  My Dropcam Pro never generated heat like this and it is still going strong. Nest also took away the feature that disables the camera when you get back home based on your GPS location.  Instead, they redirect you to their other products (thermostat, smoke alarm) to get that feature back in the app.  That was the one feature that made it acceptable to put an always-on cloud recording device in your home.

It's not perfect (most products are not) but in the end it gets the job done better than anything else available and plays well with my other installed products. I do love the nest support if you need it and the fact that they take customer feedback and use it for product improvements. I see new features added very often and they are usually well thought out and implemented. It's always great to have a product that continues to get better with time without requiring any additional purchases. Nest like Apple will send the same updates to every device so that you are constantly in possession of the most up to date software no matter if you have the older or newer version (hardware) of the product - THATS huge! Now for what I see as areas of need for improvement. These may or may not be deal breakers for those looking at purchasing: There are still bugs to be worked out in the hardware and software to increase the rating. The software keeps turning my cameras off because of the schedule I have set EVEN when everyone is away from home! This is almost a deal breaker for me. I had to keep checking my cameras every day we were on vacation and turning them back on because they would auto shut off each morning per schedule....they were supposed to STAY on while we were away - incredibly frustrating and I missed huge chunks of days. Thankfully no one attempted to rob us those days but WHAT IF?!? The hardware - the camera runs too HOT, I mean hot to touch when in use. There needs to be better ventilation or cooler processors. I can't imagine these little cameras will last long with that amount of heat output. Also, when pointed outside the software gives false activity readings/alerts when shadows move across the lawn....it gets really annoying to get constant alerts about the shade changing in your yard - boy cries wolf scenario because I tend to ignore my alerts now since I get so many false ones. An additional feature I would want to see added for the security cameras is the emergency call number listed on the NEST home screen so that in the event of an emergency the number is accessible at the touch of your nest home screen. This way if I see my home is being burglarized I can easily and quickly touch the emergency call number I have previously entered on file with NEST and be connected directly to my set police dispatch. In these situations every moment counts and this would add time back to the NEST owners side vs the burglar. This could be a 5-star product with just a little tweaking & with the NEST support team I have confidence it eventually will. I love that nest actually listens to its consumers for product improvement. I hope these improvements come sooner rather than later.",Not Perfect but pretty close!
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2015,bhart,"I am so glad I did not come on Amazon to review all these negative reviews before I purchased my Nest Cam because I LOVE it.  I went down to Best Buy to investigate alternates and the sales person, who has four in his home, gave me a personal demonstration.  Then he told me these were price protected (i.e., Amazon won't have a better deal), so I bought two on the spot.  The day light video is outstanding even in 720p and the video in low light (or darkness) is great too.  My landlord came in while was not home and I captured it all including good audio.  As far as set-up: I timed myself and it took all of about 20 minutes to set up the first one and less for the second one.  I do not have super duper high speed internet and it worked fine but, I did try the 080p because quite frankly I'm not filming a Hollywood movie here and the 720p works great.  The camera's themselves are very high quality metal and heavy.  The only drawback is the guy at customer support was a little clueless and I had to figure out a few thing on my own.  For example, I could not figure out what the ""Alert"" was that it sent (i.e., text, email, ?) when someone activated the camera by movement or sound.  And he didn't know either!  What? Are you customer support?  Very strange. Then I figured it out and the ""alert"" is great.  They send a little Icon (which is the shape of a house) to your phone.  If your phone has not been touched for a while (and the apps close down) it shows up on the screen saver page.  And if your app page is up since you've been active on your phone, the alert (i.e., the little house icon) shows up at the top of the phone screen where all the other little ""alert"" apps line up.  I also thought it was only showing 8-10 second video clips (and then shutting off) and I called customer support again and he could not tell me what was wrong.  The guy was nice but, totally clueless.  Then I had to figure it out on my own again.  I did not notice that at the end of the little clip there is a ""continue"" button at the bottom which, once pushed, showed the entire history of the video clip.  The reason they only show segments of the video when you look at the history is so you can pick out a point out where you want the video to start.  Or simply start from the beginning.  The one other drawback and I did not deduct stars for this:  I obviously don't like paying $150 a year for the cloud memory to get the 10 day play back.  They charge $100 for the first devise and $50 thereafter for each additional devise.  But, for the peace of mind, that's cheap to me.  Overall, this is absolutely the coolest gadget and I'd recommend them to anybody that wants to keep tabs on what's happening at home.",These are fabulous.  I'm buying another.

Well, its a sucky camera and an even suckier baby monitor. Now I've recently learned that Nest Cam is now saying these shouldn't be used as baby monitors (not the case at the time I was wanting one so they're probably covering their butts now) but since it's not even a good camera is doesn't really matter. The thing shuts off randomly EVERY time I use it. That means, when I'm trying to watch my baby nap I suddenly can't anymore. If you're using it for home security, you'll be SOL if it turns off while someone is robbing you. And it doesn't alert you that it's no longer working or that it's buffering endlessly so if you get busy doing other tasks and just wait to hear for a peep from your baby, you are double in trouble. I learned that the hard way yesterday when i went to nap in my room as the baby napped in his. The camera turned off and when I woke up, turned it back on, and there he was screaming away for god knows how long.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 May 2016,Beam,"This is a review of the first generation Nest Cam. I've spent an hour setting this up again, and the error messages it provides are routinely in error. After trying to switch off the auto-alert that sends an email after it detects motion, I logged in and turned it off. But in the process, it wouldn't accept my correct password, so I reset it, and then it accepted it, but then rejected it soon thereafter, making it impossible to log on. I try to hook up the Nest Cam, and it says there's no wireless router connected to the internet, which in fact there is. Then I reset the modem, and I get yet another error message. It's one error message after another, and every time you try to follow the instructions NEST provides, it simply doesn't work. I've spent an hour on this, just because I wanted to turn off the motion detector, and it's been one problem after another. (On the iPad, the page display is so bad that the Apple keyboard takes up half the screen, and you can barely see the area where you log in a password.) The product used to work fine before it was bought out by another company, which has complicated matters to such a degree that I think they must be in collusion with the engineers at Microsoft who wrote the code for Microsoft Word, which (for the Mac) is a nightmarish, bloated, confusing, bug-ridden program. Nest Cam gets my vote as the second worst product I've ever attached to my computer.","Nest Cam (first generation) set-up instructions and error messages are misleading, wrong, and endlessly frustrating.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Sep 2015,morning fog,"Installing/Setup Setting up this camera really took about 60 seconds as the company claims. Once I figured out the location and the USB power wiring, the rest was easy; all I had to do was basically connect the cam to my home network using the Nest app. Since I already have other Nest products and app running, it was a matter of adding another device. I’ve had DLink cams and others in the past, but none of them were this easy to setup. Nest Cam The built quality is stunning. I like the simple, yet smart, design of the product. It can be mounted almost anywhere due to the way it designed. Especially, I love the strong magnetic plate on the bottom of the stand. This stand makes it easy and clean to mount / attach / remove on the metal surface (or any other surfaces using included metal mounting plate). The whole cam is painted in black, but the included USB cable is white. It could have been nice if Nest had supplied a black cable instead, but the fact that they did not is not important. The default video setting is 720p, but it is capable of 1080p. According to my nonscientific test, data consumption was approx. 1.2MB/min. at 720p and 3MB/min at 1080p streaming. Maintaining connection was steady at 720p, but at 1080p it seemed less steady. However, the video quality was the best I’ve ever seen on nanny cam and home security cam at both HD resolutions. The image was clear, bright, and sharp. The image has very good overall density from shadow to light. Even the night vision quality was superb among others. The IR range was so good; it covered the entire living room (where I setup the cam) even on complete darkness. Also, the wide angle (130 degree) is helpful covering big space. Monitoring So how does it work? Monitoring capability and functionality rely on the software side. And just like the other Nest products, the cam works nice (almost perfect). Like the Nest thermostat and the protect (smoke detector), the cam works seamlessly well with the Nest app. Streaming 720p feed was smooth and flawless. All the usual functions such as ‘Rotate image’, ‘Talk&Listen chime’, ‘Status Light’, and ‘Notification’ works well as expected. Streaming 1080p, however, requires faster upload speed at home and faster download speed on the smartphone or tablet. Most of the time, it worked fine on my phone (outside) where I had more than 3 bars of LTE. Sometimes, it took little longer than several seconds to receive the video feed although I have 50mbps upload at home. On the camera’s end, it is capable of 1080p with my 50mbps upload speed, yet on the phone’s end, it really depends on the cellular’s data speed which heavily varies on location by location, I decide to use default 720p video setting. For me, 720p video is sufficient for home security purpose unless digital zoom is used on the cam. Notification with the motion / sound detection also works seamlessly. With the Nest Aware subscription, I can define selected areas to have the motion detection activated. Without the subscription, it still works well and it just covers the overall area. Overall, I would give four stars to this cam. The hardware/software built quality and image quality is the best among others, in my opinion. Also, user friendliness and simplicity of everything is what makes this camera wonderful. However, there’s one downside: the subscription model. I have to pay $100/year to access 10 day recording history. Without paying the subscription, there’s currently no way to record my own video feed. For $10 a month, this might be the best and easiest thing to handle and maintain the home security footages, if one can afford. Configuring and maintaining home network to have the server record the feed can be a big headache and costly. Without the subscription, I will still be able to monitor and get notifications on the app if motion is detected. Tapping ‘Away’ from ‘Home’ will still turn on the cam automatically. I will simply have no recordings of my own video feed after the 30 day free Nest Aware trial. I strongly believe there should be an option to either record or not on my end without monthly subscription. I wish Google and Nest would consider implementing this option or feature of built in microSD slot on the cam in the future. Lastly, Google and Nest, please make the ‘Home & Away’ feature works with the ‘Auto Away’ from my nest thermostat, so I don’t have to manually open the Nest app and tab on the ‘Away’ button to turn on the cam every time I leave the house. If ‘Auto Away’ can turn on the cam automatically, it might be really worth subscribing.",almost….perfect
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2015,EJ,"Nest Cam is explicitly advertised as a baby monitor replacement (from the Nest Cam homepage - ""Did the baby wake up?"" and ""Hear when the baby wakes up""), but it does not work for that at all. Now that I have bought it and been thoroughly disappointed, I have found the many reviews identifying these issues.  So it's clear that Nest knows the Nest Cam DOES NOT WORK as a baby monitor, and yet it STILL advertises the product as a baby monitor.  They are intentionally misleading potential buyers in order to pump their sales.  Nice growth hacking guys. Why doesn't it work? A baby monitor needs 100% uptime - otherwise there's no point.  If you're asleep, and the monitor dies, you will not hear your baby.  Nest however doesn't get close.  If it loses its internet connection, it often does not reconnect, and will not give any notification that it is no longer receiving.  This is fatal for a baby monitor application.  And app also sometimes just crashes for no reason.  So as a user, you have zero confidence that you will actually be able to hear your baby overnight. A real, purpose-built baby monitor has a very important feature to address this - if it loses its signal, it beeps, loudly, until the connection returns or it is turned off. Which means you wake up, and can fix the issue. It's also a much simpler technology, so there is no fear of crashing. Without those kinds of basic features, the Nest cam simply is not functional as a baby monitor, and it is deeply deceptive for Nest to advertise it as such. They are imagining a ""use the monitor only while you are awake"" scenario that is not representative of actual baby monitor use.",Nest LIES - this CANNOT be used as a baby monitor
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Oct 2015,Y. C. M.,"This home cam comes up short of five stars for the following reasons: 1. It was hard to get it going. It took me several tries for the unit to connect to my home wi-fi. It did connect to my phone easily, all I had to do was get the app installed in the phone, sign up (you'll need to use your email and get a confirmation email to do so) and then connect the unit to your wifi. 2. The unit takes a while to stream the live feed, but this could be due to my wifi system at home so I can't tell for sure if it would be faster with another wifi unit. 3. You can talk over the camera but there is a delay and you cam't hear anything, it's only visual. Pros: 1. It has a nice wide range and you can zoom into the frame to see with more detail. 2. You can go back and see some few images from past feed but not too much. Although you can buy and sign up with a service to have continuous recording and more features. 3.The image is nice and detailed, not blurry. 4. It does alert you when the camera senses motion. I loved seeing my kids faces when they got caught watching TV when they were supposed to be doing homework. 5. The app organizes all the camera features nicely. 6. Small, compact design. Overall this is a easy to operate and reliable image camera.","Clear images, motion detection and easy installation."
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Aug 2016,Fart Barfunkel,"I will try streamline this review as much as possible. The setup process for Nest products, couldnt be any easier; scan the QR code on the back of the device with the nest app, wait for the app the pass your wireless SSID and authentication to the device, give the device a name, and or location of where the device is in the house, and you're good to go. Setup per camera literally took less than 5 minutes. The major con (and really, the only con) is how Nest almost nickels and dimes you on features. The key example is retaining recording history. On other networkable cameras, you could simply slide a microSD card in, and have the recording stored locally. Nest Cams do not have this functionality; everything is stored on their cloud services. Another feature nest cam offers, is being able to establish ""motion detection zones"" in the field of vision of the camera. The downside? you need a subscription. However, not all is doom and gloom; if you opt not to use their subscription services, you can still stream from your cam in real time; you just wont be able to store the footage, or rewind. If the cam detects motion, you can configure it, so that it will send you both a notification to your mobile device, and send you an image of the screen grab of when the event occured. Finally, the cams have a mic and a small speaker. So, not only can you hear whats going on, communication is 2-way. This is great, especially if you have a dog at home, and you need to tell them to stop counter surfing. This, along with the Nest Protect, and Thermostat all working in concert - it's a beautiful thing!","Quick set up, fantastic features that come with strings"
Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Sep 2015,Scooter,"I've been checking out several IP cameras lately, and the new Nest Cam is the best I've seen. The picture clarity, both night and day is exceptional, but what really sets the Nest apart are the apps (iOS, Android and web). They are easy to set up, secure and very simple. Even better, they are all nearly identical. With many other cameras, the apps are all very different, with their own individual learning curves--who has time for that? I also own a Dropcam HD, and I find the upgrade in picture quality substantial. I had seen some tech blog reviews calling it a minor upgrade, but I don't think they actually compared the images. In my experience, it's like going from an old CRT monitor to a HD flat panel. I'm only giving four stars for a couple of reasons. 1) I would like the app, particularly the iPad and web app, to support multiple camera views simultaneously. 2) I would like an option for local storage. Even in this small form factor, there's room for a microSD card. 3) It seems kind of spendy, especially since you need a paid subscription to get the complete value.",Great Video Quality...at a premium price

No way to change or cancel your subscription!  Unbelievable! Nest employees have time to respond to negative reviews here on Amazon, but they can't seem to respond to their paying customers. I've had a drop cam for over 2 years and have subscribed to the monthly DVR service on and off during that time. I am currently subscribed, but cannot unsubscribe!  There is no way to get them to stop charging my credit card.  Not on their web site and not via email to customer service/support!  Unbelievable.",Non-existent customer support.

Google Nest Cam Indoor - Wired Indoor Camera for Home Security - Control with Your Phone and Get Mobile Alerts - Surveillance Camera with 24/7 Live Video and Night Vision,0,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Sep 2015,Big Data Paramedic,"I am a Nest Cam User From Dropcam Days. When you decide to place a camera inside your home ( or shop or Church wherever), there are countless opportunities from Simple cameras like a Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (Black) to complicated 12 camera systems sold at Costco. Nest Cam serves a niche market. BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF NESTCAM: Nest Cam is a product of google and they are big into home automation. Their flagship product Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation which I use is where it all started. The Thermostat can sense you are away and goes to ""Away"" mode. This triggers the Nest Camera to turn itself on . So there is no need for you to have the Nest cam on while you are in the home. Your car is going to talk to Nest thermostat and let it know that you are going to be in home in thirty minutes and turn on the ac . Similarly it will work with your lights, appliances etc. These are still few years away but worth having. Youtube for ""works-with-nest"". To appreciate , I have a WeMo Light Switch, Wi-Fi Enabled, Compatible with Amazon Echo that has no idea that I am away from home and turns on and off by schedule. How nice it would be if the Wemo light switch could turn on when my car pulls into the drive way. That is what you are getting. OTHER PROS OF NESTCAM: > It looks elegant > The videos are brilliant > You have an option to still use it without subscription for free (with no recording) > You can choose a public option so everyone can see ( like a shop) > I chose a monthly plan every time I am travelling and cancel it once back. This is an additional layer of security on top of the security system I do have at home. > The alerts are nice ( Had lots of false alerts when the shades of the palm leaves started moving on the wall). > If you chose a video recording option, it has a nice alert where we noticed movements. So no need to search for when it happened. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: It gets  heated up for some reason. I knocked off one star for this reason. SUMMARY: This is fairly expensive product but remember this will be  part of suite of home automation items. If home automation appeals to you, this is the one. If all you want is to use it as a baby monitor get something cheaper",Nest Cam ..Is It Right For Me Or Not.. The Answer Is Here !

Product support is great as well.  (Had an issue where it automatically unsubscribed my cameras when I changed addresses.  Just resubscribed after they refunded for what I didn't use.)

The original Dropcam company (who was bought out by Nest) was great - no problems with their cameras or customer service.  Now, if you want to use Nest cameras and pay for a subscription on your camera, you MUST have a computer (a tablet or smartphone won't work) and you MUST have Chrome browser or you cannot add, update or change a credit card on your Nest account.  I got an email yesterday saying my credit card needed updating (it had expired) so I logged in and tried to add the new information.  I have internet explorer and also Firefox and neither would work.  So I called them today and she said I'd need to use Chrome, so I tried it on my tablet which has Chrome installed.  That didn't work either because it comes up as a split screen.  I just got off the phone again with them and she told me that tablets/phones don't work, and that I would have to borrow a computer from someone who had Chrome on it in order to update my credit card.  I asked if I could just give my card info to someone by phone - but they don't even have a way to do that!","DON""T BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A COMPUTER AND CHROME"

I downloaded the app and to set up the device you had to enter your zip code.  I could not enter in my zip code using my Samsung smartphone  so I tried to use my computer.  I couldn't even get to the set up options so I used my Ipod.  The same app that was on my smart phone was on my ipod and was easy setup up from there.  It took minutes to set up. I can use the app now on all 3 devices once it got set up. It's a great camera and would recommend it.",Easy to use
