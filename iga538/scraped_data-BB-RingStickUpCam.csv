Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Jul 2020,FaridSanz,"GREAT VIEW! HD. The price is fair. My only suggestion to RING would be to update the MOTION ZONES so we can select the or draw our zones. Having 3 On/Off zones does not work specially if you live by the street or traffic.

They were easy to install and the images they produce are very clear.  We already had a Ring doorbell, so all of our monitoring devices are on the same software platform, which was another reason for the switch.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Oct 2020,Titanost,"This is a very good, high-quality camera with a good battery life and nice features such as automatic alerts for detected movement, night vision, etc. The portability makes this a game changer, because you can pick it up and put it anywhere that you have a concern. However, in order to actually save any of your footage, you have to pay Google for a monthly subscription fee (beyond the one-month introductory period, which is free). This would be forgivable, if there was the ability to record to your own personal hard drive or NAS; however, this is not an option with this camera. If being able to record and save video is important to you, and you are not already paying for a Google subscription, be aware that the overall cost of operating this camera will be far higher than the actual sticker price.","Nice Camera, but pricing model is deceptive"

You know immediately it's recording by looking at the blue light on the camera so you won't be missing any images.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Dec 2019,greg,"we purchased 3 cams ,they installed very easily ,and the video is good, but the audio on these are weak , i contacted 2 different people at ring to discuss the problem, one was not very knowledgeable about the product , the other was good but i got conflicting answers. we were trying to find out if the spotlight cam had better audio .and if the siren was a little louder? the alarm on the unit is very low. i still don't have an answer and best buy has made it even more complex to try and exchange one for a better wired unit because it was on a 0 interest purchase. turned into quite a ordeal. if you want this for just video or to hear what is outside its really pretty good, if you plan to talk to the people outside (like they show in there ads ) or want to hit the siren to scare them away. you better open your window and ask them to put there ear to the unit","not bad cam, audio is not good at all"

The angle view is only 130 degrees, so it doesn't cover the wider range of 180 degrees that the Floodlight Cam does. We decided to buy another floodlight cam for the back corner of the side yard and use this stick-up cam in our garage on the back of the middle of the drywall.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Jan 2020,DrDw,"Given the bad press Ring has received I still like the system, you just need to be ware of it and Put measures in place in order to dill with it given interaction with technological advances and the inherent dangers.

This being said, I have been using the Ring system almost since it’s beginning. I love the removable batteries for charging. In the past I would have to take the camera down to recharge the battery. I purchased an additional battery which has made it more convent. I can switch them out as needed.

I have the systems with the paid recording, because of the number of cameras I have, in my home and my condo at the beach. I am certain that there are more expensive systems out there but this one does what it is supposed to do, in spite of the short lag in responding to alerts.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,22 Nov 2020,Jeffrey,"Okay I gave it stars because it is a decent little camera even though it's pricey.  If you plan on using only this brand for your security it might not be too bad of a deal even though like I said they're not very cheap. For the quality that you're getting there are other options and other brands that don't charge you $100 per year for service. Overall the quality is good, the boxing is very nice, it comes with all the tools you need to assemble and mount it, and you have the option to view online or on your cell phone. The only problem I have is quality of picture could be a little clearer, the Wi-Fi for me just wasn't staying connected and had lag, also I feel it's a little steep to have to pay $100 a year to use something that I own. I went with a competitor that has a wired DVR camera that comes with four cams DVR and free service no charge for roughly the same price as this one camera. If you are going to use only this brand $100 a year might not be too bad but it's not something I'm willing to pay.",Not had but service fees to use
Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,22 Nov 2020,Mark,They have great picture quality and are easy to mount. I switched from arlo to these because of multiple camera issues. The batteries are seem to be holding up well. I have a good bit of traffic.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 May 2020,DeeFort,"I have invested in the Ring ecosystem and although it’s not a perfect product, the company is committed to making improvements on their existing product line to make sure these cameras work as intended. My camera is set up to view my driveway and is connected to my Chime Pro network. Quality is good and notifications are timely. It’s weather proof and sits in and unshaded area exposed to all the elements. There has not been a degradation of quality. The battery life is decent, so I purchased a solar panel to fix that. This is the only issue I have because if I were to periodically charge the battery on my own it will be a hassle to get it down from its location to get the battery out.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Vision,"I can only give it 3 stars. It is based on three reasons. Firstly, the battery life is not as long as the ad introduces. You may need to charge the battery every two months. Second, once you purchase the camera, you can only use it for free with cloud storage for one month. After that you need to pay extra fee on it.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Jun 2020,789BR,"We purchased a few units and a couple of them were defective. The ones that worked, have been working pretty well! 
The image quality isn't the greatest but it's okay.  We have a Nest doorbell and the image quality is great so perhaps I'm too spoiled by it (definitely wasn't impressed with the Ring camera image quality).  
It integrated beautifully with our Ring alarm system though so if you have that, the stick up cams are sure worth it. 
I have 2 other observations:  if you have one event immediately after another, the Ring cam won't catch the second recording. The ""processing"" takes a little while.
The field that actually records (the motion  ""zone"") is very very narrow. 
Still, I'm satisfied with the purchase and if it were a little cheaper I'd purchase even more units. The rechargeable battery is awesome!","It's okay, handy if you have the Ring alarm system"

It’s pretty neat and the Ring app is very nice.  I am enjoying these cameras.  4 of them are connected to solar panels and 1 of them are plugged in (wish I went with all Super Solar Panels instead of having 3 of the regular size versions).  The plugged in mode offers better motion sensing adjustments and is more powerful but the battery mode still works very well.

I wasn’t happy that I had to buy mounts to mount them to ceilings but many people probably would just sit these on something or wall mount them so I guess I understand why Ring didn’t provide them.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Oct 2020,CatzRC,"I have both, the Ring and a Blink security camera, and I must say I love the Ring more.  The Ring has more positives.  It’s very responsive, especially when mounted outdoor (Blink sometimes misses).  The Ring also has a feature that doesn’t record each passing car on your street.  All I really need to capture is when someone is near my driveway or front door.  Also, I love the 2 way talk.  You can actually converse with the person. With Blink, you have to press Speak and let go of the button in order to hear the other person respond (which has a very long lag/delay).  Clarity of the video is actually good on both cameras.  Oh, the only negative with the Ring is that when you get the alert that someone is at your driveway etc, it takes about 10-15 seconds to see the recording of it..like if you immediately press “Live” or answer motion then you will not immediately see the video.  With Blink, even if it takes a few seconds to generate the actual footage, you will at least see a thumbnail of what it capture (so I know right away if it was delivery person or not).",Very responsive.

I added this outdoor camera for the back door to give us additional peace of mind, and it hasn't disappointed. The wide-angle lens shows us our entire back yard, and the night vision is an incredibly helpful feature for identifying things that go bump in the night. The install was simple, and connecting to the rest of the system was simple. NOTE: the camera CANNOT be installed upside down, as the Ring app doesn't allow for this. Stupid? Yes, but they sell another accessory to mount this to solve this problem (of course!). Lastly, it's not waterproof, so we'll see if future heavy rainstorms cause problems.",Fantastic features for home security.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Jan 2020,RDaddy,"I like the camera. It works as you’d expect. The original one I purchased from Best Buy had issues where it would pop in and out of night vision all the time instead of staying locked in one or the other. I received a replacement from ring customer service without a problem. My biggest issue with this camera is you can’t mount it on a ceiling or overhang and invert the picture in the app yet. I’m hoping this gets fixed with an update soon. It can be done with the indoor camera, but not this one yet. Very disappointing","Works fine, but still not enough flexibility"
Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,2,23 Sep 2020,bhomes,"You can see images with active view but recording only works up to 20' with motion detection at night.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,2,23 Apr 2020,mrtech,"I kept it for the 30 day trial of the premium service, and it was just ok.  Recording didn't start as soon as there was motion, so you miss the beginning.  The clip you can view only runs a certain time, even if activity continues in it's field of view, so often you don't see the end of the activity.  Once the 30 day trial ended, the only thing it is good for is viewing live.  You still get alerts, but by the time you look at the feed, the event is likely over, and you can't rewind.  I read online that you can see clips for 24 hours without the subscription, but that is not true.  I returned it for the Nest Outdoor Cam which I am much happier with.  You still need the subscription, but with it you get continuous recording, so you can view past feeds even if you did not get an alert.  Not possible with Nest, so not worth the subscription in my opinion.  Your subscription only lets you see what the camera notices, and it misses a lot.",Nearly worthless without the subscription.

I ordered this product online brand new and when it arrived the boxed look more dinged up than usual as if someone already opened it. But it was delivered so I thought nothing of it. When I opened it the battery was missing from the camera and some of the tape that they put on cameras to protect the lens or camera itself.

So I had to return this product waaaaay across town in store, which I try to avoid in the first place, and when I was returning it the guy didn't even care or say sorry.

Makes this camera virtually useless for what it was intended to be. I know they say to adjust the motion settings to save on the battery but my truck is parked on a neighborhood street and the purpose of the camera was to monitor my truck. It naturally was going to pick up movement on the street in front of my house, but that’s what I wanted it to do. It’s not a Busy city street, it’s a neighborhood street. If you’re looking to cover an area that has little activity and no power source this may be an option but I can’t see under any circumstances where the battery would last the advertised up to six months.I gave it 2 stars because it did pick up the motion from my second story mounted position I can’t go higher as the wireless feature is the primary function and it doesn’t do that very well at all.",Actual battery life less than a month

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Jul 2020,WillPwr,"Great camera for indoor/outdoor use and with the option to go with corded (wired) or battery pack (wire-free).  I bought this wire-free version knowing that the mounting application (high up/ceiling) would best with an internal power source.  I bought a spare back up battery to have to swap out as needed.  On that note, I also have the wired version of this camera and it is identical as this one, but you just get the power cord instead of the battery pack.  The battery pack and power cord are interchangeable between units as well.  You do have added motion detection calibrations when used in wired mode over the wireless mode, but I wouldn't say it's a revolutionary difference in terms of added calibrations.  I knew the application for this camera would be wire free, but if you are indecisive, it's easier to find and cheaper to buy the battery pack to use with the wired version instead of buying the power cable to use with this wire free version. It's and added cost this way, but it's an option if needed.  App and set up is easy and intuitive.  Monitoring and live view functions work great and integration with Alexa is just as great...especially with Echo Show devices.  Video capture is great in light and IR night situations, as with the motion detection.",Great camera....I ended up buying multiple ones...

Mine are all hard wired in, no battery usage unless power goes out so I can not comment on that portion of the camera. But the camera itself has great quality; as in video and audio. One of the 2 is out of the weather, while the other is in the corner of our carport so it is exposed to the weather and have had no issues with it, nor shows any sign that rain will shorten its life span. I think it will last several years and sure makes my Wife feel safe! We have alerts go to our phones as well as to Amazon devices throughout the house. 
One feature it is lacking is “Geo-fencing” I wish it had to change modes automatically instead of having to physically open the app and change it. Maybe they can  add this feature with an update. But for that reason I’m only doing 3 stars. That is the only downfall so if it doesn’t matter to you then this is a 5 Star product.",Great camera for what we need.
Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Jul 2020,rockin,Been waiting for this product to go on sale so that I could buy a couple.  Integrates nicely with my Ring doorbell and indoor camera.  Easy to set up too.  You can't mount this upside down as you are not guaranteed that water would enter from the underneath battery compartment so I had to purchase a special mounting bracket.  You are permitted to mount to a wall as the base is removable.  Voice comes out clear enough so people can understand you out of the small speaker.  Overall great product.,Good camera

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Mar 2020,ReviewerGuy,"I have multiple Ring devices. The stick-up camera is currently installed at a little less than eyeball height right by the backyard door.  The picture is good, I've even held a small conversation with family members through it. Works ok for short 1-2 minute conversations.  After that breaks up a little in my experience.

The Ring is easy to install and perfect if you have no need for a doorbell this is the way to go.

PROs:
- Easy install
- Picture quality is good
- 1 month free trial of Ring camera
- The online cloud service is excellent
- Does it's job

CONs:
 - It doesn't work perfectly
 - I would not install these inside my home, just outside (just my personal opinion)
 - There is no zoom, it's just a framed perspective.  (However, you can zoom in on recorded video after it's been processed)
- When installing these in the backyard there is always a blind spot you have to account for depending on how your house walls are built.  (You may not have this issue.)


CONs:",Great for the Backyard and outside of the home!

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,5,23 Oct 2020,MooseD,"Bought this camera to monitor our backyard. Works great during day and night. Note though that this camera does NOT have a setting for People Only Motion - so we found that we had to turn off regular alerts because on windy days it was picking up motion from everything that was moving on our patio (umbrellas, grill covers, etc.) The alarms were going off constantly.  You can set up private zones to block out those areas - but then you have black squares all over your videos which won't show anything on the recordings in those areas. Knowing this now, we would have probably spent the extra money and bought the Ring Spotlight Camera instead - which has the People Only Motion setting on it. Also waiting to see how the battery holds up in the winter cold weather.",Great camera

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Sep 2020,amystoys,"I am not a Novice when it comes to security cameras. I purchased them for years all different prices and Ring it takes more then 2 steps back on this item.

Pros: Quality built, great customer service, can add as many cameras as you want for only $10 a month with Ring Pro. Has a spot so you can add a wire connection for the future or to add a solar panel.

CONS: Remember it has great quality videos in the day, so lets hope that's the only time you'll need it because the night vision is horrible. Won't work at all without wifi Even if you have power but don't have wifi, the camera will not work. If it did work this camera would get a 5 out of 5, but I tested the battery cameras and the wired cameras I own and none of them will work during a wifi outtage let alone a power outtage. The lights won't even blink.

Another downside is you are limited to how long you can record videos. I don't mind it. I think 30 seconds is long enough, but the wired version has better detail and also will let you record for up to 2 minutes. I highly recommend getting the wired version because a spare batter is less than $30 but a replacement wire is $40.


I have another brand of cameras from Reolink and they work during power outtages and wifi outtages and at a fraction of the cost of the Ring Cameras.

I would still recommend Ring as a back up camera though because lets face it the Ring Alarm is $10 a month and no additional fees for cameras. It's still a good deal and don't put all your eggs in one basket. It's nice to have different companies.",It's great as long as your wifi doesn't go out
Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Jun 2020,VOLdad,This is a good camera. The customizable zones are not as good as on the floodlight cam. It’s divided up into 3 sections that can be either on or off. That’s what kept it from 5 stars.,Good security camera

Cameras cannot be mounted upside down (to a ceiling) as ring has locked down this feature in their software, you will need a special mount to fasten to a ceiling.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,2,23 Sep 2020,BestBuyCustomer,"Purchased two. Both were indoor/outdoor cameras. One for back, one for front. Had immediate issues. They both have internet connection issues. Only 2.4 is available for set up even though we have 5.5. So needed an internet extender since they are outside. The back one for the most part works okay. The front one must have had a lens breach and fogged up anytime it rained. Contacted Ring customer service and they sent a replacement and a paid return for the defective camera. The replacement camera now has other issues. It is not capturing any close up movement. It is directed onto our driveway and only goes off with street movement, but does not go off when we walk or drive in our driveway, which defeats the purpose of a security camera. It misses a lot of important recording, Will be contacting Ring again. Plus there are weird light orbs that float around the camera. They claim it is dust or bugs. Whatever it is, it is very distracting. Went online and that is a major complaint of customers, especially when it sets off motion sensors. This company has not perfected its technology and really should not be selling it till they do. We will probably look to replace with another brand.",Many issues with this camera.

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,4,23 Oct 2020,Muzikguy,"This camera has great quality. I debated whether to spend the extra for an Arlo but some family has it and hasn’t been happy lately with them. I figure nothings perfect. 
The picture is wonderful, I wish the app let me customize the motion zones a little more specific like the pro doorbells. The batteries could last longer. The ones that don’t have much motion in the backyard have lasted 3 weeks and it’s at 74%. The one we have inside the battery ran down to 12% in 3 weeks, but it’s in the main room and triggered all the time. It takes about 7-8 hours to charge the batteries, so get a spare to change out if you want continuous coverage. 
Overall, I’m happy with it. I can see the kids playing outside, and I caught the dog peeing on the carpet. It would not be great for a baby monitor as it stops recording after 45 seconds until it’s triggered again.","Great camera, so so battery"

Pros:
1) Price point
2) Wireless and battery life
3) Decent picture quality
4) Works well with the phone app, every time I need live view.


Cons:
1) Two way audio is not good, lot of times you can not hear well on the side of the camera. Phone side is good. 
2 ) There is huge delay on the motion sensor, buy the time the camera-sensor register movement and engages in notification and recording, is way to late. 
3) My third one has to do again with the motion sensor, sometimes  does not even register motion.  

Now to give you a perspective of my application, I use it in my garage. So, somewhat controlled environment where all motion and sound should be relatively good received and projected, but unfortunately it is not.",Great price point and tech but not there yet

Ring - Stick Up Indoor/Outdoor Wire Free 1080p Security Camera - Black,1,3,23 Apr 2020,KenTr,"I bought this camera as a start at adding cameras to my home security system.  After testing it in several different positions, we have it where it works well.  Mounting is tedious.  In our case, we have to buy the add-on mounting kit and then place it four feet above the front door at an angle that would show the front door and the part of the driveway closest to the door.  This allows it to team with Ring pathlights that are illuminating the driveway and detect when a vehicle first enters the driveway.  The amount of time between the camera first detecting motion and the picture acually showing up on the Amazon Show 5 would also be a problem excpt that the pathlights give us a heads-up.","Helpful, but could be improved"

If its battery powered it only records a 30 second clip and has a limited motion detection area, all to ""conserve battery life"". If you have a powered camera it will record 1 minute clips and have a wider motion area. Just hope they commit the crime in that time period because you never know if it will catch the next motion and start to record again. Mine will catch a squirrel but not catch me snowblowing my walkway or picking up my package at the door, all right in front of the camera... Literally.",Not what I expected
