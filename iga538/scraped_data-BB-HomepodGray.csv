Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,12 Nov 2020,NOLASHOPPER,Been using this HomePod for nearly 30 days.  Started in my dining room but found it was too powerful and causing glasses to shake.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,08 Nov 2020,BrandonB,"So I'm a self admitted Apple fan. However I had been holding out for the last couple years on this product. Now that the software has matured, I bought a HomePod and I'm thrilled. 

It functions as a home hub for my HomeKit devices and it sounds, to me, amazing for a speaker of its size and when I compare it to other wireless speakers. Of course this is NOT
Blue Tooth and functions with Apple AirPlay so be aware of that. But for someone invested in that ecosystem, it's great.","Better Than Expected, Matured Software"

The sound is rich and bass is deep.  I use my Homepod for Apple music and to make phone calls---the call quality is amazing and sounds as if I'm on my iPhone.  If you want it to control your home's locks, smartbulbs or thermostat ensure that those devices are compatible with Apple's homekit.",Awesome speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,07 Nov 2020,Useless,"I really love this product. I will purchase another one if it ever goes on sale! I love that it is voice operated by Siri. And I love that it looks good enough to show off on a shelf or table. Voice operated it increases or decreases volume or changes music and turns off. The HomePod is somewhat heavy and unwieldly. It is not the easiest to hold or move around-- so hold or pick it up with 2 hands to move it around. I don't know how it would work, but I actually need 2 because it's a pain to keep moving one around from room to room.",LOVE IT..
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,07 Nov 2020,xKisarukix,"No real issues. 

Sound equality is rather decent and price isn’t too bad, considering what Siri has done for me. I really enjoy my HomePod!!! Great buy.

Power cord could have been a bit longer or gone wireless. A charging dock would have been cool. But besides cosmetics! Once again... great buy!",Great Buy

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,07 Nov 2020,IamDavid,The HomePods are good sounding speakers but as for smart homes or Siri usage I'm totally underwhelmed. After the first month I subconsciously slowly moved away from using these at all in favor of the simple google minis we have around the house. With the talk Spotify being added I may give them another shot but I doubt it. Habits are hard to break.,Good speakers I guess....
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,07 Nov 2020,Praiseguy,Great sound! I had Amazon devices all through my house to control my smart fixtures. This blows them away. The response time is so much faster. Also you cannot beat all the integrations with the iPhones.,Everything you would expect!

Sometimes annoying Siri talks for no reason or music disconnects/pauses.  Seems some kinks need to be worked out even tho it’s years old at this point",It’s pretty good

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Nov 2019,tkpkt,"Taking this back tomorrow. Great sound. Easy to set up and downhill from there. Apple tech told me the previous week that I could us Iheart Radio. Not so. This is a free music service. Apple has put it in Apple Music. You have to subscribe to Apple Music for free IHeart radio. Their web site I could use IHeartRadio, not so. Wonder how big tech gets in trouble with the public ?  No choices. Then I couldn’t set up my wife as an authorized user. Invitation to join was sent to our email address. Never showed up. Apple said I have to use my wife’s Apple ID address. Her address is the same as mine. No work around. I spent three hours on two separate days with Apple Support. Said they were sorry I was misled. Never seen this bad of Apple Support. I think because the Home Pod isn’t selling, their not supporting it with software and support. Tech support had to do lots of reading for basic questions. I contacted the Better Business Bureau about my concerns. Needless to say, don’t buy the Home Pod.",Great Speaker-Terrible Software and Tech Support
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Ebd1065016,Great smart speaker. I love this as I am in the Apple HomeKit smart home ecosystem. The HomePod works great to control different lights and switches in my home and sounds good for music too.,Good speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Billybyter,"Great quality build and sound.  Some frustration setting it up (specifically to work hue lights).  Used to doing it with Amazon echo or hue hub without issue.  Was unable to get them setup with apple’s home app.  Not really a criticism of the speaker but, given it’s supposed to be easy I took off a star.",Great speaker - Apple home app not so much
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2017,gvnni16,"Bought this to test it out... Wasn't impressed. Not sure if it was the WIFI or the speaker itself but it seemed to lag when playing music. I'm a big Apple fan, but this is one of those things that I wasn't sold on. It liked the texture though hahah",Meh.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2017,JayG,"I’ll start by saying the sound quality is amazing. I love the seamless connectivity between the iPhone,
iPad and the HomePod. I like the option of being able to play my music over multiple devices. I’ve tried setting up 3 HomePods throughout one room and let me say it really does sound great. I’ve placed one in different rooms and love being able to get things done without having to stop, play and pause with different devices or blasting music from one room to listen throughout the house. It’s unfortunate that HomePod doesn’t support the ring doorbell. But it’s safe to say I’ve dropped all of my Alexa echo devices and have happily transitioned to the HomePod. I’m looking forward to the HomePod mini for the kid’s rooms and guest room. Although I can’t play directly from 3rd party apps directly, yet, it’s still a great device and I’ve recommended it to my friends. It’s a bit bulky but well worth it!",I’ll take Siri over Alexa any day!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,DrewTx,"First things first...I bought a HomePod thinking I might try to use it to remind my son to dial into his virtual classes like my friends have done with Alexa.  Well, either it can’t do that or I couldn’t figure out how to do make it do it.  However, while fiddling with the HomePod I thought it had nice sound and decided to keep it for the kitchen since it can stream from Apple Music.  Then, I decided it sounded good enough to replace an older Bose speaker I had in my office so I bought another! 

Two thumbs up! One for each HomePod I bought. ;-)",What it isn’t
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,MrGC,"If your an Apple person, this fits you!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,dmoody,We have one and love ours. We bought a second for ourselves or our office  when it went on sale for $200. If your already an Apple product lover.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Nov 2019,Woofer,"Sounds great and when it works it’s great. HOWEVER sometimes it just doesn’t  work and is the biggest piece of crap ever made. I use it with Hue lights and every so often I get “you haven’t setup any devices to use with this HomePod”.  I have and they’ve been setup for a year or more.  Did it with Wemo plugs too before I swapped them for Hue plugs.   Man, Siri is dumb as a box of rocks!  I have to go on my iPhone and reset the stupid thing.  Of course you can’t just say Hey Siri Reset. This probably happens about once a month.  I know it’s not Hues fault as I can control them fine from the Hue app. Apple needs to fix Siri so it can function full time and not be a piece of crap.",Totally crap about once a month!!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Doug,"I happened to get this device when it was on sale for $199.99 and can say it was definitely worth it! I am always amazed by how much sound and the quality and clarity of it is from such a small device. It probably is worth full price for what you get because I’ve tested other devices in this category and price range and although some of them may have better smart features and integrate better with other smart devices you have in your home, none of them can touch the HomePods sound.",Great Sound in a Little Package
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Anthony,I love that Apple keeps adding features to the HomePod! It’s value continues to increase with time.,Satisfied
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,Anonymous,"Apple makes a great product and I am part of the ecosystem. I was comparing this to a sonos one and ended up going with the Sonos because the sound quality was superior. 

I bought this to use in my home office mainly for music.
I’m not a fan of Siri and I use Spotify for music, so this was strictly about sound quality and ease of use for me. 

The HomePod sounds great and is well designed, but it is still overpriced and didn’t sound as good as I thought it would (not that it sounded bad). This would be a great value at $200, but not at 300 and def not 350 where it started at. 

 As a Spotify user, I also noticed how much of a difference the sound quality is when streaming it natively as opposed to using airplay and that was another point for Sonos. 

This may be a good device for HomeKit users, but I didn’t need a smart speaker (already on Google’s eco) and not an Apple
Music subscriber, so this didn’t fit my use case. I’m glad I tried it out for myself though.","Good speaker, didn’t fit my use case"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,Picklz,"So I was Skeptical about buying this over all the other smart homes because mainly of price but the sound quality alone was worth the price. Knowing that the other products from Amazon and Google that listen to your conversations was a no go for me so I wanted something else and the only other option was Apple, in which I do own a Apple phone so in my opinion it was a no brainer. After the couple hiccups I ran into not knowing that the phone and speaker needed to be on the same network, I was able to enjoy it at its full potential. Having Apple Music and Apple TV, I notice i was able to use any Apple product I wanted to connect to the speaker via airplay. So not only can I use it for Apple Music but if I’m watching tv, movie etc I can use it as a sound bar which is so cool I give this product a 10/10 for sound 6/10 for being a smart device when coming down to knowledge and a 10/10 for the other known features.","Best sound, best price, only at best buy"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,msscarlet5,"So far I've only listened to music, podcasts, and set timers using the homepod. I do not have any complaints. I am a apple product lover so this just adds to my other apple electronics.",So far the apple homepod is a thumbs up

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,Sherbear,I’ve always been an Apple fan. The Home Pod is everything I want and all that I need. I really love that I can ask Siri to play my music at anytime.  I don’t want or need a Bluetooth speaker with a “bass boost”. I don’t want one that makes your ears ring like a transistor radio (yep I’m that old). I appreciate a speaker like the HomePod that can calculate the size of a room and play your music the way it was meant to be heard.,Took Advantage of a Great Deal
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,SunnyKool,These speakers give phenomenal quality sound. Thanks to Apple for all the research they put into it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,Caleb,"I was admittedly a little skeptical when purchasing the HomePod, as the price is a lot to spend. However, I am very happy I made the plunge. The thing that surprises me most is just how much punch this little thing can pack. Is it the same level as a home sound system? No. However, it can fill my dorm room with enough sound to make your teeth rattle at times. I normally keep it at 60% volume but there is still plenty of untapped power left.

TL:DR - Great sounding speaker, excellent low end sounds, but a fairly hefty price tag for a single speaker.",Excellent sound from a small package
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,Digital,Night and day from the echo studio. I bought two of them to pair for stereo. OMG! You can send audio to them with airplay or hold your iphone over one. The updates will make them better and better. And Siri will hear you to lower or stop audio.,Get a pair. Wait.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Oct 2020,Franc,"I was excited to buy HomePod when I read it had several internal speakers. The design is elegant and minimal that exemplifies the Apple signature. However, in hindsight, I would not be so quick buy it if I was aware of its shortfalls. 

Here is why:
1. Does not connect with the Apple TV smoothly. The volume breaks while watching a film or does not come on at all. Makes for unpleasant experience and not be able to enjoy the engineered volume design. 
2. Siri does not connect to other Apple devices. If you ask it to set an alarm, it would set alarm on the pod not the iPhone. Hardly useful, specially when the alarm volume on the pod is so maimed to wake you up from deep REM sleep. 
3. It does not have connection to home app that we have come to be accustomed to from Apple. It is limited when it comes to controlling o smart lights for instance. 

I recommend to wait until Apple irons out the kinks in the next HomePod models. It’s too $$$$ not to have the all inclusive experience. If it is the sole function of the speaker you desire, there are reputable speakers with much less price tag.",Well design at its infancy
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,AT72,"This is a really good sounding speaker that I decided to try after the salesman talked so highly of it. However, it was between this and a Bose (which I purchased later) and the Bose still sounds better.",Still prefer Bose

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,YouMadBro,"I mainly use the speaker for HomeKit. I have many devices that I control via Siri and having the HomePod makes it so much better than having to have my phone next to me all the times at home.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,Moe1911,"The HomePod works great with apple devices. Easily transfer  music playing on your phone to the HomePod  and vice versa, just by  briefly placing phone next to the HomePod.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,Calvin,"This speaker is fantastic sounding. The problem is its features aren't that great. For example you cannot use this speaker as a Bluetooth Source which means your limited to Apple Music. I think it would be great if you could pair these devices to a non-apple device OR even pair the speaker in Bluetooth mode to your iPhone/iPad/iMac and play through them vs using Apple Music etc..

As for build quality and performance as always its worth every cent. Everyone always bashes Apple and say its overpriced but you get what you pay for and any Apple product I've had is better than the opposition in almost every way possible, every time..",Lacking features but lots of potential

This was by far the most expensive.

It was also the most buggy, often ignoring the alarms I set leading me to oversleep.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,HM28,Good speaker although while having them paired to the Apple TV for some reason it looses connectivity and the Apple TV will later use the tv speakers. Having to reconnect get’s a little annoying. This is probably something that can be fixed with an update. Other than that the simplicity and being able to connect two HomePod at once can sort of be a replacement for wired speakers.,Great speaker to connect your iPhone or Apple TV.

Alexa wouldn't always hear me, even when the room was silent, or she would, but wouldn't complete my request (play music, turn on lights, etc.), but Siri hasn't had nearly as many issues. I was lucky enough to find this on sale for $200 and since I have several other Apple products, it works seamlessly with their ecosystem, just as you would suspect.

With the massive number of tweeters and the subwoofer, you will get amazing sound out of the HomePod.  Not only is it good for playing Apple Music, but it's overall great for controlling lights, and plugs, and many other objects that you can control in your home.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,JackZ,"Like many we passed on HomePod due to its high list price. But when we decided to try some home automation, we went with HomeKit. The HomePod does a very good job as our home hub and is responsive even when it is playing music (which it also does a very good job at). We also added a HomeBridge to integrate in some older items that aren't HomeKit compatible (a Nest thermostat, a Sleep Number bed, and some Wyze cameras).

Ours is in the living room, which works well since it is close to the front door which will be getting a BlueTooth only HomeKit door lock and BlueTooth range might be an issue from the other side of the house. If they come out with a smaller one we will add a second in our bedroom to plus-up the sound from our TV, but the current size is a little big for use there.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Oct 2020,CABREWSKI,"The HomePod seems to still fly under the radar for smart speakers. People always ask about them at my house and most have never seen or heard the HomePod before. A lot of people also don’t know about HomeKit and Siri built into it. However, they are always impressed by the sound and quality of the HomePod. I purchased a HomePod from Best Buy to make a stereo pair with on I already had. With the price reduction of $199 on sale which Best Buy has run every few weeks like clock work, the HomePod is more affordable than ever and is a must buy at its current reduced prices. AUDIO FEATURES While one HomePod sounds great, a stereo pair is where this speaker really shines. The soundstage is large and the audio is warm and balanced. Music has rich, deep bass accompanied by crisp, smooth highs and a balanced midrange. Out of the box, the eq settings are perfect and the microphone placements inside analyze the surrounding environment in which they are placed to automatically adjust the EQ of the speaker. As you move it throughout the house, it shines in an open setting or against a wall where it will pump out loud and clear sound without clipping. With a stereo pair (you can pair them in the Home app), the music is then sent as LEFT and RIGHT channels and the quality is unparalleled. You can even pair them with Apple TV for amazing home theatre quality mimicking surround sound or soundbar setup. Music and TV audio will fill the room perfectly. They are plenty loud in any placement and they sound just as good at a higher volume without distortion. You can also handoff audio playing on your iPhone by simply holding your iPhone next to the device. Your iphones audio will seamlessly transfer to your HomePod without interruption. You can then hold your phone next to the HomePod to have the audio transferred back to your iPhone. You can also stream any airplay capable audio to the speakers from your MacBook or other apple device by selecting the HomePod in the airplay drop down menu. SMART FEATURES The HomePod features a touchscreen on the top of the speaker that recognizes certain gestures like the Echo or Google Home devices. The HomePod has no physical buttons, but illuminated to reveal a volume up and down touchpad and a singular circle touchpad in between them that you can tap to pause, play, and skip songs. You can also accept or reject phone calls on the HomePod and utilize the HomePod to talk on the phone. The microphone quality is great - on the phone you come across extremely clear and “Hey Siri” is almost always recognized in any part of the room you say it. Of all my smart devices, this one recognizes my voice more than any other device and I don’t have to yell or repeat myself to get it to recognize me. The HomePod is integration of Siri is where the speaker leaves a lot to be desired. You can use the Siri function just as you would on your phone. You can set alarms, send texts, make calls, ask it to play music, and ask some basic questions such as metric conversions or “Who is Nicholas Cage”. If you’ve used Siri, you’ll know that it is an AI far behind Alexa and Hey Google. Complicated questions confuse it and it often can’t answer simple questions that Alexa and Google are able to answer. Apple is constantly improving Siri, but I use my Google Nest Hub far more for my everyday questions. If you are a HomeKit user, you can control your smart home with the HomePod. HomeKit, however, has far fewer applications where it useful and it is still pretty bare bones in comparison with its counterparts. For my smart home functions Philips Hue, ecobee, SimpliSafe etc, I prefer to use my google home and Alexa. The functions of HomeKit are limited and until it gets better, it is much easier to use another AI for controlling my home. Even though Apple is serious about its smart home integration with the HomePod, it just isn’t useful yet. So if you’re looking primarily for a smart device, choose something else. CONCLUSION For most people that buy the HomePod are aware of this and they buy it for it’s best quality, its speaker. It is far better than any other speaker in my house, and head to head with the Home Max and Echo Studio, it is miles above them with unparalleled sound quality. For the price, it is the best speaker you can buy and you won’t regret the absolutely amazing sound quality. As a stereo pair, it is much better than some of the top speaker brands at a fraction of the cost. Siri is great for asking it to my shuffle my playlists or play certain albums and the hands free nature of being able to ask for music is great. The design is beautiful - the minimalist look fits well in any space and the cloth covering is much more appealing than plastic or other alternatives that many speakers use. It is very much a signature Apple device that is still underrated. If you are looking for incredible sound in a small and reasonably priced device, you cannot get any better than the HomePod.",Amazing Sound Quality for an almost smart speaker.

If I didn't already have a surround sound system I would probably set the Homepods up as my Apple TV speakers, especially for music listening. With the upcoming Atmos feature upgrade I might still try that out. Word to the wise: Get a pair of microfiber gloves, like the ones used to move a TV, these homepods are fingerprint magnets, and especially the white one is hard to clean once it has a smudge on it.",Nice speaker with boomy bass

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,MegaHighDon,"We needed a hub for our smart home devices, and it was either this or apple TV. We didn't have a need for Apple TV since all of our TV's are smart TV's, and our living room TV (LG CX 55"") already has an Apple TV app. It can hear you from a pretty good distance and is very fast to do whatever you ask it to. 

We don't use it much as a speaker, since we use our living room surround sound for that, but when we tested it out it definitely pumps out a lot of sound as well as a decent amount of bass for something of its size.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Luke,"The quality of these speakers outshines most others. The home automation ecosystem has been lacking due to this being the only option up until late 2020. Siri, despite what haters may claim, works just as well as the multitude of Alexas we have around the house. The Homepods definitely take the cake on sound quality, even by comparison to Amazon’s highest end Echo Studio and Sub combo. It is on par with the more expensive Sonos units; but you can get HomePods for $199 if you catch them on sale and, thus, this makes them a better value than compatible Sonos. Sonos has the benefit of a large ecosystem full of a myriad of options.

The call quality on these is superb, second to know, it may even be their best feature. People on the other end are completely unaware that I’m not talking on my phone. I’ve also been on the other end of these calls and can attest to this observation. It is simply astounding how well they isolate your voice. This definitely surpasses Alexa, Google, and even similarly priced Sonos units.

It also integrates much better with our home automation on a grand scale than our Alexa units; working with more lights and smart home devices overall. We just simply have more Alexas due to cost. We use the pair of HomePods exclusively for music and phone calls due to this fact.

However, I’m only rating this as 5 stars with the knowledge that the ecosystem is FINALLY expanding with the Mini; if not for that, this would probably get 4, maybe even 3, stars. Apple simply waited too long to break out of this single-unit shell.","Flawless call quality, limited ecosystem"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Nov 2017,GreatSound,"No complaints on the sound because it is awesome, Especially at $199.99 when Best Buy had a sale. Unfortunately since I bought a set of two, the connection To the WiFi is less than Stellar. It keeps wanting to connect to 4g instead of 5g that it’s set to so I often have to manually reset it again and again. Also because i bought two for my loft, I’d like to play both of the same thing music without setting them as Right and Left speakers because they’re in different “rooms” in the loft, but that can’t be done without using AirPlay. Bf and I used his Sonos throughout the loft before and it worked great. Never had an issue with connection or setting it up as individual Or paired speakers. I thought the sound quality would override The need of testy setups but I was wrong. I wouldn’t have bought these if I knew what I know now, even with the better sound. I’d recommend Sonos over these even though they don’t sound as robust for the connection and tethering options. Also, when I connect one of the speakers to Watch a Netflix show on my MacBook Pro, there was a 1-2 sec lag in audio. My laptop is. A few years old but nothing to the point where this should happen.",Sounds great but bad connection
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2017,Chad,"Great sound. Looks stylish. Easy to use with an iPhone. Could use better Spotify integration. Siri integration isn’t as good as Alexa, especially for smart hone features.",Apple’s Answer to Alexa
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2017,cakefornoreaaon,"Because it's the Apple smart speaker, of course it's a little locked down, really offering only AirPlay 2 and Apple Music as options to get your tunes. (Though a software update still due in 2020 supposedly adds support for other services, it's not here yet.)

What I love about the HomePod, though, is its deep bass in its small size, especially if you create a stereo pair. I've done some in-store and at-home listening, and a pair of HomePods definitely gives a single Sonos Five a run for its money in raw sound quality.

I've also had very good luck using a HomePod pair instead of a soundbar with an Apple TV, and supposedly the same update that adds support for other music services will allow you to pair an Apple TV 4K with a pair of HomePods for Atmos support. (We'll see how good it actually is, but even if it's not perfect, the price is better than shelling out for another wireless speaker system.)

In short, you get more out of a HomePod if you're deep in the Apple ecosystem, but everything I've heard played on one sounds great.","Amazing sound quality, even better in a pair!"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2017,John,Best sounding smart speaker I purchased so far. Get it on sale too.,Amazing sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Nov 2017,stach,"As an Apple ecosystem family, I would be their favorite customer to buy a HomePod for my living room.  I give it some stars *at all* for having pretty good sound quality for the size.  It's on par with Sonos, just a different tone.  You could be happy with either as a speaker, go with the best price.

I don't like the Siri implementation for this.  My house has probably 10 devices that respond to Siri for various reasons.  HomePod will hog the Siri usage, and HomePod can't control the same things my phone or iPad can.  For example, my phone can voice control into my Apple TV 4K.  If HomePod hears this, it doesn't work. I often use Siri to make personal or work calls during the day.  I don't necessarily want to use the HomePod for that, but if it's in the room.... It's just no good.  Same for my wife, she says Hey Siri to her phone but the call goes out from the HomePod which is registered to me.

Not very smart.  Returned.",Returned

It’s amazing to hear the same music play all around the house. The sound quality is incredible, and Siri is WAY better at understanding me than google and Alexa ever were. I can create playlists, add to current playlists, tell her what songs I like and dislike, and hear a perfectly curated station when I ask her to “play some music I like.” I recommend these to anyone who uses Apple Music.",Simply Perfect
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2017,Valanda,"I’ll put it this way:  I went back 2 days later and bought another one to go with it. It has Superb sound.  I was looking for small speakers to go in my wood shop and considered everything that was in the portable Bluetooth category when I walked by the Apple stuff and remembered these.  I tried them out and —well they blow away the quality of pretty much everything else in their price range.  I bought them to be speakers first, the fact that they are also voice control for home automation and intercom—well that is a nice extra!!",I bought not 1 but 2!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Oct 2020,AAGK,"This is my second HomePod, pairing them in stereo produces great sound for music and works great streaming movies/TV on my AppleTV",Awesome speaker
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,Zae13,"The product works beautifully. The sound is really surprising. I also enjoy arguing with Siri. The One draw back is that it requires an I-pod, I-phone, or I-tablet to set up - and cannot be set up with any other apple device, or if this is your only apple device. 

I had to borrow a friend's I-phone to set up the device and have some of my functionality limited as a result, but I bought it to play music and keep timers - so, it works enough for me. I am sad that it does not work with the other things apple makes or as a stand alone apple product. 

I don't like the I-phone, I-tablet, and have no use of an I-pod... so the fact that they chose those to be paired with it, seems odd to me. And I actually DO own a MacBook that I use for work and drafting articles. Sadly, Apple missed the concept on fore-thought with this item.

The only hard part about setting up this thing was finding someone with an I-device I could use.",One very big surprise.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,CalloRules,"I have owned 2 of these for a while now.  I used them as a pair for stereo sound.  The bass produced by the pair is good.  They are easy to control with voice commands or the app.  I also connect them to my Apple TV for sound when I am watching shows on the Apple TV.   I do not use it for home automation as I have other devices for that.  The only complaint I have, is that if you accidentally touch the top of the speaker they will start to play music.  Then you have to give the command to stop the music.  All around great speaker.",Great sound in a small package

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Sep 2020,Chef4fun,"I am a huge Apple fan and wanted the HomePod to complete my Apple ecosystem, however I was disappointed by its connection performance. It works fine when you ask Siri to play music, but if I ask it to send a text, add anything to my reminders, or even make a call it says I am not on the same WiFi as my phone. It works once in a while randomly throughout the day. I know it’s not my WiFi because my MacBook Pro, iPads, IPhones, Apple Watch and Apple TV all have no problems answering my requests. I bought this primarily for the hands free messaging that Alexa and google can’t do, so to pay the price that I did and not get flawless functionality is highly disappointing.","Good sound, but has connection issues"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,CarloBoss4sho,"I mainly bought the HomePod because it's the only portable speaker from Apple. I didn't necessarily need the additional home fonctions.

We owned a pair of Sonos Play 1, which were also great but I've enjoyed the HomePod even more because: setup is much easier, it sounds just as good (actually, better in terms of base and depth of sound), it's a more flexible system - easier to move around and readjust and easier to pair with additional speakers (we purchased 2 HomePods), and of course, it's a smart device and it works very well with other HomeKit compatible devices.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,stick152,"Overall, I love the sound and ease of using Air Play from my iPhone and MacBook Pro.  However, handoff only works 2 or 3 times before it quits working.  Logging out and back in to my Apple account on the phone fixes it for another 2 or 3 times, but it just quits working again.

Please note that this is *very* likely a software issue and will likely be fixed at some point. 

Pros:
* Sound quality, clarity and volume are pretty great for its size.
* Air Play works well.
* Siri has been nicely responsive and helpful.

Cons:
* Handoff isn't working for me pretty much at all.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,IBoughtAThing,"At first I was going to rate this a 3/5 because I was using it in my small office (6x8) and it was a little overpowering for the small room, especially sitting on the desk top. My main purpose for it is sound, I don't care at all about the Siri functions. I'll just keep using my power computer speakers in that room for now.

So I moved it out into a large kitchen/family room and integrated it in with 4 in-ceiling speakers in that room by putting it across the room on a shelf, and it tied in quite well and improved the sound drastically. The bass is significantly improved and makes the in ceiling speakers sound way better.

It sounds great in the kids bedrooms - way better than the little portable battery powered ones they currently use. We've set up an Apple TV & monitor on a desk in one empty room as a 2nd tv watching area and it works great for that. 

It's impressive how good it sounds alone but would probably be pretty amazing if paired with another in a stereo configuration, so that's likely in the future. I'd like to compare it to a Sonos airplay compatible set for similar pricing though.

If I could perform a lobotomy on it and take out Siri I'd like it better. I use ""hey Siri"" on my phone extensively while driving on hands free. Then I come home and do a fast and easy calculation like ""hey Siri what's xxxx plus xxxx"" and it stops working on my phone and the HomePod answers from across the room up on a shelf ""I'm sorry, I can't do that"", while my phone Siri is silent. I think I can disable it but the control interface isn't super great.",Sounds really great but had to grow on me

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,Randy,"As with everything Apple, this speaker is awesome. Extremely simple to use. The only controls are on the top of the speaker which is basically tapping it to talk to Siri (you can always just say “Hey Siri”) and there is a + and - to manually control volume.  The speaker sounds incredible, rivaling other high end speakers I have. Speakers and microphones are all the way around the speaker, so it literally is 360° sound and listening. All of this is covered in a really cool rubber feeling mesh which gives the HomePod a Modern, non-obtrusive look. Setup is ridiculously simple using the Home app. It works with any HomeKit compatible accessory and others that can be configured with the Apple Shortcuts app.  I have been using one and just purchased a second one for another area of the home. Using Airplay2 you can link these for stereo effect and multi room music, which I have not done yet.",Amazing
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,B808,"Great product, gives my room a modern look. I Took out my Bose v37 home stereo system and replaced it with this. And I must say even though it’s just one speaker the quality is there,  not to mention the convenience.",Love it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,TedL,"Being used primarily as a speaker for my Apple TV, this does its job well. I would like for the highs to be a little more clear, the bass on this thing is a little overpowering. Like shockingly deep bass from this thing, but I wish I could turn it down a little. It does sound good overall though, and works flawlessly with all my HomeKit devices for voice commands.",Great for HomeKit

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,MBTech,"Wait for the HomePod to go on sale as it has periodically in 2020 ($199 instead of $299). I am a technology professional and am pretty hard to impress, but when I first started playing music through my first HomePod it made me double-take. It was super easy to set up and works really well with Siri voice commands. It's a bit pricey at $299 but if you can get it at $199 and are in the need of a really nice wireless speaker for a bedroom, office, or other similar room where you don't have a home entertainment speaker setup already (and are vested in the Apple ecosystem) then you won't be sorry.",OMG the sound!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,Papo,"Great sound,simple and easy connection to my other Apple products,.",Great addon to my Apple products
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,wrbluepearl,"TL; DR: The HomePod is super easy to set up and use with your iPhone.  It even sounds pretty good.  A good value if you get it on sale.

Setup: Take it out, plug it in, and use your iPhone to configure it.  Yep, that's it.  Takes like 10 seconds.

In use: I'm an Apple Music subscriber, and using Siri to control it works *fairly* well. For some reason, Siri doesn't understand a request for Boston's ""Hitch A Ride"", but otherwise seems to do a good job of figuring out what I'm asking for. One gripe is that the HomePod is essentially a 'separate device' as far as Apple Music is concerned; it would be nice to have the option of seamlessly continuing a playlist or song that's playing on your phone on the HomePod - obviously, there's a manual way to do this by using the HomePod as an Airplay destination, but it would be even nicer if it were automatic/seamless.

Sounds quality-wise, it's good but not amazing - I'd say it sounds as good as a Sonos One, but each has its own pluses/minuses.  The HomePod sounds a little 'bassy' to me; the bass is good, well-controlled, and has some texture, but there's just a little too much of it.  Mids and highs are fairly clear and well-defined.  Gets pretty loud without distorting or vibrating, which is nice.  However, my KEF LS50s in the other room aren't feeling threatened.",Convenient and sounds decent
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,Hmmm,Setup a pair of these and they work great with just a few hiccups.,Very nice speakers
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,davidgrantaustin,"Awesome sound quality for the price! Only issue is that outside of speaking directly to Siri or touching the touchscreen on the top of the HomePod, the song / playlist selection, and pause / play / track skipping using your iPhone is absolutely NOT intuitive. If you start playing music on your iPhone using the Music app and bring your iPhone close to the HomePod, the music resumes playing on the HomePod like magic. You then go to the music app to pause audio or adjust volume or change song and NOPE... you have to go into the Home app to do that. Totally makes sense Apple... NOT.",Awesome sound quality for the price!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,Atimm,"From reading the reviews, I expected this thing to immediately blow me away. It didn’t, but I had to give it a proper chance. I put it in a different spot that was more open from obstructions, and gave it a shake to recalibrate its audio scan feature. I played another song and noticed it was sounding a bit better. It’s about 6in from the wall on a shelf 3ft off the ground with some small decor around it. It’s in my bedroom so I wanted it at a height that would reach above the bed. Well, I laid in bed on my laptop while I had some music playing on the HomePod. I noticed it sounds fuller and more balanced when you’re about 6+ feet away from it. Up close, it’s loud and clear, but no depth to the sound. When at this 6-8 foot distance, you can actually notice the HomePod filling the room and the walls resonate with bass. At that point, I was actually impressed this was coming from the little black speaker on my tv stand. I listened to various genres of music, and some bass-lines in LoFi music made me smile. How can something so small and simple make the room seemingly vibrate around me? HomePod is best for someone looking for an always ready speaker to cast your music/audio to from your Apple device. Siri isn’t the brightest AI, but she can make phone calls, send/read texts, and control your smart home well enough. HomePod is for those that love to listen to music and experience proper sound quality while doing so. If you seek brains over sound quality, check out Google’s offerings.",First Impressions
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,TeeTee,"I love that it is so responsive. I set alarms, and listen to music all of the time. I don’t like that it doesn’t have other music things that you can use other than Apple music, but you can link your phone to watch movies, which seems as if the volume is lower, but still great sound quality!",I love it

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Sep 2020,Austiniter,"Very disappointed in this Apple product.  Very buggy, had issues with identifying demands when music was playing.  Over priced for the technology.  I recommend the Amazon SHOW!",Apple HomePod - Over-Rated
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,IcelessInTheBay,"I now want one for every room!  It may not be as smart as the Alexa box but nothing can touch HomePod when it comes to sound quality.  And, you can almost whisper your commands from anywhere in the room and it understands.  I purchased it for the sound quality, not intelligent conversation.

The most amazing feature, IMO, is the way it recognizes each family member’s voice and Apple profile, playlists, etc. even if you are all in the same room taking turns calling out music preferences.  For instance, it won’t play songs with explicit lyrics upon request from my 9 year old because of content restrictions in her device profile.  If it recognizes me or moms voice, the content matched our restriction profile from our devices... genius!",Home Theatre Sound Quality

For that sale price it was definitely worth it, very good quality sound, and handy compatibility with HomeKit.

This only allows you to play songs from your device (Bluetooth) or Apple Music, which is a service that I don’t have. I have Spotify and YouTube Music. I was a bit disappointed and I returned it.

Hands free phone call is awesome.  It is so clear. I think its way better than what is used in a conference room.

My family absolutely loves the HomePods, as we now have three and will probably buy one or two more once they go on sale again. The sound is amazing and fills the room easily, And the bass that comes off this thing is incredible. 

Having Siri Incorporated into the speaker only makes things better. Being able to get voice commands through using HomeKit makes life so much easier. Our speakers are used constantly between music, commands, updates on the weather and more. 

Wow they are not cheap like the echo, they are made for top quality sound which they deliver. I truly feel the HomePod is one of my best purchases in a long time.","Amazing, amazing sound!"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,nostupiding,"When the HomePod came out I was a bit skeptical, especially at it's normal price point. But this is now my third that I have purchased. I bought this one for use in my guest bedroom. The other two are in the Master Bedroom and my office at work. 

Hands down, the sound quality cannot be beat by anything else in this size package. I was blown away by the quality. It's got enough volume for listening to music in almost any situation. It's perfect for a bedroom or office. For outdoor use or larger party environments there are some larger speakers from Sony I'd recommend... but for just wanting some great sounding music and the ease of saying ""Hey Siri, play me some..."" it can't be beat. 

Setup is the easiest of ANY smart speaker I've used IF you're in the Apple ecosystem. I have Google smart speakers and/or displays in every room room of my house and all my lighting is Philips Hue. The HomePod was by far the easiest to setup. And although Siri is not as ""smart"" as Google Assistant, the microphone quality on the HomePod is far better at catching commands from a distance, and I get far fewer errors with the HomePod. Often times my other smart speakers don't hear me without shouting, or they hear something different than what I said. The HomePod hears me every time and more accurately, even with music at a fairly loud volume, than any other smart speaker I've used. 

So although Siri can't do as much as Google Assistant, when I interact with my smart speakers in my home, I much prefer interacting with the HomePod. And setup was so much easier (if you're already an Apple user). I do plan on replacing all my other smart speakers in every room with HomePods when my budget permits me to do so.",Was skeptical at first... Love it now!

Have Siri play playlists, play any song or artist, ask when a song was released, etc...  It's even better when you pair two of them in stereo.  There is an issue using the speaker as an Airplay speaker from a Mac or PC.  For some reason, the speaker just stops playing.  From an iOS device it is fine, the problem is only when used from a Mac/PC iTunes or Music app.  I'm sure it's a software problem that will eventually be fixed.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,RequisTheBrolic,"I've had an Amazon Alexa for years now in the kitchen, and it's done a good job of playing music and it's nice to get alerts about Amazon deliveries.

That said, the sound quality and capabilities of the HomePod are already wayyyyy better than what Alexa can do. It sounds like a mini home theater despite its size, and I can easily play songs just by putting my iPhone near the HomePod.

I would definitely recommend to anyone who is an Apple household. We have iPhones, iPads and Apple TV, so this is a great addition to add to the house.",Much better than Alexa

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,Yoga,"I have been intrigued by this product since released, and frustrated with Apple's pricing practices and desire to be a ""top tier"" company by only offering high end high price products. This device always seemed a bit overpriced and unnecessary for me as I have a nice sound system connected to my TV, but I wanted something for Home Kit control. I like Apple's focus on encryption and privacy especially with the alway on always listening home controlling devices like this. I have apple Home Kit enabled devices in my house, and wanted a quick way for my pet sitter to turn them on and off when she comes in. I tried the Amazon dot last year, but found it difficult to setup and you need to have the always listening feature on. It also required setting up my already existing already working HomeKit enabled devices in the Alexa app which was hit and miss. I was waiting and hoping that Apple would release a cheaper version of this with less speaker and more control. Then Best Buy had this on holiday sale for 100 dollars off retail price. I figured it was worth a try knowing I had time to return it if it did not work. I set it up in seconds yesterday, and immediately transferred the podcast I was listening to on my phone to the speaker. I often wear headphones around the house and listen to music or podcasts throughout the day. This makes it easy to transfer what I am listening to via my phone airplay button and I can hear it clearly from anywhere in the downstairs. It sounds amazing and is so much easier to use to listen to anything on my phone. Yes you can use it without the Hey Siri feature listening. You can press and hold the center of the top panel which prompts Siri so I can turn off the ""always listening"" or if it does that annoying digital assistant thing where it mishears something I say that sounds vaguely like ""Hey Siri"" and becomes disruptive (This has not happened yet). I also like that in the Home app on my iPhone I can turn off the Home pod analytics which will not share my always on always listening recordings with Apple or anyone else. I wish the $200 price was not a promotion, but the retail price. After 1.5 days it has proven its worth and made me realize something I was overtly critical of and uninterested in is as good as I was sure it was not. I like being proven wrong. I am not sure I would pay $300 for it at full price, but if it keeps impressing me like this I might eat those words as well.",Good

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Sep 2020,someguui,"Hey there, I'm really into my apple HomePod.  I've had it for about three weeks or and wish I had more than just one.  I use an AppleTV, an iPad, and an iPhone XR and happily pass tunes across devices.  As good as the HomePod sounds, having Apple Music is a must, or it's just sort of an inconvenient blue tooth speaker.  Being able to talk to Siri and have music play based on your mood is a significant bonus as opposed to having to control some other service through airplay. Overall I give it four stars for the UX, sound quality, and overall satisfaction and enjoyment it has brought to my life.  It loses a star for the total cost of the unit for the realization that you will have an apple music subscription in perpetuity.   I'm still into in and currently write this review listening to some awesome music I would of not of had without this purchase.",I really like mine - good companion

Its has great clarity and the Bass is surprisingly robust for such a small package, especially after the speaker has been broken in properly. Siri is fantastic, able to hear a whisper across the room even when playing music at a loud volume. In fact, it’s hard to say “hey Siri” anywhere in the room quietly enough for it not to hear you. HomeKit works great through it. When watching Apple TV you can have the sound come out of the speaker, which is really cool since it acts as a sound bar would.

I have a home theater set up for the living room, for the office for the computer and a sound-bar in the gym. so I felt like not might have been overkill. especially considering I rarely use Siri and I don't have any Alexa devices.  but I was pretty taken with then idea. and the sound quality is very good. clear, the bass is powerful but not overwhelming or like overdone. and I ended up using Siri to do things a lot more than before. Siri also can hear while music is playing and from a pretty far off distance. I also ended up getting a second one to create a stereo pair. which I would very highly recommend to anyone.

The HomePod produces beautiful sound, better than the ones. Every genre I have thrown it has been handled with aplomb. The bass is right without being overwhelming. The treble and mods are clean without being shrill. The highs are perfect. The soft mesh design is aesthetically pleasing and looks sturdy. Siri does it’s job for basic tasks, it is obviously not as good as Alexa or Google assistant. But the mics are terrific however and is the best of all smart speakers I have used. Currently it works best with Apple Music but I believe Spotify support is coming very soon. Overall at $200 this is a smart speaker that can not be beat.",Musical heaven

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,Scott,"We really like our three previous HomePod purchases we use in our house (two bedrooms and office).  First HomePod was purchased direct from Apple upon initial release so we've had since the beginning.  

HomePods 2 through 4 from Best Buy when they have the great $200 sales.  The last purchase is for garage where I often tinker on projects on weekends and were we work out.  These are the pictures you see prior to me getting the wires affixed to wall and HomePod plugged in and working.  The set up went smooth.

Handy way to get music, radio, podcast, white noise for sleeping (wife likes Ocean Waves ambient sounds) throughout the house.  We have one in each bedroom, office and now garage/work area. None are paired for stereo but might get one more for that purpose.  The sound is exceptional.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Sep 2020,Applehouse,"I love these and I have them for music and appleTV sound. Siri uses HomePod to control my smart home and finds my music, controls my volume and mutes it to answer iPhone for me.

I was surprised at just how  good the Homepods were as a stereo pair ,the stereo effect is natural and clearly audible. the bass from the Homepods is solid and substantial, though in my opinion it is not over done. Ease of setup is notable and straightforward. Siri obeys my voice commands quite well.

Siri, is fine not the greatest between Amazon and Googles assistants. but, it does what it needs to do without really impacting your privacy. unlike Alexa you wont be getting suggestions on what to buy from Amazon. it's also great for building a smart home. however, the more expensive companies products seem to work better with it. i have bought some Phillips lights which integrate very well. but, cheaper lights and plugs, even though they say they are Apple Home certified you can hit some road blocks. over all i recommend highly if you are in the Apple universe. but, if you just want a great bluetooth speaker you'd be good too.",great price

But the noise level in every Apple store I ever entered was so lound that there was no way to actually audition this speaker. And none of the Apple stores had 2 HomePods configured as a stereo pair. So I decided to take a leap of faith and buy a pair. I'm pleased to report that the sound quality is excellent for a $600 pair of speakers. Certainly as good as other $600 speakers that don't include in-board amplifiers. I don't much use Apple Music, but use the speakers to stream loss-less music from the 2300+ CDs I have in my iTunes library. And I use them to listen to several classical radio stations.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,HomeBoy,"These speakers sound excellent.  I EQ my music so I can get the sound I want but this speaker sounds good all by itself.

I listen to most of my music out on the deck and this speaker sounds as good loud as it does low.  It’s something I didn’t think about before but sometimes I want great music at a low volume when I’m talking to someone and sometimes I want great music at high volumes, this speaker can do both.  At low volume simply EQ your music to whatever genre you prefer and it can sound full at low volume.

Can’t say enough good things about this speaker.

Cons: it has to be plugged in which might be a negative for some people but not me.","It’s a HomePod, what’s left to say?"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,Murdoch,"I purchased this because I have Apple Music, it was on sale, and I just wanted new toys. I picked up two and they sound phenomenal in a studio pair. I use it basically for setting alarms or reminders, and of course playing music. The HomePod has very rich bass and sounds great, but I wish it had an EQ mode. The sound fills the room on very low volume and I haven't really tested it at its peak volume. You can also speak in a normal voice across the room and Siri will pick up your command effortlessly. I wish this could be paired via bluetooth with other devices, but for what I got this thing for it works as advertised. I still don't think it is even worth the sale price, but that has nothing really to do with the product itself. It should be maybe $50 cheaper than what is is on sale.

I recommend highly if you are into Apple products and definitely recommend spending the extra to pickup two to create a theatre like system.,Perfect sounds quality.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,mikembbr,"This purchase was two units, my 2nd and 3rd.  I decided to add a couple of rooms.  Nice to have the option of syncing across rooms.  The sound for the size is still amazing, this makes them very easy/flexible to locate. We have one on top of a kitchen cabinet.  Even when playing loudly or with other noise in the room Siri can hear a command given in a normal voice.","Sound great, easy to connect, work well"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,FenixMan,I have had apple music for years and now HomePod. Finally took the plunge when the price dropped.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,jeffulri,"I’d been pondering about the purchase due to my questioning how much I’d actually use it; since I don’t have like a smart home...  And after the purchase was made — oh my word 8) I’m Uber excited about its usage and beautiful sound.  I use it as:

• my wake-up alarm 
• to listen to my music (outside of my iPh 11 Pro Max (smiles) without interruption of calls, texts, notification of any sort
• but can still take/make calls through my speaker
• the sound is absolutely true, clean and powerful 
• the response “hey Siri” whether anything is playing or not is so accurate, even from a distance (*at least up to 15ft tested in my home)

I’m considering purchasing another (1 or 2) for an area or two more in my home.  The current pod is in my bedroom.  I’m quite happy with the investment made and addition to my Apple goods!",Best Sound & Technology (so happy!!!)

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,Danny4668,It’s a good unit if you want allot of full sound. Only problem there is no control really to adjust sounds. Being a smart speaker it’s missing allot of features. For a gift it’s great. I think you really need two of the for that stereo experience.,It’s good

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Aug 2020,TaTa,I have had an Amazon Echo for 2 years and decided to try the Home Pod to go with the rest of my Apple products. I gave this 3 stars because the speaker does not listen to me much. I have to repeat myself frequently and there is a lag at times. The sound is great. I just felt that for 200.00 dollars it’s performance would be better than an 80.00 echo and it’s not.,Average

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Aug 2020,RustyKnees,"So far I am not impressed with the HomePod.  SIRI is still dumb as a stick and the promised “room full of sound” is nothing to write home about.

I took a gamble and bought one because the upcoming IOS 14 promises to give SIRI a brain like the Tin man in the Wizard of Oz.

I have several other Apple devices and was hoping that the HomePod would add something enjoyable to the collection.  Will update after IOS14 comes out this fall.",So far.. ho hum
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,DrDre,"The sound quality is unmatched, and it fills up my apartment. Siri connectivity has been improved with voice recognition.

While that may be true for a small to mid-size room, Bose easily wins for a larger room. That said, it is a pretty good speaker and sounds good in a mid-size room. Tip - create a speaker pair for synergism - sounds much better when paired.",Great for Mid-Size Rooms

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,Stereowasteland,The HomePod is an excellent sounding speaker but two of them paired in stereo mode is what you will ultimately want in order to experience everything it has to offer. If you are already invested in the Apple ecosystem then it’s practically a no-brainer. I purchased one on discount and within a week purchased a second for stereo play. No regrets whatsoever.,Great sound! More the happy with it.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,centurion,"This is my first so called smart speaker and I have been hesitant because of privacy concerns, you're basically buying a microphone/speaker hybrid with a processor connected to the internet all the time - 1984 Orwell, anyone? I decided to nevertheless give it a try. Most of my devices operate within an Apple ecosystem, so the choice was obvious. I love what this little thing can do after I was finally able to set it up, but it was a nightmare. It is something designed to operate seamlessly as a Wifi based device. However, the first speaker would not connect to my Wi-Fi no matter, how hard I tried. I spent 3 hours on the phone back and forth with Apple technical support, which basically advised me to reset, unplug everything back and forth. They are usually good for other devices but for this one they turned out to be useless. I have a great Link-sys Wi-Fi 6 router with WPA2/WPA3 mixed personal security settings and network quality is excellent. After 3 hours, Apple capitulated and told me the device was defective and advised me to return it to Best Buy. I returned it and exchanged it for a new unit. In the meantime, I discovered on my own that the Best Buy Unit had an old software and also read on the internet that people who were having trouble were able to connect it to a guest network. When I exchanged the device for a new unit, it had the same problem, would not connect to Wi-Fi. I created a guest network, connected the HomePod and updated its software. Then I switched the iPhone I set it up with from guest network to my regular network. HomePod switched along with it but still would not do personal requests. I then reset the HomePod and set it up again and it worked like a breeze. Maybe yours will set up easily like most, mine didn't and if I were not persistent, I would not enjoy it. You can use it as your digital secretary, make appointments, reminders, play music, radio, news, ask for stuff, fun. It is the first iteration of a primitive AI digital secretary and music player, in 10 years I expect it will do a whole lot of things for you :()",Very interesting device

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,KaPsLoCk,"The HomePod advertises it self as a music speaker first before a smart speaker. This is 100% true. Siri is not as versatile on the HomePod as it is on your phone. That aside the sound is fantastic. The speaker adapts to its room and position as well. Unexpectedly, it has become my kitchen timer!  She can hold up 4 alarms and it’s easy to shout “hey Siri add a 15 min timer for salmon” 

To clarify you actually do not need to shout, the mics are hyper sensitive.  She can here me from around the corner.  

The downside is her connection issues. She constantly drops my connection or is choppy. Update to HomePod has not helped much.

It also does not integrate well with any non apple service. So you can play Spotify and Soundclound but you can not start those apps with voice control.  

For $200 it’s a fantastic wireless speaker. But it’s not perfect.",Great sound but do not expect a smart speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Aug 2020,Todd,"The sound quality of these speakers is great, particularly when used in pairs.  If I had reviewed them immediately after I set them up I probably would have given them 4 stars (minus 1 for horrible ability to answer questions). However, after the near continuous ""hmmm I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the home app for details"" my opinion is much lower.  I have learned that the speakers require a hard reboot to reestablish the connection.  This happens at least couple times a week.  I have almost given up and just use my phone to stream to the speakers to avoid the frustration. I don't have this issue with smart speakers from Google or Amazon. At $400 for the pair (on sale) there shouldn't be these issues.","Great sound, but does not stay connected"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Aug 2020,AdamE,"The speaker has great, great sound for its size (not too big). The bass bumps. Awesome sound quality.
Having said that, the software interface is incomplete. It disconnects when it wants. If I’m playing Apple Music, and move to YouTube, the audio does not follow, meaning the speaker will continue to play Apple Music while my iPhone plays YouTube.
Sometimes the volume control button on the iPhone doesn’t control the speaker, it controls the iPhone volume. You have to go into the app that is playing music for the volume to work.
Having said that, I will keep the speaker. It went on sale for $200, so it’s almost worth the price.
I would say that, as it’s released right now, that the speaker is worth $150.
I hope that Apple fixes the interface, the iPhone communication, and the overall sound connectivity between applications. It is do able. Again, the hardware is there, and I give it 10/10 based on the hardware alone. But the software interface/connectivity, and the high price tag, drops it to 3/5.
I don’t use the smart features (Siri) so won’t comment on that.","Great hardware, incomplete software, too expensive"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,WFHome,"It’s not perfect. The sound is great and if you’re looking for a speaker that’s a speaker first and everything else second, then you can’t do much better... especially if you find it on sale for $100 off retail. I have the Sonos system spreadout around my home, but I chose this for my home work desk. I think it’s awesome to tap my iPhone on the Homepod and voilah... podcast is streaming to the speaker or I’m taking a phone call on it. It answers your Siri type questions like weather and time and whatever, but it’s obviously not as smart as Google Home or Amazon’s Echo speakers. This is purely a not as smart speaker that excels at music. It is getting better at the smart home stuff, but let’s be honest, it plays nice with Apple everything and the sound quality is excellent.",Ecosystem Speaker
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,mashy444,"I bought this to complete another HomePod that I already owned. They work great in pairs!

The integration with Apple products, such as iPhones and Macs, is seamless. I can AirPlay anything from my phone to listen on my HomePods. And the same is true for my Apple TV, if I want to use my HomePods as TV speakers. Get two if you want stereo sound!",Works great in pairs

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Aug 2020,Bsavy,"So I wanted to educate my house and make it a Smart Home (Lol).  I researched speakers and found that Alexa and Google were the probably the most popular do to price and ease of use.  I don't think Apple pushes this product as much as they should.  With that being said, i now have four(4) HomePods throughout my house.  I simply say ""Hey Siri""  and tell her to do something and its done as if it was on my phone or IPad.   Controls my Apple TV, Phillips Hue Light Bulbs,  Easily connects into the Apple Homekit, as with all Apple products.  So my Apple Watch, Earpods, AppleTV, HomePod, and IPad are all synced (as are my entire families devices).  The Homepod is your IPhone or IPad without a screen.  Instead it has a speaker that has great top of the line sound. Its competing with Bose and Cerwin Vega,   What you lack in loud distorted bass.  You make for with clean ""full"" sound.  The HomePod still gets pretty loud and the fact that you can sync them to all play the same music from the same device or have each speaker playing different music from different devices makes it even better.  The only down side to this speaker is that i needs to be plugged in, but this is not a portable speaker it is a home speaker.  Perfect for an Apartment, Dorm, and/or any room in a house.  Its an Apple Product and if you like Apple this lives up to Apple Product hype.   Again, did i mention i now have four (4).","Quality Sound!!!!! Solid Smart Speaker,"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Aug 2020,Justin,"The best in terms of sound quality for a smart speaker. Siri is an okay virtual assistant, but Alexa or google do a better job. If you’ll be listening to a lot of music you’ll be happy with this.",If you want a great sounding smart speaker

I bought this to start my smart home build. Unlike other apple products, this did not connect or work seamlessly like all my other apple products. Maybe it is me but with my familiarity with apple products this one is quite a challenge. Watched several YouTube videos but I still struggle with it. 
Am sure I will eventually figure it out.
the sound coming out of it is amazing and the built looks very quality. very much like what you can expect from Apple. It fits the standard quite well.

Is this a safety override when I'm blasting the tunes while working out? Not sure. It could also be because I have several of them and use the Airfoil app to run Pandora. Could be a software thing.

I don't ask much of my ""toys"" like many do, so there may be things that don't work for others, but I LOVE the sound and the volume is never too high, but always ultra clear and well defined.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Jul 2020,SCLoop,"The HomePod has the best sound of almost any similar sized streaming speaker, especially when you pair it with another HomePod.  With that said, one of my units only lasted 18 months.  It will no longer power on.  Because it was out of warranty, Apple's answer to this was to offer me a $20 discount on a refurb unit. Due to my poor experience, I decided to move on.  I also have many Sonos products for my whole home system, some of which are now over 10 years old.  They work perfectly and have not given me any trouble.  In addition, the Sonos system connects and plays instantly and every time.  The HomePods often will not connect to my phone via Airplay causing me to restart my phone or the HomePods several times. The HomePod seems to not work well with a mesh wifi system and does not recognize that the iPhone and the HomePod are on the same network. I am a big user of many Apple products and I have usually had a great experience.  Other than the excellent sound quality of the HomePods, I am very disappointed with the functionality and quality of this product.

And the fact that all the recordings are left in your amazon account, kinda concerned me... so being part of the Apple Ecosystem, and how good they are with privacy and security, I decided to give HomePod a try when best buy had them on sale. Picked up two. Right away I noticed the quality of sound, so clear and crisp, you can tell that the HomePod was made for a audiophile, I couldn’t believe from a small little thing. Once I did the software update, I pair them on stereo mode and wow it really does it. I decided to watch a movie and connect them to the Apple TV. Pretty good sound there too... would they replace my surround? Probably not but If you have an apartment and a smaller living room that is a great sound bar for you. And wireless!!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,David,"This works phenomenally as a smart hub and utilizing the Home & Shortcuts apps with it is critical. I set it up so that “Hey Siri, Time for bed” turns off all the lights, puts the AppleTV to sleep, turns off my LG TV, and turns on an Apple Music brown noise song on repeat. The sound quality is phenomenal. Highly recommend. It’s a little more effort to get the hang of this but once you get it incorporated into your Apple fleet, it’s worth it. Note, this is not properly designed for Android users- a Sonos system would make more sense.",Works great
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,Trevon,You will love this speaker. I was very skeptical on it but when I plugged it up and heard it I was impressed. Sounds amazing from anywhere in the room you choose. Get 2 and it’s even better. I was disappointed I can’t use it with Bluetooth like Amazon’s Alexa but it’s still an amazing speaker,Amazing sound quality

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,Rv21,"First of all to all it’s so sad that most people don’t appreciate good sound quality when I see reviews comparing these speakers  to Amazon Echo or Google Home (except the Google Max)  it makes me cringe, I can’t even sample a song A song in any those it’s comparing apples and oranges I can’t believe people listen to music in those things... I know cause I also have the Google Home. Now these: single or stereo create IMHO the best soundstage of any bookshelf speaker “smart or not “ under $500. Even at $350 ea ($700 pair) you won’t find anything better or even close for under $1000 and most likely you will have to add a subwoofer just to replicate the bass tonality these HomePod are capable of producing. I bought a pair on sale for $200 ea ($400 pair)
To me that was a steal, a no brainer. And yes I’m aware of the lack of Bluetooth accessibility and the only Apple Music could be play using Siri, but you could AirPlay anything else and there’s no difference in sound quality in fact that’s the way I usually use these. My advice if you’re inclined to buy these and you see them on sale for less than retail just snatch them you won’t regret it ;)",Best sounding “smart speaker”
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,SD101,I had this speaker for almost two months and it’s the best! I got it for $299 I thought $399 was a bit much. It has the best bass and does everything with Siri has you would with your phone.,The best speaker!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,HUGE,"If you’re deep in the Apple ecosystem and looking for a speaker, this is pretty good! I have two synced together in separate rooms and it’s great.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,AlwaysSkib,"Have owned for 3 weeks now and love this thing.  Amazing sound. Am literally rediscovering albums from the last few decades.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,commonone,I use these in pairs which Apple makes easy to setup in stereo. It does everything that the competitors do just with better quality and a emphasis on privacy. It just comes with a higher cost of entry.,Good Sound and Privacy

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,CeeGee,The sound quality from this speaker is pretty impressive. We’ve really had no issues communication and commanding the HomePod either.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,swayne724,I use it more for sound than for Siri or assistance. I take it and use it on the patio. The sound quality is amazing and is a great substitute for pricy wireless systems for Wifi.,Great speaker replacement!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,JasperDyne,"This is the perfect accompaniment to a subscription to Apple Music (a free 3-month trial comes with purchase if you aren’t). Once the initial setup is completed, just ask Siri to play a song, album or playlist and boom! You’re getting good sound with rich bass. Volume can be controlled with voice commands, or the virtual buttons on top of the unit.

Things get more complicated if you’re not an Apple Music subscriber.

If you have an iPhone, all you need to do is start your music playing, and tap your phone to the top of the unit and your music is automagically transferred to the HomePod via Airplay.

Any AirPlay enabled device should be able to stream to HomePod, so if you have an AppleTV, you can stream audio with a couple of taps.

You can link two HomePods together for stereo sound.

An update coming in Fall of 2020 promises better integration with third-party music services like Spotify.

If you’re not in the Apple ecosystem, there are better, cheaper speaker systems with equal sound quality and more flexibility (like Sonos).","If You’re Deep Into The Apple Ecosystem, Get This"

The biggest plus is being able to have access to Siri and your information whether your phone is nearby or not.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,ZaidSteve,"I’v had my first HomePod-Black back in the very first month of the official release. Until last month, I’v been using it everyday for music and automation, Siri works accurately when invoked. Quality of sound is “ Indiscussible” sound is clear and bass is amazing. Apple ecosystem provides smooth and piece of mind experience. AirPlay from any Apple devices can be streamed easily on HomePod and to have better sound experience “Stereo” you can add another speaker and link them together. This what I exactly did, two weeks ago I purchased my second speaker and create stereo pair which is amazingly blasted my audio experience. I bought it on sale for $199.99 which reasonable if I consider other brands.",Apple is all about tech quality

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,Marshall,"The HomePod is a beautiful piece of decor that sounds amazing. I love how you don't have to think about it or can even hear where the sound is coming from, it just puts great music in the room for you to enjoy.
The ability for Siri to hear you on this thing is amazing! You can have the music going at full blast and just talk normal for Siri to hear and respond. It's truly unbelievable.

I'm just starting to use the ""tap your phone"" feature to transfer music or phone calls back and forth. It's nice that everything works so well together if you have an iPhone.

We did have to switch to Apple Music instead of Spotify but I was able to download an app to move all the playlists over and it's the exact same price a month. PLUS- you can play different songs on different HomePods or Amazon Echos in the house instead of stealing the other currently playing one like Spotify does.

We have two HomePods in the house. Tried them as a stereo pair for a AppleTV but decided to just split them up on different floors instead.",High quality sound you don't have to think about.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,NewHomeNightmare,"The HomePod emphasizes sound quality more than smarts.  
It’s most useful to think of the HomePod primarily as a high-performance wireless speaker that is voice-controlled and to consider its “smart” features as secondary.

Audio:
Apple stuffed this device with loads of sophisticated audio components—seven tweeters, a high-excursion subwoofer, and six microphones—as well as, to make it all work, one of Apple’s own A8 chips, like those used in iPhones.  The result is an excellent deep, rich audio that sounds fantastic.  The speaker is easy to set up and effortless to use, as long as you're playing Apple Music.

Smart features:
You can’t make calls to phones or other HomePods or create calendar appointments, or make use of any of the 15,000-plus smart skills (like games, Uber or Lyft requests, pizza delivery, and more) that have powered the popularity of Alexa or Google Home platform.",Great speaker that's not so smart...yet

Fits nicely with my Apple ecosystem. Love the control it provides for my smart home features. Since my wife is intimidated using my stereo system, she likes the convenience of the HomePod to listen to music while doing projects around the house. Sounds really good for a compact sized speaker. Looks good with my family room furniture decor too!  Pretty cool feature is the fact that my other Apple products, like our phones and watchs, knows not to interfere with the homepod’s Hey Siri feature when I call out to it.

While its original asking price is still worth the product, I found it all the better at a lesser price point.  The HomePod is itself a great item and does an incredibly great job at integrating with my iPhone.  It can be at times ""glitchy"" in that it will randomly at time not respond, those issues are few and far in between and any product these days is bound to have some kind of issue.  I have not found any big issues to raise as an issue or warning against purchasing this item.  It's overall a great product and easy to use.  Make it the centerpiece of your smart home, you won't regret it.",Awesome Product With Great Price
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,Allan,"I have had my eye on the HomePod since it was released. For me the cost of entry was always a bit too high. I finally caved when Best Buy had a sale and picked one up. Comparing it to the two echo dots that I have at home, the HomePod was in a whole other league. Sound was crisp and filled the room, and sounded great in multiple locations, due to the HomePods ability to optimize it sound based on the room. Being an Apple Music subscriber, using Siri on the HomePod to play music and playlists that it would think I would like has been nothing short of a treat. I find the music recommendations great and the sound quality unmatched in a smart speaker.

Although Siri has gotten a bad reputation, I find Siri is more than adequate for most queries and actions. Again comparing it to my two echo dots, I actually prefer Siri for 99% of things. I have found Siri to have less hangups, especially when making music requests. Apples app “Siri shortcuts “does make customizing what you request from Siri better. However the app can be a bit daunting to novice users. And Siri’s response when responding to custom commands can sometimes be robotic. I have found that Siri is far quicker than Alexa at controlling smart home devices. 

Having loved the HomePod so much, when they were on sale again, I picked a second one up. I set them up in stereo mode and was again very impressed by the sound that it put out.

Ideally,  I would have a HomePod on each floor of my home. Due to the higher price of the HomePod, the cost can be restrictive to making that a reality. While I have two set up on one floor in a stereo pair, it is easy enough to move one or both to another floor or a room, plug it in, and have it play without doing anything else. 

The HomePod works best with Apple Music, but with the upcoming update in the Fall of 2020, Apple will be allowing third party music support on the HomePod. Although it is possible to do so now by air playing to the speaker from your phone, you must still rely on the phone to do so. The new update should allow third party services to run natively. 

The HomePod is a device for people that want smart home control, with the advantage of privacy that Apple offers, along with a love and appreciation for music. If music is not a priority, there are currently cheaper alternatives to dedicate to smart home control. For music lovers and those in the Apple ecosystem, the HomePod is a great choice.","Fantastic speaker , smart home hub"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,CDF3,"This is the best sounding speaker I own.  The downside is that it can only be played by asking it to play music from your Apple Music account or by casting from your Apple devices via AirPlay.  I wish it came with a Bluetooth connection because the AirPlay connection is finicky at times, and drops the audio sometimes.  I assume they didn't add Bluetooth functionality because they didn't want you trying to connect other devices to it, thus keeping you within their echo system.  If so, that's a bad move on their part.  Overall it's a great sounding speaker, but it's fairly limited.",Great Sound!

I like that airplay allows other iPhones in my household to play sounds from other apps besides Apple Music. It was a very steep learning curve to figure out how to figure out the airplay menu on the phone, but I eventually figured it out. My girlfriend likes to play the Calm app on it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,Rasha,I purchased one and now own six. They really are the best sounding speaker especially if you use the Apple ecosystem. I use it as a home hub for my smart automation. Works great but Siri is not the best for Radom facts.,Better than I thought
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,TomBrady,"The Apple Homepod has excellent sound. I’m not a speaker expert but the sound on this speaker is great! You do need to place it in a good spot to get the best sound (not obstructed by too many things on a counter or shelf). I got it on sale for $200 and definitely worth it. I also like that they don’t make money off of my voice commands, unlike other speakers... Also very easy to install. Literally plug it and my iPhone detected it automatically.",Awesome rich sound!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,ScottR,It works great as a speaker but apple still needs to work out the bugs in Siri. I wish it did more stuff on controlling electronics in our home. It works good with all of our other apple devices.,so far its good
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,jbright,"This thing is so good I had to get a second one to make a stereo pair. Just one fills a room very well. A second and set up as a stereo pair is overkill but very satisfying. These things sound amazing. As a final touch on your Apple ecosystem it is something you didn’t know you needed. Hand off from phone to HomePod or the other way around is flawless and such a cool way to keep your playlist listening uninterrupted. Plus all the voice control via Siri for your smart home.

These are a cool add for any Apple aficionado and if you can get them for $100 off at Best Buy as I did they are a great value.",Must have to complete the Apple ecosystem!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,friendsofcarlotta,"Many years ago I bought an Apple HiFi and was very happy with the sound quality. I still use it with my 160gb iPod and the old-style plastic remote. Syncing the iPod these days, though, has become an iffy proposition -- I guess Apple is trying to convince owners to upgrade or something. The HomePod, on the other hand, is very bass-heavy, to the point where it's distracting on some tracks. However, I can play to it from my iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook, Apple TV, etc. No syncing required. I tried a stereo pair, and set-up was a bit fiddly, with the final sound not being that much better, or even different. One is plenty for casual listening. Although I use mine most of the time just for music, they make really good ""home theater"" speakers. There are plenty of shows these days where the dialogue is poorly recorded, and my TV speakers have to be cranked to understand what the characters are saying. With the HomePod, not only is the sound bigger and more immersive, but the dialogue bits are a lot clearer. Best of all, unlike Sonos and the others, you don't need extra apps or software to use the HomePod. Plug it in, initialize it with your iPhone, and you're off and running.","Not the best-sounding speaker, but so convenient"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,oleseasostac,"It is a nice device when it actually understands what you ask of it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,MauiAggie,"I haven’t used the HomePod as much as I thought I would. It’s good for music, but not great (to my ears). Very bass-heavy with little treble. I am amazed at how Siri can understand me across a room, though. Just wish she’d stopping carrying on a conversation with the TV. Random “um-hmm” and “what?” are a bit unsettling!",Fun toy
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Jul 2020,BD12,"These are beautifully made speakers, but the bass is overpowering. Most music is muddy sounding given the bass, even with adjustments made through equalizer on music played through my iPhone. I wanted to love these speakers. I bought 2 and set up as stereo pair in office. When you could find music with minimal bass profile, they sounded great. I wish Apple would offer a couple of native profiles imbedded in the speakers that would allow you to change the bass emphasis. Probably not going to happen, given Apple’s arrogance about their engineering. Great sale price at Best Buy, unfortunately I returned them. Once things open up again, I would recommend listening to them before you purchase.",Bass is Overpowering

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,Roman,Overall great performance both to listen to music with great sound and to control smart appliances. Of course with the limitations Siro still has as compared to others as a virtual assistant.

There is a little bit of a delay between phone and speaker and also can only have one phone connected to speaker unlike other Bluetooth speakers. I wish it was cordless.

The only thing we're waiting on is for Apple to allow Spotify to stream natively on it. Right now, you can use your iphone and say ""Play on spotify on Homepod"" and it will stream through your phone. But I would rather just talk directly to the homepod via Siri to say ""play "" and do it. It works this way ONLY if you pay for Apple Music.

• my wake-up alarm 
• to listen to my music (outside of my iPh 11 Pro Max (smiles) without interruption of calls, texts, notification of any sort
• but can still take/make calls through my speaker
• the sound is absolutely true, clean and powerful 
• the response “hey Siri” whether anything is playing or not is so accurate, even from a distance (*at least up to 15ft tested in my home)

I also am a HomeKit user with Lutron Caseta lights which I can control with voice command for convenience, especially when I have my hands full or I’m too lazy to get up.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jul 2020,Aidan,"The HomePod seems to still fly under the radar for smart speakers. People always ask about them at my house and most have never seen or heard the HomePod before. A lot of people also don’t know about HomeKit and Siri built into it. However, they are always impressed by the sound and quality of the HomePod. 

I purchased two HomePods awhile back from Best Buy. I snagged open box deals for both of them, considering the original introductory price was a hefty $349. That put the HomePod in the same range of top of the line smart speakers such as theGoogle Home Max, the Echo Studio and Sonos One. With the price reduction now of $199 on sale, the HomePod is more affordable than ever and is a must buy at its current reduced prices. 

AUDIO FEATURES
While one HomePod sounds great, a stereo pair is where this speaker really shines. The soundstage is large and the audio is warm and balanced. Music has rich, deep bass accompanied by crisp, smooth highs and a balanced midrange. Out of the box, the eq settings are perfect and the microphone placements inside  analyze the surrounding environment in which they are placed to automatically adjust the EQ of the speaker. As you move it throughout the house, it shines in an open setting or against a wall where it will pump out loud and clear sound without clipping. 

With a stereo pair (you can pair them in the Home app), the music is then sent as LEFT and RIGHT channels and the quality is unparalleled. You can even pair them with Apple TV for amazing home theatre quality mimicking surround sound or soundbar setup. Music and TV audio will fill the room perfectly. They are plenty loud in any placement and they sound just as good at a higher volume without distortion. 

You can also handoff audio playing on your iPhone by simply holding your iPhone next to the device. Your iphones audio will seamlessly transfer to your HomePod without interruption. You can then hold your phone next to the HomePod to have the audio transferred back to your iPhone. You can also stream any airplay capable audio to the speakers from your MacBook or other apple device by selecting the HomePod in the airplay drop down menu.  

SMART FEATURES 
The HomePod features a touchscreen on the top of the speaker that recognizes certain gestures like the Echo or Google Home devices. The HomePod has no physical buttons, but illuminated to reveal a volume up and down touchpad and a singular circle touchpad in between them that you can tap to pause, play, and skip songs. You can also accept or reject phone calls on the HomePod and utilize the HomePod to talk on the phone. The microphone quality is great - on the phone you come across extremely clear and “Hey Siri” is almost always recognized in any part of the room you say it. Of all my smart devices, this one recognizes my voice more than any other device and I don’t have to yell or repeat myself to get it to recognize me. 

The HomePod is integration of Siri is where the speaker leaves a lot to be desired. You can use the Siri function just as you would on your phone. You can set alarms, send texts, make calls, ask it to play music, and ask some basic questions such as metric conversions or “Who is Nicholas Cage”. If you’ve used Siri, you’ll know that it is an AI far behind Alexa and Hey Google. Complicated questions confuse it and it often can’t answer simple questions that Alexa and Google are able to answer. Apple is constantly improving Siri, but I use my Google Nest Hub far more for my everyday questions. 

If you are a HomeKit user, you can control your smart home with the HomePod. HomeKit, however, has far fewer applications where it useful and it is still pretty bare bones in comparison with its counterparts. For my smart home functions Philips Hue, ecobee, SimpliSafe etc, I prefer to use my google home and Alexa. The functions of HomeKit are limited and until it gets better, it is much easier to use another AI for controlling my home. 

Even though Apple is serious about its smart home integration with the HomePod, it just isn’t useful yet. So if you’re looking primarily for a smart device, choose something else. 

CONCLUSION
For most people that buy the HomePod are aware of this and they buy it for it’s best quality, its speaker. It is far better than any other speaker in my house, and head to head with the Home Max and Echo Studio, it is miles above them with unparalleled sound quality. For the price, it is the best speaker you can buy and you won’t regret the absolutely amazing sound quality. 

As a stereo pair, it is much better than some of the top speaker brands at a fraction of the cost. Siri is great for asking it to my shuffle my playlists or play certain albums and the hands free nature of being able to ask for music is great. The design is beautiful - the minimalist look fits well in any space and the cloth covering is much more appealing than plastic or other alternatives that many speakers use. It is very much a signature Apple device that is still underrated. If you are looking for incredible sound in a small and reasonably priced device, you cannot get any better than the HomePod.",The best sounding “almost smart” speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jul 2020,HomeReviewer,"The HomePod is a great sounding speaker, but not a very resourceful device in terms of asking questions.  It can only tell you answers to the most common questions such as weather. Most time it will say it cannot do something and refers to using Safari to find the answers.",Great Speaker ...

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Jun 2020,Skull,Come on it’s 2020 why would they make a speaker that you can’t connect to through Bluetooth. It’s also a little irritating that it doesn’t have a built in battery.,Ehhhh
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Chefjeff,"I have various ways to listen to music, but as a loyal Apple products customer I’ve had my eye on this speaker since it was released.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,JacobTech,"No other bookshelf speaker I have used in the past compared to the sound quality I get from the HomePod.

It Also works beautifully with our LG OLED as an external speaker (latest LG OS with AirPlay 2). Of course works great with Apple TV as well.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,JakeMiran,"The homePod is an awesome speaker with great loud sound. I also like how it looks and its cool white color. The things that I hate about it is its expensive price tag and that its Siri is not as smart as Alexa. For this reason, I only use this as an extended speaker of my iphone. It gets pretty useless and unhandy if you don’t subscribe to Apple Music. So unless you have an Apple Music subscription, I recommend that you buy this HomePod.",Awesome speaker

It is so amazing to have a voice activated speaker. The music quality is great. Siri’s functionality out of the box is limited when compared to other smart speakers, but with the shortcuts App, she gets a power boost.

I purchased this for my daughter… and No, I do not currently own a HomePod; however, that is simply due to the fact that I do not (yet) have any good option for home broadband (waiting on StarLink).

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,Alexed,"It simple to operate, compact with big sound. A good value for $200 (which you will often find it). If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, it’s an easy way to expand good sound though the house. It also brought me into other “smart” items like lightbulbs... seriously when your hands are full, being able to tell it to turn them on/off is really REALLY nice.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,MacTulare,"First off, understand that the HomePod acts as its own device and not really an extension of your iPhone. 

You can airplay to the HomePod from your phone but the HomePod will take over the source leaving your phone open to play it's own music. You can control the HomePod from your phone but you have to specifically select the HomePod in the Music app to do so, by default the Phone will show what it is playing on the phone and not the HomePod. Is this a problem, not really but it does take some getting used to.

The HomePod will sync to your AppleID so you can access your calendar etc BUT it has its own app for alarms and does not sync to you phone alarms. Viewing the set alarms on your phone is stupid, yes stupid as you have to open the Home App and then open the HomePod. 

I get the sense that Apple is trying to force you to use Siri to control the HomePod. If this is your thing then you won't have any issues. I had to adapt to using Siri for everything. Also Siri is no Alexa so don't expect it to act like Alexa. Siri is simply not that smart and can't handle commands or actions like Alexa. If you know Siri's limitation's you won't be disappointed. 

The sound is amazing! Really more than what I expected. 

My final verdict- I'm going to get another one when Best Buy drops the price back to 199.",Know what you get and don't get with the HomePod

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,v3rlon,"As far as digital assistants go, Siri often gets dogged compared to Google and Amazon.  Part of Siri’s limitation though, is Apple protecting your privacy a bit better than the other players. 

I can say that Siri is the only one smart enough to know what room it is in.  You say “turn off the lights,” and it knows enough to turn off the room lights it is assigned to.

As a speaker, none of the other devices are even close.  HomePod fills a large room and actually sounds good.",Expensive but good.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,LawDawg88,"We purchased the HomePod based on professional reviews that it was one of, if not the best sounding of similar devices.  Being an Apple centric home also helped.  It does sound great, better than our previous Alexa based unit.  We do not use such a device to run our home so the fact that the HomePod is more limited with regard to the amount of devices with which it will connect did not bother us.  In the future, we will simply make sure we purchase devices that do work with HomePod.  Although I'm sure we do not ask it as many diverse questions as other families, it answers our questions in a meaningful way and we can set multiple different named timers which comes in handy as we cook a lot and it is between our kitchen and family room.  It easily picks up your voice too.  So far, we would definitely buy it again.  Getting it for $199 was also a nice bonus.  Like most Apple products, setting it up and connecting it to our iPhones was incredibly easy.",Sounds great and does everything we require.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,PeteCT,"This is my second one to complete my stereo setup.  The sound out of the these HomePods is just wonderful.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,RachiMayes,"Before I go deep into this review. Remember: I’m deep in the Apple ecosystem. 

I did my research before buying this HomePod just to make sure this is what I wanted. So after tugging with the price and the wallet strings, I finally got one when the price went down(On an excellent open box!)

This thing is heavy! All those speakers in a round speaker that look sleek is crazy! Had to order the tabletop stand because the speaker can ruin furniture(Read in reviews)

I set it up at my mom’s house just to see what it sounds like. As a person who likes his sound coming out of any speaker to be clear and hit on every note I will say this......OMG! Apple nailed it on this unit. Every note. Every time.  

(Just to prove it, if you get one....play Feel The Bass Part One by DJ Majic Mike to test it out)

It has the capability of controlling anything in your house with the right comparable equipment. 

Downside: Need iPhone to setup and Apple Music subscription. Only pulls music from the ecosystem including any music you have in iCloud. Not Bluetooth. Have to know how to hit those taps just right on the unit to get it to work right and it’s highly sensitive.

But it sounds great! If you are a Apple user and like top quality sound, then get this for your living room and or bedroom.",At Least It Sounds Great
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Jun 2020,Techman,Not such a full sound... not too happy..too much cost for poor quality of sound,Ummm so so
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,MickeyMel,We love our Apple IHome  Speaker. Great quality and great sound. Thank you to Best Buy for always providing great service.,Apple Home
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,HammerAbe,"Good sound and portability.   I also have the Sonos 5 so the Homepod doesn't meet that standard.  I'm not sure it's apples to apples though as the Homepod is clearly a smaller design and the variance is power and bass (in Sonos play5 favor) which should adjust based on size.   

Main difference is my wife can connect to the Homepod from her iphone and we can move it around the house fairly easily.",Good portable option from Apple
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Fefe,"Sound quality is amazing! Super simple to setup!!! Literally open the box, plug it in and sync it with your home app and voila!!",My favorite Apple product so far!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,NoHRodriguez,"I absolutely love the sound quality of the device. Best smart speaker I have used when it comes to sound. However, this may be a situation of my not so good WiFi, but connections could be hard to reach from time to time. So my advice is if you are into sound quality, you’ll love this device","Great sound, okay connection"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Mitch,"The HomePod received a lot of critical feedback at its initial launch, and in some cases rightfully so, but this is a FANTASTIC smart speaker for those in the Apple Ecosystem. I originally bought, and returned, a HomePod a year and a half ago and regretted it shortly thereafter. The recent sale was too good to pass up on however, so I took the dive again and will likely be buying a second.

I have had Google Home devices scattered (mini's, normal Homes, a Home Hub, and a Home Hub Max) in my home for years due to wanting smart speakers, but not wanting Amazon devices. Privacy has become more important to me over time, and I have become more entrenched into the Apple ecosystem over the years as well. The HomePod sounds absolutely incredible, and is FAR more reliable as a smart home hub than the Google Home's we have had which constantly have issues connecting with our Philips Hue, and August Smartlock. The HomePod and Homekit never have issues controlling our smart home, and perform tasks much more quickly than our Google devices. Pair the better performance with better sound, and much more privacy due to how Apple handles requests on the HomePod and this is an easy choice to make. As is normal, the build quality is fantastic, and it looks great in any space.

My main wish is that a HomePod mini and Google Home Hub like device is released so that I can replace my Google Home's entirely. Sure, the Google Assistant is smarter when it comes to random search requests and internet type searches, but for what I use my smart devices for 95% of the time, the HomePod is actually BETTER.",Fantastic
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Munajj,"I was looking for a clean and simple speaker for my desk set up, and this fit the bill. It connects seamlessly with my Apple TV, MacBook, iPad, iPhone, you name it. 

The first time I heard sound come out of it, I was in awe. It sounds amazing. Strange how something this compact can produce sound that loud and of that high quality. 

I was a bit hesitant because of the relatively high price tag, but having listened to it, I am
considering buying a second one for another room",Perfect addition to Apple Eco-system
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,chriss999,"I am blown away by the sound quality on this. Comparing it to the Sonos Play:5's I have set up in a stereo pair and still use daily (they have inputs for Turntables).

I have about 5 of these now because my home runs on Apple HomeKit and they all work very well and deliver great sounding music at a much lower cost than Sonos (if you can live without the analog inputs that the HomePod does not have but the Play:5 has).

Buying another one today to create a stereo pair in my home office with all the WFH due to Covid-19.",incredible sound.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Jun 2020,Jray,"It's probably me, but it works sporadically and not well.",Confusing and difficult
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,DMS52,"I am so pleased with the HomePod purchased at Best Buy. The sales associate was fantastic and made sure the Open Box HomePod was complete (actually still in factory packing).

I have a large iTunes library and the HomePod sounds amazing with all types of music. Today I've already enjoyed some Rammstein, a few Bluegrass favorites, three Bach cantatas and plan to hear the Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 1 next. 

Setup was incredibly easy via the Home app on my iPad Pro. The HomePod is a solid, heavy object with a simple, elegant and compact design. It is a terrific part of the Apple universe, ideal for Apple users.

I haven't used it for anything but listening, so don't know the level of functionality for Siri.",Beautiful in every way!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Clayton,"I've used a few different bluetooth speakers and none of them have come close to how good the HomePod sounds. I use Apple all around and this has become an equal part of my home ecosystem. It is used daily. The sound is incredible. Using voice commands is perfect. You can speak at a normal volume even with the volume at max and it can hear you perfectly. A simple, but my favorite feature is being able to set up scheduled alarm clocks.",Sounds Amazing
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Mazefb77,"The HomePod speakers not only have great highs and lows for my favorite songs from Apple Music, but having Siri to keep me informed with news and weather without using my phone is such a treat. It can recognize my voice while the TV is playing. I loved my first HomePod so much that I now have three throughout  the house. I also use my HomePods to turn smart lights on and off or change colors with just a “Hey Siri”. Pausing a video on AppleTV with just my voice is so convenient. Like a certain big movie, it really ties the house together!",It really ties the house together!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Flewdog,Apple did a great job on the sound of this speaker.  I just wish it was compatible with more devices.  I use this and Alexa.  Alexa for turning smart devices on and off and Apple for good sounds.  And information.  I wish the price would go down or they make a portable unit.  It would be awesome,Great
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,EnzoM,"I’m an Apple user through and through so, homepods (I bought two on sale) make sense for me. My wife and I have iPhones, Apple TV’s throughout the house, iPads and Apple watches. Ahem! Apple... you got us. So, homepods make sense for us compared to other smart speakers for that reason among others. I happen to like Apple’s privacy policies better than googles or anyone else’s. If you’re going to have these devices in your home “listening” to you all the time, I prefer that they’re Apple devices. I bought two of them and connected them as a stereo pair in our living room and they do sound pretty dang good. I have an actual stereo/hifi multichannel systems upstairs in my theater room. The homepods certainly can’t match the stereo imaging/sound of that system but, with careful, precise placement, they do offer good stereo imaging and sound. Not great, not spectacular, but good for what they are which are small smart speakers after all so, expectations in check. For their size/weight they sound very impressive and even at very high volume they don’t sound at all stressed. I first tried a single homepod but as our living room is medium to large in size and open to the kitchen/dining area, it didn’t fill the space as I had hoped. Set up as a stereo pair fixed that problem and I can hear them pretty much anywhere in our home. They’re very even sounding with no real peaks or dips overall. They just sound good. The Siri function works perfectly almost every time too. Siri’s well known limitations compared to other virtual assistants not withstanding. We subscribe to Apple Music (naturally) and that service works perfectly via the homepods. As we’re “Apple people”, they work for us and we’re quite happy with them especially as we picked up two of them at a substantial discount while on sale. Back to stereo for a sec, I have noticed that they can sound great with “audiophile” tracks. YouTube is not an audiophile streaming service, but when I play audiophile quality music from YouTube there is an improvement in airiness, delicacy and separation and vocals sound better too. So, they can sound very good on certain high quality tracks even over less than audiophile quality streaming services like YouTube. The homepods are smaller than I thought (or remember) but pack a solid punch in sound quality. Great product and we’re happy with them. Now, let’s hope Siri gets a huge update to finally bring it up to par with the other virtual assistants.","Love em’, but I knew what I was getting..."
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jun 2020,Yesgaeborin,"If you take it as stereo speakers, It is really good choice.",Really good
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jun 2020,kiteman,"I own smart speakers from the other two major companies but wanted to get a Homepod to compare all three.  I wanted until it went on sale as I did not think it was worth the everyday price.  When it comes to music and audio this be by far the best on the market.  The sound is excellent and the bass is a lot better than I could of imagined.  

When it comes to asking it do searches, turn on the lights (Hue) and other things it is not really good.  It tells me the lights are not available all the time, I don't know that one, or something else. All of the other devices not issue.  I get annoyed if my phone/ipad is closer than the Homepod the music will stream for the that device.  I have to get closer to the Homepod of make sure all other devices are locked.

I do like the Homepod but if you not into listening to music or podcast I really can't see a reason to get one.",Great Audio - No a Smart Speaker

Can be annoying at first because it will just start to randomly play music if you turn it on.  After you get used to how airplay works, it's much better to just send music to it by phone or computer.

I paid over $400 for mine shortly after release with AppleCare, and with it currently going for $199 I'm tempted to grab another one. Other than Siri's imperfectness, I honestly do not have a single complaint. 

I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD650s with a Schiit Stack ($450), AirPods Pro ($250), have owned Bose QC15 ($300) and Beats Solo2 ($200 or something I forget) and this, throughout the entire time I owned the previous products, got the most use.

It is simply one of the greatest sounding speakers you will find in such a small and relatively cheap package. The sound quality alone makes it a steal at that price.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 May 2020,PoopyD,Sound quality is shockingly great but it’s what you’d expect from Apple. The device is much bigger than you would think. Siri isn’t awesome by any means but she is still evolving and so will the speaker that’s the great thing about Apple. Definitely try to get this on sale if you can cuz they are not cheap. That is probably the only negative thing I could say about it is the price Apple tends not to discount their products much more than $50 but on the flip side you no that you aren’t paying for a poorly engineered product either.,Another great Apple device

I bought this one to pair it was another and the sound is even more amazing than when it's a stand alone speaker.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 May 2020,WhateverEd,"Purchased 2 to use as a stereo pair.  At the 200 each price, I thought the value was reasonable as they sounded great as a stereo pair.

However, I could not find a way to just use them as replacement speakers for my iMac (recent model bought fall 2019), as they wouldn't show up as a stereo pair to the OS (google, long standing issue).  Seems they only show up as stereo via airplay (Music, etc).

But, the sound is great!  Just beware if ur buying to use as replacement speakers for internal speakers.

Also, not great to use outside on the deck as they require wireless network connectivity instead of connecting to iPhone via Bluetooth.","Great sound, not so great using with iMac"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 May 2020,OTACORB,"I purchased two in order to link them for stereo setup. Saved $200 on the pair. Setup took 2 minutes. Takes you through a few steps to get your voice pattern down. Then it updated the os to the latest version. All in all about 20 minutes time. The sound on loud is great and party worthy. But it shines on low volume listening to some chill, meditation or new age. This also works with smart lights and switches from Philip Hue. It’s a nice setup I was willing to pay $200 but $300 was too much. They should sell them at $169 and would likely sell a bunch of them. I did also try Amazon Echo Studio. It connects to more stuff, but how well,it works is hit and miss. Music from other service often quit playing. It sometimes locks up.. never had these issue with HomePod. It’s not perfect but we like them. Anyone want to buy two used echo studios. LOL",Nice sound (low or loud)

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 May 2020,LAViking,"This is my third HomePod for my home. I am using it to expand my smart home upstairs.  Siri interaction has matured nicely and improves all the time.  As an audiophile I am alway impressed by the sound quality for movies and music.  No other speaker competes for sheer audio quality. Bass response for such a small speaker is amazing.

I rank the following:

Audio quality - 10/10
Privacy & Security - 10/10
Smart home interface - 8/10
Siri interaction - 7/10 (Siri does not answer every random question you can ask it over the internet, but improves over time with AI and machine learning by learning what you say and how you ask within the context as you use it.",Beat Smart Speaker Available

It sounds just like listening to a Beats Pill but a smart speaker. When the price dropped to 300 from 350 last year, I immediately went out and bought this. Today, I still use it and I’ve had no issues with it. The one thing I wish this would have is a snooze button when using it as an alarm clock. But overall, I definitely recommend this to my friends and family that are interested in a smart speaker besides the Amazon Echo almost everybody has!!! LOL",Best smart speaker from Apple!!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Apr 2020,HolaBird,The HomePod is great.  But you cannot voice command siri to play music from your itunes library that has been imported via a CD.  If you're been in apple and iTunes for over ten years like I have this is a huge miss.  I'm not sure but I think you can buy some apple music services or iTunes match to overcome this.  The option i took was to airplay to the HomePod from my mac.  Siri wills till respond to mute voice commands if you do it this way.,"Cool tech, but not fully unlocked"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,Angel,"Nice Price $200, Good quality, Great Sound , Excellent employee’s",Excellent
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,Serhman71,"Okay.  I do love Apple and their products.  I had some WiFi issues that made setting this unit up very difficult. ( finally had to part with my airport extreme after five years). After I replaced my router all was fine.  Asus AX88U which is awesome.
Set up on this unit was not bad at all with my iPhone 11 Pro. The sound quality is very good and I like pairing it with my Apple TV as a great external speaker.
I love being able to make calls and text, and speaking to my girlfriend on the HomePod has been a great hands free experience.
I wish Siri had the breadth of function that Alexa and Google Home do-but it’s still not a bad experience.  I got mine for $199.  At $300 I couldn’t justify the purchase.  If you have an iPhone, iPad, iMac and use Apple Music I would recommend this.  Hopefully Apple can improve on Siri’s functionality.  It’s a shame that they started the whole personal assistant deal and have fallen so far behind.  Although I will say she now can tell me how long it will take to get someplace (specific to contacts or business with road names included).  I like the voice recognition as Echo doesn’t have that feature.  I can also turn my Apple TV on and off which is lazy but fun.  I control my lights and switches seamlessly too.
Bottom line is it’s a fantastic Apple person product for $199.  I also have a SoundTouch 20 and 30 so I didn’t really need another speaker.  When the price dropped I grabbed one.
I hope this helps!",Great for Apple people like me.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 May 2020,Brima,Bought two of them when they went on sale. Def worth it,Great sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 May 2020,Briandb03,"The sound from this puppy is wonderful. Its ability to assess its surroundings and project room-filling sound is impressive. It’s quite heavy which helps give the bass some added “oomph.” It is best experienced when used in conjunction with an Apple Music subscription. One irritation is that it doesn’t seem to be able to begin a playlist in the middle and play forward from there. It must start at the beginning and play the songs in order. Passing off music from an iPhone to the HomePod isn’t always seamless, either. 

I liked the sound so much that I bought a second one. They were able to quickly identify each other in the HomeKit app and play well together. However, I must admit that it turns out I was fine having only one HomePod. I’d hoped to have one in front of the living room and one in back so that I would feel even more immersed by the sound. However, that isn’t really how it worked out. Instead, one gets assigned as the left channel, and one the right. Both really need to be in front of you for the best combined effect. Our apartment isn’t large, so a singe HomePod would have been fine. I suppose that a person in a larger home would find it beneficial to have one upstairs and one downstairs, but that isn’t our living situation. We’ll likely give our second one to a friend.

The HomePod  isn’t as smart as an Alexa. Instead of being able to add “skills,” many functions my be airplayed from an iPhone to the speaker, rather than the speaker being able to do it by itself. An easy fix would be for most iPhone apps to have HomePod versions the same way they do for the Apple Watch. The functionality through the HomeKit app is clunky and not as intuitive as you would expect from Apple. The Apple Watch and the HomePod don’t seem to communicate well, either. The watch and the HomePod don’t seem to be on the same page, as the watch is showing different music playing than what the HomePod is actually playing. If you tap the HomePod in the HomeKit app on your watch while the HomePod is playing, you don’t gain access to HomePod controls. Rather, the HomePod starts playing whatever music was on the watch. 

The HomePod can serve as a speakerphone so I was really eager to use that functionality for when we call family.  Unfortunately, the caller on the other line seems unable to hear clearly unless you really raise your voice or literally sit right next to the speaker. I’ve tried speaking to several callers to make certain the issue wasn’t because of one person’s phone. I learned that the issue was always a problem. Perhaps the microphone isn’t as attuned to voices during phone calls as it is to voices speaking commands to it.  
 
I know I’ve listed several complaints in this review, so I want to reiterate that this is an EXCELLENT speaker if you want room-filling sound with rich bass and crisp treble. But this is supposed to be smart and functional, too. Apple is usually too customer oriented to allow a product to be deficient for long. They like to make products that “just work.” Therefore, I’m hoping that future software updates will make it smarter and more user friendly.  If they do that, I’ll give it all five stars. It’s an expensive piece of equipment so it really should do more things more easily.","An excellent speaker, just not so smart."

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 May 2020,Anton,"Every smart speaker has its unique advantages, and while Amazon’s Alexa leads in IoT compatibility, Siri and HomeKit offer things like household-based home automation rules (turn off lights only when the last person leaves, for example). And Siri on this unit works much better with my LG TV.

Only downside is the price. I got it on sale for $200 and that was worth it. Oh, and sound quality is nice but not my main use for it.",Got it just for Siri/HomeKit
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 May 2020,ITGuy481,"This was easy to set up since it read all the information it needed from my phone.  The sound is incredible.  I am still annoyed that I have to start Pandora or Spotify on my phone and airplay it to the speaker instead of just asking Siri to play it on the HomePod. I was able to create a AirPlay II speaker pair with my ""Apple TV/Samsung Sound Bar"" in another room so that the same music played in the Kitchen and the living room.  That is useful.

I bought this on a super sale at less than $200.  At that price it seemed to me to be a good deal.","Sounds Great, listens well, still only Apple Music"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Apr 2020,tjb007,"I bought this for my spouse to use in her salon for music. Previously she was using a Google Home speaker, so she was due for a sonic upgrade. And the HomePod definitely produces better sound than a Google Home, no question. But unfortunately, the speaker just didn't work well for her. 

Her biggest problem was caused by plugging her Square mag-strip card reader into her iPhone while music was playing. No matter what she tried, plugging the Square reader into her iPhone made music on the HomePod pause (I assume the either the phone or speaker saw the Square reader as headphones or an audio device being plugged in). I tried to fix it, but couldn't ever figure it out. It drove her nuts though, especially since the old Google Home never had this problem. She is the type to just want things to work and be simple, and saying ""Hey Google, play my salon mix"" is about as easy as it gets. 

After a month with it, the pausing issue was on her last nerve. She decided to return it and she put that money towards a Dyson hairdryer, and resumed using the Google Home for her music needs. 

My second, and more general, gripe is the price. I purchased the HomePod in December 2019. At that time, there was a holiday price of $199. I think, sound-wise, that $199 is the right price for this speaker. Don't get me wrong, it sounds great, but it still sounds like a bluetooth speaker, which means a limited soundstage and some lack of clarity (particularly the highs and mids). It's just inherent in the design of a small object stuffed with speakers, you get a small footprint in exchange for a lack of clarity or separation. In my opinion, $299 would be much better spent on a pair of Sonos Ones in a stereo configuration, placed apart from one another. You'll get better stereo separation and a wider sound stage with a pair of Sonos versus the HomePod. You can also keep adding Sonos speakers as you see fit, to service multiple rooms or even create a surround system. Lastly, it is also worth mentioning that the HomePod is already a 2 year old product. Sure, it sounds great for a bluetooth speaker, and it does sound better than my $139 JBL Charge 4, but it doesn't sound TWICE as good.  If you pay more than $199 for this is in 2020, you're paying too much. 

In conclusion, if you must own a HomePod, wait for it to be on sale. $199 is a fair price for a 2 year old bluetooth speaker, but $299 just isn't a fair price anymore when you can get two Sonos One speakers for a dollar more. Also, if you're getting this for a similar use-case as my spouse, don't be surprised if using your iPhone for other activities while streaming music to the HomePod causes problems for you.","Great sound, but price and small quirks overwhelm"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Apr 2020,Espresso,"One of the most infuriating pieces of technology I’ve ever bought.
The good thing is that the sound quality is very strong.

What’s bad though is how often it doesn’t work.
Siri is useless. I also have a $30 Alexa and that is vastly superior. I expected that when I bought it however; as Siri is so bad on iPhones.

But the most annoying thing is the ‘hand over’ function where you used to touch the top with your iPhone and the music would transfer.
It works about 1 time in 5.
And then stops altogether.
I reset it, it works 1 time in 5 and then stops again.

If you just want a speaker, it is good (but I imagine Bose and others do it better for the price) but for everyone else - avoid.",Simply stops working

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,MusicFi117,"Yes, this speaker only works if you have an apple device, but if you're looking for a great wireless speaker that streams over WiFi instead of bluetooth, HomePod is the way to go! I love it and it can pick up my voice from a distance to either make it play music or even turn up the volume while it's playing. I have no issues with it yet. It does what I bought it for and it's so nice being able to play music now from my bed without having to get up and turn something on and having to connect my phone. 

I have my speaker setup next to an old 2.1 computer speaker setup in my room and one day my dad thought my music was playing from my 2.1 setup. He couldn't believe the sound was coming from just the HomePod. It's heavy and for a good reason! It puts out a good amount of volume and great quality sound. According to Amazon Music's app, the HomePod is playing at 24bit/48kHz for it's maximum streaming quality. I have a Hi-Fi setup in a separate room with studio monitors and an Onkyo receiver as well and the HomePod is still a great substitute when I don't feel like turning on my whole Hi-Fi setup.

I highly recommend the HomePod based on my experience, but you definitely have to first consider how you plan to use your wireless speaker and what you need from it. But again, for my needs it's been perfect and I have no regrets! I wish it was completely wireless being that it needs to be plugged in to work at all, but again that's what makes it able to put out the sound that it can.",Great Wireless Speaker for Apple Owners!!!!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,Chava,"I have been intrigued by this product since released, and frustrated with Apple's pricing practices and desire to be a ""top tier"" company by only offering high end high price products. This device always seemed a bit overpriced and unnecessary for me as I have a nice sound system connected to my TV, but I wanted something for Home Kit control. I like Apple's focus on encryption and privacy especially with the alway on always listening home controlling devices like this. I have apple Home Kit enabled devices in my house, and wanted a quick way for my pet sitter to turn them on and off when she comes in. I tried the Amazon dot last year, but found it difficult to setup and you need to have the always listening feature on. It also required setting up my already existing already working HomeKit enabled devices in the Alexa app which was hit and miss. I was waiting and hoping that Apple would release a cheaper version of this with less speaker and more control. Then Best Buy had this on holiday sale for 100 dollars off retail price. I figured it was worth a try knowing I had time to return it if it did not work. I set it up in seconds yesterday, and immediately transferred the podcast I was listening to on my phone to the speaker. I often wear headphones around the house and listen to music or podcasts throughout the day. This makes it easy to transfer what I am listening to via my phone airplay button and I can hear it clearly from anywhere in the downstairs. It sounds amazing and is so much easier to use to listen to anything on my phone. Yes you can use it without the Hey Siri feature listening. You can press and hold the center of the top panel which prompts Siri so I can turn off the ""always listening"" or if it does that annoying digital assistant thing where it mishears something I say that sounds vaguely like ""Hey Siri"" and becomes disruptive (This has not happened yet). I also like that in the Home app on my iPhone I can turn off the Home pod analytics which will not share my always on always listening recordings with Apple or anyone else. I wish the $200 price was not a promotion, but the retail price. After 1.5 days it has proven its worth and made me realize something I was overtly critical of and uninterested in is as good as I was sure it was not. I like being proven wrong. I am not sure I would pay $300 for it at full price, but if it keeps impressing me like this I might eat those words as well.",Great speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Mar 2020,badmammajamma,"I returned my Bose Soundlink 10 and paid the well worth difference to move to the apple homepod. This device has not received the proper spotlight it deserves. The device is an excellent addition to my apple home ecosystem.

The sound quality and deep base is superior to most of my prior 5.1 component systems over the last 20 years. A product that is quality and futuristic in quality and design.

Siri is what Siri is, but if I have to pick an overlord that listens to me at all times, but comfort is more with Apple than any other options that have more to gain by collecting data from me.","Bass and sound is better than good, it’s great!!"

I still find myself sitting near it listing to music and trying to understand how they were able to make the bass sound as tight and full as they were able to, the bass has a big impact.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Apr 2020,bob2112,"I tried a HomePod at launch and it was not worth the asking price so I returned it. I got another this past holiday season when the price dropped. Sadly, little has changed. I was ready for the idea that only Apple services were truly supported, but even those are poorly supported in parts. Siri continues to be a D+ student, not able to answer anything beyond yes/no questions, weather, basic headlines and set timers. Multi-user support is laughable and doesn't recognize the other users about half the time. And Apple HomeKit lags Alexa so badly as to make it worthless. Skip it, lots of other great speakers out there.",Second time is not the charm...
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,Chaz,Had this for about a year now. I can’t believe the sound that comes out of it. I’m very impressed. The Siri can pick up your voice even if your in the next room.,Great speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Apr 2020,BigMike,"Great sound. Excellent materials quality and solid construction.  The device sometimes disconnects or delays in reconnecting to WiFi resulting in failed or delayed execution of commands. In most cases repeating commands or waiting is required, but on rare occasions a restart is required. AirPlay syncing works great. For me this is two Apple TVs and one HomePod. When I hear what sounds like delay, adjusting the volume of one or more devices and keeping the relative volume the same on all devices resolves it. Keeping a balanced volume on all three devices results in no sense of delay.",Great Sound - delays or disconnects sometimes occu

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Apr 2020,Mikey2103,"I'm an Apple fanboy, yet there's one issue I have with this amazing smart speaker.  For sound, it's top notch and better than any other smart speaker out there, IMO.  The bass punches and the clarity is spectacular. If you buy two of these and make a stereo pair, expect to be amazed.  This speaker is a no brainer for Apple people and if you're patient, it usually goes on sale at BB every few months where you can snag it for $199.  When this happens, snatch the babies up. 
Now for my one main issue, and it has nothing to do with quality of sound.  I wish so badly that there were an Apple speaker that had an HDMI ARC port and could hook it up to your tv.  This way you could have true surround sound with these speakers much like the way Sonos works.  I only have one of these Homepods due to this reason and I have way more Sonos speakers around the crib.  Each of my flat screen tv's have a Sonos Beam synced up with two Sonos One SL's.  They're sound is good but if I had the option to replace this setup with Homepods, I would in a freaking heartbeat.  Maybe it's good that I can't cause that would destroy my wallet trying to replace the One SL's with Homepods.  But who knows, maybe if a miracle happened and Sonos and Apple had a collab... haha and we're all going back to our normal lives within a week (cough, Corona virus).  I would give these Homepods 5 stars and beyond if I could set them up as surround speakers for a TV but that just ain't where we're at.  If you do have an Apple 4K TV you can go into your video and audio settings and set the Homepods as the audio source but it's a pain to have to do that each time you turn on the device.  Not worth it in my opinion.  Anyway, if you plan on using the Homepod strictly for music then you're definitely getting your money's worth.",Amazing sound with one limitation
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Apr 2020,Myc19,This thing is sweet. It sounds so awesome my roommates have asked me if i “heard the neighbors throwing a party” at noon because of how much bass the thing has. 10/10 recommend,Way better than Alexa

I have about 9 Amazon shows/echos but want to jump on HomeKit because of privacy concerns.  Unfortunately I don't think Apple is ready to take over duties yet.  As far as sound goes, it does sound great but not better than the amazon sub at the same price.  I have Apple Music but I can also play that on my Alexas.  All in all happy I made the purchase but I struggle to find a niche for this HomePod to reside in.  So far it's main use is playing classic music which it is an absolute beast for.",Bought on sale.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Feb 2020,Austin,"I love this device. It receives much criticism because of it not being the smartest speaker out there. However, the quality is phenomenal. I use it to play music and do simple alarms, or turn off smart plugs. I do not ask the fun questions you can ask other home assistants. I can say “Hey Siri play songs I like” and it chooses personalized music for me that I enjoy. 


*DISCLAIMER*

I would NOT PURCHASE unless you have an Apple Music subscription. There are still many things you can do with this device, and it can still stream sound from your phone no matter what app you are using. However, I have found it’s peak performance is with the Apple Music subscription. 

Overall I have really loved this product. I even bought one for my parents to have at their house, along with a friend who has people over often and has an Apple Music subscription she is always using. Would 100% recommend.","Great speaker, just not so smart."

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Feb 2020,HappyHomePoduser,"Christmas present to myself. I mostly wanted it for music, possibly more Home kit stuff in the future. works well for me. I use lots of Apple products and services so I find it easy to use and convenient.

I got my first one from BB for $200 - new on sale. (Probably would not have paid the regular price of $299.) I liked it so much I went back and bought a second one to setup a stereo pair in my living room. Sounds very nice for that listening space.

A good wifi internet connection in the room where you place it is needed otherwise you are unlikely to find it useful. Mine occasionally looses the internet and needs to be reset (I unplug the unit wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Open the Home app on my iPhone and check settings. Sometimes it is checking for/waiting for an update).

I use iTunes Match and can ask Siri to play any of my hundreds of albums or any of the thousand of individual songs I have uploaded to my iTunes Match account and the HomePod plays them. I love the instant voice activated access to all of my music. Also works with my Apple TV if I want to use the HomePods for my TV sound output.

Good product if you know what you are buying and what the current and future uses are/will be with new Home kit functionality and new compatible devices becoming available.",I like it for my music

Boy was I wrong, it's AMAZING the kind of sound this little guy can pump out.  And the quality and fullness of the sound is nothing short of extraordinary.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Feb 2020,ycables76,"I have been intrigued by this product since released, and frustrated with Apple's pricing practices and desire to be a ""top tier"" company by only offering high end high price products. This device always seemed a bit overpriced and unnecessary for me as I have a nice sound system connected to my TV, but I wanted something for Home Kit control. I like Apple's focus on encryption and privacy especially with the alway on always listening home controlling devices like this. I have apple Home Kit enabled devices in my house, and wanted a quick way for my pet sitter to turn them on and off when she comes in. I tried the Amazon dot last year, but found it difficult to setup and you need to have the always listening feature on. It also required setting up my already existing already working HomeKit enabled devices in the Alexa app which was hit and miss. I was waiting and hoping that Apple would release a cheaper version of this with less speaker and more control. Then Best Buy had this on holiday sale for 100 dollars off retail price. I figured it was worth a try knowing I had time to return it if it did not work. I set it up in seconds yesterday, and immediately transferred the podcast I was listening to on my phone to the speaker. I often wear headphones around the house and listen to music or podcasts throughout the day. This makes it easy to transfer what I am listening to via my phone airplay button and I can hear it clearly from anywhere in the downstairs. It sounds amazing and is so much easier to use to listen to anything on my phone. Yes you can use it without the Hey Siri feature listening. You can press and hold the center of the top panel which prompts Siri so I can turn off the ""always listening"" or if it does that annoying digital assistant thing where it mishears something I say that sounds vaguely like ""Hey Siri"" and becomes disruptive (This has not happened yet). I also like that in the Home app on my iPhone I can turn off the Home pod analytics which will not share my always on always listening recordings with Apple or anyone else. I wish the $200 price was not a promotion, but the retail price. After 1.5 days it has proven its worth and made me realize something I was overtly critical of and uninterested in is as good as I was sure it was not. I like being proven wrong. I am not sure I would pay $300 for it at full price, but if it keeps impressing me like this I might eat those words as well.",Excellent speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jan 2020,LoveMyMusic,"I picked up a HomePod recently and I’ve been happy with it. I’ll admit I probably would be very happy with it if I had an Apple Music subscription. I choose not to have Apple Music because I have songs I’ve downloaded from artists websites that don’t have DRM attached to them and Apple Music doesn’t acknowledge their existence and I LOVE my music.
Now the good news is the HomePod is a GREAT speaker the sound is crystal clear from Dr Dre to Björk and all points in between the HomePod makes it all sound incredible.
I can play podcasts through my iPhone and I assume I can play audio books through it as well. If I had Apple Music I think the experience would be better, but I’m able to ask Siri a few things and I am very happy with my purchase. Just know that you can’t order amazon items through Siri and that it performs better with an Apple Music subscription before you buy!

Pros: sound is very good for the size, easy interaction with other Apple products, it can be used to make and answer phone calls, can be paired with a second HomePod and linked for better sound or multiple room configuration with Airplay 2 and Sonos products.  You can have Siri read or send texts and multiple user voice recognition, plug and play. In addition you can use the HomePod to control smart home devices, 

Cons: its a heavy speaker for the size, no external jacks available, power cord is permanently attached.
It works with only Apple Music. 
It has NO BLUETOOTH you need an iPhone or IPad to connect to it. If you are an android user I don’t recommend it but if you love Apple products like I do it’s a great addition to your Apple family.

It doesn’t get as loud as some speakers, but it puts out plenty of volume for a midsized room.  The Siri functionality is what you’ve come to expect from Apple’s digital assistant; she’s not the smartest, but she’ll do.  Sorry if my use of pronouns is offensive.  What’s really amazing is how well Siri can hear no matter how loud the music/audio you have pumping.  She easily hears me from a couple rooms away.  It really is amazing.  I have two tethered in my bedroom that play audio from my Apple TV that gives me a spectacular stereo experience.  It’s a fantastic audio experience.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Jan 2020,MacFlagg,"I bought several HomePods to replace Amazon Alexa’s in my home, due to privacy concerns. At first, I was pleasantly surprised by how little functionality I lost, with the help of some bridge apps, like Yonomi, Siri Shortcuts, and a piece of software I use called homebridge, I obtained off github. I was also surprised by how good they sound. I mean, they don’t sound anywhere near as good as a real home theater/hi-fi setup. But, for smart speakers, they’re leaps and bounds ahead of the others.

Unfortunately, that’s where the love affair ends. I could absolutely care less about music. I don’t even have Apple Music installed on any of my iOS devices. I consider the Music to be malware. It takes over your device every chance it gets, often ignoring the last audio source listened to, in my case it’s mostly podcasts and audiobooks, to shove music down your throat. I DISLIKE this behavior and the HomePod is completely infected with Apple Music. If the HomePod misunderstands anything, its defaults to Apple Music and tries to play a song. Just now, I was watching a tv show and the actor said, “seriously?”, and the HomePod replied, “I don’t know who is speaking,” and then started playing music. Some random song that I didn’t care for. OMG!

Then, this morning, I asked Siri, “how long will it take me to get to my next appointment?” Siri responded, “I can’t find that song,” then started playing some random music. I then asked, “how long will it take me to drive to my next appointment?” Siri responded, “traffic is light to John’s Barber shop in St Marys, so it will take about 45 minutes.” A) that is not the location of my appointment, B) I’ve never heard of or been to John’s Barber Shop and C) I don’t live in St Marys. I live in another town that is 45 minutes away. My appointment was literally 10 minutes from my house.

Using the HomePod with the Apple TV is also frustrating. One of my Apple TV’s is named Theater Tv. I can say, “pause Theater tv,” and the video will pause. Then if I say, “play Theater tv,” Siri will respond, “I’m having trouble playing your music,” then about 30 seconds later, a random song will start playing. 

Another problem is when saying, “unpause Theater tv,”  Siri will respond, “playing on multiple sources,” and will turn on and start playing music on multiple TVs throughout my home. OMG this is so annoying!

Then I tried to set up some Siri Shortcuts. I’ve got a Logitech Harmony remote and I used Yonomi to bridge Siri and the Harmony with Siri Shortcuts. I created a shortcut to turn on my projector, another to trigger the 3D Movie scene, one to control the AC unit, and another to turn on the theater room. So, when I asked Siri to, “turn 3D movie on, “ or, “ turn AC on,” or, “turn Tv room” I either got told that Siri didn’t have the capability or that there was no such room. I had to chance the names of the Siri Shortcuts to just random words and phrases to get them to work. 3D Movie became Bigtime, Tv room became just the word Maple, and AC’s became Turn Cool Breeze On. 

Then, there are connectivity issues. Just about every morning, one of my HomePods, when given a command, will respond, “Something went wrong, please try again later.” Often, rebooting the HomePod, from the Home App, fixes the issue. But every few days, one of my HomePods will have to be deleted from the Home app and re-paired to get it working again. Moreover, I get, “device not responding,” responses when trying to operate one of my HomeKit devices, by Siri on my phone can communicate with the device without issue. How is it that Siri on the HomePod is so much more incompetent than Siri on the iPhone. They should be the same, right? But, they are not. 

I called Apple to see if I could get some help and the senior tech was snarky to me and basically told me I was doing it wrong (kind reminded me of Steve Jobs telling everyone that they were holding the iPhone 4 wrong) and that I had to learn a whole new vocabulary to use Siri and that I was going to continue to have to name things random words, and remember them all, because that’s just how Siri works. He also flat out refused to troubleshoot Siri Shortcuts....Wow, just wow. 

If you’re buying HomePods just for music, I guess they’re fine. But if you’re buying them for smart home control, be prepared to be severely disappointed. This is the most un-Apple like experience/product I’ve ever had. They’re literally like disappointment and frustration generating machines. There is no delight to be found  here.

Siri is unbelievably stupid and incompetent at home control. Since home control is my primary concern, my only concern, I can’t give the product more than one star.","Siri is so bad, it’s truly an embarrassment"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jan 2020,Techcat,This a gift. I haven’t used it. I’m sure they’ll enjoy it.,This was a gift
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jan 2020,WoodyWoodchuck,"I bought a pair of HomePods from Best Buy right before Christmas when they were on sale for $199 apiece. At that price, the ability to play music (directly from Apple Music or via AirPlay from an iPhone or iPod) or sound from an Apple TV more than justified the price for the pair. (I have them set up to play as a stereo pair.) A good stereo would cost as much and saddle me with unsightly speaker wires. And the bass on these is just awesome, particularly when you figure the relatively small size.

I liked them enough that a few days after Christmas, I decided to pick up a second pair to use in another room. However, at that point the price had gone up to $300. They are nice speakers but at $200 apiece they are pricey; at $300 apiece they are way overpriced.

My advice. Wait until they go on sale for $199 either at Best Buy or at another retailer that Best Buy will price match.

As for Siri functionality, I was pleasantly surprised. She can hear me even when the HomePods are playing music pretty loudly. And most of the basic commands I’ve tried work well. Voice control of HomeKit accessories seems brisker than the same command given to Alexa. However, when I ask Siri to turn on a group of lights she does fine but when I ask her to turn off the same group, she replies, “I can’t turn off a scene.” Odd.

Where Siri still falls down is on knowledge-based requests. She still tends to want to send you the information as a link to a website you can view on your iPhone or other screen. Since  HomePod has no screen, these requests cannot be fulfilled.

The basic bottom line is these are great speakers when on sale but overpriced at full price. Smart speaker functionality is getting better all the time but still needs some work.

Oh, and you still need an iOS device to set the HomePod up, so if the HomePod is your only Apple device, you’re out of luck,",Great speaker but wait until they are on sale

I listen to all genres of music, and they all sound superb! I would recommend this speaker to those that who favor superior sound with smart speaker features.

One should always be cautious of first generation Apple products.  The first Watch and iPad were both underpowered.  The first iPhone was missing important features such as GPS and 3G connectivity.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Jan 2020,TypTech,"Using this system of mics, distance & sound calibration (etc. etc. etc.) I’m not sure what to say bad/or cons. Well, the price is certainly not as that of the black puck things nobody seems to use.I can be downstairs, and say “Hey Siri, tell me a joke” or something like “Who is Doctor Strange” as I did not know- thought the movie looked cool. 
 I ask, and get about 20 seconds read about said topics, AND verbalized to me in a voice which I notice intonations, inflection, and pause where necessary.
Hey Siri will you marry me? “Let’s just be friends, ok?” Fine Siri, play my favorite songs. -mine, as it does know my voice from others, thus “my songs” are specific to me.
 Perhaps it comes down to this; if you want to plug in a device and use it, almost out of the box & it just works looks cool, sounds amazing, which is a nice quality for a speaker, get yourself down to the Best Buy n’ get yourself one. :)

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jan 2020,gusg,"First, I bought this to replace an amplifier and two speakers that were taking up too much space in my kitchen, and on that front the HomePod was a great purchase. It sounds just as good as what I had before, with the added benefit of easier connectivity (no need for Bluetooth pairing). 

Where the HomePod lacks is in its voice capabilities. I frequently accidentally activate Siri when talking to my cat (saying things that sound nothing like “Hey Siri”), and the HomePod consistently has problems recognizing my voice vs my boyfriend’s (I often get the response of “I’m not sure who you are” when trying to add reminders or reading texts).","Great sound, but Siri is lacking"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Jan 2020,Lisa,"We loved our Apple Home Pod, until it started interrupting play with a very old buzzing noise.   After trying the DIY fixes posted online we called Apple Support.  We do not have Apple Care or a close Apple Store,  but since our speaker is still inside it’s one year warranty customer service offered to send a box for us to send the speaker in for repair.  At this we were fine with that resolution. 

Unfortunately after waiting 2 weeks, the box never arrived and I had to contact customer service again.  

Since the delay was due to lack of follow up on Apples side, I asked them to upgrade my service level for this incident to Apple Care and send a replacement and I would immediately return the faulty Home Pod.  

I was VERY frustrated when not only was I refused the upgraded service to cover Apples Oversight - but the Customer Service rep refused to escalate to someone who had authority to create a better resolution due to their original service oversight.  

We have made enormous investments in Apple products and have appreciated their focus on user experience - but this experience will have us evaluating their competitors before making future purchases.",Loud Buzzing Noise / Poor Resolution

First, the sound quality is fantastic (better than other speakers I've heard from Sonos to Google). Because it is limited to Siri (which is much more scaled back than other voice assistants), it does have some limitations in regards to it being a voice assistant...but, this is a speaker first and assistant way down the list. Where it shines is the ease of using the speaker with Apple Music (though other native service integrations like Spotify are coming soon).

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Jan 2020,Zoosh,"I bought two, for a stereo set, when on sale. Figured they'd work well with my Apple devices.

The wonderful: music is beautiful, TV and films are generally fantastic. I use it primarily with my iPad Pro 12"", iPhone 6s Plus both on iOS 13. Occasionally on my Mac, in the Music app.

I believe the latest iOS update improved the speakers' reliability. Classical, rock, folk, jazz - all excellent. With the improved reliability lately, I won't return them. I was otherwise considering it,

The eh: one speaker often picks up sound before the other. The lag isn't huge, just annoying. Occasionally the connection doesn't happen. I have to try a few times, both in Apple Music and using Airplay.

The speakers cut out on occassion, then resume sound.

Depending on the app, Airplay can be a nightmare. In Music, Prime Video, Netflix - rarely problems. Airplay in the Criterion Channel app sometimes works, sometimes becomes a nightmare and unuseable.

MacOS: like everyone else....why limited to iTunes? When my older MacBook eventually fails, hopefully not for a while, and if I can purchase the 16"", I'd like to watch films on the newer, larger screen and use the Homepods.

Siri: gets confused. The speakers are in my bedroom. I did not purchase them for Siri but for their music quality. When my iPhone, iPad, and HomePod are in the room together, I can say, ""Siri, turn off the lights,"" and at least two-three devices respond. The device occasionally become confused and turn the lights off, then maybe turn a lamp back on again.",Amazing sound; wifi lag and Airplay - eh

I wish it had a little more power.  It sounds great but it’s not going to outperform a set of decent bookshelf speakers.  For general listenIng it’s great.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Dec 2019,krazygreekguy,"The quality of sound on a speaker this size never ceases to amaze me. The microphones’ ability to pick up you voice when talking to Siri with music playing full blast is just awesome too.

Some people tend to point out Siri is terrible or worse than Google Assistant and/or Amazon Alexa, but Siri will never be as good as those assistants as it does not collect data like they do. Also, Apple is marketing this device as a high fidelity speaker first and voice assistant second, whereas it’s the opposite for Google and Amazon. That explains the prices differences.

A couple other things to note. This speaker is geared towards Apple devices. There is no auxiliary jack or Bluetooth support, which forces the user to use Apple’s wireless streaming protocol: Apple AirPlay, which was recently updated to AirPlay 2. AirPlay 2 allows for Apple devices to stream music wirelessly to speakers or receivers that support AirPlay 2 for multi-room audio (similar to Sonos - Sonos now supports AirPlay 2), but you can use any brand speaker that supports it. AirPlay 2 uses WiFi and is much better than Bluetooth anyway, but this unfortunately does not allow non-Apple users to use the HomePod with their devices.

Pros:
-Excellent sound
-Excellent microphones
-Multi-user voice support 
-Ability to receive future software updates with new features

Cons:
-Marketed towards only Apple users
-No headphone jack
-No Bluetooth",Excellent speaker!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Dec 2019,Chanimal23,I returned for 2 main reasons. Siri is still stupid compared to Google. And to obtain stereo sounds you’ll need 2 HomePod. Apple needs to drop the price to make that happened.,Siri is still dumb

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Jan 2020,MoreMusic,"I just received my HomePod a few days ago so I’m still trying to optimize functionality. First of all, it sounds great! Easy to use AirPlay to listen to my music and Tune In app. Bought iTunes Match with the expectation that I could use Siri to play my iTunes library, but so far that hasn’t been great. Seems more a problem of Siri not recognizing my requests (I say “play Beatles songs” and Siri says I don’t have any Beatles songs. I ask it multiple times in a row and get the same answer and then try again later and it starts to play Beatles songs from my Library.) I think that using “shortcuts” will probably help, but that is a work in progress for me. Even with these issues, I still recommend the HomePod for those who use Apple products. Also, at the moment it’s on sale for $199.","Great sound. Works well with iPad, Siri not so muc"

Paired with Apple Music it’s super easy to use, as long as Siri understands.  Apple could make this even better and more universal if they open up Bluetooth for non airplay and allowed 3rd party apps to work with it directly without needing to use an iPhone to airplay music from my Plex music library for instance or any other audio (I.e. TuneIn radio support).  The hardware can do it, if only apple allowed it.  Super wish list, Apple should make the HomePod at as a WiFi mesh network!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Jan 2020,MacRick,"I bought a pair of HomePods with the hope of simplifying the sound system in my home office. I was disappointed for a number of reasons. I returned them to the store.
1. Setup was a bit frustrating. I was playing music from a desktop Mac, but the speakers played random selections of their own at top volume. Once I got them silenced, the update process took a very long time before I could gain full control over them. 
2. Stereo paring: When I set them up as a “stereo pair” they immediately began playing separate tracks from my library at different volume levels. Quitting the Music app was the only way to resolve this.
    a. The paired speakers are accessible from the Music app by not the System Preferences panel. There they appear as separate devices.
3. Sound quality was the greatest disappointment. Voices in choral works sounded like they were coming out of a cardboard box and they lacked warmth. Orchestral works lacked richness and complexity. Overall the sound was much inferior to the surround sound system and patchwork of speakers I’ve been using for the past several years.",Disappointing sound quality

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Dec 2019,baforer,"First I want to say that I am happy with my purchase.
The HomePod is a good sounding and reasonably competent smart speaker.
I purchased this on Black Friday and at that price I think this was a fair deal.
The things that stop this from being a 5 star review are as follows:

The reviews I read stated this as the best sounding smart speaker and this may be true, but in my opinion it is not the best sounding portable speaker. I have a Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth speaker that is of smaller form factor that I feel is a better sounding speaker.

As a smart speaker, Siri is ok but I have a Google Home Mini that is more competent at internet type questions. I don’t have any smart home devices that Siri or Google can control so I can’t speak to that, but the grand kids have a lot of fun asking Google stupid internet questions that Siri doesn’t handle as well. I have asked questions that Siri did not answer that Google did.

It would be nice if the HomePod supported music platforms other than Apple Music like Spotify or Pandora. Now this was not a real issue for me as I had Apple Music for free with my phone service but for other users this may be an issue.

Pluses for the HomePod.
I would like to mention that the HomePod can answer a phone and do so for multiple users. The Google Home Mini can place an internet call with a predetermined phone number For caller ID but it cannot answer a call to your phone (it can answer duo phone calls). The HomePod can place calls from your phone and answer phone calls to your phone. It does this for multiple users as it determines which phone to use by your voice. I wanted this feature so my wife can answer her phone while being busy in the kitchen which is where our HomePod is setup.

Another plus for the HomePod is that setup is so easy. Granted you have to be an iPhone or iPad user but most of the setup is copied from your iPhone or iPad. Things such as WiFi setup and Siri recognizing your voice is all taken from your device.","Good smart speaker, but not great"

Be sure to have phone on the same band/network. When setting it up be sure to choose which network band you want cause the only way to change it is a complete reset. 
Sound is very clear and good clear bass for its size. It will pick up the hey siri comand from another room with a normal low voice with music playing loud. Use the command (Set volume to 50%) to change or set volume.

Sound quality is great. I'm not an audiophile, but I will say that the sound coming the speaker is better than my little Bose (not a fair comparison since that one is portable, and the HomePod is not).
I've also tested it out using Airplay from my Apple TV and this will provide a slightly deeper and more immersive sound if you place it next to, or behind, the listeners. I'm planning on getting another one eventually to even out the sound on the other side. 
Siri commands are picked up really well. And now with the last update (13.2.x) it can recognize your voice so that each member of your home can have personalized responses.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Dec 2019,Applefan12,"My family is pretty deep in the apple ecosystem. I held off on HomePod because of the price and we have the first gen Sonos. 
I bought this on sale at see how it could make things easier. 
Pro’s:
Great for music on iTunes (most time). My family picked this up rather quickly. 
Good quality speakers and fills a room nicely
Great if you use HomeKit. 
Also good for looking up info such as weather, movies, store info. 
Timers, I do a lot of cooking and the ability to have multiple timers going is nice. 
Cons:
The voice recognition for music goes wonky for bit and I can’t figure out why i will say Siri play the classical station on Monday it will play the right station. Then on Tuesday I will say the same thing and something complexity different comes up. It does this for a few days then it will go back to normal. 
Whenever you say hey Siri every Apple device answers and it is random to which will answer your request. 
On the lighter side if you have some names is even remotely closed to Siri, Siri will answer. My daughters name sound simplified to Siri, and Siri will answer when I call her. 

Overall it is a bit iPhone which has great sound. It is a nice to have and the family picked up on its use right away but some glitches that pop up now and then stop it from a perfect score.",Pretty quick to get used to
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Dec 2019,ksm94,I tried alexa and I have to say this product is far away! I use an iPhone and the match is perfect I love this product,Perfect smart speaker
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Dec 2019,FrankS,"I have been intrigued by this product since released, and frustrated with Apple's pricing practices and desire to be a ""top tier"" company by only offering high end high price products. This device always seemed a bit overpriced and unnecessary for me as I have a nice sound system connected to my TV, but I wanted something for Home Kit control.  

I like Apple's focus on encryption and privacy especially with the alway on always listening home controlling devices like this.  I have apple Home Kit enabled devices in my house, and wanted a quick way for my pet sitter to turn them on and off when she comes in.  I tried the Amazon dot last year, but found it difficult to setup and you need to have the always listening feature on.  It also required setting up my already existing already working HomeKit enabled devices in the Alexa app which was hit and miss.  I was waiting and hoping that Apple would release a cheaper version of this with less speaker and more control.  

Then Best Buy had this on holiday sale for 100 dollars off retail price.  I figured it was worth a try knowing I had time to return it if it did not work.  I set it up in seconds yesterday, and immediately transferred the podcast I was listening to on my phone to the speaker.  I often wear headphones around the house and listen to music or podcasts throughout the day.  This makes it easy to transfer what I am listening to via my phone airplay button and I can hear it clearly from anywhere in the downstairs.  It sounds amazing and is so much easier to use to listen to anything on my phone.

Yes you can use it without the Hey Siri feature listening.  You can press and hold the center of the top panel which prompts Siri so I can turn off the ""always listening"" or if it does that annoying digital assistant thing where it mishears something I say that sounds vaguely like ""Hey Siri"" and becomes disruptive (This has not happened yet). 

I also like that in the Home app on my iPhone I can turn off the Home pod analytics which will not share my always on always listening recordings with Apple or anyone else.  

I wish the $200 price was not a promotion, but the retail price. After 1.5 days it has proven its worth and made me realize something I was overtly critical of and uninterested in is as good as I was sure it was not.  I like being proven wrong.  I am not sure I would pay $300 for it at full price, but if it keeps impressing me like this I might eat those words as well.","Excellent product, sale price should be permanent"

I just bought my second one and they’re exactly one year apart. One fills the room but two working together, is another experience entirely. When Apple says that two will work in perfect unison, they’re serious. Both HomePods detect each other and work to give equal sound in every direction possible and it doesn’t sound weak or distorted. The sound is evenly balanced and because it senses barriers and walls, it never sounds like its just”blasting” music. The pairing to one another is simple or from another Apple device is also simple. With the HomePod, I’m reminded of Steve’s old line “it just works”, and this really does.",Awesome sound! Definitely consider.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Dec 2019,zgnsi,"I stream Spotify and Pandora. This speaker is only good if you plan to pay into Apple Music. You can stream audio to this device but not use voice controls with those applications...

We researched a number of smart home hubs and landed on the Apple HomePod.  First, as a speaker, it has amazing full sound and has flexibility in sound set up using the equalizer native in the Apple settings menu of our phones.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Dec 2019,Joey,"Overall completely blown away with all the issues this thing has!! Don’t get me wrong the sound is impressive but that it. Siri is useless which I knew that going into it however when you buy apple products you expect the seamless connectivity and ease of use! That’s why I have many many apple products. However this doesn’t even seem like an apple product... it actually makes trying to listen to music a total hassle. And I have new iPhone 11 with Apple Music! Long story short airplay can’t even get through one or two song without stopping. Half the time it can’t even connect if I skip the song it just sits there thinking, and if I use Siri to play my music and does the same thing.... NOTHING!!! Some of the forums ive read said you need a good Wifi setup. Well rest assured I have the best possible WiFi! 1000mbps downloads!! So that is clearly not the case. Trust me I love apple products. I have almost every single one but this is complete trash. Totally useless piece of tech. And I’m saying all this when I bought it 9on sale for $199!! NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!",Not even worth the huge discount I got on it

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Dec 2019,charlie,"I wanted an assistant that could integrate with the smart lightning/devices around the house. But, I also wanted the assistant to not keep my audio in the cloud somewhere where the company/third party contractors/etc could listen to it also. 

The only choice for such an assistant so far is the HomePod, since as long as you opt out, Apple will not keep your audio in the cloud. 

I wasn't expecting much, since I've had Alexa's and Google Home around the house before and they both didn't work terribly great. However, the HomePod is remarkably better at listening to the ""Hey Siri"" command from everyone (from adults to children) in my household. This is even when the HomePod is playing music. 

I used to have multiple Google Homes dispersed throughout the house because Google just couldn't hear the ""Hey Google"" command very well. But now I just have one HomePod in the center of the house that can be used from nearly anywhere in the house. 

I don't enjoy the price as much and hope that come out with cheaper version of Siri speakers.",Better than I thought

Controls my Home integrated devices and maintains a consistent connection (even after a power outage). I have Apple Music and this device has become the DJ that takes requests. I now have purchased 2 of these to cover any command given throughout my house.

Alexa just cannot replicate this.",Awesome sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,1,13 Dec 2019,Axel,"When the speaker does what it is supposed to the sound is great, but unfortunately takes a while to get anything playing from your phone. It tires to open a new hub so you can control the HomePod volume and still control your phone volume but it usually can’t keep playing more than 1 song without crashing if not stopping in the middle of the song. And the hub will give you a loading screen and Apple Music will also give you a loading screen and you can’t really do anything while it tried to connect. I’m able to listen to music about 40% of the time when I use this speaker. It just tried to do too much without having the software to back it up so it leads to a lot of headaches and frustrations.","Good sound quality, horrible function."

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,EricB,"I wasn’t impressed with the HomePod when I heard it in the store, but the reviews said otherwise so I purchased one. In a home situation the sound is absolutely defying. How can so much sound come from such a small package? I was so impressed that I purchased another one and use them in a stereo configuration. Now it’s two times awesome!! The amount of bass these speakers put out is outrageous. Siri seems to be an attentive listener and quickly finds a song I want to hear or skips tracks or adjusts volume.",Awesome sound from a small package!!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,adeelc,I love the sound quality of this speaker and the how good the microphone is even with loud music playing.  There is a limited version of Siri with this HomePod.  I wish that Siri was able to do as much on this product as it does with iOS devices.,"Great sound, but Siri leaves a bit to desire"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,DroneGeek,"Is a good speaker was hoping it would be the Apple version of Alexa but it requires the phone and/or my MacBook to do anything meaningful other than play music.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Tideturner,"I purchased this HomePod for $100 off, so it was a good value at the time. I love the sound quality, how it fills the room.

I’ve considered turning it off, but that would mostly defeat the power of the speaker.",Good value

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,doctorwho,"The HomePod isnt for everyone. Siri isn't a great assistant, there's no bluetooth support (only AirPlay). So this device is more for someone who is already in the Apple Ecosystem and want a decent sounding smart speaker. 

The sound quality is great. Paring with another HomePod is fantastic. It also serves as a Hub for all of your HomeKit devices, thus allowing you to control things remotely. The assistant features are just okay. Standard at best. But upcoming software updates may make it more appealing.","If you're in the Ecosystem, it may be worth it"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Crew,"Truly, my house is an almost everything Apple home. However I never thought I’d ever buy the HomePod especially at $300.  While we have home automation with Alexa and Google.  Both me and my best friend also have mostly Apple devices. We stopped in our local BestBuy and we saw the HomePod on display. We tested it out and we were hooked line and sinker.
However, once we got it setup 10 minutes and realized how freaking easy it was to setup we tested it in the home. The sensors in the device adjusts to the acoustic of the area it is placed in. We were in awe at how this device performed.  My best friend had set tumbler down with a cold drink on the same table as the HomePod and as soon as he released the tumbler the HomePod made an adjustment to the quality of sound. He picked the tumbler out of disbelief thinking it was just my imagination. And the HomePod readjust itself again and then he put it back down and the HomePod again readjust the sound. Nevertheless the HomePod not only connected to our WiFi and Apple Music account all within the 10 minutes. I am very surprised Apple isn’t selling these at a record pace.",Much better than expected!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,BBYReviewer,"Sound quality is quite good, but a single speaker is not loud enough. Bass begins to diminish at higher volumes. Two speaker setup is ideal for a larger room. Apple Music subscription required. It works on airplay over WiFi and not Bluetooth. No WiFi - no music!

Still a pricy option compared to other speakers. I tried my luck with a open box speaker, but it had 2 dents and a crack on the top. The store manager could have easily dropped the price of the product since it wasn’t as described, but she refused to budge. After 2 weeks with it I returned it back because I couldn’t justify paying $40 less than brand new with so many flaws. Ended up buying a new HomePod and its works great.",HomePod Smart Speaker

I have since connected numerous smart devices and all were very simple connections. If I had one criticism I would say I wish the volume at top end was a bit higher but not a deal breaker at all.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Beto,"This as a speaker is good, but if you don’t use Siri often, it’s no better than buying a dedicated speaker.  I have a Bose S1 Pro speaker that is louder, but that one is more expensive.  Also, I think the Google Home speakers are louder.

If you do use Siri, this is great.  It can hear you even if you speak at normal volumes at a distance.  It works especially well if you have Apple Music, as you can ask Siri to play whatever song you want.  If you haven’t invested heavily in other Apple products, then there isn’t much appeal here.  On the other hand, if you do have iPhones, iPads, Apple TV’s, and Macs in your house, you will enjoy adding this product to the lineup.

It also holds up well over time, given that the hardware in this product is from the time of the iPhone 6 or 6s.  It still sounds good and there isn’t any lag that I’ve noticed.",The audio quality is pretty good

I decided to purchase a second and saw that an open box certified one was a available. I purchased it and shortly after getting it home I noticed that it was a bit glitchy.

Even though I have Apple Music set up, siri likes to ignore my requests and play whatever it feels like. Sound is heavy in bass, which some may not like. Voice call quality is so-so -- the receiving end tells me that the quality is worse than using iphone speaker. Overall, I use it in the kitchen as a speaker only, to airplay my iphone music. You can get better bluetooth speakers for the same price, so I'm not sure what Apple intended with the HomePod. I certainly should have returned it... too bad I threw out the packaging.",Only useful as a bluetooth speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Jordan,"Leave it to Apple to combine the best of their tech and Beats technology. I especially like how seamless it is with all my Apple tech I already own. The speaker is powerful but compact. The 7 mics find it easy to hear me speaking to Siri, even when volume is turned up. And it's great to connect 2 speakers for a more immersive surround sound experience. The only downside I can find is that the speaker is hard-wired to a power source, so it's not portable - in that it doesn't have it's own battery supply.

These are great for almost everything, but fall a little short for spoken word podcasts. We have a Tivoli Audio M1BTSLC Model One Bluetooth radio in my wife's study, and going from one room to another voices are clearer on the Tivoli. That said, for ease of use and overall music playing, we're very pleased.",Get these in pairs.

The sound quality, Apple Music and Siri integration is as good as advertised. The Homekit options are vast (although the Google and Amazon devices have a bigger selection) and worth it. To me, sking Siri to pull a song from Apple Music (or podcast from the Apple podcasts) and then play with the sound quality is has (and as seamlessly as it does) is the big seller for me.

Honestly it's so frustrating because on the other hand its occasionally a pain to connect to it. I think that's true of all these devices though, but the biggest glaring issue is the fact it's not wireless and/or cordless. Why, oh, why can't I just unplug it (the charging cable is built into the dang thing) and carry it where I want? Even if it didn't have a battery, and it needed to be plugged in, I still would just buy like 2 charging cables (one inside/one outside) so I could switch between rooms easily and not unplug it from the wall each time!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,kilowatthours,"I'm a long time Amazon Echo user. I love my Echo. It connect with a ridiculous number of services, and is a respectable bluetooth speaker. I haven't had a reason to switch to anything else.

Then I heard the Apple HomePod.

I'm a nerd who love tinkering so on a certain level I love the flexibility of the Echo. On a more realistic level I just never use that flexibility. I listen to music and ask silly questions to get the thing to give silly responses. I already use Apple Music and let me tell you, the Echo isn't even in the same class as the Echo speaker-wise. This. Thing. Sounds. Phenomenal. One speaker easily fills a large room with incredibly well-balanced music.

As for Siri, I honestly have struggled adopting it due to poor detection or just clumsy responses. The Siri that comes with the HomePod is ridiculously fast, and actually feels more conversational.

Now the ""catch"". It simply doesn't compare to other devices when it comes to integrating with other home automation devices. Compatibility is limited to HomeKit approved devices which while expanding, isn't terribly robust yet. I'm confident that this will improve (assuming Apple remains committed to this market) but I would definitely do your research to make sure your devices are compatible before buying if that's important to you.

In short, if you're in the Apple eco-system (Apple Music, Apple News, Reminders, etc.) then you can't go wrong. If you're a home automation nerd, do your research and prepare to either be disappointed or make some sacrifices. And if you just love music, just give this thing a listen. You won't regret it.",Phenomenal!...With a catch
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Danr6,"Just like all of the other reviews state, this speaker sounds amazing. I had a small google speaker before this one, I wanted something that would utilize my apple music subscription without using Bluetooth on my phone. The Apple Homepod sounds amazing!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,RayB,"I was hesitant due to the price, so I waited for it to go on sale, and because it is not a true Bluetooth speaker. However, I do love the voice recognition and audio quality. It also helped me get exposure to Apple Music (I was previously not a subscriber). With the free trial, I am now a dedicated Apple Music user. I have found that the HomePod’s look and sound are awesome and I keep using it more and more each day. I also love that you can now connect two units together for either left/right stereo sound or whole-home audio when you’re moving around the house.

It’s super easy to setup, it calibrates itself to sound great no matter where you put it. Siri sounds great, makes Alexa sound like a robot. It sounds amazing. The highs are great, the mid range (vocals) are awesome, the bass is so deep and very satisfying. On top of all that, it’s beautiful in white or black. I have three of them and if I knew that Apple was devoted to the product I would buy many more. A HomePod mini is needed badly and an investment in HomeKit would be helpful too. The HomePod should have been released for 199.00 and even then that would have been asking a lot. 349.99 was an absolutely non starter for 90% of buyers, leaving only Apple fans like me, and even I never paid full price for it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,LegacyMeatware,"I waited nearly a year to purchase the HomePod until it went on sale for a not inexpensive, but much more reasonable price for an innovative and well executed speaker design. I took some time to “burn in” the speaker components with a variety of music styles, something done with higher end speakers in expectation of bringing out audio warmth and fidelity. I even placed it in a bay window enclave to act as a sort of speaker horn enclosure so as to enhance the projected sound. Such were my high hopes for how well the HomePod might perform. After all, it had been hyped and compared to higher end stereo equipment due to its genuine technical advances in speaker design. Its WiFi only input maximized the digital music information the advance computer chip could upscale for the multiple speakers calibrated for each personalized listening area. 

Well, it turns out not to be the aural renaissance of bookshelf audio systems, an unrealistic expectation Apple perpetrated upon itself for this device. Nonetheless, it is a compact and competent sound system that produces music with enough quality to lose yourself in it, absent of harsh or distracting distortions in the musical reproduction. It is a joy to merely ask for whatever song or album comes to mind from memory or suggestion and then be able to listen effortlessly to faithfully reproduced music. 

That said, and despite being a fan of the Apple ecosystem who harbored high hopes for how well the HomePod would perform, it is evident that it is not, and never will be a high-end bookshelf speaker system that transforms the music from the mundane into some superlative version. Moreover, it is ironic and frustrating that in trying so hard to be more than it is via strict audio source inputs, it is transformed into less than it could be if only Apple would “jailbreak” the HomePod. For starters, it could at least allow Bluetooth 5 audio connections for input. That would unleash it as a top-notch Bluetooth speaker free from depending upon a WiFi network, freely accessing whatever sound sources were available to the listener. A USB-C input would be a cinch winner also, simultaneously inputting audio and charging the audio input device. Yes, I know that would impinge on the revenue stream from Apple Music that is the real money to be made by Apple with the HomePod, but it would enable a moderately high-end audio system and an ultimate midway audio system. It would likely be the preeminent sound system for small-spaces like apartments, dorms, offices, RV’s, work spaces, sheltered exterior spaces, etc. At the same time, doing so would not prevent it serving as the aspirational sound system Apple envisioned. It would dovetail nicely into maximizing their high-dollar X series phones that now have Bluetooth 5, which seemingly allows virtually lossless digital streaming rather the the garbage in, garbage out hyper-compressed digital formats inherent in previous Bluetooth iterations. As it is, the HomePod has garnered a precious small percentage of the smart speaker market as they have virtually required an Apple Music subscription to make use of their speaker. In pursuit of their version of the perfect sound system, Apple has destroyed the very good, and for most customers of a device like this, good enough is perfect. 

That still leaves the not-so-smart-speaker problem of poor, dear, simple Siri’s incompetence at summoning anything but Apple Music (or most anything else reliably) that severely limits HomePod's utility as a go-to music and other listening device. That one will not go away until Apple develops the in-house talent to build Siri out as seemingly envisioned originally, or the in-house vision to develop her by building out that talent however those billions of earnings might increase product value. Then Siri might just tell me she does not have access to Willie and Lobo in her music catalogue rather than giving me some random Willie Nelson album.",Could have been a contender

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,JoshA,"Unpopular opinion: HomePod is the smartest smart speaker. As someone who at one time had a Google home, Echo and HomePod in each room of my home (...I have a problem) I can confidently say that the HomePod is the best at controlling my home. Whether it's the lights, the doors, the appliances, my nanoleaf stuff or whatever because of HomeKit...it works. My Google/Amazon speakers couldn't control all of my Philips Hue lights because there were too many and they can only connect to one Hue Bridge. HomeKit/HomePod can connect to multiple. I also think this one has the best microphones, by far. Even when music is playing, I don't have to speak more than at a conversational level to get Siri's attention. Also, I'm really impressed with Siri's ability to process complex commands - ""Turn off all of the lights upstairs except for the ones in the guest bathroom"", pretty cool. Also, I like the sound but I'm not blown away by it (-1 star). I don't think that it's THAT big of a difference from the Plus or Max though. HomeKit is the selling point for me. *I'm fully integrated into Apple's ecosystem. Services, hardware, clouds, etc. So I'm probably the exact right audience for this.*",Best Speaker for Smart Homes

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Lucas787,"If you are looking for a device that Airplay and sounds great, then this is it! Apple has created a speaker that sounds great, looks great and it's very easy to set up 

The good: Looks great, Sounds Great, Has Siri (could go any way with that) NIce look 

The bad: A lot of the home devices must be designed with Apple ID number to set up. Google home has more apps and its smarter than Siri 

Overall: If you want airplay very easy then this is it, Great sound! Siri needs improvement if they want to compete in the Home business",Great sound!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,0x41726C6F,"Great sound quality, easy setup, Siri is limited and can't answer basic questions your phone can. Also Siri only recognizes one user (and their playlists).","Good, could be better with a software update."
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Brian5,"To get this out of the way upfront, I am in the Apple ecosystem. I have iPads, iPhones, and MacBook Pros and like the way they work together. In its current form, this is not a product for everyone. I would think it would be practically unusable if you weren’t at least partially in Apple’s ecosystem. If you want the device to stream music from an internet source, you need to have an Apple Music subscription. I don’t, but I have iTunes Match so this device can stream my music from the cloud. Unlike other devices, like my Echo, it doesn’t support Pandora, Spotify, etc at this time. You can use AirPlay and send these sources to your HomePod from your phone, iPad, MacBook, but not without. The sound quality is very good for its size. It is able to fill the room, sounds clear and crisp, with a good overall sound. Some reviews complain about too much bass. I can see this being true, as it does seem to emphasize bass a little bit. I haven’t noticed it to be a problem in the genres I listen to (Country and Classic Rock primarily). As far as a smart speaker, it does a great job of hearing your spoken commands. I think it exceeds the competition here. Siri almost never miss hears me or ignores me. I can’t say the same for Alexa. Siri has gotten a lot better since this was released. There are still some things she ‘can’t do on this HomePod’ but overall is pretty good. I have to take away one star because of one problem. Being in the Apple ecosystem, I wanted to have Siri add things to my grocery list, reminders, send texts, etc, and I get told the iPhone that was used to setup HomePod must be on the same Wi-Fi network much too often when it is sitting right next to me. I do think it is a 4 star product with the other limitations mentioned above because it generally does everything it promises to do very well. If you are unaware of the limitations, you may be disappointed. Another thing to consider is the color. I went with the black because the white was dirty immediately after being taken out of the box.","Good sound, compact size"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,RubyTubby,"The HomePod is 2 devices in one, a premium speaker and a home hub. In my opinion the sound quality is the best on the market. Features allow for searching for music, setting timers and making phone calls. Siri voice is very accurate and the design is quite attractive. On the flip side Siri is limited to the Apple universe(Appleverse) with no Bluetooth streaming and no aux input, I recommend Apple subscription enhance your HomePod experience. Oh yea and grab with both hands it’s rather heavy.",Good entry home pod market
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Bhgcgolfer,"Better sound quality than the Sonos play 1, but the Sonos app is much easier than the Apple Music app. For the price of the HomePod you can get 2 play 1’s and make a stereo pair which sounds great. HomePod doesn’t get as loud as the Sonos. If the HomePod was cheaper and louder I would give it 5 stars because you can’t beat the sound quality.",Outstanding sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,kindertodd,Love the Apple Home Pod. It is fantastic to walk in and have music ready to go at the drop of a hat. Siri always helps out and this is perfect for any Apple fan!,Love this!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Smitty91,A mixed bag. Loved the way it works with Apple Music. I decided to stick with my Sonos One’s and sub. I believe the clarity of the Sonos One’s for music is better than the HomePod.,Nice but limited speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,jorgefgr,"This is my second homepod, which I have paired to the first for stereo sound. I love the convenience of voice-controlling stuff like volume up and down, skipping songs, setting up timers. For the most part, Siri picks up from whenever I am and understands and executes. What I don't like is that, I typically play music from an iMac. It used to be Spotify via Airfoil. Turns out Airfoil can't handle two HomePods that have been paired up, and so, I now have moved away from Spotify and am using iTunes and radio stations (not Apple Music). I'm hoping that Airfoil will sort this out soon.

Also, the two HomePods are next to a Sony soundbar/subwoofer which, to be honest, I've never thought to have extraordinarily powerful sound. For Apple TV, I believe the two HomePods simply are no match for the soundbar. The soundbar volume is much higher and, probably more important, seems to have a better connection to the Apple TV (via HDMI, of course) and the sound is always consistent, no lag, no frustrating pauses or disconnects that the HomePods seem to experience.",Very good speaker.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,ndvictor14,"I was shocked at how good the quality was! What's even more amazing is that it's able to hear me while the music is blasting! (Note: I did run into some issues where she wasn't able to hear me, that's because I had items surround the home pod which disrupted the ability for it to hear me, after moving it out of the way it works just as it did, so don't put stuff around it ;) )",Amazing Quality

I was able to connect and control all my LIFX bulbs quickly and LOVE being able to just say to turn on and off certain lights. If you have Apple Music, it is great because you can ask it to play songs, identify songs by lyrics, and add to your personal library or playlist. I think it sounds better than all of the other smart speakers and has a sleek and slim design. It isn’t the smartest speaker compared to others and is very limited on answers when asking questions that are not music related. Overall, I am satisfied with the speaker since I use it mostly for the music and podcasts and leave the heavy searching for my phone or iPad.",Great sound. Siri a little lacking
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Memo,Very loud and powerful. Any song at the tip of your tongue.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,TryToBeInformed,"The speaker is great, but it is more than a speaker, it is a home base for your smart home. As with most things Apple, this doesn’t play well with others. but there is a growing list of apple homekit enabled accessories.
The speaker is well balanced, not all tinny like the clock radio that it replaced in my kitchen. I use it to control music with my voice while I wash dishes, put timers on my cooking tasks when i have messy fingers or full hands, and to catch up on the news and weather for the day. 
While i’m away from the house, it relays the information from my homekit enabled cameras by netatmo and baby monitor from arlo in the home app without sending my data through their servers.
Amazon speakers want to sell you stuff from amazon, google speakers want to advertise to you, the homepod just wants to keep your stuff secure. That limits your compatibility but it is worth it to me.","Excellent product, focused on security"

However, it states free 3 month trial of apple music with purchase. I already had activated my 3 month trial and this benefit was of no use as it is only for brand new apple music subscribers. All in all, it should specify instead of leading you to believe you can stack your free 3 month trials when purchasing apple products.","Great Product, not great bonus"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,albert,"The sound is excellent, but it does not have enough power like the Soundtouch 30. What made this device not a good choice for many people is that it cannot connect via Bluetooth to non-apple products (like a Samsung or LG TV). No wonder it's not selling as well as it should.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,LRG4,The HomePod has been beat to death by reviewers saying it sounds great but it’s expensive and Siri is lacking. I bought this on sale and it’s still too expensive. I put it in my office and it works great but I’d have a hard time justifying buying another one. We’ll see what version 2 has to offer :),All things everyone else said are true
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Apple,The Apple HomePod sounds amazing! It’s hard to imagine such a superb sound comes from such a small device.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Grggary,"I’m nothing if not stunned by the quality of sound from this speaker. Really amazing for its size. Additionally, while watching my Apple TV, I can add the HomePod as an additional speaker along with my Bose sound bar. Talk about making good sound even better! I’m also quite happy with Siri performance. I had read some negative reviews on how much catching up Apple has to do to make Siri more on par with other digital assistants, but as far as running my HomeKit compatible devices, I’m thrilled with Siri’s accuracy and performance. To really enjoy, you’ll want an Apple Music subscription. Pretty much opens up every kind of music imaginable. I wish the price was lower, although it’s worth the money just for the sound quality. Just make sure you DO NOT buy anything from Nest if you want to automate through HomeKit using Siri on the HomePod. Although they have hinted at HomeKit support for a LONG time, there’s no indication Nest cares to be part of the Apple ecosystem (they’re owned by Google, so duh). Unfortunately, Apple is the only company I can thoroughly trust to honor my privacy, so if it’s not HomeKit compatible, I will not buy it. Thankfully there are MANY great alternatives to Nest that ARE HomeKit compatible!",Phenomenal sound

The sound is rich and has a lot of bass. This speaker is also very loud which my daughter loves. We have it connected with the Home App and it is capable of turning on and off our Hue Lights. Highly recommend this speaker. We also have a Google Home and Google Mini. The sound of the Apple Home Pod just blows out the Google products.,Enjoying Apple HomePod
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,gravy89,"Purchased the HomePod very reluctantly after it was discounted $100 for Black Friday. I will say, I am glad I did! This speaker is being used in my home as a sound bar replacement with my AppleTV. Sometime the Apple TV will get disconnected (this is easily resolved by holding the “play” button on my Apple TV remote). After the last 3mo of continued use I am giving this product 5 stars on the basis of sound quality, ease of use and Siri integration.",A nice addition to my home

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,RandyRoland,"I'm not someone who constantly dogs Siri. It's not the greatest voice assistant compared to Alexa or probably even Google Assistant, however for what does work, Siri is solid. And I find her to be way more responsive in terms of Homekit device like smart lights and the like. 

That being said, the HomePod is a tremendous speaker. If you are deeply steeped into the Apple ecosystem, as I am, it will serve you well. The ability to shout ""play this song"" into the air is a killer feature and the key reason I'm on Apple Music over the more superior Spotify. 

If you are an Apple Music user, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Buy it on sale. The full price tag on this speaker is way too much.","Great Speaker, Less than Perfect Assistant"

It loses WiFi connection a lot and fails to work when you are selecting it as an audio source from your iPhone or iPad way too often. If they can make the connectivity better this would get 5 stars.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,cjd2112,"I've owned other smart speakers/assistants and while there are some advantages, the sound quality of the HomePod is hands down the best available. As I have homes in Berlin and NY, I own a handful and do notice a slight difference in the equalizer in iOS 11 vs 12. Most won't notice but if you prefer more base, don't update the firmware if the model you buy still has iOS 11. Otherwise, iOS 12 has a plethora of Siri and iCloud features such as handsfree callings, reminders, appointments/scheduling, etc along with Siri Shortcuts that make the update paramount. I've updated most of mine with the exception of two in my master bedroom and know Apple is releasing a new update that will allow users to customize the equalizer. Beyond that, Apple's improvements in Siri have finally pushed the virtual assistant to the quality level it has sorely needed for years. While I understand Apple places security/privacy above all else which has hindered Siri's ability to evolve, the last year of improvements launched with iOS 12 along with Siri Shortcuts, a clever way to create the equivalent of Alexa Skills without foregoing user privacy, and with more to come, I highly recommend the investment in a HomePod over others. If you have an Apple TV, AVR, Mac, etc with AirPlay 2, the ability to fill a room with space conscious auto-tuning is far and above what's on the market.",Great Sound with Siri Improvements

Having a music background, I thoroughly appreciate the true sound it emits. I've used lots of speakers in my lifetime and can say this is the only speaker that I can clearly hear hi's/mid's/lo's without having to blast it. It's a great experience. I will be purchasing another in the next few months. Beats the Echo devices and Google homes for sure (in terms of sound!!)

THE ONLY complaint I have is this: I have them paired with each other, one's in the living room and the other in the bedroom. I know I know, I promise I'm not that much of a snob in real life. I haven't had any hiccups with sound delay BUT what I do find annoying is only one of them will register my voice and respond back. A silly nuisance, but did want to call that out!

I also have a Sonos One in another room, and this does sound much fuller.

I'll admit, I don't use any of the home automation features. I mostly play music using AirPlay2 from my iPhone. Hoping to add an Airport Express or AppleTV so I can push AirPlay2 audio to my tv/surround sound system at the same time for parties.

The sound quality is fantastic and we are in the apple ecosystem so it integrates nicely with Apple Music and our iPhones.

AirPlay from a Mac works much better, from an AppleTV is worse (the AppleTV always forgets what device to play audio to).
These are software problems that will hopefully eventually get fixed.
What's not fixable: there's no AUX input and no Bluetooth connectivity, i.e., with non-Apple devices or legacy audio equipment, these speakers are useless. Not what you would hope for with such expensive speakers.
The sound is okay, but for this money you can probably get better sound elsewhere.",Could be better if Apple fixes the software

As a bonus, I added Phillips Hue bridge and lighting to my home and Siri controls the lights and can control any smart device compatible with Apple HomeKit. Siri via HomePod can also provide weather, traffic, notifications, and other tasks also. If you have iPhone or iPad, you can use HomePod to hear text messages and use it as a speaker phone or bluetooth speaker to play music directly from your apple device. If you are a Apple Music user or use iPhone or iPad or use Apple HomeKit compatible smart devices, the HomePod is a great addition and compliment. I also can't say enough about the sound quality.

The sound is rich, it has great Bass compared to the Sonos Play 1. The added bonus is that it can act as a hub for Homekit. You can also stream music from an apple TV or computer directly. 
Music services could be a little better, and that is an area where SONOS is way better as you can use apple, spotify, amazon, etc whereas Homepod allows apple and spotify. However I do not use them regularly, I most of the times use my library so it is not really a problem for me. 
All in all, homepod is a fantastic speaker.Pricing at $349 seems a bit high, but with regular sales dropping to 250-279 the price is right. If you don’t have speakers, two of these are great. I got one as I already have several SONOS.",Great Speaker

Great connection! 
Love this product!",Great product
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,TheTim,"All of my smart equipment supports Apple Homekit and everyone in the house uses iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, etc so it made sense to get a HomePod to replace my Google Home. Siri isn't as good as the Google Assistant but the sound that comes from the HomePod, in my opinion, is infinitely better and more than makes up for it. 

It works as a hub for all of my HomeKit equipment which means I can set up automations and control smart devices when I'm outside the house.

The ""Hey Siri"" functionality is so good that you can have music so loud and can barely hear your own voice and you can speak at a normal level and it'll hear you.

If you plan to use it mainly for music and you already have Apple devices then this will be perfect for you.",Great speaker but Siri still lacking
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,KA75,"Incredible sound for its size. Very easy to use. Best speaker I got so far (and I also have bang and Olufsen products)

Siri can hear me much more easily using the HomePod than she can using my phone or watch. I’m a lazy lazy man, and I hate light switches. I just want to tell someone to turn off the lights for me, and since my wife is just as lazy as I am, Siri is the best.
I also use it as the sound for my Apple TV. I don’t have a sound bar or anything, and the TV speakers are not the best, but with this item, the sound is much more full and more immersive. It’s not as good as my home theater setup I have downstairs, but for a bedroom, it’s great.

Sure, Amazon Alexa products and Google Home products have a wealth of resources to ask from but Siri does answer what I ask it the majority of the time.

I have to turn on AirPlay every time I want to stream music & it only works with iTunes. I have an alarm app that I use to wake up in the morning & the music only plays on the iPhone & not the HomePod. I even tried using the Apple Alarm app & the audio will not stream to the HomePod. The audio quality is awesome but unfortunately it does not meet my needs so I returned it & purchased a different Bluetooth speaker.,No Bluetooth
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,JackBlack,"Mac user since 1990. This has to be the first product of Apple that lags behind its competitors.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Eddieomy,"My wife started her own at home business. I wanted to get her an assistant for her desk that could be a speaker phone, spelling aide, and speaker for back ground music. In my research I found out that the other popular speakers do not work as a speaker phone unless the other caller is using the same system... odd

This was plug and play, does everything she needs, oh the sound is fantastic by the way. Yes it may be more expensive than the best selling ones out there, but if they don’t do what you need them to do, then price doesn’t matter. It didn’t hurt that BB had them $100 off the week before Christmas!!!",Apple just does it right

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,nouse4aname,"First off, live person here, not a paid review. My home is filled with Apple products so naturally I gravitated towards the HomePod despite there being several other options in the market. My primarily goal was the sound of the device and the HomePod delivers. Additionally, I've grown to use the Siri functions and actually find many of them to be quite helpful (setting alarms, playing music, setting timers, random Siri questions, etc.). The HomePod integrates seamlessly with Apple Music and also allows me to play anything via AirPlay. Lastly, the HomePod doubles as my device used to play sound for my AppleTV and that integration is rather seamless as well. Will I didn't pay the full $349 retail price, I do feel the speaker alone is worth the investment and the Siri functionality is an added bonus.",Buy it!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,MikeG,"If you have Apple Music and Apple devices, this is a no brainer...great sound, ""Hey Siri"" can be picked up very easily and if you have any HomeKit electronics, then you can start using the HomePod as your voice activation.",Great Smart Speaker for Apple Ecosystem
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,TechTest,"Sound is excellent and works great with AirPlay 2. Since we are all on Apple iDevices/Mac, connectivity is not even a concern. You can AirPlay using Spotify if you like, but I've decided to give Apple Music a try instead being a non-Facebook connected music platform. Having the HomePods have helped me to better understand the Apple Music implementation, which is not nearly as easy to operate as Spotify or Pandora at first. I now like Apple's music implementation better as I use it more.

I would recommend that you buy two HomePods at a time since you may want to use a twin stereo setup in the future. I have them in separate rooms which cover the first floor quite nicely. They are easy to move around with Apple Home App. Also, the HomePods can act as an Apple Home Automation hub if you don't want to use an AppleTV or iPad.

All in all, we are glad we bought them on sale at Best Buy, appreciate the quality and will be listening to music much more (and less TV).","Great product, better than expected"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,TekE,"Purchased this on sale for $249.99 and I am totally loving the product.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,Tonyc,"Sounds great, but if you are a Siri user and other people in your home are Siri users, think twice. Microphone works great but limits the ability to use Siri to respond to voice commands that are specific to a single users account. So I had this set to my Apple account and when my wife wanted to use voice commands to write a text it basically did not work. It is for that reason that I consider this to be an unacceptable product at this time. I’m considering the Echo plus with sub. The Echo had unacceptable sound quality so the search continues.","Great sound, but..."

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,nlaughter,"I’ve been an Apple user for over a decade, and as someone that made a career making iOS apps, I really hoped the HomePod would have stepped up the game for personal assistants. The problem isn’t necessarily what it’s bad at (primarily being that it can only be tied to a single user), it’s that it isn’t particularly good at anything beyond just being a great speaker. The voice commands work decently enough, but there’s such a vast lack of compatibility beyond texting/calling somebody that it’s essentially a voice-activated speaker phone + weather announcer. Pair this with its inability to determine users based on who’s connected to the same Wi-Fi, vocal signatures, etc., and this device will leave you underwhelmed. The audio quality is bar none, but without better features, your money would be better spent elsewhere.","Shadows of greatness, body of incompetence"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Blessed,"Well. Apple has (again) exceeded our expectations!! It’s unbelievable how something so small can produce such an amazing, rich, sound. I love how I’m able to just tell Siri what to play, what to skip, raise or lower the volume and she packs a solid base sound. It sounds as if there’s more pieces playing when in actuality it’s just this one.",Amazing Sound

So far, I'm loving it.",Marvelous and delightful
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Rockies,Love the speaker. Wish it had more of the features that the amazon ones do.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Wiggs,"I bought two of these speakers as I am an Apple enthusiast generally. The fidelity and sound quality is OK but, they sit side by side with some Genelec 5"" monitors, which are much more transparent and clear than the HomePods. The integration is a bit buggy and the voice recognition is also buggy. I have been in the middle of an important conversation and they HomePods start talking back. I am generally happy with them but I expected higher fidelity, but I am comparing them to professional monitors costing twice as much.",Sound is Okay

Compliments the Apple echo system of the iPhone or iPad streaming Apple Music to the HomePod. The sound is amazing. It's all the great sound in one small device without all the wires and components those ""back in the day"" systems required (e.g., turntable, tape deck, speakers, etc.). Yes, Siri will need improving, but it will only get better with further iOS upgrades. Read reviews and capabilities before I purchased it on what it can do and what it can't (e.g., what apps don't work with it). And you can control the volume via your iPhone too! Highly recommend if you're into Apple.",I LOVE IT!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,MisterD,"Bought during a Black Friday deal, which knocked about 100 quid off the price, making this a very good deal. Sounds better than what you'd expect when you see and handle it. Plenty loud, but not to the point of being potentially too loud. Very clear with good highs, mid and lows for a speaker it's size. Might have a hard time filling the space of a huge open room, but would be fine in most homes. Siri is hit or miss, but mostly good with basic commands (changing volume, skipping/replaying/pausing songs, etc.) and not so great when it comes to asking it to play songs by title or artist using an Apple Music subscription (often plays something very different than what I asked for). For the price I paid, I'm very happy but at normal retail price I think it's a little high for what you get, but such is Apple. If you can get it discounted or don't mind the price, it's a great product perfect for use in a fitness room, home office, bedroom or even a decent size family room or kitchen. I do wish it had a built-in battery so that it'd be easier to move from room-to-room.","Great speaker, but a bit pricey..."

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,leehinde,"I bought this after also investing in Sonos speakers. I prefer the Sono interface to the complete dependency on Siri to drive the HomePod. (Although, I bought this before AirPlay2 shipped. It might be better now,)

Impressed and I'm not even an apple fan.,The Clarity and ease of use.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,Tzomb1e,"I really want to give this speaker 5 stars. The sound is phenomenal, the functionality is phenomenal...however....the first month I had this device, I was plagued with constant issues keeping my devices connected to the speaker. I use this device 99% of the time with airplay from my iPhone X. During this month, I could not play music for more than about 30-45 minutes before I would lose connection to it. The HomePod would not drop off if my network, it was almost like it would start rejecting traffic from my iPhone. I tested this on an iPhone X, iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, and from iTunes on a windows based computer. I set the HomePod up on its own wireless network (different access point than my main) that was very close to it to verify the signal was strong, but the issue still occurred. After a couple factory resets and making some changes to my home hub settings, this issue *seems* to have disappeared. I have also revamped my home network to a Ubiquiti one, so that might also be a factor. Either way, the speaker still sound absolutely stunning. Especially the bass that this little can is able to create.",Great sound....connectivity is not as great

I had to update the firmware/software before I was able to configure as a stereo pair. For music, these sound unbelievable with great bass. However if you want the full functionality you must be an Apple Music subscriber. 

Now the downside. If you are picking these up to use as speakers for your AppleTV, I was dissapointed with the volume even turned all the way up. My budget 2.1 soundbar which costs less than a single HomePod produced much better sound quality.

Gone are the days that I have to track everyone down. Loving this new feature in our house. It is also an amazing speaker to play music, it’s loud and the quality is great.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Nov 2019,SoCloseYetSoFar,"First off if you live in the Apple ecosystem this would normally be a no brained BUTTTT it’s priced $150 too much for what it is. 

Sure you get a great audio quality product, robust build quality, ability to control your Apple Music, speaker phone and other BASIC Siri functions but it needs to do more. 

I would love nothing more than to replace my Sonos ecosystem with multiple HomePods but the price is far too much, Siri without a screen to link you to a webpage is seriously lacking and inability to control some of the more popular smartphone products (nest I’m looking st you) it makes for a hard pill to swallow.

Tapping to mute is awesome. ""Hey Siri"" works awesome. If only Siri could search the web better.... ah, but that's another story.

It has a reputation for not being as ""smart"" as Alexa or others, but that changing. And they are great integrated features that I didn't realize, like making speaker phone calls. The setup couldn't be easier. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you put them close, confirm you want to set up HomePod, and that's it!. It automatically configures it for your network settings, Apple ID, iTunes subscriptions, everything.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,BoboBrazil,"A fine Apple product--impossibly easy set-up, outstanding sound, etc. but not fool- or goof-proof when it comes to pairing with the iPad and iPhone. And it's dawned on me more than once that if you're not using it for ""smart home"" functionality and using it purely for a volume and sound quality boost, there are probably (okay, definitely) more economical options to be had. Not quite experiencing buyer's remorse (optimistic that an enhanced usefulness will develop as I use it more) but as close to it as I like to be.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,g0002,"If you are an Apple person then this speaker is for you. I took a gamble as I have the Bose SoundTouch speakers throughout the house. Bose announced that they will be supporting airplay 2 in 2019 and I wanted this to be a speaker to include in my whole house system. Even if Bose does not end up supporting airplay 2, I will keep this speaker. It integrates with Siri well and even after a couple days of use, I have found myself using it more than I thought. I currently have it in my kitchen. You can ask it (Siri) about sports, news, and weather, and will give you updates from ESPN, a variety of other news outlets, and weather from the Weather channel. It has great bass for the size of the speaker and it sounds great overall. I have not tried to connect via Bluetooth yet. Set up was simple, especially with an iPhone. You literally hold your phone next to the speaker and you are basically done. Works great with Apple Music.",Great speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Jason43,"I waited for a sale and when the price dropped by $100 I decided to purchase. I’m a Sonos user and love the Sonos sound. It’s not really fair to compare 1 of these to a Play 5. 1 HomePod sounded good, not great. Not super loud, not super clear. Not bad at all, good sound just not full or rich. Added a second to create a stereo sound and that has definitely improved the sound. Much fuller, still lacks the detail of a Sonos, but it’s closer now. I’ve not listened as much as I’d like to give a detailed review as a pair but I’m more impressed than I was with just 1.","Good sound, better as a pair."
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Leigh,I purchased this for my office to have back round sound and it works great for the weather and questions and making calls and music awesome,best blue tooth speaker
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Mobius,Def. recommend if you have Apple Music and a music enthusiast.,Must if you have Apple Music
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,djchavar,"First off, I’ll say that the hype about the sound quality of the HomePod is true. It sounds incredible. As a musician and someone who has dabbled in studio recording, I care about and pay attention to sound quality. And, for the price, the HomePod has excellent sound quality. 

I also have a Bose SoundTouch 10 and a Sonos Playbar. This speaker truly blows the Bose out of the water—and I’m not one for exaggeration. The dynamics and depth of the HomePod simply cannot be matched by the SoundTouch. The HomePod has crisp highs and booming lows coupled with a spaciousness that seems to surround you. Even my wife, who doesn’t pay much attention to sound quality, can notice the difference. 

Interestingly, the HomePod holds its own against the Sonos Playbar. The Playbar is louder and has better stereo separation (which are both to be expected). However, the HomePod holds its own, even as a single mono speaker. 

As far a the “smarts” of the HomePod, it suffices for my needs. I use the Home app and have several HomeKit products. My HomePod can control my lights, locks, thermostat, and sprinklers without much issue—though, it’s not perfect. Sometimes it can’t communicate with my devices; but, it works far more than it does not. And the microphone on this speaker is amazing. It can hear you without a problem from across the room with loud music playing. 

I do wish the HomePod could play live radio. That would make it a more complete home speaker. 

Additionally, I wish Apple opened it to native Spotify streaming (which is extremely unlikely to happen). As an Apple Music user, this doesn’t bother me, but in my opinion, it does affect the overall experience with the speaker and should be noted. 

The HomePod is a powerful speaker that simply works. It can play any audio via AirPlay 2, including audio from Apple TV. 

At regular price, the HomePod is expensive. If you can pick it up on sale, I highly recommend it.",The hype is true
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Filmikl,I have a few different speakers from different high end brands suck as Harmon Kardon and Sonos but having the added Siri functionality makes a huge difference in this speaker being used at least a few times a day,Love this thing

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,AppleFanBoy,"It’s No Secret That Siri Doesn’t Stack Up Well Against Alexa Or Google Assistant, But I Think For The Average Joe Who Listens To Music (Apple Music Mainly) Will Love The HomePod. It’s Bassy, Balanced Sound Is Just Enough. This Speaker Is Small, But Packs All The Punch, Kick Or Whatever You’re Into To WOW You. Simply Put If You’re An Avid Apple Music Listener This Will Work Well With Your Current Set Up And With AirPlay 2 It’s Even Better.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,NWSuburbs12,"Owned many echo's in the house but always had an issue with music. The sound just was not there. Another issue with Amazon Echo's is if playing music loud, you had to yell to get Alexa's attention. So next thing you knew everyone is screaming for Alexa to have ""volume up"", Stop... and so on. It was irritating. So, once the Apple Home Pod dropped price down a 100 dollars, decided to give it a try. The music quality is incredible! It really does fill the room. Got another one and whole house music is incredible as well!. Changing volume individually for each speaker is very nice from iOS devices. And using the Home Pod microphones for commands is light years ahead of an Echo/Alexa device. We can calmly say ""Hey Siri"" and the HomePod will pick up your voice no problem. AND, she is not dumb. For what we need to ask, she answers. So if you are on the fence, get a HomePod. We have Spotify and we use it as well, we just add the speaker from any device that is playing within the house.",Much better than Echo!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,richroks,"This thing sounds amazing with music. It cranks it out at a decent level and I really can hear it fill the room with it's ""bounce off the wall"" technology. As an Apple Music subscriber, this really is a quality speaker. 

The only nitpick I have (which is a big disappoint me for me as an Apple TV superfan) is that the sound quality when airplayed from an Apple TV is rather low. Decent but low. It's already a favorite product for me but I'd praise it as a must have if it produced the same quality for movies as it did for music. IDK the specs of it enough to know if or how that would be possible but it's the only thing keeping it from a 5 star. Otherwise, it's an amazing product!",Almost Perfect Product

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,Donnie,This one was for my son. If you love music and subscribe to Apple Music this is hands down the way to go. If you want a speaker you can talk to cause you need a friend then get Alexa. They update that thing every day so you can ask it more things so you never have to go out and communicate with actual people. It was fun for about a week the Apple is great 24/7. I listen to thunder storms all night and music all day. Even bought a cool case to bring back and forth to work and now twice to Indiana. Only negative is that it has to be plugged in to power but that doesn’t matter to me.,2nd One I’ve Bought

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,IcedCorn,"The HomePod speaker is fantastic, and even more amazing when you combine two together for stereo. What I like with the Home Pod vs the Sonos is that the bass is impressive. It's like there's a subwoofer in this tiny speaker.

There are some not great things though : first the speakers are NOT bluetooth. Second, you better use Apple Music as your way to play music. Yes you can use spotify, etc, but it must be used through your iphone...no iphone, no audio from homepod speakers. 

So to recap: you better be in the Apple world to really appreciate this speaker..but if you are...wow.",Great speaker but you have to like Apple

I started having problems with my Apple HomeKit items so I ended up getting this HomePod for the purpose of using it as a hub.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,ChicagoEthan,"I bought this HomePod primarily to control our HomeKit Smart Home Devices (Phillips Hue lights, Ecobee Thermostat) without having to always have a phone or tablet on us. On first install, the HomePod wanted to set itself up as the primary Hub for our devices. We already had an Apple TV set up as the primary Hub, and the HomePod seemed to fight it for supremacy, leaving us unable to remotely connect to our Smart Home devices. After I disconnected and reconnected the HomePod, it seems to be playing nicely with the Apple TV and we’re able to control things remotely again. When we are home, the HomePod controls everything very well, and it’s nice for every member of the family to be able to ask Siri to turn smart devices on and off. As far as music quality, HomePod has been touted as the best audio quality in a smart speaker - it certainly sounds much better than the little Google Home Mini we have in one of the bedrooms. We previously had a UE Megaboom in the Living Room where the HomePod is, and I don’t know if I’m enough of an audiophile to tell much difference. The Megaboom always sounded great - the HomePod sounds great.",Great Audio - Tricky HomeKit Support

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,Madman,"I am a huge Apple fan with lots of Apple products, and I was thrilled to get this at a reduced price (unfortunately, it was even cheaper from another retailer about a month after I purchased this). It sounds great, looks great, and is handy for controlling my Homekit-enabled products by voice. However, I find myself wishing it would do more. I am still learning its quirks, such as how it manages default reminder lists, etc. Also, I have to ask everyone in the room not to talk and mute the TV before I attempt to speak to it, because it can't seem to separate out that type of background noise. 

I have to say that I would not pay the current MSRP for this...I just don't think it is worth it. I hope that Apple makes substantial improvements in Siri's AI very soon, which would improve the overall experience.

One last note...I can't make phonecalls from HomePod because I use wifi-calling (it appears to be a known issue). That is just another minor disappointment that I hope gets fixed soon.",Good first-generation Product
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,MarianaB,I bought a bunch for gifts for some over achieving students. Had to return two that arrived with a plastic wrap. My kids are loving it.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2019,Cort35,"I have a couple of Echo/Alexa devices that I use to control home devices. Since I am deep into the Apple ecosystem, I was interested in getting a HomePod for intergration with my music and for better sound quality. When the price dropped by $100, I bought one. While control of my Wemo devices was faster and smoother with the HomePod, I do not agree with the seemingly vast majority of people who think the sound is great. I was very disappointed that mostly midrange and voice sounds were very muffled almost like the HomePod was wrapped in plastic. I moved the HomePod to other locations in the room with the same result. This was a significant negative for me since I prefer more crisp, clear sound. The base range was more than adequate, almost to the point of being too “boomy.” I am returning this HomePod and hoping the next generation that is rumored to be coming out by mid 2019 will address the sound issues or at least provide the option of manual sound adjustments.",Disappointing sound quality

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Nov 2019,Tech0,"Sound quality is good for a small speaker, but make no mistake, this is a small speaker... a small mono speaker. It will fill a space with music, but don't expect it to fill a room, unless the room is a closet or you have two to make it stereo. That's just the physics of sound. 

While you can manually stream any music or music service you like to HomePod via a Mac or iDevice you can only use Siri voice control to control music playback (performer, genre, etc) if yo have Apple Music or iTunes Match. It cannot be used to control HomeSharing, if you use that on your Apple devices. You can control volume though no matter what the source of your music. HomePod only works with AirPlay. There is no way to connect via Bluetooth or a wire.

My big disappointment with HomePod, and why I ultimately gave it 2 stars, is that it's microphones to summons Siri are way too sensitive. HomePod can hear me even on floor down. The result, if I ""Hey Siri"" a question to my iPhone on the table in front of me, HomePod upstairs will answer. There is currently no setting in iCloud to lower Siri's sensitivity or disable completely and let another iDevice act as a remote. That would solve that problem.

Bottomline: if you have bought into Apple Music and no chance of switching to a different service HomePod may be a good option, depending on whether you use Hey Siri on your other devices. For everyone else, while maybe not as good sounding, Sonos One with Airplay 2 support offers more versatility in connections and streaming service options.",Only for Apple Music Devotees

The sound was much better than I’d hoped- decent highs and a surprising amount of low end for their size. I came very close to keeping them. Ultimately they went back because I was looking for a pair of speakers that would elevate the music a bit more for critical listening. For the casual listener who has an Apple Music subscription, however, they are hard to beat in terms of simplicity, access to music, and yes, the sound as well.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,RobR,"First and foremost, I love the sound that comes from my HomePod. I also have an Echo 1, an Echo 2, an Echo Show, an Echo Dot and two Sonos Play:1 speakers. The HomePod sounds much better than any of the Echo Devices. The HomePod has very solid bass and very clear highs. Midrange is a little lacking though. The Echos sound flat and a little muddy in comparison. Compared to the Play:1, The HomePod has slightly stronger bass and slightly clearer highs. Where the Play:1 has an advantage is midrange. The sound from the Sonos is a little fuller overall but also a slightly muddier.

The thing I like most about the Echo devices is their ability to play so many stations with voice commands. iHeartRadio and Radio.com are 2 of my favorite providers. I can play them on the HomePod but only thru my iPhone or iPad. I cannot ask for them with my voice. If I could, I would use the HomePod much more often. I can only use Apple Music with the HomePod using my voice. This is great if I know exactly the song and artist I'm looking for. However, the Apple Music playlists are not as good as the stations on iHeartRadio and I can't ask for local sports radio. I can only get ESPN radio using Siri.

So far, my Play:1 speakers only work thru the Sonos app for me. I should be able to send music to them with an Echo but there is some sort of conflict on my network preventing them from working properly. If I can get this straightened out, I will stream more often to them.

Overall I would recommend the HomePod to people that use the Apple ecosystem. Especially if you love Apple Music. Right now, I'm setting up my own apple Music Playlists. Once I do that, I will likely use the HomePod more. If I could use my HomePod like my Echo devices, I would give it 5 stars all day. But because Siri is so lacking in smarts, I deducted a star. Others might deduct more but I do love the sound...","Great sound, Siri & Music Services are limited"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2019,ToRo,"In terms of musical capabilities, no other smart speaker can hold a candle to the HomePod. This is my second, and I'm constantly impressed by the unit's ability to reproduce full frequencies (including sub-level bass) with fidelity and musicality at volume. It's really impressive.

You can't order paper towels with it, which may or may not matter to you. (It doesn't to me – I see that as a plus, actually.)

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,Ewrek,"I love the Apple HomePod, great integration with Apple Music, but my main issue with the speaker is not being able to put a song or music as an alarm. You would think that spending so much on a speaker and having access to millions of songs wouldn’t have that issue, but hopefully Apple fixes that with the next update. That is one thing that I loved about Alexa, music to wake me up, not an abrupt alarm noise.","Great speaker, but lacking"

It was so easy to set up. And all types of music sound great on it! Siri picks up commands easily, although sometimes when I have music on I do have to repeat my request a couple of times before Siri can hear it. Overall, I’m really enjoying this product. Although, I will say I don’t think it’s worth the non sale price and I would definitely wait for it to go on sale again before purchasing one.",Easy setup. Great sound. Pricey tho.

I just ordered my 5th one today and could not be happier!!",Better than Sonos???
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,RememberMe,Great sound quality for the size but for $349 it could be louder. It does best in open spaces due to it always wanting to adjust the direction of the sound. I would recommend it to anyone in any taste in music. I play all types from mainly vocals to bass heavy music with little to no distortion. I mainly recommend this also when on sale.,"Big Sound, Small Package!"

It sounds fantastic, the microphones pick up commands easily (sometimes too easily when it mistakes other words for ""Hey Siri""), and Hey Siri works reasonably well. Siri may not be the best assistant out there but your privacy will be better protected than with the alternatives at least.",Fantastic speaker and smart device
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2019,jonro,"HomePod speakers are a little different than your typical wireless speakers. They use WiFi, not Bluetooth for transmitting sound. While WiFi has the bandwidth needed to transmit all of the music, I wish that using Bluetooth was an option. I bought a pair of HomePods as I wanted full stereo sound. In this case, two HomePods are at least three times better than a single one. In my opinion, I've never heard speakers of this size that have such deep, full bass. The problem is Apple's software support for HomePods with AirPlay. They work well with iTunes and independently using Siri, but no other Mac software supports HomePod as a stereo pair. That means that no Safari-based music can use them. When Apple updates Mac OS to work with stereo HomePods, I would probably give the product five stars.","Great Sound, Shaky Software"

When it comes to its ""smarts,"" however, I have been less than impressed. Siri frequently fails to respond when I say ""Hey Siri"" and it often provides me with results that are irrelevant to my question/command. The good news is that I suspect the device can be made smarter with software updates. If you're completely committed to remaining within the Apple ecosystem than you'll likely be pleased; but if your looking for the best smart speaker on the market, you may want to consider other options.",A great sounding not-so-smart speaker

They find it funny to run through the room and change the music on me. There is a stop listening feature, but they figured that one out pretty quickly too. I am also disappointed that it doesn't recognize my existing playlists. It synced with my current music but the lists I had on my iPod are not recognized. While I do have access to everything musically, I like to make my own playlists and so far I have not figured out how to do so with this. Apple wants to make them for me which is ok sometimes, but other times I want my own. Overall I am very happy and look forward to apple improving things such as voice recognition.",Great sound

I have an amazon echo 2 and there is no comparison sound wise. 

Siri is adequate when using her for music or menial tasks. 

The more I listen to the speaker it just seems to sound better than the day before. It must learn your environment over time because it seems to fill the room more and more over time. I can only imagine what two or three of these speakers together sound like. 

I am not sure it is worth the steep $349 price tag but if you can get it for $300 or less don’t hesitate.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,2,13 Nov 2019,tobewiser,"Sounds ridiculous with the resources Apple has...it would design and launch a speaker that cannot be used with its own laptops and desktop computers. A pair of HomePods only play in stereo in iTunes but the computer's audio is only played in either one of the speakers in the pair. The latency is also very annoying. Sound quality is okay but not great. They don't play very loud so in big rooms they will sound like small speakers. Bass is weak in medium/large rooms.

The fact that it is always updating to ensure even playback is an amazing algorithm, not to mention the fact that “Hey, Siri” can hear you even over loud music. 

Definitely will purchase more for other rooms and stereo pairing. Airplay 2 is hands down the best. I can now tell my Apple TV to play audio on my HomePod and vice-versa, so I can have full audio playing throughout my place without missing a beat.",It Packs a Punch

Now it is by home entertainment center and I play music from time to time. The Hey Siri function works great and the music sounds great in any part of the home. Another benefit is that I have it on a glass side table which I thought wouldn't sound so great but there is no change when placing it on a glass versus something like a hardwood table.

Based on my initial impressions for two days, I like it, but I don’t love it. It’s an amazing speaker...it sounds incredible really...but personally I don’t see it as a good value yet. Maybe as I use it more and learn more of its functions I’ll be more impressed. For me...most Apple products have an immediate wow factor and it justifies the price...that didn’t happen for me on this product. Not yet anyway. Luckily I got it on the Black Friday sale so that helps. Apple’s original MSRP price was just a bit optimistic to say the least.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,JBny,"These smart powered speakers (I bought a stereo pair) look great and sound great...and listen even better. At first blush the $349 price sounded very high...though I hit a $50 off sale... but when you think about it they’re not. The solid/heavy compact speakers pack a punch in the bass and with 7 folded horn tweeters fill the whole room with omnidirectional sound. Each of the 8 speakers has its own amplifier and are separately controlled by the A8 processor (same as in iPhone 6). The touch controls and discreet color display round out the package. The bass auto adjusts to room size and the 7 tweeters sense walls and beam the sound around the room...I.e. these sound great anywhere in any room at any volume (no distortion at full volume). After updating them to Airplay 2, I could use them as a stereo pair, whole house speakers that play the same or different content in different rooms or assign each to different accounts for independent control from separate user IOS, TVOS, or MacOS devices—remember these are WiFi, not Bluetooth, full range speakers (40-20kHz?). Spookily amazing are the 6 microphones that can hear and respond to your normal (inside) voice even when the speakers are creating a cathedral soundstage while playing Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor at full volume. Siri easily answers queries like “what’s the weather tomorrow” when you ask from the next room. I did not have home automation devices to test, but as you can tell I’m having fun with a pair of HomePods. Just don’t think they can replace your $500+ HiFi tower speakers ... or the other way around ;?)",Solid Performer

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,Jimbob,"Full disclosure I bought this knowing it was limited in it's capabilities, I am just writing this as an overall review of the speaker. The sound quality is by far greater than what you are going to get out of Alexa and Google home, however, if you are buying this as a smart assistant or a smart home controller, you may want to hold off. The home pod is only compatible with devices that are home kit enabled, which is a small collection and tends to be premium and pricey options. Surprisingly, the HomePod does not control the apple tv, so if voice control for television is something you want it will be best to look at Alexa with fire tv or Google and ChromeCast. Lack of support for popular streaming apps is a turn off as well. You can very easily stream music from your iphone to the speaker, but it is an extra step that ignores the basic premise of the speaker being an easy to use one stop for entertainment. If the sound quality from the Google or Amazon offerings is a big turn off, I recommend looking at a Sonos Speaker, unless you absolutely have to have the Apple brand or Apple Music is your sole provider or musical content. However, the speaker is not good at finding a song for you. Both Alexa and Google are much better at identifying lyrics and getting you the song. Home Pod and Siri can only do this if the title of the song is in the lyric you give it. Now where this speaker shines is its sound quality. Bass is nice and deep, and one home pod is capable of filling a 2200 sqft house with sound. 
 Additionally, the latest updates have allowed for you to place a second home pod or compatible speaker in the same area to provide with stereoscopic surround sound. Set up for this is also automatic and very easy to configure. If you are only concerned with overall sound quality while maintaining a device that seamlessly integrates into the Apple environment, then this speaker is for you. If you are OK with a premium price tag, and waiting for possible updates that are promised to add features, this is for you. However, if you want a smart assistant that can control features in your house, I have to say go for one of the others available.","Great Speaker, lousy smart assistant."

I would need to purchase two Homepods for that. The sound quality of the HomePod is good, but since it’s only one unit, the sound doesn’t have the range I would like.

I do like the Siri commands for the HemePod, such as the ability to play and pause songs and issuing commands to a few of my Wemo connected devices via HomeKit. There are several other commands I need to try and get accustomed to using such as for quick calculation. 

Maybe when I save enough money, I might consider buying another one, because I much rather have two wireless speakers, the wired stereo setup that I’ve been using for years.",Can’t replace my current stereo system

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Shpktty84,"I’ll begin by saying that I’ve been a subscriber of Apple Music for the past few years, and that made the Home Pod especially attractive to me. The sound quality is great, the design is beautiful, and overall it has been a very capable device. We have an older surround sound system connected to the TV (with an Apple TV), and that used to be our main source for listening to music. But asking Siri to play whatever we’re in the mood for is much more convenient! So far the unit has been flawless in serving as the “home hub” for our smart devices. It’s fun to control lighting and home accessories simply by asking Siri! Response to commands is rapid, accurate, and has exceeded my expectations. Yes, home pod is priced higher than some of its competitors, but it certainly has the look and feel of a premium device. If you are already a fan of the Apple eco system, and/or a subscriber of Apple Music, I can’t recommend it enough.",Fantastic Device
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,genesisnick,"The HomePod has been a lot better then I thought it was gonna be, along with apples software updates, it can only improve.

If you are bought into the apple ecosystem, this is a great addition. While some will say that Siri isn't as skilled as Alexa, the bottom line is Siri can do anything you really need on a day to day basis. Only the gimmicky Alexa skills are missing. The sound quality also far surpasses any of the current Alexa offerings, even the Sonos options.","If your considering it, just do it"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,WMcK,"I’m very impressed with the sound. It sounds like a subwoofer is attached, producing rich, clean bass. However, since I hooked it up, I’ve been having a problem keeping it connected to the internet. I have a powerful router and it’s not that far away, and other other items in the room, such as my iPad, have no problem maintaining connection. But at least a couple of times a day, I will ask Siri something and it will say “working on it” and finally “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.” Also, very disappointed in how few smart items the HomePod Control. I’ve kept my Echo because it controls my entertainment system and Dyson fan, and the HomePod does not have that capability.","Sounds great, but otherwise troublesome"

Second, the sound is very refined and in my opinion better than Bose or Sonos. It totally blows away an Alexa speaker. Third, with AirPlay 2 and in stereo mode (if you get two) the sound is amazing. The sound is comparable to audiophile quality systems - I am saying this as some who has KEF bookshelf’s in my office and the HomePods match them if not better.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Sandy,"The HomePod is an excellent speaker, producing some amazing quality sound from a very small form but with Siri it can and does much much more. It functions very well on its own once connected to wifi but it is also possible to link it to an iPhone or and iPad or even Apple TV in which case it produces superb sound for those devices.
Setup couldn't be easier, just plug it in and put an iPhone or iPad next to it, two minutes later it's done. 
Apple has some expanded capabilities coming in the next software update which should be here in a few weeks so it will be possible to use two units to have stereo but frankly the single unit sounds so good am not sure it will matter.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,MichelleJD,I would use strong cursing words on how much I love this speaker! I even move it to my back yard for pool parties and it sounds just as great. Well worth the price. I may buy another.,LOVE
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,foof,"I love this speaker a lot. The Hey Siri detection is second to absolutely nothing thanks to those much-vaunted ""beamforming"" microphones, which also make phone calls nice and clear even if you're 30 feet away speaking at a normal volume. 

But most importantly, the sound is wonderful for its size and great for really anything. It's a punchy little speaker with outsize bass that handles anything you can throw at it. Like other reviewers have said, Apple did a great job of tuning this speaker to communicate the intent of anything it plays, so aggressive music will make you angry and calm, beautiful music will bring a tear to your eye. It goes extremely loud with no distortion and the ""tunes itself to your surroundings"" part of the sound is really everything it says it is. It sounds huge and fills up rooms if placed correctly and you'll really never get any ""meh"" sound out of it. 

However, you are essentially required to have Apple Music to get the most out of it, and not owning an iPhone will mean that you just bought a very nice piece of useless decor, as you won't even be able to set it up without an iOS device (sorry, Mac owners, you can only play to the speaker and control the queue once you've initialized it with an iOS device.) You can airplay to it using your phone if you're a Spotify kind of person, but it's a little lamer as you can't ask Siri to play music from Spotify or any other service.

One last thing: I have had some glitches with it where it won't play music from the HomePod, it will only allow you to airplay and everything else acts like it's playing but immediately shut off. I contacted Apple and was immediately escalated past senior support up to what was basically the HomePod team, and my advisor told me that it was a known issue and it was being worked on, with a fix anticipated in the next update. Given that the next update is hotly anticipated (as it's going to include AirPlay 2 and multi-room sound as well as HomePod pairing), I can't wait. 

Other than that, not a bad word to say about this thing. I adore it in Space Grey, and smudge it in White. I've definitely gotten my money's worth!","Great, Ecosystem-Locked Sound"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Butterfly69,HomePod is the best investment ever! It doesn't take lots of space. Siri is very user friendly and can hear all my commands. The sound is spectacular. It's the best addition to my Apple products.,Love the Home Pod

I’m by no mean anti any other device. Ive just found these tools to be easier for me. But besides the point. This speaker is amazing. It completely fills my apartment from its centeral location which real crisp and powerful tones and base. The ‘Hey Siri’ function can hear you from almost anywhere even at full volume.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Missoula,"I have a 5.1 Sonos home theatre system that I was using to play music when not watching TV and the HomePod rivals the system. The bass is there as is the treble. It does sound better at louder volumes, but at lower volumes Sonos has it beat. It’s better than a Sonos Play 1 and as good as a Sonos Play 5. If you’re concerned about Alexa’s lack of privacy and that it’s always listening, then go with Siri on the HomePod.",Beautiful Sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,DemocraticUnderground,"Pros:
- Sound quality is great; far superior to my existing Echo.
- Product feels high quality, all the way down to the fabric textured power cable. I’d have been upset if this came with the generic Apple plastic white cable that inevitably gets dingy/yellow and begins to fray.
- You can use other music services outside of Apple Music (via AirPlay), just not natively. I’d prefer natively, but listing this as a pro because I have seen some misleading posts saying services like Spotify cannot be used at all. That is incorrect.

Cons (most regard it severely lacking as a smart speaker):
- Cannot set multiple timers. Especially when cooking, I’ll often have multiple timers going on my Echo.
- Inability to recognize different people. This one is especially annoying if you want to be able to receive/send calls or texts through the HomePod. The speaker is linked to my phone. Even if I’m not around, anyone with access to the speaker can send or receive messages from me (if the option is enabled), despite the fact they are not me. My options are to either disable the feature entirely, or be aware that anyone (friend or family) who is near the HomePod, would have unfettered access to my messages/calls.
- Siri in general is lacking. For instance, if I ask Siri if it is going to rain, all I get is a “yes” or a “no”. If I ask Alexa the same thing, I get a percentage chance of rain and expected amounts. Several other instances, but just one example.
- No ability to use other music services (i.e. Spotify, Tidal, etc.) natively with the device. As listed above, it is doable through AirPlay, but this comes at the cost of more in depth voice commands.
- Was foolishly hoping the Nest would become HomeKit compatible since Apple made HomeKit authorization digital now (no longer requires physical hardware). That is not the case. Another thing to keep in mind, Apple’s control over smart home items is limited to HomeKit devices. More may come soon with recent changes to HomeKit, but if you have anything from Google (like the Nest) don’t get your hopes up and factor into your purchase decision.",Not all that

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Jackson,"This is awesome for use with Apple Music. There is little other value but for me it does exactly what I was looking for. Added bonus, I can throw the sound from my Apple TV. Not quite home theater level, but MUCH better than the tv speaker!",Great for what it does
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Jeepster40,"I love music and this HomePod delivers. It sounds noticeably better than my Bose or Sonos. Siri works just great even when the music is loud. It has some limitation but if you don't know them without me telling you, you probably wouldn't miss them anyway. My my purpose is music for this speaker and its amazing .",Super
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,TBear,This thing sounds incredible. And I like that it’s not as bass heavy as the Bose products tend to be. And it actually works better and responds quicker with my Phillips hue product.,Awesome sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Gadgetguy11,"I preordered an Apple HomePod from Best Buy. Picked it up on Friday after work. Early Saturday morning I was at Best Buy buying a second one before they sold out. Yes, the sound was really that good!

 I own a number of Amazon echo devices including several Echo Show and several Google Home devices. Alexa and Hey Google outperform Siri. But if you’re buying this for sound, nothing even comes close. The sharp, clear high frequencies because of the seven tweeters which are computer controlled cannot be duplicated by any other device on the market today. 

 I do not subscribe to Apple Music. I listen to SiriusXM through my computer using iTunes, and distribute it to these HomePod speakers wirelessly, using the Apple lossless wireless system. That gives an additional benefit of being able to adjust equalization through iTunes. The resulting sound is phenomenal! Please note that after purchasing these two HomePod speakers, Apple updated the firmware. They still do not have stereo capability, but they reduced the bass because a number of people thought there was too much bass! I thought it was perfect before, so I simply bumped up the equalization through iTunes and I’m back to where it was before. Don’t even worry about the stereo consideration. Each speaker fills the room and sounds so multidimensional, you will think you have surround sound from HomePod. Crisp in your face audio in every area of your room!

Highest Recommendation!!",Audio in a Class by Itself

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Prospero89,"The sound quality of the speaker is phenomenal. However, you need to be deep in the Apple ecosystem to fully enjoy using the HomePod. Apple Music support only, no Spotify, no direct Bluetooth connection, airplay only. There are quite a few features that need to be added that are coming in future software updates, so, if you don’t have all Apple products, this isn’t necessarily the best choice. For those deep in the Apple ecosystem, it’s a great device.","Great sound, locked ecosystem"

I have all my music from Apple so I have no issues when accessing my Albums.",Amazing Sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Airbornebuckeye,"So I was very excited to be one of the first to get the new Homepod as I love most Apple products. The sound blew my mind right in the store! So I got home and set up was pretty easy however that's when I discovered the HomePod's big flaw! It doesn't connect to your phone or ipad via bluetooth like most speakers. It operates under the premise that you have Apple Music (which I do) however it will play songs based on what you tell Siri to play. Most times you're scrolling through your music on your phone and you press a song to hear it. The Home Pod only let's you play pre made playlists that you create or you tell it to play a specific song. I was surprised how much of a pain that was. Luckily rumor is that Apple is working to fix that otherwise I'd have returned it even though it sounds great! Get on that, Apple!",Amazing with one HUGE flaw
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Yankeesfan3564,This speaker sounds amazing & I love the built in Siri functionality.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,ReelVideoMan,"As an Apple fan it pains me to not recommend the HomePod. Now as a speaker with Apple Music it is fantastic and if that is what you want you should hands down purchase one. I have Apple Music and it integrates and sounds amazing on the Homepod. What is frustrating is the weakness of everything else. It constantly misunderstands (except oddly with Apple Music commands) the queries given to Siri. It frustrates me when my iPhone and Hompod fight for control (Apple needs to get their act together on this). It's a nightmare using it with the Home App (although I don't know if this is an issue with my Phillips Hue Lights, the Homepod or both). Bottom line if you must have the best speaker for Apple Music this is for you. All others: what till Apple makes it more useful and stable.",Half-baked as a smart speaker
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Dilly,"This speaker is awesome! It has a very clear sound to it and gets very loud. Me and my wife have it in our kitchen as it’s the center of the house for us and you can hear it everywhere you go in the house when turned up loud!

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,kes601,Does fine with controlling my HomeKit devices and plays audio quite well. I just wish it supported more directly than Apple Music.,"Great Audio, Lacking Features"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,eddie,"right off the bat: it is locked into apple music. it sounds pretty good, which is a positive. it syncs up well with airplay enabled devices. it plays well with apple TV (no noticable delay) and with apple's iphones. when you airplay to it from your iphone however using say, spotify, there is an annoying delay (about three seconds in some instances). you hit play... silence... two seconds later, music plays. same with pause. harsh reality is it seems to only do that with spotify on my iphone.

otherwise, you can set alarms, reminders, ask for basic information and siri responds well. lots of room for improvement but i feel like i got a good product after a couple of months of using it daily. 

works very well with apple homekit.",great sound. decent functionality.
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,KirkS,Kept at the center of the room it sounds really good. Works great on its own and when connected to Apple TV or via airplay from the phone.

Not to take anything away from Sonos but Apple hit a triple and not a Homerun only because it doesn’t give you all the functions that the Amazon Echo give you. Best sound speaker by far and as long as you setup Apple Music you’ll love it! Pandora works great too but I’m hoping Apple offers updates in the future to add a few more features.,Apple hit a triple
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Cindy,We love the Apple Home Pod is a wonderful addition to our home.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,GlenLantz,"The sonics and build quality of this little speaker are impressive. Sounds really nice across the living room. I plan to pick up another for the opposite end of the room at some point. Would love to hear this vs. a pair of Sonos Ones, which can be had for the same price.","Great sound, but pricey"
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Applewood,"If you’re embedded in the Apple ecosystem this is a great speaker. Not as smart as Alexa, but Siri is respectable for common requests. I bought this as a music smart speaker for my Apple Music subscription and it sounds amazing no matter where I put it, I’m very pleased. Hopefully software updates will expand Siri’s utility, as that is a major drawback, in addition to the lack of third party integration (eg. Spotify).",Great Smart Speaker for Apple Users
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Repentantgamer,"I was initially skeptical of the HomePod but after using it for several weeks I think it's a fantastic speaker. The sound is incredibly rich and projects in all directions. While Siri isn't perfect and is actually restricted in the HomePod compared to the iPhone, the controls work pretty well and it picks up my voice nearly everywhere.",Incredible sound for its size and price
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Spoiled,You need to get this on sale. It is crazy expensive. That being said it has great sound. It vibrates the surface it sits on to produce bass not expected of such a small speaker. Great for a room.,Greatest blue tooth speaker

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Resqhopper,Amazing sound. Easy to setup. Works perfect as a home hub for anyone who uses the homekit ecosystem.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Picnic,"Wonderful sound in lrg room w/area of 2 stories. Hey Siri has been quite good for creating and adding to lists/reminders, timer, all music related (who’s playing, favorite, add to playlist etc,), questions like where is Black Panther playing, of course weather. Siri responds to very low volume command-amazing. I will probably buy a second Homepod when Airplay 2 is available-both for stereo and to move occasionally to second room. I will add a 5th star after Airplay 2 I expect.",Wonderful addition for Apple centric
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,JBlumberg,"Sound quality, setup process and microphones are great. This thing can hear me over just about anything. The only issues I have are when it picks me up and I don't want it to. I prefer to do timers with my Apple Watch since they are quiet and unobtrusive and frequently the HomePod will pick up that command. I rigged up a bunch of Homebridged smart devices (including my TV and Sonos speakers) and it controls them all pretty well. Excited to see how this evolves (and it really needs to if Apple wants to stay competitive) but even as is I don't regret the purchase.",Great Sound and Microphones

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,JoeDaMan88,"I know the knock on the HomePod is the lack of smarts. I agree, however I purchased this for my love of music. No other smart speaker is as ""smart"" when it comes to sound as the HomePod. I am in the Apple Eco-system so this works perfectly.

Of course, the main features will be turned on later this year and with the great quality sound combined with Airplay 2 it is a no brainer this is the best smart speaker to have. I was amazed I could go full volume and fill the room with music that was not distorted in the least.

You value quality sound
You don’t want to order a pizza from your speaker.

You will HATE the HomePod if you can put a NOT in front of any ONE of the above statements. People bash this speaker because it doesn’t try to be like any or all other speakers. Judge it for what it is, not what it isn’t.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Ropadope,I was skeptical about spending 350 on a speaker this size. I was not sure if I would go with this Because I already had a Sonos one and Amazon Echo. I am also pretty tied to the Apple Ecosystem. I have to say this speaker sounds absolutely incredible.

I even hooked up my appletv to it and it sounds better than my Sony soundbar. I can’t wait for airplay 2 and I’ll buy another to use as my living room surround sound.

I absolutely love Apple and have no problems with any of the product. Now there is the ""but"". I did think that HomePod would be like my iPhone or iPad, but it doesn't get close. It basically is the most expensive timer for the kitchen I've ever bought. Yes, it does work with Homekit but it doesn't connect to the Web so I can't do many of the things I wish that it would, as Alexa does. I have Sonos filling the entire house with music, and I'm told I will be able to control Sonos with Siri and HomePod end of year. I'm going to keep wishing Siri (HomePod) will go back to school and get it right.",Just OK for now
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Hung,"The sound quality is really good. Its sound spectrum is full.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,ModRocker9,"I'm a person who doesn't use a smart light, a smart home electronics so to me the speaker aspect of it is really worth it. The HomePod is definitely one of the best purchases I've made this year. It has such an outstanding sound quality with just one in the room. I did a test to see how loud this speaker is so I put it on 75% volume, closed my bedroom and walked around the house and I could still hear it from upstair and downstairs. The con with this device is it has difficulty recognizing classical music. Siri just butchers some of the classical and when you try to repeat it in the way Siri does, it won't be able to play that piece of music so you have to manually play the song in via iTunes or from your Apple device.",Literally shocked by the sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Mbox,"First, between my Sonos array, Google Max, and other similar function devices the HomePod is certainly my favorite for listening to music. It sounds great and fills the room and even when the volume is loud Siri can still here my commands with just regular level voice. Where I’m let down is with the “smart” capabilities of this device even when compared to the abilities of Siri on my phone. I’m already deep in the Apple garden and totally happy with the choice but still a bit let down with the “smarts” of the HomePod. Hoping that updates give me the functionality to control the Apple TV, get multi-room up and running, and just really nail down some more basics. I listen to a lot of music and podcasts at home, bought two HomePods one for the living room and one for a bedroom, and if you want a speaker that’s very capable and takes up a small footprint this is a wonderful little device.","Great sound, lacking assistant"

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,swalter6,"I couldn’t make up my mind between this and a Sonos One so purchased both to compare:

Sound: Both sound great, but I actually preferred the Sonos overall. The HomePod bass sound great but clarity suffered. Sonos isn’t as bass heavy but me and my wife listened to both and found to prefer the Sonos for its great clarity and thought it reproduced the music more as it was intended than the HomePod. Obviously very subjective. 

Smarts: Sonos wins this hands down with its Alexa integration and upcoming support for google and airplay 2. Siri on the HomePod is basic and not that useful. One positive with the HomePod was how well it can hear you even when the music is loud. 

Value: Sonos hands down. You can get two for the price of one HomePod

Other: HomePod locks you in to the Apple ecosystem. If you are all in on Apple, great. But, if you want flexibility then look to Sonos.",Good but not great returned for Sonos One

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,3,13 Nov 2018,Bobnoise,I really wanted to like it but just couldn't. I guess i've got used to working with the google assistant and alexa. The speaker is pretty good but its not so smart. The inability to recognize multiple voices is a big security risk. Not being able to play spotify directly (can do it via airplay) and Siri as a whole is a big letdown. This is not ready for primetime. I bought two of them and returned and got two sonos one instead.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,D33man,"I have to say Apple did an amazing job working on the microphone detection and sound output. The quality of the sound with separation of sound levels is amazing for this system. My biggest peeve is that Siri is missing some basic functions that she should have.

Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,lazydaze,"If it’s the sound that matters most this is a great speaker to get, if you are in the Apple ecosystem. the design and quality are top notch. I plan to buy another when air play is upgraded to allow two speakers to sync with one another.",Great sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Tayor,It sounds phenomenal and works great with the Apple ecosystem.,Gorgeous Sound!
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,4,13 Nov 2018,Bwesleyc,"The speaker has an amazing bass but my pair of Sonos one in stereo are a little better. Sonos gets louder than the HomePod and streaming through WiFi beats AirPlay any day, for the simple fact that whatever you’re doing on your phone won’t play through the speaker or stop the music. I’ll buy again once some improvement are made",Nice speaker but Sonos is just a little better
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,UTexaslawyer,The new speaker is very useful for listening to music and has a nice sound.,Great sound
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,bk78,"I finally decided to automate my home and decided to give this a try. It was super easy to install and the setup was a breeze. It even talks with my home lawn sprinkler and offers an option to turn the sprinklers on outside if there is smoke detected inside. Doesn't sound like much, but the idea stopping a fire from spreading from home if it ever happens is very comforting. I plan on adding a couple more of these soon.",Very Happy
Apple - HomePod - Space Gray,1,5,13 Nov 2018,Peter4,The HomePod is the perfect companion if you subscribe to AppleMusic! Best of all Siri works near perfect with it! Yes it’s pricey but if you want superior sound this is for you! I think it’s well worth the bucks! Apple will continue to expand capabilities over time.,Completes Apple Music!
