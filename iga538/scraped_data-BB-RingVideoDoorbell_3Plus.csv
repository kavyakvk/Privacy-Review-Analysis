Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 Aug 2020,EternalSummerOne,"I originally wanted the wired Pro version, but it proved incompatible with my current doorbell chime unit so I purchased this current newer version of the battery doorbell. Other than using too much data when viewing or recording, it includes the features you need.  When in HD mode, it delivers a decent video and view.  My wired stickup cam might be a little better, visually.  It's still decent.  Installation was easy as well as set up.  There are numerous settings to go through and decide which is best for you.  If data usage is an issue, there are settings and things you can do to minimize this, but for the most part, you can run this device without worrying if you don't sit there and constantly view or record.  I guess the only thing that surprised me for whatever reason was the data use.  I ended up getting an unlimited data plan and don't worry about it anymore.  A relative has several RING devices set up and doesn't have a data problem and doesn't have an unlimited plan so maybe it's not a big issue.  This is just my experience.  When you first get it, of course you want to do a lot of viewing and have fun with it. Battery life depends on how often it is actually doing something.  I have another battery pack ready to insert when the current one is down.  There is a Device Health area so you can check the percentage of what's left on your battery.  It does take hours to charge them so it is a good idea to have an extra if you want constant coverage.   Easy to replace.  Don't place any of your battery RING devices up too high to cause you too much inconvenience to change the batteries.  Those probably should have hard-wired choices. Decent product.  You can view and use audio from your mobile device, PC and Echo.  This is just my experience.  You may agree or disagree.  Bottom line is that it all worked out for the good.",Easy solution for some visual security.

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Sep 2020,Theo,"I think its a great device especially when bundled with an echo show or something similar. Takes a few days to get the settings right. Out the box it was picking up everything on the street in front of the house. We were able to adjust to make it less so. The look of the ring is okay i think it could be more attractive given the price. Battery lasted us about 30 days while frequently  video recording(better than i expected quality even at night). Its worth it in my opinion.

A ladder fell on my car and emotions and someone off and it was not recorded! The new one they doorbell camera 3 which features pre-roll! Another word for as soon as the motion sensor goes off and we'll start rolling 3 second then the other one! The only thing I don't like is you have to buy membership the membership for basics $5 a month or $10 for the Security Plus for more than one device and it stores your recordings for you if you don't get it then you won't get to be able to Cher's then our fave your recordings! If you cancel your membership it will you will lose your recordings! Other than that overall you can speak to someone through it and they cast feedback good sound quality and I would recommend buying the doorbell camera time chime Pro in the older less expensive! The way I say it is time to changing and the more updated the product is the better off you will have not happened to change out a litter problem! Well there is a chime pro extender if you have problems with learning or not which I had did with the original one this one not that many problem! And from work from home I get alerts I can check it to see what's going on from away from house totally work! The only other thing I dislike is the battery and can you can join in if you use live video feed too much he's so you would probably try the solar battery charger put it over the front casing movie an additional 50 to $60. Other than not yeah that's fine Tsar for to hear the doorbell ring cuz if you don't have one that's compatible they won't use it and the phone is not that effective so I would recommend getting the or newer .so you can hear the doorbell ring your phone Ding.  just so I could see who that so far,It's still recording early and the quality is very

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 May 2020,yamoinca,"My wifi at door was weak so initially setup was frustrating. I had a Wi-Fi extender at the door but it didn’t really seem to help. Made me upgrade my wifi from a netgear 6900 to Orbi. That is a different story/review but I’m glad I finally caved. After wifi upgrade setup was fast and easy.

Main thing is that it is doing a good job of detecting and capturing someone approaching the door.

A couple of “cons”
I went with pro for the “preview” function which is already in cheaper webcams (albeit powered). It can be slow (“processing video”) which is frustrating but seems to me to be an essential feature.

Only one battery so you are “blind” while you recharge unless you can find/buy the second battery. Seems like it should come with a second battery.",Pretty easy setup and seems to work well

After the first couple days, it magically stopped working on and off. The app would show that the WiFi signal strength is very low - which made no sense. We would stand outside with our phones or even a laptop and signal strength was very good when standing next to it and going all the way down our driveway to the mailbox. We also live in a 2 story home with excellent signal strength throughout the house, garage, backyard, etc without needing a WiFi extender. We ended up buying the chime pro to act as a “Signal Booster” and it started working fine again.

No complaints with this Ring, like all other Rings it had a great installation guide and provided all the materials/tools needed to install (except for a drill but they do provide a bit).

The Ring Pro had a tiny torx screw that stripped and was such a problem.  The Ring 3 Plus uses a larger screw and seems to be easier to screw and unscrew.","Works great, much better than the Ring Pro"

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 Jun 2020,MrGadget,"Overall I am very happy with this.  Good resolution.  Excellent integration with other ring components like Chime and also with Alexa.  Lots of features for customizing sensitivity of motion detection, zones of motion detection, and can limit to people.  I have had to do a lot of adjusting to get this to work well.  Despite this occasionally garbage trucks driving by seem to activate it, or it misses an occasional person coming up to our house.  Sometimes does not send a recording to the cloud, which I suspect is due to bandwidth issues.  Have to charge battery from time to time, but this is not too bad.  I may buy a second  battery to make the swap faster.  Overall good quality video.  It is HD and looks good though details of faces are not always picked up.  It works well with the rest of my system.  I am happy overall, but wish that resolution and sensitivity was better.","Works well, though had to adjust"

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 Sep 2020,RachelC,It does what it says it does.  The pre-roll video seems helpful.  It picks up movement quite a distance away.  I get notifications about cars driving by on my street (you can turn off certain areas to avoid this). The camera angle does not provide the widest view of my front porch but that's due to the spot where my doorbell mount is located.  Installation was straightforward to do.  I hardwired it to my doorbell wiring and bought a separate mounting device that did not require me to drill holes in my house.,Satisfied

My big issue is that the night vision isn't consistent. It's great when it works but it has lapses every night. 
The Ring app could be a big part of this problem. I'm such a fan of Ring products but the app is very unreliable.

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,2,23 Oct 2020,JanM,If you read reviews; search for pre roll. You need it. The battery operating rings cameras do not have it except for this one. The wired models have pre roll in color and merge seamlessly with the video when motion is detected; day or night (may be B&W at night). Pre roll on this is low resolution and does not work at night. It is stitched too your full resolution video shown after the motion was detected. IT IS HORRIBLE. IT looks like your two year old edited it. IT IS HORRIBLE. The engineers should quit. If this is what it takes for the battery model;;;; quit selling it.  Without pre roll a motion initiates camera is useless. At least they finally let you record for more than 20 seconds. Which was also useless. I have 8 wired and this one. I have no other way of getting a camera on my back door. Every time at look at motion initiated video on this one;;;;; IT MAKES ME SICK.,Its am engineering joke.

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 May 2020,WG26,"I bought this model video doorbell for two reasons: 1) the location where it would be installed did not have an existing doorbell, thus I needed something had an internal battery (this is one of the few that has this feature), and 2) the Ring products are mature and get good reviews generally.  Installation was pretty easy, though marking the spots to drill the holes for the plastic anchors in Dryvit was a bit tricky.  I could not get a pencil to show up on the gray Dryvit material, and the holes are so small that nothing larger than a pencil would fit through the hole for marking purposes.  I ended up making a paper template on which I marked the holes.  I placed the paper on the wall and drilled through the paper. It worked fine.  The first 30 minutes I saw I was getting alerts when a vehicle on the street passed the house.  I was able to adjust the zone to exclude that area, and I get no false alarms.

I can see how the pre-roll feature (that records a few seconds in black and white) might be important in some instances, but I'm not sure that one feature is worth the substantial extra cost of Doorbell 3 Plus over the Doorbell 2 on which there are a lot of good deals now.  I wanted to buy the current technology, and have no complaints, but a Doorbell 2 is probably a better value.

Unit was installed about a month ago.  Battery is currently at 60%.  At this rate, I expect it to last about 2 months between charges in my situation.  I wish it were longer, but I bought an extra battery to swap in when the battery needs a charge.  I may eventually get an electrician to run a low voltage AC wire to where the unit is mounted to give the doorbell a continuous source of charging power.   

If your situation requires a battery powered device, I think this is probably the top video doorbell from my research.",Good picture quality. Jury out on battery life.
Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,5,23 Nov 2017,TtotheB,I've had two of these up for about a week now and they work great.  One was hoard wired into an existing doorbell and the other was mounted on a clean wall.  Both set ups were very easy and the directions hold your hand throughout the process.  I've greatly enjoying being able to see whos coming and going with my young kids as well as package drop offs.  Sometimes they're over sensitive to street movement even when you set them up not to notice those things but it's only with large vehicles like garbage trucks.  I also greatly appreciate that you can snooze them so you aren't bombarded with notifications when the kids are running in and out all the time after school.,"East install, great video"

Ring - Video Doorbell 3 Plus - Satin Nickel,1,4,23 Aug 2020,Patrick,"I rely strictly on the batteries, no wiring attached.
