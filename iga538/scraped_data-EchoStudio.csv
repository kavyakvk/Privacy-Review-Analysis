Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Steve Pugliese,"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here. I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you. The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening. You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face. All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it. A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off. Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon! And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay. Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back! UPDATE:  After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!",These must be paired in stereo!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,A. Meller,"Disclaimer: this is not my first Echo device - I have altogether 5 of them at the moment, and have used them for at least 3 years. Unlike other reviewer who criticized this gadget, I had no problems with setting it up and with using it. It works fine, plays music and answers questions. I am just unhappy with the sound, that was, of course, the primary reason to upgrade from Echo Plus to this device. The good: a. Bass is better that on my Echo Plus. The bad: a. Trebles are  very bad and muddy. Rudimentary equalizer settings (Bass, Midrange, Treble) are not sufficient to adjust the sound properly. I believe the problem is mostly due to phase cancellation effect on a single tweeter that mixes signal from left and right channels. Amazon developers, please consider either adding another tweeter in the next generation, or employing a better algorithm that will minimize phase cancellation effect. b. The switch for ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"", that is enabled by default, makes the sound much worse and completely kills the trebles. c. There is a clear dis-balance in volume between spoken voice (that appears too quiet) and music (too loud). So every time you use it, you need to adjust the volume. d. Light ring that shows that Alexa is listening for you can be seen only from above, and not from the side, so if you ask Alexa to do something from 3 steps away, you don't know if it can hear you or not.","Not ""Studio"" sound quality"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Harry Sachs,"After installing the update (that took an hour) it still won't consistently play music. I don't know if this device is ready for primetime as this seems like a common issue. I was very excited for this one as I use my original echo daily to listen to the radio or music. Little difference between this device and the original when it comes to listening to talk radio like NPR or news streaming. The music that it did play sounded better than the original echo (much of the difference was an increase of bass). It sounded good when it played music. I have returned it because of the inconsistency and lack of functionality. I opted to not get a replacement though because I have my echo spot hooked up to a Boston Acoustics speaker that sounds as good and it's cheaper than the $200 For this speaker. Having used this ""studio"" version, I would recommend hooking up your old Alexa to a quality speaker instead of spending the money on this one. I find this to be a much more versatile option. Plus this thing is huge and didn't fit in the place where my original echo sits. My experience with Amazon customer service this time was horrible! I talked with about 15 different representatives to arrange for a ups pickup for the defective one and now I need to contact ups and try to accomplish this. Seems like Amazons policies or customer service has taken a nosedive.",Not ready for primetime. Doesn't play music and overpriced.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Ted J. Wheeler,"I am very pleasantly surprised.  I have an Echo Plus which I thought sounded good (but it's mono).  I'm a big-time audiophile.  My home theater subwoofer is a Velodyne SPL-1200 II (1000 Watt with a 12"" Kevlar cone), my main speakers are hand made with RAAL electrostatic ribbon tweeters and solid bamboo cabinets - five identical.  Point being, I enjoy good sound and I have a very picky ear.  I like full range clarity and balance.  More than anything, I'm tired of wires at my home computer workstation, I've tried so hard to simplify things.  My Bose Companion 20's are incredible but they're cumbersome, top-heavy and require way too much wiring. Problem is, no single speaker I've tried has had the sound-stage two or more speakers can have.  So I decided to try this...  Awesome Amazon.  Incredible.  The Dolby Atmos actually sounds like I am sitting in front of two speakers (or more).  I had to move it around a little bit to find a sweet spot but it is so nice.  Frank Sinatra sounds like he's in the room.  The bass is full without distortion unless you crank the volume all the way, the clarity is there.  The unit is heavy and substantial.  I'll be enjoying this for both my computer content and yours as I have the Dot, Alexa, and Echo Plus.",For the Money Incredible!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Aaron,"I had a Sonos beam and sub combo that cost $1,200 and it sounded great but I was never happy with it not being able to be a part of the multi room audio with all of my other echo speakers.  I was hoping the Studio might be close enough in sound quality that I could replace Sonos.  I purchased two Studios and a sub it has definitely surpassed my expectations.  Goodbye Sonos!  I feel like our living room is the closest we can get to a movie theater experience without spending thousands of dollars and you can get it all for a little over $500.  Sonos is definitely clear and loud but I feel the Atmos and 3D Music add a depth to the sound that the Sonos is missing.  It's like a whole new experience watching Jack Ryan with these running Atmos...so good! I didn't have any issues adding the Studios/Sub to a Home Theater group to my Fire TV.  All you have to do is make sure the Fire TV and Studios all have the latest firmware.  You can check in the Fire TV menu and you can ask the Studios to update the software.  I even like how when you increase volume the Fire TV cube and both Studios Alexa indicators light up so you can tell how much you are increasing/decreasing volume. Amazon has always provided a great value for their good products at a good price but I feel they have exceeded expectations with the Studio.  This is definitely an awesome product for an awesome price!",Beats the Beam!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Disappointed,"UPDATE 11/21/19 - I received a replacement unit on 11/13.  I set it up and everything seems to be working.  I would note that for whatever reason the packaging of the replacement was more generic than what I originally got (the box didn't have the picture of the device on it, just was plain black) and it didn't come with the power cord which I had sent back with the defective unit.  I don't care about the box at all but why not supply the power cord??? (luckily for me I had a spare I could use from another device - it's just a generic figure 8 power cord).  I did also pair the new device with an echo sub I used to have connected to a stereo pair of Gen 2 Echos.  I like the sound from the studio and I definitely can hear the difference in 3D music vs. non-3D music.  Interestingly now that it is paired with the sub I don't really notice the Studio being that much better than the stereo pair of Gen 2 echos (with sub) that I used before when playing non-3D music.  Granted I'm no audiophile but I'm wondering if it was worth the upgrade when I already had the sub to help the Gen 2 Echos in the bass dept.  I debated changing the rating since the replacement works as advertised and I think Amazon customer service was great (although after leaving the negative review below they called me within an hour or two - otherwise I had been waiting for a few days for follow-up), however the whole review/experience may get missed by others if I up the score so I'll leave as-is. ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW 11/11/19: I preordered this speaker the day after it was announced.  With 8 existing Echos around the house I was more than excited to experience the sound quality from this HomePod killer.  It arrived on launch day (11/7) and I immediately went to work setting it up.  With baited breath I told Alexa to ""play the best of 3D music"" in order to get the full 3D experience and Alexa repeated my command as a confirmation.  Then......  nothing.  No music.  No sound.  Was the volume too low?  No, it was set around 5/10.  About 30-45 seconds after the initial command Alexa told me ""Sorry, I'm having trouble playing the music"". Long story short I tried everything - playing different stations, playlists, individual songs, etc.  All with the same result.  Alexa would repeat my command as confirmation (just like the other Echos prior to playing what I asked) but then there was silence for anywhere from 15-45 seconds before she would tell me ""I'm having trouble playing the music"".  I called tech support after running through all the online suggestions (reboot cable modem, reboot router, reset Echo, remove and reinstall Alexa app, etc.).  Even though the Studio was in the same spot in my house where an existing Echo pair with Sub was located I put the Echo Studio 6 inches from the router and went through some more troubleshooting with the tech on the phone.  I asked the Studio to update software and was told on several attempts ""Sorry, I experienced a problem, please try again later"". To be clear the Echo does everything else it is supposed to - control lights, answer questions, play the news, etc.  It just won't play music (and I'm an unlimited subscriber). After an hour on the phone with the Amazon tech he was clueless.  He pulled some logs to send to engineering team and I've yet to hear back.  I REALLY wanted to love this new Echo and the sound quality but right now it's not even up to par with an Echo Dot - at least the Dot can play music. I'm sure this will get sorted out somehow, either with some update or with the replacement of the device itself.  It's just frustrating to wait so long for the preorder, get the device, and have it not work.  And Amazon's Echo Studio page is saying it's out of stock until 12/10 so it may be another month before I can have the chance to hear music on a replacement.  I hope others that got theirs on launch day didn't have the same experience!",Would be nice if this music-centric Echo would play music
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Nov 2019,Bobo Blackboots,"Great upgrade for my open floorplan.  I started with a dot and worked my way up until I had the previous top model (3"" woofer and .8"" tweeter) paired with the matching sub.  While that pair was great across the spectrum, the soundstage was off due to the sub sitting against the wall, rather than next to the echo.  I had reservations that the front firing tweeter on the Studio wouldn't disperse well from the center of the house, however that isn't an issue.  The studio sits on my kitchen bar and points away from the kitchen.  It does great at filling the central part of the house with music, including the kitchen ""behind"" it. Had I not done my research,  I probably wouldn't have realized it had a front firing tweeter, vice up or down. I moved the sub into the master bedroom where it's near that echo.  This added the low end to the bedroom without the spatial blur of the sub sitting away from the mids/highs. Back to the Studio... it delivers premium sound to the bulk of my first floor and now that the woofer is integrated into the echo, the soundstage is no longer off/annoying. There has been a steady improvement in audio quality over the past several models and generations, now that the Studio delivers premium sound in a single package... I'm not sure where Amazon will go next.  I'd buy a smaller future device IF it delivered equal sound quality.  I am not interested in sacrificing range or depth for size though.  The Studio fits fine on the bar and I can crank it up when the wife is out. Considering the Studio is full range in a single device, I am very pleased with the pricing.  If Amazon offers any holiday deals, you should definitely give in and upgrade to at least one studio.  If no deals soon, give in and pay full price like I did.  I think it's still a bargain at full price. For comparison, downstairs I have the studio, a premium echo with sub paired, another premium, 1 echo in the garage, and dots in the kids' rooms.  I guess towers will eventually work their way into the kids' rooms... upstairs I run Monitor Audio Silver 7.2 with SVS cylinder subs and I still have a dot hooked up to my receiver to listen to audio commands. Well done Amazon. Oh, one final nod to incorporating a spectral automatic equalizer to immediately adjust the Studio's audio output to match it specifically to your room's configuration.",It's worth upgrading... Again!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Leo B,"I got this unit to replace my old Bose SLII and it was an excellent decision; your get a decent bass and clear sound. I really liked some of the 3D sound songs available in Amazon HD, however not all of them are impressive. I also tried the extended stereo feature and it does a decent job in electronic music but it sound unnatural in acoustic/vocal songs. I did not notice any difference between Spotify and Amazon music, I'm not 100% that the streaming was even HD because when I clicked in the icon Amazon Music app said that the information was not available. I don't rate down the speaker for this because is an Amazon HD problem, but just to make my point clear: this is not an audiophile grade speaker, it sounds very good but it doesn't reach the clarity I got from my M-Audio monitors. In my humble opinion this speaker is a better option than Apple Homepod.",Excellent Speaker for the Price
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,NJrockboomer,"This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD. For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music.  Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality.  But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion.  Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's.  Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio.  When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track.  An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz.  While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming.  On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about.  True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k.  These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks.  I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal. I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore.  I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy.  So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice.  After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks.  So it was time to update my audio system.  I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub. In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan.  I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands.  I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub. If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes.  Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub.  That is my Home Theater Group. Now this is where things begin to derail.  I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub.  It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed.  Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers. Next up, the moment I've been waiting for.  Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio.  Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks.  Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD.  I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD.  ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"".  Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song.  The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track.  I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it.  So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it.  Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me.  The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd.  I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio.  This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all.  Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story. This is where the call to tech support happened.  Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me.  What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios.  How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k.  It didn't make any sense to me.  Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios.  Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios.  That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense.  So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit.  So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities. So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers.  This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment.  But I still had one more test.  If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory.  I'm doing this for testing purposes only.  I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks.  I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me. The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played.  SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios.  Only I can't.  When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""!  What??  So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios?  So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube. Amazon:  You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio.  You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks.  But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios.  So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube.  Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit.  Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!",Audio Issues when configured as home theater
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Nov 2019,Mike K,"When this was anounced I was so excited,  I thought I finally found the holy Grail of home theater. Get a pair of these, an echo sub, and a 4k FireTV edition tv. Let it all mate and be a beautiful compatible system that finally just works. No wires, Dolby atmos, what a joy it should be. Well it doesn't work! Basically its worthless for home theater use with Amazon's own Fire TV edition tv's Can't connect wirelessly to FireTV edition as a home theatre in the app,  as alexa app won't permit it, says not compatible. So as work around, Bought a toslink to mini toslink cable and connected to Toshiba FireTV edition tv that way and it still stinks, you can't control the volume with the tv remote anymore, So i would need to buy another remote and give up the single remote which ruins the whole FireTV built into the tv all just works experience. Didn't even get to the point of attempting to mate a second studio to the first to try and at least get 5.1 out of it (Amazon website, while totally unclear, seems to say the toslink input can NOT be shared anyway). Gotta go cancel my second order. Even if pairing two does work, the second remote experience is probably a deal breaker. But the web is clear 3d and Dolby atmos wont pass over the toslink optical anyway. Just all around disappointing mess. Epic fail that the most expensive top of the line echo speaker doesn't work with most expensive top of the line fire TV devices. Totally bummed. ****Update 5 months later and still horrible. Acquired a 4k fire stick as a workaround. And the home theater experience is still terrible. If you pause, ff or rwd video and it loses synch. Frequently it disconnects and you have to reboot everything. Sometimes it disconnects and you have to remove it from the network. Terrible Epic fail months later Buy a sound bar or a real system for your home theater. Not this","Horrible home theater experience, epic fail"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2019,Amazon Customer,"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels. There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing. Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future. The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus. The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference. So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless.  I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it. UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that. As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus. Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.",Quantum Leap in Quality
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,AC,"I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation.  When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one. First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears.  That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up! One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time.  After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right?  That’s where I ran into problems. I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular.  Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like.  The pairing went fine with no hiccups.  Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine.  I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with. I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent.  I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it! Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room.  The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled  “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app. However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group.  The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together!  Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted. I don’t know how or why but I learned:  1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case.  2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name.  It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent.  3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN  add the pair to my Everywhere group. Thanks Amazon tech girl! Rock on.",*Fixed -  Issue with Studio/Sub pair at first but now stellar.

This Studio is something.  For the money I can't imagine finding something that sounds as rich and fills a room (or two or three) with such a tidal wave of music.  Paired it with the sub and will get in line for another to create a stereo pair.  Stopped in the Amazon store on 34th Street and they had just one playing - you could not tell where the music was coming from, it was just everywhere.","Worth It, Worth It and Worth It!"

Since they have updated the firmware it sounds incredible left on which is default when you turn it on. It now sounds terrible if you turn it off and it disables some of the tweeters, so you might as well not even have bought it if you turn that setting off. It sounds amazing now! Perfectly balanced! Before this last update it did sound better with that setting off. Not now! They need to do a better job getting that info out there. They also should have had this update out before they let their product be reviewed because now people are going to switch it off and wonder why it sounds like crap.",Leave spacial stereo enhancement on now!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 May 2020,Frenzo,"This device has an extraordinary limitation, which I wish I had known about before: it will only be detected in the Amazon Music app FROM ONE SINGLE ACCOUNT (the account it was registered with). If you happen to have a family account on Amazon Music with multiple users on it, as we do, ONLY ONE USER will be able to detect and use the Amazon Echo Studio from the Amazon Music app. It sounds nuts, but I have spoken with multiple Amazon helpers who have confirmed this! This is a severe limitation, and a deal-breaker for me. Different family members have vastly different music libraries and need to be able to connect to Studio under their own accounts. Yet this isn’t possible at this time, unless you want to de-register and re-register the speaker each and every time a new person wants to play a song from their Amazon Music account, despite being all connected on the same WiFi! As is, the Amazon Echo Studio is for individual users, and can’t handle multiple Amazon Music users.",One SEVERE limitation
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Minnesotian,"Let me start out my review by saying I have purchased five different kindle tablets and at least four amazon type speakers from the dots to this studio. I am not an Amazon fanboy - but I do enjoy their products and appreciate their pricing. I also gave this speaker its teething period before I decided to write this as I was a preorder 1st day delivery customer. Let me start by saying if this speaker is going to be used to play music from your 24bit capable phone - its great. The sound is bass heavy and you will very likely be turning it down a notch to appreciate all it has to offer at the higher volumes. That said - where this thing does not shine, is in every other feature. As others have stated the light bar is at such an angle that you are often peaking at the top to tell if it heard you so often time you just have to assume it does and wait to hear the feedback. Not a deal breaker. The speaker is large but nothing you wouldn't see in a sub woofer but for a speaker id use like a right or left, its very large as a satellite type speaker without the height of a standard tower that would let you forgive it.  - again not a deal breaker. Now where the deal breaking starts is whether or not this is connected via an optical audio this device SUFFERS with the ebs and flows of your internet connection. It is so sensitive to  your internet setting that it cannot even calibrate or produce its calibration audio with less than perfect internet. This is such a true statement, that I actually returned my first studio as defective because AMAZON's technical support and developers thought there was a serious bug in it and had me ship it to a persons name at one of their centers for analysis. I was even asked for video recordings of the bugs mine was producing. If you have less than stellar internet and mine is 200mbs down cable type internet - my Alexa when asked questions would have her audio clip. After about 10 resets of my modem - calling ISP - and updating software on my Alexa I reduced this from a permanent aspect of my Studio to a 10% occurrence. So did it get better = Yes. did it go away....no. You said 24bit audio sounds great? Yes it does. But lets caveat that. If  you have a 4k Fire stick. The one they link to in this product description as compatible > its not. Not truly. You can pay for Amazon HD music and get up to 24bit type audio and play it through the studio on your phone. But Amazon HD on your firestick is only capable of 16bit. I have a yet to be responded to ticket for that. Which is why Im finally nail in coffining this device and sending my 2nd one back. What about use paired to firestick. How does that work? Its a pain. Not undoable, but not intuitive. If you want the studio to have volume UP/DOWN with remote you have to group it into a room AND set a home theatre system up. Not bad but not naturally intuitive. Setting up the speaker to pair with the smart TV or firestick you think would be enough or you could go in the firestick and change the Equipment management = nope. You spend so much time in the app making/breaking connections > its truly maddening. Stability? Lets talk about that 10% failure rate on this. What this equates to is when everything else is sailing on your internet for no reason the studio will have audio pop while being your firestick audio. Then because you hit pause, to go to the restroom, when you resume the lips no longer sync. OK maybe you just need to go to firestick and set the lip sync once in the setting > false assumption. You will set it and it may work for that resumed playback. But you pause again > back to out of sync. Again maddening. This if where I get into the fishing type comments is no matter how sure you've got something pegged some other variable makes your setup not work and lose all confidence you were even doing the right thing to begin with. I love amazon products when they work and I wanted to believe in the 3d audioscape of this device but this one is not ready as many have described. If this thing does 3d audio, I cant truly tell, and honestly I don't have the patience to wait any longer to find out because I spend more time on forums and in that Alexa app messing with settings/pairings to make something that should be near plug and play for how long they've been in this smart home hub/speaker business. All this speaker has done now is make me want to reconsider buying a new nighthawk router and modem > which every other day up to this point I didn't think i needed. And honestly the only reason this thing makes me want to waste more money is to compensate this things very probable lack of readiness for the market. Its just too much of a gamble in this first run.",Its all about that Bass Fishing!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Nov 2019,TOT,"The Amazon Echo Studio is a one of a kind audio device with a unique sound you've likely never heard before from a standalone speaker. Some thought and engineering was put into this product and it clearly shows with it's sound quality. When I first played a song from the Studio I felt like I had speaker in every direction in my house; almost like being at a concert. To me it sounds better than a stereo pair. I can only imagine the sound quality when paired with a second Studio since one alone has already knocked my socks off. The Echo Studio is by far the largest speaker Amazon has released but in the grand scheme it's quite small when compared with a 5.1 stereo system which that's basically what you're getting here from one Echo Studio speaker with it's 5 mulidirectional internal speakers system. I've read a few critiques about the aesthetics of the Studio with it's gray woven cloth but to me it looks just fine with it's minimalist design. But I didn't buy the Studio to look at, I bought it so I could hear the wonderful sound it emits. Regarding the bass you can feel it in your chest and feet when played at higher volumes. it's somewhat of a perplexing experience because of the Studio's size. What wizardry is in this Echo? I don't know but I don't really care. It does what it does and does it well. To sum things up, this is one superb audio device that truly delivers with immersive sound. If you buy the Echo Studio you will likely be highly impressed for what you're getting at the price point. The Amazon Echo Studio has likely paved the way for the next evolution of sound, who knows what the future holds.",The first time I've had an eargasm from a single speaker

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,Patrik,I have been a Musician for over 35 years and play various Instruments very well. I am also an audiophile. I am pretty critical of AMAZON at times but I will honestly have to say that they really delivered with the ECHO STUDIO. It does sound very good. It only took a minute to gather the information for the best acoustics for my room and it does have a full sound. If you have it pre-registered to you set up is extremely easy. All you have to do is plug it in and wait just a minute while it connects to your WiFi network. I own 2 ECHO PLUS and a second gen ECHO that all still work like a champ incidentally after several years. This is absolutely an upgrade. Also had LED lighting that I installed with it and it was pretty easy as well. The only complaint that I have is so far after 3 trys I can't get it to find my 4K FIRESTICK remote in pairing mode when I ask the ECHO STUDIO to find it despite knowing how and following the instructions to the letter. I am hoping not to have to factory reset the FIRESTICK. Otherwise I am extremely pleased with this and plan on getting another one to pair with as well as the ECHO sub. As I stated previously I have been critical to some degree in the past with AMAZON but I earnestly mean every word of this review. In all likelihood you will be very happy with the ECHO STUDIO... Update... I have since added another ECHO STUDIO and the ECHO SUB and after a couple of initial hiccups it all sounds great. Other than the fact that one is still announcing the Song and Artists while the other is beginning the Song I can't complain. There is no lag whatsoever it's only when the Song Title and Artist is being announced by Alexa that the other is already beginning the Song. I really do like this setup for my bedroom with my Unlimited Music plan that I have had for years with AMAZON. I also appreciate the new Ultra HD and 3D features that come with my Unlimited Family Music plan. They are not going to replace my really high end speakers but I am very pleased with these and would easily recommend this setup for anyone who Loves Music of All Genres...,Good job with the ECHO STUDIO...
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2019,Dave A Johnson,"My first review ever. I feel compelled to offset some of the one star reviews. In short, well designed user friendly high quality product for the price. Long version...  I was disappointed with audio quality at first. Thought I might return them. Like others mentioned I noticed poor reproduction in the mids and highs even after running room correction.  Was user error,  important to remember speaker placement. I had my left speaker nearly against a wall and the room correction did what it could to compensate. When I moved it and did a factory reset and new room correction they sounded great. Had to do another factory reset after I laid a folder on top of one while in use. (Would love to see a version with room correction app without factory reset.) As you can see in the photo they are in competition with a pair of play 5’s. Bet you would like to know which is better. Honestly, neither. They are very different in their audio reproduction design. Both are very worthy of their price point. I did decide to add a sub to the studios after comparing them to the play 5’s. Good base on the studio’s but not up to the Sonos. The amazon sub could use a user selectable crossover app, but all in all a bargain at the price. I switched from iTunes to amazon music several years ago. This recent purchase of the studios makes me even more pleased I did. I like the Sonos app a lot, but with amazon music I find myself saying “Alexa play some music”. She always plays something great tailored to my taste. She makes a better playlist than I could myself. My favorite listening environment was B&O pentas or my B&O RL 60’s back when turntables and cd was the source. Now that we have repaired the damage done to music with mp3 and have brought room correction to everyone we are in a whole new era. I can’t wait for the next step from amazon or Sonos. I believe at some point there will be floor standing speakers with room correction, matching amps for each driver and digital delay with room correcting software. Stereo pair Sonos play 5’s $1,000 Stereo pair echo studios with echo sub  $530. Love both. Use studios most of the time. Amazon let me know when you build a pair of floor standing speakers. I’m in.",Absolutely worth the investment.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2019,Grizzly_Atoms,"Has to be played at high volumes to really enjoy. This thing really shines when the volume exceeds 65% or so, but for most people I don't think they will normally play it that loud as it will be heard easily by your next door neighbors. At volumes less than 40%, where I suspect most people will use this device, there really is no difference in sound from the normal Echo. Most times people are streaming talk radio, or lower bit rate audio stations and again, it will sound very similarly to the normal Echo. So unless you are listening to a high bit rate streaming service at quite loud levels, I think you can pass on this device. Also, why hasn't Amazon put a small LiOn battery in these things?? I want to be able to unplug and move this device from the kitchen to outside, but when I do that the whole powers off and it has to reboot.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Nov 2019,Adam,"So I have an interesting review to write. I Purchased my first echo studio from Best Buy and immediately got it home and playing music. I was immediately underwhelmed by the music that was coming out of the speaker and was confused. I had heard so many good reviews and how much people love this speaker. Was I just too much of an audio snob to appreciate it or was I doing something wrong. I repaired the speaker just in case I had messed something up in the set up process and it still didn’t sound that great the base was poor and the sound that came out was very thin at low-volume. Well the speaker did have good sound at high-volume the low-volume sound was very lacking. I decided that there must be something wrong internally so I immediately returned it and bought a second one. The second one I purchased was just as easy to set up. This one immediately did sound better with the immersive sound function turned on. But I am still on the fence overall. So what’s the hidden problem you might ask?  Many reviewer’s have said to turn the “immersive sound” off, And it will sound much better. No reviewer has mentioned yet that when you turn the “immersive sound” off, it turns two of the speakers off.  With the immersive sound on, sound comes from all five speakers. With the immersive sound button turn off,  no sound will come from the top firing or the front firing speaker. So essentially you are left with a left and a right and a sub to produce music and sound content. WHY, has amazon chosen to do this, I’m not sure? Maybe someone can chime in and comment on this. I would have thought that all speakers on the system would be active all the time instead of just sometimes. I have a very high-end home theater system and understand how surroundsound works. Only delivering audio to a specific channel if there is content decoded for it. An example would be a 7.1 surround. The 2 rear channels on this type of system may not produce sound all the time, they are there for when, say a plane flies by or a an object goes behind the listener. Another example is the center channel is designed for speech and the left and right are for other sound affects.  But..... this all has to do with the processor. In most processors you can choose to have a multi channel stereo sound where sound is sent equally to all speakers. This is not the case with the echo Studio. Essentially the “immersive sound” button turns your speaker into a 4.1 surround , sending specific sounds to each speaker for the surround affect. Turning the “immersive sound” off, you get a 2.1 stereo sound, killing sound from the top and the front firing speaker.  Not sure I’m cool with this.  I would much prefer a 4.1 stereo sound when the “immersive sound” is toggled off than a 2 channel stereo. Amazon..... care to chime in? I’ll play with this more and report back what I find and update this review,  but in the mean time I’m not sure I’m gonna keep this 🤔",Hidden problem...... maybe ?

This smart speaker has amazing sound & bass! I had the opportunity to compare this to the Apple HomePod and this blows it away! I can't imagine what this would be like if you pair this with another Echo Studio and adding the Echo subwoofer for a stereo 2.1 sound because just one of these alone sounds amazing!

While the base delivers, the overall sound quality is much different than I expected.  I think you need to have two units or something. With just the one, it almost seems like there is a faint echo, or the music is being played from far away, even if loud.  Almost like they introduced a tweak with the 3-D sound that just doesn't sound right.  I think the original Echo is still my favorite. I wish I could get that device with a better speaker.

We returned the echo and got the regular echo speaker. That one has a distinctive hissing noise when the speaker comes on but it's better than the popping and buzzing I guess.

I have 3 echo plus, in my home. I bought them primarily for smart home purposes and occasional  background music. The 3 pluses were very satisfactory in that role. However I must say the studio is a different animal. Listening to the new 3D HD sound, I was somewhat floored, that type of sound could come from a single speaker. Bass that grunts, like my 1000 what B&W subwoofer. Very good midrange clarity. Not the most sparkly treble, my Pass system gives, but very acceptable. The sound from the studio is quite large and fills my kitchen, wall to wall. Loudness is not an issue with this speaker. Voice commands to the studio, is superior to the the other alexa’s. Even when when the speaker is playing loud, it can still hear commands from your voice. Remember, as with any speaker, placement is important to get the bet sound. I have my studio near a rear wall, and this makes the bass more authoritative and more to my liking. I use Pandora for my music source and although it does not stream the resolution as some of the better music service, the sound from the the studio is very good.

One sounds very good but two paired with an echo sub sounds amazing. I do agree with many other reviews that you should turn off the spatial enhancement. I am an old guy and most of the music I listen to is from the 70's and 80's. I was very surprised and happy that Amazon music HD has most of my music in HD or even ultra HD but none of it in 3d.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,J Pearson,"The Echo Studio sounds great; I had two paired for stereo and quite enjoyed what I heard.  However, when linked to my 2nd generation Fire TV Cube the pair produced only stuttering, distorted noise.  The problem turned out to be an apparent defect with one of the Studios; it sounded no better linked alone to the Cube than it did as part of a stereo pair.  That one has already been returned.  Now, the other Studio sounds fine with the Cube - apart from the very occasional and very annoying drop-out during playback.  Also, I notice that when playing the ""Best of 3D"" playlist from Amazon HD every song cuts off just before its end.  This happens only when the Studio is playing from a verbal command.  It doesn't happen when the same music is played in conjunction with the Amazon HD app on the Cube, nor does it happen with other playlists.  Another odd thing - when paired with one Studio or two, for surround sound the Cube defaults to ""Always Dolby Digital Plus"", and this setting cannot be adjusted.  ???  Note that all updates were and continue to be applied to every device.  I have another Studio due to arrive tomorrow.  Hoping to hear then what all those writing rave reviews have heard.  If not, I'll hold on to both as long as I can in hopes future updates will remedy all problems. Update:  After replacing the defective Studio and linking the new one with its counterpart and the the Fire Cube, things are looking up.  The Studios are playing music and movies in sync with the Cube, and they sound great.  The Cube still defaults to """"Always Dolby Digital Plus"", though, which can't be right.  So, I've upgraded the rating to four stars in hopes future updates will remedy remaining issues. Update 2:  Amazon has lately issued updates to the Fire Cube at the rate of one approximately every 2-3 days.  Today both the Cube and the Studio received updates.  And, voila!  The Cube is no longer limited to DD+ when linked to the Studios.  Amazon's attention to remedying problems with newly released product is creditable.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Christian B.,"So far so good! Once it gets set up right, it is amazing. I have been avoiding buying a soundbar in hopes of finding something like this. And the Studio more than satisfied. For now one speaker is enough in my apartment living room. It is so good, that I now plan to upgrade to a second speaker to get surround sound in a couple of months when I get a house. The bass rumbles! The midrange is all there and the highs are clean! I can hear dialogue very well over the sound and it’s a huge upgrade from the decent TV speakers I have been using. My main complaint right now is that the Fire TV 4K remote will not pair to the Studio. The instructions in the Alexa app show that you can pair the remote to it, but this isn’t possible. I called customer service after many tries, and the very nice customer service guy at Amazon said this isn’t functional right now. He said there is no notes about if this will ever be functional. That means you have to control the volume with your voice, even though you can still control everything else in your Fire TV with the remote. Come on Amazon, please fix this ASAP! The volume is so good on the speaker that you have to yell at Alexa just to turn the volume down. And it pauses the volume and it’s just awkward. Fix this! Also, I don’t love how the speaker will unpair from the Fire Stick when you play your own music through the speaker even when using a skill. You have to reconnect either manually through the Fire Stick settings or figure out how to exactly tell “Alexa pair to xxxxx’s Fire TV” without messing it up. This should be seamless or continuous. Please make this easier! Overall it’s a great experience! If those two issues are fixed it will be a 5* system.","Overall great, but a couple of issues Amazon should fix"

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Nov 2019,Christine,"My only complaint is the sound quality and not the quantity. It gets very loud, but the sound is harsh and unrefined compared to my Homepod and Sonos speakers. With the sound quality being below standard, it ruins any benefits of 3D music. Timbre is unnatural and sounds overly processed, even with 3D spatial turned off. It basically sounds like a very loud Echo Plus with more bass. The bass is also overdone and boomy for music. If you are not an audiophile or particular about sound, these issues that I mention may go unnoticed. It gets loud though and Alexa is of course awesome. I wish I could give 2.5 stars",Sound Quality was Harsh & Unrefined Compared to Homepod & Sonos
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Nov 2019,Sucram,"UPDATE I’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. . I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago. I’ll address three improvement areas: 1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔 2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue. 3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability. BOTTOM LINE I like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality. The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things. FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money. If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music. ———————————————————— The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races. From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both. I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting. In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...",Better than HomePod and Sonos One
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,REM52,"(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs. Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo: The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well). Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers. Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Nov 2019,Stanley K.,"I ended up returning the Echo Studio because to my ears the sound quality was not quite on par with my Sonos One speaker. I was hoping to replace the Sonos with the Echo because of Sonos's sometimes glitchy software but the tradeoff in sound quality was not worth it to me. The Echo Studio does have stronger bass but the Sonos One has a richer, tighter, more refined sound - it is absolutely the better choice for listening to music. (I am an Amazon Prime HD music subscriber, and I spent a lot of time comparing these two speakers.) Also, the footprint of the Sonos One is also much smaller than the Echo Studio's, and it can be placed as close as one inch to a wall - the Echo must be placed at least six inches from a wall.",Sound quality OK but I prefer the Sonos speaker

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Nov 2019,Llama Dude,"My first impression was negative but then I realized I was treating it as an upgrade to my Echo and locating it where the Echo had been. It should be positioned as a high quality speaker.  Your listening to this device is active, not passive.  After I came to this realization my experience became  extremely positive.  I recommend placing it across the room from you and listen to some of your favorite music at your preferred volume. For demonstration purposes I requested that Alexa play the following: 1. Bolero. I set the volume at a level where the beginning was barely audible. What happened next was amazing as the music built to a crescendo. 2. Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor. Because  of the crazy way Amazon Music has been catalogued do not specify Bach as the composer. Specify ""by E Power Biggs"". You will experience the raw power of the Studio Echo. My normal listening is much tamer than the above. Whenever I listen to piano music I feel that there is a grand piano in the house. No matter what genre I listen to the quality of the sound is limited only by the source quality. When you open the box you will immediately note the very heavy duty electrical cord. This is not merely an enhancement of the Echo, although it can perform everything the Echo can, it is a radically new and powerful device. 12/6/19 update.  My subscription for Amazon Music HD was implemented today. I asked Alexa to play Andrea Bocelli  Si Forever. When it started to play I knew something special was happening and headed for a chair.  Closing my eyes the wall near my Studio Echo disappeared  and was replaced by Bocelli and the orchestra. The spread and quality of the sound was impressive to say the least. The acoustics of my living room were replaced by the acoustics of the recording studio. I was mesmerized!!! Before signing up for Amazon Music HD you should  review the system requirements if you suspect your home wifi is underpowered.",Update 12/6/19. See bottom  of review.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Feb 2020,Drew Lankford,"The hype is real with this.  It sounds incredible for it's size and after putting it side by side with our home pod, the homepod got demolished in terms of bass output and clarity when cranked and I would say ***AFTER A VERY NECESSARY FIRMWARE UPDATE ON THE ECHO STUDIO*** they're about on par with sound quality/clarity at lower/medium volume. I say that update in bold because out of the box, as you may have heard/read, the 3D audio setting on the Studio makes the sound worse unless you're listening to 3D audio.  More than that though, the option to disable 3D audio is not even in the audio settings. You have to actually TELL the device to update and there were 3 updates mine had to do to get to the most recent firmware version. Once that was taken care of though, not only was the 3D audio toggle switch in the audio options but the sound quality of non 3D audio music was WAY better.  They must have heard the complaints about it not sounding very good with 3D turned on and fixed whatever was going on because now, you can hear the quality and clarity DROP when you disable 3D. I dont like the fact that I had to go to forums to figure out that I needed a firmware update AND that I had to use voice commands to do this.  These things should be in the Alexa app both telling you there's a software or firmware update AND the option to always keep it up to date.  The thing is always connected to the internet so I don't think that's too much to ask.  All my other devices, smart TV and game consoles manage to do this so Amazon need to take action.",HUGE sound from a tiny little object
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Nov 2019,Dan,"This is a nicely made and presented product. I had high hopes for it, but it is a bit disappointing. Here's why... Sitting close, it sounds full and powerful. Moving away the impact drops off very quickly. Also, as you turn up the volume, the amplifiers dynamics processing is very audible and the bass is reduced noticeably. It kind of comes in and out, so it loses ""punch"". Also, I am not a fan of the imaging or soundstage. Seems pretty point source to me and flat. I know Amazon has specially encoded ""Atmos"" tracks to show off the soundstage, but that not what I'm listening to 99.9% of the time. I find myself not using it most of the time... it just seems a little fake sounding. I like the original Echo device better even though it is not in the same class output or bass wise, it is more listenable and truthful to me. I can accept its shortcomings because it more honest sounding. The other HUGE issue to me is the inability of voice recognition circuitry to work when it doing what it's designed to do... play loudly. You end up screaming at it. I've used much better implementations of the Echo solution that can understand voice commands when a lot is more going on in the room, sound wise. I know I could use two of them and add a sub, but at that point might as well get a real hi-fi and an echo dot for $22.00 and call it a day. Hey, you guys asked...","Good, but not great."
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2020,Darrell Fichtl,"At 88 I'm a skeptic and a picky sob. I also sometimes question the validity of some of the reviews. So let's get the validity question out of the skepticism. 1. I have a first-class commercial radio license. 2. I was the regional expert for voice and data transmission when I retired from AT&T in 1983. 3. I was a computer programmer for many years and owned a shareware business before that business went up in smoke due to increased data speeds. 4. I had a high fidelity system in my home when your parents were probably in diapers. So, with all that out of the way, I'll have to say I was totally pleased with the performance and the sound quality that filled the room.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,Joe F.,"The speaker function is outstanding with absolutely great sound but unfortunately the software to make it work as a sound bar replacement isn't there yet. When connected with a mini-optical cable to a 2019 Samsung Series 8 TV, the behavior is almost possessed and I don't know if the issue is with the Echo Studio, the Samsung TV or both. Sometimes the sound is really great but then it will suddenly just quit completely. It won't work again until you disconnect and reconnect the cables. Searching online, this seems to be a fairly common issue.  Other times, the sound will suddenly become what I would describe as fuzzed or distorted.  Disconnect and reconnect and it will work fine again. My TV has a crap shoot of a time selecting the audio source when connected to the Echo Studio. Sometimes it works normally; select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out of the TV speakers. Other times, it is coming out of the Echo Studio regardless of the source selected. Select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out both the TV speakers and the Echo Studio (slightly delayed just to be more annoying.) If connected by Bluetooth, that seems to work with both the audio and the source selection but it defeats the purpose of using the optical cable for the best sound quality. Also, the only way to control the volume when connected with either the optical cable or Bluetooth is by using the hardware buttons on the Echo Studio. The Samsung TV doesn't recognize the Echo Studio as a known sound bar when connected to the optical cable and can't set up the remote; so no remote control of the volume. Even stranger, when connected via Bluetooth or optical, the voice commands via Alexa, while appearing to work, don't actually change the volume. When streaming music, the voice commands work perfectly. I don't know if the problem is the the TV or the Echo Studio but the two definitely don't play nicely together. I'm hoping that a software update by one or both will finally give me the sound bar I was hoping for.  I do love the sound as a speaker though. It is everything I was expecting.",Awesome sound but don't expect to use it as a sound bar.

Sure, you could plug an amp and speakers into the audio out, but then you have to either leave those powered on, or hunt around for remotes, rather than just voice command. Quiescent power draw with the Echo Studio is about 3.6W from the wall (kill-a-watt meter).  Thats about $4 a year in my location, so leaving it powered is an easy decision. It was a bit of a pain to set it up on day one.  The iphone app couldn't remap the wake word, or show volume properly.  Android was fine though.

Setup was easily as always with Amazon devices, and after a quick google I paired with a fire tv stick 4k. Now that it was ready to go, I wanted to try listening to music on it. Tell Alexa to play music ... nothing. Try again ... nothing. Try command I've used on my other Echo ... nothing. I went on the spotify app and selected play music to the Echo Studio, and finally, excellent, rich sound. 15 minutes of a playlist going, and then audio stops. Start music again from the spotify app, everything is great, until a few songs later and audio stops. I also connected a toslink from the TV to the Echo Studio line-in. Turn on the TV, and the Echo Studio switches to playing audio from the TV ... until it decides to stop playing all audio. I could not find any commands to get audio back up again. Turn off the TV and back on, and great, it's fixed, and 20 minutes later ... you get the picture. Alexa's voice also had a weird glitch where she would speak in a extremely slow stutter.

Originally, sound for the Fire Cube TV went through the TV via HDMI to a set of speakers. The Echo Dot was connected to a different set of speakers. I thought I could use the Echo Studio to completely replace the speakers needed. Overall, it did not work out as great as planned because of how the Echo Studio handles the 3.5mm input. It needs a certain volume level to keep it on. Frustrating when watching a program/movie and there is a quiet part and next thing you know is you missed the previous dialogue. Just plain frustrating! I'll go through my observations: Sound was full and good enough for us and since that is subjective (know many audiophiles), it gets 5 stars. Tastes may vary. Integration with Fire Cube TV was painful, but figured it out. Instructions/documentation was useless. We have a smart home with over 20 various smart devices (echoes, cameras, lights, etc.) and all successfully connect via Alexa, so I am well-versed in setting up devices in our environment. This was painful. As I mentioned, I wanted to replace the external speakers and have multiple inputs into the TV, not just the Fire Cube TV. I thought the Echo Studio could be that solution for an echo device and a single speaker output for any media on the TV. With the 3.5mm,/TOS jack, it can, but with that one issue of if the volume level dips down too low, the Echo Studio just stops. We also have the Echo Connect for our phones and whenever a call came in, we'd lose audio. For that we turn off the ""incoming Call Ringer"" under ""Sounds"" in the Alexa app for this device and many others. I have contemplated just turning on ""Do Not Disturb"" and mute this since it seems that anything that turns on the Echo Studio will interrupt the media coming from the TV. It seems the only solution when watching media on the TV is to keep the volume up on the TV very high and manage the volume from the Echo Studio, which requires us to get up and change it. Since we are muting it, we can remote from a device, but that is too cumbersome; it's easier to just get up. The Amazon devices in the living room are now only the Fire Cube TV and Echo Studio. Overall, it works, but that constant managing volume levels is so frustrating since at times we are watching live TV and not able to rewind 10-15 seconds. 2 stars.",Frustrating for my use case

It’s better than the dot alone obviously,but without the dot, it seems a bit blah.  I understand the other reviews about it being kind of vocal lacking. I don’t plan on using it in a home theater type st up as I already have a bose sound bar I’m quite content with that sounds better than this unit.  Similar prices also. I do enjoy linking my five devices (studio, regular echo gen 3, and three dots around the apartment) for full apartment music.  Might be the only reason I keep the studio as I’m not that much of a fan.  It’s kind of well, unimpressive, but gives a little extra “oomph” to the whole bunch together. As far as Bluetooth, I find it painful to pair versus any other Bluetooth device.  I’ll probably only use it for streaming services and use my Bluetooth speakers for that purpose.  This applies to all my echos. I’ve never listened to a Sonos or the expensive Apple speaker, so I haven’t a clue what to compare it to.  I’ve been more impressed by Bluetooth speakers that I have when I first heard them.  I’ve had a few by the likes of bose, ue, and Soundcore. When it comes to speakers, the echo studio is ok.  I’ll keep it because of the alexa operation, but have heard better.  There’s not a huge “wow” factor for me.  Very surprised it’s not better claiming 330 watts. Kind of like finding an amazing pizza at my advancing age......","Not sure if it’s a keeper (Ok, it’s growing on me)"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Nov 2019,Charles E. Wegrzyn,I don't have a clue why anyone would say it doesn't play music nor work. This thing plugged into my wireless network as easily as all the other Alexa devices. Music playback is better - much better - than the other Echo devices (because of the speakers). It does very well with Amazon HD music giving me a sense of directionality!  It is integrated with my HiFi system and TV all without a lot of extra effort. Definitely worth it....,What's not to like?
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Adrian,"I waited 5 weeks to receive this speaker. Which I wasn’t told until after I placed the pre-order that it would take this long. But that’s beside the point. I’ve read the interesting Amazon reviews on the Echo Studio while being patient and I still knew it was worth at least trying this speaker out. I’m not an audiophile, but I have good hearing. I’m not exaggerating when I say, the 3rd generation Echo Dot (yes the dot) paired with or without a sub is 10x better of an experience then this Echo Studio. The Echo Studio sounds like 3 instruments trying to be a team but are clearly hung over. Man the sound is so hollow and muffled. It’s like they put someone inside an empty Costco warehouse, ducked taped the man’s mouth and told him to annunciate the ABC’s but meanwhile it just sounds like Ariana Grande singing a verse. Just noise. I turned down the bass, turned it back up, turned up the treble, tried the spatial audio sound thingamajig. Placed it in the middle of the room, in a corner, directly in front of me. In summation, I encourage you to spend $200 on this because you can always return it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m just telling you my personal experience. I have 3 third generation echo dots throughout my home and those have a RICH sound that I’m very impressed by. Even just one by itself. I went to Amazon 4 Star store in Berkeley yesterday and tried the Echo and Echo Plus..... literally the Echo Dot was still the winner for me. It’s $24 right now and I’m laughing at how size doesn’t matter. And don’t get me started on the stupid Amazon Unlimited Music HD promos they bribe you with and then act like they never existed. Out of 10 million songs, only a small hand full are 24 bit quality sound. And they charge you on separate days for the HD. The Unlimited plan isn’t lumped together with HD. WTF! It’s all jacked up. Spotify premium is still the winner when it comes to sound quality. I’m a loyal Amazon customer. I’m confident Echo Studio next year will be the one to buy. Good luck =)",YOU’LL THANK ME LATER

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,HTD,"This is a nice speaker and a great value as an alternative to an Echo in a bedroom or kitchen or especially, in a multi-room setup.  It has everything the new Echo has with better sound and it's only a fifty dollars upgrade (provided you get the hub in both). So the difference in sound quality is well worth it. But understand it's limitations and advantages before you buy one. I bought 2 Studios and set them up as a stereo pair and the sound get's loud and it stays clear. I compared them to my Definitive Tech speakers and okay, not even close, the $1000 Def's blew them away. But that's a 600 premium.  So, let's compare them to my sons HomePods at 300. Much closer comparison. But still, the HomePod's clarity and sound stage win but not by much. But usually you're either in the Apple or Amazon ecosystem so not really relevant. Then I put them next to the new Echo's and at normal volume the Studio win's in both clarity and bass. The Echo's bass is way too boomy (although the sounds not bad in the new Echo) and that affects the clarity. At louder volumes, the Studio's crush. And it's only $50 more, if both have hubs, however even if you compare it to the $99 Echo it's well worth the upgrade. But remember, it's a substitute for an Echo not a dedicated home theater or music. As for the sound, it's spacious. It fills the room and provides a deep listening environment. However, that does effect the focus. It's hard to identify precisely where instruments are coming from (even when paired in stereo) but to get big, deep sound, that's a problem with all lower-end speakers. The clarity is amazing, no bass boom here. Even fine wind instruments are clearly heard. This was for me the aspect that stood out. Too many speaker makers tend to over-emphasize the bass (Sonos!). But that's what sells to many customers. It seems like Amazon didn't fall into that trap. That's not to say it lacks bass but its not overwhelming. If you want big boom, use an equalizer.  So overall I like the sound, especially for a bedroom but don't buy it for GREAT sound. You can do better with 400, but you'll give up the convenience of Alexa and a hub. Pairing 2 in stereo improves the sound but not to the point it can compete with most dedicated systems so I don't see the point. Yes, it improves the depth and gives better imagining then one but is it really a main listening system worth $400? Especially when you can't play 5.1 and the optical input won't split to allow stereo from an outside source? It doesn't improve the sound to the point it can compare with the sound or function book shelf speakers. Remember you're paying for Alexa and a hub where speaker makers are putting the money into better speakers. Get two put them in different rooms and enjoy what it does best, multi-room music and have Alexa in 2 rooms. The issue when considering these for a Home Theater system or as a replacement for a soundbar is that they ONLY play with content that comes through the Amazon Fire. That's a problem. Want to replace your sound bar with these? Well not if you have cable, a game system or DVD and don't want mono sound. I know wires are so 2000 but not when you have content from another source without physically connecting and disconnecting the input each time. Especially when the studio's sound can't play stereo let alone compete with a 5.1 or 7.1 system when you use the optical input. So where do these excel?  First - In a multi-room setup this is a great system. You can buy 10 Studio's and still be paying for the wiring of a traditional multi-room set-up. And it would sound great. No doubt, this is a huge positive. Second - In an apartment where you want better sound, have a soundbar for TV and a smaller space to fill with sound. And lastly, if you are considering a new Echo or Echo Plus. For a little more $ you can get better sound and Alexa. In the end, anywhere you want better sound and Alexa makes this a nice upgrade.","Good upgrade from an Echo but otherwise, limited."
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Robert M.,"I'll get the conclusion out the way: The speaker sounds surprisingly great For context, I own 2 Sonos One speakers and an Apple Homepod. I've always been lukewarm on the Sonos as their sound, while fairly good, doesn't match their price in my opinion. The Homepod, too, has always felt overpriced if not a decent sounding speaker. When the Echo Studio was announced, I figured I'd give it a shot given I could always send it back with Amazon's excellent return policy if it didn't live up to snuff. $200 put it below the Homepod and right around the Sonos One pricepoint so my expectations were set around there. Setup was simple as the device came pre-linked with my Amazon account. It goes through an initial room test where it plays some tones to measure the size and placement within the room (something it does continually should you move it around anyway). After that, all that was left was to listen to some music. I started with some Sinatra to get a feel for the vocals, and was immediately impressed with the tone & clarity. You could easily pick up on the subtle percussion on the background and the band hits packed a punch when they came in behind him. Next I tried some classical to get a feel for the range and, again, came away impressed. You could feel the lows of the brass section just as well as the high strings. The material was all represented well. Ok, so how about something that thumps. I asked Alexa to play some Chemical Brothers and this is where I got really impressed. Too many speakers, in my opinion, emphasize the volume of bass over accuracy. You end up with a boomy sound that doesn't reflect the music properly. Not the Echo Studio. The bass was punchy, loud and accurate. I tried some Daft Punk and Deadmau5 and came away equally impressed with the tight bass and crisp highs. Next I tried some Metallica. I feel if there's a critique I'd have with the Echo Studio it'd be here. The mid guitars lack a little feel and all start to sound a bit muddied together. You get the bass, you get the highs, but the guitars lack a little range. This isn't at all uncommon on speakers like this (the Sonos are quite bad in this regard in my opinion), but it could definitely be better). I tried a handful of the 3D audio selections on Amazon Music. In short, you do get a wider soundstage which is interesting, but you lose something in the clarity of the music. It feels a little gimmicky maybe, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just an ""I don't know if this is actually an improvement or not"" kind of way. In short, I'm very, very impressed with the Echo Studio. It's priced right at $200, has tighter and more accurate bass than the Homepod and a much fuller range than the Sonos One. If you're looking for a good speaker for music (with the bonus of having Alexa built in), I can't recommend this one enough. I came in skeptical. I came away impressed.",Fantastic sounding speaker that'll have me selling my Sonos & Apple Homepod.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2019,Pretty Handy,"Nice product from amazon, well built hardware, setup was fast.  Sound quality is poor,  I am hoping this will change soon. As with other Echo devices you cannot Android Cast to the device.  You can only cast from the amazon music app, or use bluetooth. This really is a nice speaker.  The sound quality is poor because of the tone balancing software (equalizer) deficiencies. The device control software only has a three band EQ.  This ""studio"" device needs more refinement than 3 bands.  The stereo separation enhancement sounds unrealistic. I turned this off and it sounds much more natural. I ran the setup routine several times with the device in different locations.  It just sounds like a cheap boom box. I did do the setup calibration in its current location and ran it for several days before I wrote this review. This is just not that good with the current software.  I would not recommend it and I will not buy another one unless the software (setup calibration and/or echo control) gets much better.

Got it the day it was released. Was super excited that it arrived quickly. First thing you’ll notice is that is actually a very heavy speaker, bulky as well, if you compare it to the previous echo plus. Set up was simple enough through Alexa app. This speaker sounds great when is on full blast, but when you put it at a lower volume setting it disappoints. You can hear static, (kinda like a microphone when is on). When you turn it up it goes away. But I’m hoping that they can update it or somehow fix it. I really wanted to love this speaker, but was let down and I almost returned it right away but I figured I’d give it a shot for it to adapt to my room.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2019,FrequentBuyer,"Background: Have had Dots for years, but never played music through them obviously. Recently purchased an Echo 3 and was very impressed with the sound which seemed to defy the small size, and which prompted me to purchase a second Echo 3, so I would have music in a couple areas that did not have speakers. These Echo 3’s are perfect for spreading music that will sound great throughout the house, not sacrificing great sound. Echo Studio: Decided to take a chance with the mother of all Echoes, the Studio. Received it a couple days ago. Setup was a breeze. The speaker will appear in your app once it is shipped. Brilliant! I listen to a variety of types of music from pop to dance to classical. This speaker plays all of them well, though obviously tracks with a lot of bass bring this baby alive. Pandora tracks sound great. I haven’t used Amazon Music much.. until now. The HD & Ultra HD tracks are incredible, allowing me to hear the individual instruments while listening to classical music. That extra bit rate is worth the extra cost and what this Studio deserves. Would like a little more control with the equalizer, but it works, and maybe Amazon will give us a control to fine tune later. At 199.00, having experienced this speaker, it’s a nobrainer. I had been wanting the HomePod, but no way was I going to spend that amount on one speaker. Also, the Studio allows groups, multiple sources of music and easy to stream from your phone. Sonos & HomePod are more limited. I will definitely purchase another Studio at some point, if there is ever a sale, it will be even sooner. Support: As an aside, I applaud Amazon for having dedicated Alexa support, and staff that actually know the products. When I’ve had a question and able to get routed, the support is BRILLIANT... there’s that word again. Conclusion: Amazon, you’ve converted this Apple fan to an Echo fan & supporter for my home speaker needs. Brilliant!","Brilliant sound, simply brilliant speaker!"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2019,Kunpeng Wang,"I wouldn’t call myself an audiophile, but I love the sound aspect of all media formats. I have a Dolby-Atmos-enabled sound bar for my 4K UHD blu-ray movies and streaming devices, but because it’s designed for that purpose, it’s not the perfect speaker for only listening to music, even though it sounds great. Amazon Echo Studio is the first home smart speaker in the market that supports audio-only Dolby Atmos format via streaming. If you also happen to subscribe Amazon Music HD, you will have access to streamable music coded in Dolby Atmos format. Try the newly remastered (the one with the “3D” badge) Abbey Road by the Beatles, it sounds phenomenal: you could clear hear the depth and virtual placement of each instrument in your room. Like most single-unit Dolby Atmos products, however, you shouldn’t just place the speaker anywhere. Yes, they promote that the speaker will automatically adjust to the acoustics of any room, but it’d work the best in a place where there can be an equal distance to a wall on either side of it with minimal obstructions in between, a flat ceiling directly over it, and your primary listening location is directly in front of it. After all, single-unit Dolby Atmos products work by bouncing sounds off of ceiling and walls. Also, just like movies, the 3D effects of 3D music are only going to be as good as the sound mixers who have mixed them. Therefore, not all 3D music will sound as amazing as the remastered Abbey Road.

The rep did troubleshooting, with no success. I sent additional information over the next couple of days and did more testing. The rep called again and took some more readings to send to developers. Still no resolution and no additional information from technical support. They may be done with me. I no longer am using the Studio with my Fire TV Cube. The lag and getting it back on track again is too frustrating. It has been a waste of time and apparently $200 flushed down the toilet. Good thing I only bought one. I was going to buy another if it would work. ------------------- I was an early adopter and had postponed writing an honest review until now. I understand that early issues are usually fixed a few weeks later. But several months later and several contacts later there is no resolution to my issue. Technical support has been very unresponsive. I was told they were going to research my issue and get back with me and they never did. The last time I spoke with a rep, they sent a replacement. That did not help. The issue that I have is there becomes a video/voice synch issue after watching certain shows for a while. My set up is a Fire TV Cube and also an Amazon Recast DVR with the Echo Studio. To temporarily get rid of the synch issue, I have to restart the Fire TV Cube, but then there is no sound from the Echo Studio. So I have to unplug the Echo Studio and plug it back in. Then sound works again. Some days I have to do this more than once a day. As far as the sound system, when it works, the Echo Studio is great for movies and music, with a couple reservations. For music, the sound can be great. However, only some Amazon Music apps give you full quality. You don't get full quality from the Fire TV app, but I do from my phone app, or directly from the Echo Studio. For movies, the Echo Studio has good sound and a pair of them is much more immersive. However, two Echo Studios do not work as a pair when you are playing a movie through a disc player (I have a Samsung 4k bluray player). Only one Echo Studio works (The one with the cable into the player). The quality of picture and sound is better when playing a 4k disc versus streaming, but unfortunately sound only plays through one Echo Studio.

Here are my first impressions. It is larger than the HomePod and really likes to be played LOUD. At very low volumes, it is less impressive. Regardless of what anyone says, no solo speaker can match the spatial environment of a stereo pair. I may wait for a second Studio around the holidays, when it might be cheaper (hint, Amazon, hint...). I had several frustrations. First is the availability and sound of the '3D' effect from Amazon Music. I could barely find any valid '3D' music outside of 5-6 3D Amazon Playlists (which all seemed to include the same very few songs). I count maybe 20 in total? If there are more, then I could not find them. C'mon Amazon, if you are all in on 3D, then start adding these! ...and there is the rub. Few songs, no new being added lately that I can find, and the complete lack of knowing if you are playing a 3D song or not. No badge labeling on the track, no clear listing of the 3D or not, and worse, if it is being played for reals, then I could not hear any difference (!). It all makes me think the Studio is not playing in the 3D mode or not. In fact, as many have noted here, the sound is more bright and present when the 3D (spatial enhancement) is turned off! I am so afraid that the '3D' mode will die a quick death and no one would even know. I would love to even be able to compare '7 Rings' with and without the 3D effect, but how can anyone know which is which without any clear labeling of the track. At this rate, the Studio will become just a 'big Echo' and all the 3D promise will be abandoned.",Where's the 3D difference? Where is the magic?
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2019,Carlo Dixon,"I am a audiophile with not that much money and let me tell you, I have had B & W Speakers which sounded great!!!  I currently have 2 Sony SRX-88's and  1 SRX -99 which sound awesome too especially the 99 because it has alot of the missing low end that the 88's are missing.  I figured I would try the Echo Studio because of the 3d Music... and I have to say I am IMPRESSED.  I believe that these speakers sound better than the Sony's which is a pretty high bar.  I agree that the Studio is the best sounding Echo speaker... but I believe that is really low bar, considering that the other speakers seem to be to get a audio assistant to the market... which I believe that Amazon has done a great job in doing that.  The things that I really like about this speaker is that it is a true audiophile speaker, great frequency range even in the low end.  I think as a assistant it works alot better then the other Amazon speakers (it understands when your talking to it), Even when not listening to a 3d track it sounds 3d because the spatial enhancement it provides depth, it is relatively small with a huge sound 330 watts, without distortion... if you have this speaker try listening to Beyonce's Homecoming Album with the Volume turned up ALOT!!!

The sound quality on the Studio is a 10X upgrade to that and it's mics are soooo much better. If you want really great, room filling sound, give the studio a try.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2019,Lionel Gautreaux,"Amazon really SCREWED up on this product. The sound below level 5 is just about awful. Giving more power to the smaller speakers at the lower volumes seems to be a very simple process, but they didn't do it. Also, the microphones on on TOP of the enormous speaker instead of the sides. So, since the volume has to be above five, you have to scream at the ceiling in order to be heard. They had a chance to beat the living tar out of the competition but left some serious flaws on the table. I should have waited for second generation but oh well. UPDATE: I really HATE that the microphones are on top of the device. DO NOT buy this until Amazon fixes this serious freaking issue. One year after buying this piece of junk, it won't stay connected to my network. All off my other Echo devices work just fine. JUNK. JUNK. JUNK.",Good but has major suck parts.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Oct 2020,JJFlash,"Another Update:  I really want to emphasize that recent software updates have completely solved the problems people were reporting with the Stereo Spatial Enhancement setting. This speaker sounds phenomenal and I can't wait to get a second one for stereo pairing. Unfortunately, I waited too long to order during Prime Days so I won't get until just before Christmas. I've decided to hold off on getting the Echo Sub until after I've experienced two Studios paired together. Update: Changed from 4 to 5 stars. I had followed other reviewers recommendations and turned the Stereo Spatial Enhancement setting off. Big mistake for my tastes. I understand that everyone has different preferences, but when I finally turned this stetting on the improvement in sound quality was immense. I figured out that when this setting is off, the top firing midrange speaker and the front firing tweeter are silenced. No idea why. When this setting is on, all speakers are producing sound, and it is pretty great. I'm now ordering a second Echo Studio to try out the stereo pairing. I'm still think the bass could be better and will probably add an Echo Sub whenever they're available again. I really wanted to love this speaker, but that's not really the case. It certainly sounds good, but not as good as I'd hoped. I don't really listen to music at a high volume very often, and at the low to moderate volume levels I usually listen to I find the Echo 3rd generation to be more enjoyable. Now, when I do want to play something loud, the Echo Studio is great. It can get very loud and never distorts. It does require considerable tweaking of the very limited equalizer features to get the best sound. The default settings are lacking in the bass department. Once you find the settings that are right for you it sounds good. All in all it's a very good speaker, but unless you listen at higher volumes often, the Echo 3rd generation is a more affordable choice. My music tastes, by the way, are hard rock, classic rock, and some metal (Slayer, etc).",Very Great
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Oct 2020,Ryszard Kilarski,"I am... disappointed. First, the good: The sound is great, it fills the room very well and, as you expect, setup and folding it into the Alexa ecosystem is a breeze. But I certainly have a lot of criticisms. I'm using this as a speaker for my TV, and HERE is where it just falls down hard. So here are all my problems and complaints: 1. When I use it as an Alexa home theater group for my 4K Fire Stick, it constantly disconnects when I pause my video. Even when it works, I lose maybe 10 seconds of sound before it reconnects. But when I pause video for ""too long"", it doesn't reconnect for... well, I've sometimes waited 30 seconds to a minute before giving up and having to re-do my home theater group. Once I redo my home theater group (basically, just editing the existing home theater group, unselecting and reselecting the Studio, and clicking save) then it seems to work. Until my next pause. This is hella frustrating. This happens A LOT. The long pause to reconnect happens almost each time, and having to redo my home theater group is maybe every other day. I can't help but compare to my Sonos speakers (in a different home) where I can't even tell it's on Wifi, it ""just works"". 2. So, instead, I tried connecting to the TV directly with an audio cable because my thinking went: if it's directly connected, then maybe it won't do that pause and certainly maybe it won't drop completely. Nope, same thing. It's as if it's ignoring the direct connection and still using wifi for sound. 3. Alright, so I switched to using an Apple TV instead of the Fire Stick. MUCH better: The reconnect time goes down to maybe a few seconds and it hasn't dropped at all. BUT now that I'm using Apple TV, I can't control the volume with my Fire Stick remote. So either I have to do it via voice or the physical buttons (what is this, the 80's?). 4. Now it's definitely better (but it's frustrating that it works better when NOT using the Fire Stick!). But lastly, the wake functionality seems to be significantly over-sensitive. We're watching something, and maybe we make a sound or just move on the couch (not even words) and the Studio mutes the video sound and listening to a command from us. It's just tooo sensitive and interrupts our viewing a lot. I'd like to try to turn off the microphone while watching TV, but then I can't use voice to change the volume! Ugh! 5. Finally, ever since I plugged it into the TV via a hardwire, it seems to reboot a lot. Like, two or 3 times a week. This is not good either. Yes, I've reset it, I've re-paired it, I've examined my network (I'm a tech person) and it all points to the Studio.","Great sound, but so many bugs and problems!"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jan 2020,Steve is not my name...,"Update: put two of them together and it's the best soundbar for a TV you can buy. I have no clue how all these reviews are having problems with pairing and creating groups and so on and so forth first of all. I have a ton of echo devices and they all play nice with the Studio. I've had Samsung soundbars, 5.1 surround sound systems, and have been around the Sonos Beam and Playbar. All I can say is this thing ROCCCKKKKKSSSSS. The sound is incredible. Absolutely incredible. It as a stand alone speaker blows away any similarly priced sound bar or speaker for music and even TV watching. Sorry for those of you who overpaid for the Sonos playbar as well, because it rivals that at a third of the cost. The Atmos sound is incredible on a single unit hooked up through my 4k Fire Stick, but one unit isn't enough for the ultimate experience. So, I just ordered a second one to go on each side of the TV. (While it sounds amazing by its onesy, you really should pair them if you're going to use them for a TV setup. That was not my original intention when bought but I was so happy with it now I just have to.) Amazon really knocked this out of the park. I was iffy on the sound from the new gen Echos and not very happy with the sound for price really, so I was hesitant on expectationsfor the Studio. (I have two echos and like 8 dots....and Echo Autos, and Echo buds.....yeah I'm a slave to Amazon at this point....), but the Studio just killed the competition. Sorry Sonos. Will update if necessary when I get the second one. If it wasn't for the Mrs. hating too much bass I would pair it with the Echo sub, but this thing has enough bass on its own. Cant wait to get the second one, pair them, and condemn the sound bar to the garage...... Now, let's get working on a complete surround system with this same bang for the buck Amazon.

If this input is being used and the echo switches to a call or drop-in, the mini-toslink input doesn't return when the call is finished.  Unplugging the mini-toslink and plugging back in does no good.  You need to unplug the echo power and plug it back in to continue using the port.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Aug 2020,James Hughes,"I purchased the Echo Studio expressly for the purpose of using it as a home theater speaker with my Fire TV Cube.  Unfortunately I’ve passed my 30 day return window, otherwise I’d be sending the Studio back. In my experience, it fails miserably as a home theater speaker, and if your considering purchasing the Studio for that purpose - look elsewhere. Setup of the speaker is just as easy as setting up any Echo device using the Alexa app.  The demo was encouraging because the sound quality right off the bat was impressive. Setting up a home theater system and paring the speaker with the Fire TV Cube was easy as well, but it was all down hill from there.  At first, there was a noticeable lip sync delay.  There is a section in the Fire TV audio settings to adjust for any delay, but it seemed that I had to make that adjustment at least once a day, sometimes multiple times after switching between apps like Netflix and Hulu. Starting about a week ago, we couldn’t any sound out of the Fire TV after turning it on. After a combination of rebooting the Cube and power cycling the Studio, we’d get sound, but the lip sync delay appeared even worse. Sometimes I’ve had to reset the network settings for the Studio in the Alexa app because it seemed like the Fire TV Cube couldn’t connect to the device, even though both were on the same wifi network.  Finally, today, after dealing with the connectivity issues once again, I deleted the home theater feature from Alexa and hooked my Fire TV Cube to a Sonos Beam.  Even though the sound isn’t as good (it’s still really good), the connectivity issues are gone. Since I’m past the return window, I may try to offload the Studio on eBay. Otherwise I’m stuck with a moderately expensive Echo device that will never get used again.",Sounds great - reconsider using it as a home theater speaker with Fire TV Cube
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Mar 2020,Bendy (Ben and Randy),"We had 2 Sonos One speakers for a few years now, and TBH we've loved them in terms of sound quality... but their Alexa integration, however was lacking in one critical feature - being able to join the Alexa ""everywhere"" group for when we had parties or are doing things around the house. We like to be able to move room to room and have the same music... it's just nice to be able to clean and jam out house-wide. We do the same for parties - lower music in every room is so much nicer than loud music in a few areas. This closes the bridge a bit between normal Alexa's (not great sound) with the Sonos Ones (great sound with tech limitations). The one big downfall is that this is 1.5x as big, approximately, as the Sonos One. Had we had the Sonos:1 instead, we'd have just gotten some Echo Input devices and called it a day, but they made these without input ports, so that was off the table as well. Let's talk about cost - full price currently is VERY expensive - more than the Sonos devices. If the Alexa integration isn't important to you, go with the Sonos model - smaller profile, still works great, etc. I'd not spend the extra on the Sonos One - just get the Sonos:1 or the Sonos:5",Comparable to Sonos One sound in a much larger footprint
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Dec 2019,anon,"tl;dr: Excellent Bluetooth and Wifi speaker for home music, audiobooks, and lectures, with minor static noise. I've wanted a speaker for a few years.  I've upgraded my other listening devices (Oppo PM3 planar magnetic headphones, and AirPods Pro), but I've waited to get a speaker for my TV, or MacBook, and my life.  I read all the reviews for the Bose, Google, and Apple products, and I ended up getting the Sonos One.  Sonos was an excellent brand, but after getting the Sonos One (Gen 2), it just wouldn't set up with my home's wifi.  I tuned the wifi, reset the wifi, and changed my wifi password, all to no avail.  So I shipped the Sonos One back for a refund, and waited a few weeks until the (conveniently) Echo Studio came out.  I had high hopes, although I had gotten an Echo Dot in the past that never paired to wifi either. Anyways, the Echo Studio paired to my home Wifi with ease, and paired to my MacBook Pro with ease.  It also came in a gorgeous container like Mac products.  The sound quality is great; I'm still fully assessing it, but it compares well with my PM-3 headphones.  I just wanted an audiophile-like speaker that could play music, Audible audiobooks, and lectures from my professors, and this delivers.  I've never used Alexa before; I just want basic Alexa functionality to tell it to play some mood music for house guests, and it looks like it can do that.  The Echo Studio just has this weird static in the background.  It was very noticeable; then I reset the device, and it's still perceptible if I turn the audio way down, but it's very minor.  Maybe I'll call tech support on a rainy day.  Overall, very satisfied!",awesome bluetooth and wifi speaker with minor static noise
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Nov 2019,Blindman,"First, I have a 2nd gen Echo, Echo Dots, Echo Input, Echo Auto, Fire TV 4k, many devices controlled by Alexa and subscribe to Amazon Music HD. That being said, I was overly optimistic about the Echo Studio. I was hoping to replace the Echo in my kitchen with a better sounding speaker. Although a Denon receiver in the family room (open to the kitchen area) takes full advantage of Amazon Music HD, the convenience of the Echo tucked away in a corner on top of the cabinets makes it the most used audio component in the house. It's on for much of the day while listening to Sirius XM, Pandora or Amazon Music. Now for the good, the bad and suggestions for Amazon. The good: - It worked out of the box and was effortless to set up (other than with the Fire TV 4k). - Was reasonably attractive and solidly built. - The bass response went fairly deep and sounded good on the right material. - It had enough power to sound ""punchy"" when it needed to. The bad: - The 3D effect was non-existent to my ears. I tried the speaker in four different locations (even though is was destined to be in the kitchen). - The sound quality was not pleasing on most material. This could potentially be corrected if the EQ was expanded from three-band to ten-band. While determining this, I gave the most weight for sonic quality to songs delivered in Ultra HD from Amazon Music since the Sirius XM material is pretty compressed. - The volume level was never quite right when using the 1 -10 scale. Even using the Alexa app to control it was a pain. Sometimes it did not remember the setting when exiting the app. I don't understand why Amazon can't expand the volume option to either 1 - 100 percent or allowing .5 settings (i.e. ""Alexa: Set the volume to 2.5"", or ""Alexa: Set the volume to 25%"" ). This also hold true for the Echo speaker (as others have voiced online). For my needs, 2.5 or 3.5 (depending on time of day and the music source) are perfect, but going into the Alexa app to change it is not convenient. - I could not get it to work with the Fire TV 4k. - The spatial enhancement for stereo music is awful. Just turn it off immediately (it is only available with the latest update for the Alexa app). - As noted by another reviewer, the blue light is not visible is many placements like it is on the standard Echo. I tried using the audible notification (available in the settings), but it was obnoxious. My suggestions for Amazon: - Make the EQ ten bands, not three - Add more granularity to the voice activated volume adjustments. - Market it as a full range Alexa enabled speaker with an included hub - not a ""surround sound"" speaker where it fails miserably. Sell that as a bonus feature. - Improve the quality of the high frequencies. Not sure if it's the tweeter or the amp, but the high end could use some help to produce a more pleasing sound. I returned it after one week... but would likely have kept it if it had the expanded EQ and ability to voice control the volume in finer increments.",Needs a few tweaks

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jan 2020,O.Bqwiet,"I was a little reluctant to buy this due to the conflicting reviews on sound quality, but knowing Amazon had a good return policy I figured I'd try it out. Are they the best speakers in the whole world? No. Are they the second best speakers in the whole world? No. But they're pretty good speakers nonetheless. I'd them a 5 for set up, versatility and ease-of-use. And far as sound quality probably a 4.5. The only thing I have to compare them to are my edifier 1000's. And although I like the edifier's better, this speaker's sound quality is not that far off from them.  I mainly wanted the speaker to put in the living room and I really like that I can group it with my family room edifier speakers (that are hooked up to an echo Dot through a cable) and the sound is loud and clear throughout the house. On their own I think they would benefit from having a sub paired to two of them, but a single unit still sounds really good. One other reason for not giving them a five is that I just can't believe that these are 330 Watts. I would guess more like 90 to 100 Watts, but they're loud enough none the less. I also tried it outside for a bit and I know they are loud enough to irritate your neighbors if that's what you want.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2020,Ronald Thompson,"Update: After what feel is unnecessary investigations online, and turning off the awful stereo spatial audio setting which is on by default, the quality and lost layers issue was resolved and general music sounded much better - and at a lower volume - making Alexa’s quiet voice less of an issue. However this hits the 3D audio files a bit as they sounded, less ideal than they would have otherwise. I’m not going to bounce in and out of the app for this setting. Also there's no way this setting should be on by default with it in the state it is currently in. Inexcusable to not screen all formats/genres of music before pushing out a device with a feature that is not advertised. Alexa’s voice on this device, however (as well as comms) is still far too low. We still need the ability to set these independently from one another if there is going to be these kinds of balancing issues depending on the device type. Was going to provide a slight bump to the score, but this is still bothersome however that using as a basic Alexa device is hamstrung by the audio mixing. A good quality for the $ speaker that is just seemingly going to waste. —— I gave this a full on shot, tried various music types and the lot, and with many of the non-classical and traditional rock tracks, such as pop and electronic music, a lot of layers, elements, and specifically - vocals - were drowned out by the “rest” of the music. This even occurred in the 3D branded tracks, in where undoubtedly the vocal layer is far too squashed. It sounds great, it’s just uneven. Even Alexa’s voice itself is shockingly way too low compared to the music, and any call to another Echo device, is barely audible unless cranked up. If you have any intention of buying this as an Alexa speaker with improved audio - do consider the unbalanced nature of the audio itself. Overall this product is a disappointment. I also do not own a Fire TV Cube so I will never have the ambition to get a second for Dolby Atmos, unless it’s more broadly supported (which it is not). Maybe an update fixes it, I’ve received a few already, still have the balancing issues even when tinkering and putting it in a super ideal spot. I just can’t unhear the flaws.","Update: Disable Stereo Spatial, then it’s better as a solo unit. Still has audio balancing issues."
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Dec 2019,Arthur Mills,"It's a solid speaker and a fair price.  I'm bound to the Alexa world and having a first class speaker available makes life easier.  I was able to connect this to my Fire TV 4k Stick and it took over for my TV speakers admirably (though this did take me messing with the LG HDMI settings to make it go).  The sound watching shows is far superior to the LG speakers, as you'd expect.  I ride a bike with a fan on during my show watching usually, so having this put out good sound above that is great. We watched a couple of old movies with it on and I saw a couple of Witcher episodes.  Sound works far better than any other Alexa device.  I have a Play 5 soundbar from Sonos and it's not as good as that, but you would not expect it to be given the $400 price difference.  It is solid sound, but not overwhelming sound. For a home theater setup I will probably pair another with this.  But I will almost certainly replace most devices in the house with these over time for very rich whole home audio.  In all at this price it's a worthy purchase.

My echo studio sounds muted and even like a blown speaker with the way certain highs become twiny (like on a 1st Gen echo dot).

I personally believe that digital music currently does not match digital music. But I'm a believer that digital music, done right, can equal analog music at a fraction of the price. Amazon, with some help from Dolby and Sony, has now established that this can be achieved in a closed, controlled, environment. Amazon has put together a ""front to back"" music system that is beyond belief. Their Echo Studio is the perfect companion to their just introduced HD/ULTRA add-on subscription to Amazon Music. I can't believe the sound quality of the Echo Studio for the price. I guess Amazon is removing all the hardware cost barriers so they can sell subscriptions to their HD/ULTRA Music service, which is where the real income is generated. My only criticism is that the Echo Studio can have a tad bit better audio quality. Great Bass and good Treble, but the mid-range can be muddy. This can be fixed with the great Alexa app that is dedicated to the Echo Studio. But the real hardware fix for this comes at a cost expense, so I'm sure that in a year or two we will see an ""audiophile"" Echo Studio II at a premium price.",I'm blown away!!!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Dec 2019,smoddelm,"Not just disappointing for what I expected, but bad.  I played the song Summer by Simple Minds using Spotify connect.  At highest quality - 320kbps, with the volume at out-of-the-box level.  It sounded distorted.  I played it on my Echo Plus and it sounded fine.  Maybe I got a lemon? Tried playing a different song using Bluetooth.  Didn't sound distorted, but gave me no reason at all to spend $199 on what I thought would be a noticeable upgrade from my Echo Plus.  I played this song through my Echo Plus, too, just to be sure. I suppose the bass must be louder, which would satisfy some people who don't know the different between the bass being louder and high fidelity.  But actually it wasn't even noticeably bassier to me.  Anyway, I'm looking for clarity and definition, not more bass, and I was disappointed. To be fair, I didn't play anything from Amazon Music, so nothing with the 3d feature that's available there on some tunes.  Maybe that's where the Studio stands out.",Thought it sounded bad

It sounds noticeably better than my Echo. It is comparable to a Sonos One. The issue I have is the Echo Studio has difficultly listen to the wake word and the command that follows. There are multiple times that I need to be at arm's length to issue the wake word. The Echo Studio right light up and then quickly disappear which left me to use the wake word again.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2019,Darthdaddy,"I bought this because when it was announced, it had everything I was looking for. What I received was no better sound quality than the echo plus I already have, but in a larger, less convenient form. Home theater doesn't work on any of my fire sticks, because they aren't compatible. Multi speakers don't work then for me at all for my TV. The optical audio is so delayed, it's like a terrible echo. Sound quality is honestly no better than an echo plus, and not as loud as the echo plus. On the plus side, it was easier to set up than the echo dot. I bought this to be a sound bar replacement. What I received was an incompatible with anything but a 4k fire stick, and worse sound quality than literally any other sound bar I can get for about fifty dollars. I'll be returning it and spending half the money of the refund on a much better sound bar.","So far, it's awful"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Nov 2019,Stucco,"Comparing the Echo Studio to this Bose Home Speaker 500, the results reflect the small cost difference.  I'm really displeased with the direction Amazon has taken with music, and this is more fuel for the fire.  I don't want to have to worry about if my music is 3D and optimized for the Echo Studio device.  I also don't want to pay a monthly fee for music, as I already own what I'm interested in, but you know- Amazon no longer lets me upload my music.  Yeah- real helpful Amazon- thanks a pant load.  Back to the speakers.  The Echo device does better as an Alexa host- it's faster to respond and works well.  The Bose is slower and the phone app is beyond primitive.  However the Bose can go louder.  The Echo Studio is reportedly 300 Watts.  Bose won't say what the Wattage is, but maybe that's where the ""500"" came from?  I kind of doubt that, as the Bose is not so much louder than the Echo.  For audio quality, it's the Bose by a not dramatic, but noticeable margin.  I also don't know if the mute switch on the Bose is mechanical (like the Echo) or just software, so if you're paranoid, the Echo may be a better fit.  The business where Amazon claims the Echo Studio is able to detect the room and adjust the audio accordingly?  Yeah- I've not heard anything that'd suggest that's so.  I have it in a living room and it's not really ""wow'ing"" me.  maybe if you're in a dorm room it's different.  Summary- if you were going to get an Echo, get this one.  If you want better sound, try Bose, Sonos, or some other Alexa enabled option.  Your mileage may very, batteries not included, void where prohibited, etc., etc.","Better than other Echo devices, not as good as Bose"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Oct 2020,Nerd1,"Likes: Sounds good, looks sleek, does 3D/Atmos audio. Dislikes: Very simplistic and outdated bluetooth support, no support for LDAC or APTX. Anything listened to via bluetooth will sound blah at best. Very poor handling of aux/optical in. The unit can not be switched manually and will freeze up completely if a cable is left in. Incredibly annoying given that bluetooth isn't a good option either. Summary: If you plan to never use this speaker with a HD Audio source such as a phone, tv, dac etc and only plan to use it for Alexa/Amazon Music and other built in functionality its a good product. If you want to use your phone or other device with a cable and with no loss of fidelity or via a modern decent sounding bluetooth codec look for something else such as Sonos or other brands.",Great sounding speaker but beware some shortcomings and oversights.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Mar 2020,The Queen Bacon,"This is my review for the 2 studios and sub connected the the cube. Please be aware that I think that the 2 studios and subwoofer are amazing together.  The sound is outstanding, my only setback is that I can't connect a bluetooth record player to the group to listen.  I can only listen on one of the studios, and no sub.  I am hoping that this is something that amazon fixes in the future... So I had a regular Fire tv that worked fine, we recently purchased 2 amazon alexa studios (amazing sound! kudos amazon!)  and a subwoofer.  well amazon got us on the hook for an additional $90.00 because we couldn't connect the group to the fire tv, we needed to upgrade to the 2nd gen cube.  FINE, we move the tv into our bedroom lol. Fast forward, well we watch a lot of shows on amazon video, hulu, and sling.  MOSTLY recorded things, sound and function 5+ stars!  We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her.  I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok. So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background.  I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app.  So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either!  wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either.  I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv).  Still doesn't work. Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube.  Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE!  Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao.  Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) .  Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes.  We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv.  My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube).  I forget the group, live tv starts right up. In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers.  Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording?  none of that works.  So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work.  I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this?  Amazon please come up with a resolution asap.  Once you do, let me know and you will get 1000 stars.",I purchased 2 of these and a sub to set up an entertainment system with a 2nd gen cube..

Before this I had two original Echo Plus speakers on the back porch. The difference is night and day. My neighbors agree LOL.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 May 2020,JOSE ESPINO,"I've always been someone who listens to music very consistently, sometime weeks have been legit 24/3 Then there was a time where I stopped even having the interest of listening to music. Then i listened to music with 2 echo studios paired and It automatically moved my soul back into listening to music, it even had me subscribe to Spotify for the 1st time The sound quality is something else with these 2, i carry one around my home and balcony with ease. So the positive of these are the sound quality, absolutely magical. The negatives are the annoying faulty pairing speed and faultiness it has. Alone, it's fine, sounds great. But if you're interested in surround sound, rich music, it is an annoyance. I constantly have to figure out how to re-pair them together to play on Spotify. 2 ECHO STUDIOS WILL NOT PLAY MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH They connect through wifi to each other and play through a service like Spotify, Amazon music, and some other ones. If you have a default player, youtube, or an app like Calm, etc, you won't be able to listen to both at the same time for some strange, annoying reason. Randomly they will pair together or unpair in the middle of the night or any time. Again, when wanting to play a song, you can't just have a song pop up tap the song you want to play and listen to it. You have to literally do troubleshooting everytime you want to play it in paired mode and through Spotify in my experience. If that wasn't an issue, this sound system would be an easy 5 star. Regardless, I'm going to buy them again because the audio is that good and hope that updates will fix the issue. I bought 2 JBL Flip 5 speakers to compare. In sound, there's no comparison. With those it's around 200$ for both, smaller, and pair easily and can play through Bluetooth, which means you can play through any music player most likely. Sound wasn't bad, but it really made the Echoes sound even better when comparing.","Superb Sound Quality, terrible mechanics"

I bought 2 of them for use as a home theater for my fire tv cube. Since day one it's been a disaster. Immediately after setting them up, and disconnecting my soundbar my TV and movie watching experience has been wrought with frustration. My sound and TV picture are out of sync. Not talking like milliseconds, no, I'm talking about 30, or 40 seconds. I stop my video from playing and I get sound coming out of my speakers for another 40 seconds. I can even start another video and I still get sound from the previous video coming through the speakers. I NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM UNTIL I HOOKED UP THE NEW SPEAKERS! I spent 400 dollars for this? I called customer service and the guy said he'd never heard of this happening before but that he'd research and call me back in 30 to 60 minutes. 4 days later I called customer service back. I logged a ticket and now I get an email telling me to make sure I'm not using an optical cable and other such canned responses that mean the developers never actually read my ticket or problem.",Total disappointment from the moment I hooked them up

The sound quality is better then the echo, but no where near as good as some other speakers like these.  I had two of these and the sub in a stereo pair and you couldn’t even tell the sub was connected.  I have 3 Echoes throughout my home and you cannot put the studio in a group with the echos. It just seems like the functionality isn’t there in the app for these studio speakers. Update!  I called amazon thinking that something has to be wrong with my setup or studio speakers.  After much discussion they sent two new studio speakers.  I just set them up and they still sound just okay.  I was replacing my echo gen 2’s with these.  They sound better then the gen 2’s, but when the gen 2s have a sub paired with them they sound nearly as good as the studios.  When I added the sub to the studio  pair it was as if the sub needed to be inverted.  The sub canceled out any bass from the studios.  I so wanted to love these speakers, but they’re being returned and the gen 2s will go back to being used.",Not impressed.

This is my 13th Echo device and I love it. Currently I have it set on the floor near a wall in our family room and the sound is fantastic - fills the room and even sounds great from the adjoining kitchen. I tweaked the EQ settings in the app a bit, which I have also done for all of my other devices which enable that option. I thought the size would be something I would have a hard time dealing with, but it is actually much more adaptable to just about any place than I thought. I have not tried pairing it with one of my Fire TV Cubes yet, but will get to that later. Just as a quality speaker for streaming music, this thing is fantastic - nice full sound without too much of any highs, lows, or mids. I see at least one more of these in my near future.

I placed it in a very large room where I had my echo plus and moved the plus to a different room. I was expecting so much more for the price especially given that people are saying the 3rd gen echo is just as good as the 2nd gen plus. The studio does seem to carry a bit farther than the plus and the voice recognition is far superior. I do wish I had bought the 3rd gen echo along with the studio so I could compare and see if there is a true 100 dollar difference. I would say that the echo plus and the studio sound a lot alike. Also, I could not pair my studio to any of my other echo devices. I made sure the firmware was updated and even removed all devices from multi room music thinking they couldn't be paired due to the fact they were part of another music group. Didn't help. The studio is good but I am willing to bet something better will be coming along shortly and/or the price will drop significantly sooner than later.",Eghhhhokay

Initial setup - like any Echo product setup was a breeze, if you already have the alexa app most of the time if you order online the echo product is already linked to your account. - the startup sound gave me goosebumps, i couldn't believe the depth of sound that this speaker produces - Playing music sounded great, Echo studio has some great lows, mids, and highs.

My wife can’t deal with this and neither can I. Also, the sub is way under powered. It’s very poppy when connected to the studios.

So yeah I just had my first charge and I have to take my time to get my money back. Additionally with the 3D audio and HD audio you can’t find the 3d or hd content easy. 3d is so rare that they give you a handful of play lists and most of them are only 10 songs. There is no way to search/filter for 3d audio or hd audio.

Setup was relatively easy and a big step up from my 1st generation Echos. Sound is excellent (unless your expecting marvels from a small package). But, what has me posting this so quickly is the shock I experienced when, after setting it up, Alexa asked it I wanted to hear a sample of 3D music. I can’t post any lyrics here without the likelihood of being suspended, but if you Google WAP by Cardi B, you’ll know why. Now, I’m an adult and can tolerate these things. But if you’re a family with young kids, BEWARE! A few clues: Use of the ‘n-word’ is the least offensive part. And the P in WAP stands for that body part the President grabs. If I’m not the only person who got this as a music sample, I’m surprised Amazon hasn’t been sued. On the good side, this device helps integrate older Echos into the system, where previously standalones can now be combined in an ‘everywhere group playing notifications from all three Echos.

And the 3D music is just marketing - it still just sounds like it’s coming out of the speaker (obviously). There’s no throwing the sound behind you and enveloping you in sound. I also bought the optical audio cable to connect the Studio to the tv to use it as a soundbar. There’s some weird software bug that you have to restart the Studio so that it will recognize that the input is now the optical port. Amazon should have already fixed this as this is its’ premier Echo device. So buy it for the great bass and Alexa assistant, not the promise of surround sound.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2019,Damon L.,"Pro: the sound quality is very good. Hooked it up with both a line-in 3.5mm cable as well as blue tooth and both sounded very good. Bass is above average if not phenomenal, but overall I’m very satisfied with songs, movies and even Alexa. She sounds more natural and warm with this Echo. Pro: look and feel are high quality This speaker is heavier than you would think at first glance, especially for its size. It’s not especially compact but it’s smaller than I expected. I like the white light that displays the current volume level. Con: horrible setup procedure After powering it up, the instructions say to open my Alexa app on iOS and follow instructions. Nothing appeared. Had to manually add it. After manually adding it, It was not clear AT ALL how to use it with my Fire TV Stick 4K. Was I supposed to pair it via BlueTooth? Was I supposed to add “Fire TV” streaming service to it so I can allow Alexa to control the Fire Stick TV *through* the Echo Studio? After literally hours of searching the Internet I learned you had to go into the Devices section, click the + button in the upper right and select “Setup Home Theater”. What?! That’s not even intuitive! Even then I had to deregister my Echo Studio and re-add it because the first time I set it up, like most people, I followed standard prompts and added it to a group. But for some reason doing that didn’t let me select it later as part of a home theater. So my advice: be patient, it’s unlikely you’ll get it right the first time. Overall: if Amazon included clear instructions, or even a link to helpful tips. That would be one thing. But even if you Google “set up echo studio with Fire TV” you will get a dozen Amazon links, none of them pointing you how to “setup a home theater” under the Devices section. Finally: you’ll want to get the Fire TV remote with volume control. That allows very easy manipulation of the Studio’s volume which is SO much better than constantly asking Alexa to change the volume during a show.","Very good sound, high quality hardware, poor setup"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,susananne,"Our house has a large open family room/kitchen.  We have an Echo1 in the living room and wanted to get another speaker to place on top of the refrigerator to listen to music while working in the kitchen.  It seems that a lot of small speakers are designed to be taken outside - built in batteries, etc.  The sacrifice for portability is sound quality, so we were not interested in those.  We looked at Bose, Sonos and this Studio.  The Bose with built-in Alexa seemed overpriced compared to the Studio.  The Sonos speakers seemed nice, but many of the reviews mentioned proprietary software and systems.  I often like to listen to music while getting ready for work and didn't want to have to deal with intermittent bluetooth connection issues while rushing around.  We have an Amazon Unlimited Music subscription and I have always loved being able to just ask Alexa to play any song I wish, so we opted for the Studio. The Studio was amazingly easy to set up since we opted to ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup"" when placing the order.  Honestly, we just took it out of box and placed in on top of the refrigerator and plugged it in.  We didn't have to specify a wireless network, provide the password, etc. - it just connected and worked right away. It took about 5 minutes to figure out how to create the ""multi-room music"" group.  Once we did that and played our first song request simultaneously on the Echo1 and the Studio, the sound was absolutely amazing.  Being able to adjust the Bass, Midrange and Treble on the Studio is an added bonus. Although we were really impressed with the sound quality, we opted for the Amazon Music HD upgrade.  They advertise a 90 day free subscription with the purchase of the Studio, but we were not given this option.  I called support and they explained that this offer was only for ""new"" subscribers.  Since we already had Unlimited, we were not eligible (not nice).  Still, we were given a one month free subscription so - why not. The sound of the multi-room system with HD is beyond amazing - as close to concert sound as any speaker I have ever heard.  It completely fills the entire first floor of our house with high quality, deep bass, clear treble sound.  Our annual music cost is going to be $129 a year now (unlimited was $79 - the HD is an additional $50) but given the quality of the sound, it is well worth it.",Absolutely worth the price - amazing sound

Due to the larger size the echo studio is able to produce more bass than the shows or  regular echo. I am still trying to adjust the mid and treble hoping to get the echo studio to sound better. But for the price I was not impressed. It produces more bass than a regular echo, but overall sound does not seem as good. Depending on how I adjust the mids and treble it tends to either sound muddled or shrill. The volume is decent, but you are unable to turn the volme all the way up without speakers distorting. Not sure if this is the speakers or if there is an amp built in producing thd. It also tends to create sweet spots in the room. You can walk around the room and find areas where the music sounds a little better than other areas. I purchased the higher level amazon music subscription for the 3D music but was not impressed with how it sounded on the echo studio. Maybe it is how I have it located in the room. There were not instructions with it, so havent figured out how to get it to re-analyze the acoustics of the room after you move the device to a new location without having to do a factory reset. Overall its not bad, but was not impressed with the sound or how it fills the room. I dont think I will purchase the second one to pair with this one and use in place of a soundbar for my tv. If I had it do over, I think I might try the sonos instead.  I will keep trying to tinker with the sound adjustments and room location to see if I can get it to sound better. I will update my review if it works.",Not what I expected
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2020,Roger,"I bought 2 of these to set up a theater system.  Set up individually, they work AMAZING.  The sound is great and as a stand alone smart speaker, it is the best of the ones I own (Echo 1G, Dot 1G and 2G, Show 1G and Show 5). The problem I have is that the connection between the speaker and my 1G Cube breaks constantly and I have to do a reset ever 2-3 days.  TechAssist say that it is because it is switching back and forth between my 2.4 and 5.0 networks even though I have the networks set up separately.  Never once during set up did I ever see them connected to my 2.4 network.  Tech filed a ticket, but I don't know how much that will do. After multiple resets and set ups, eventually they do set up and work.  Usually it takes about 20 minutes and 3-4 cycles for it to work.  But I have to ask myself if it is worth spending the time to set the whole thing up over and over.  Sometimes I only have time to watch a movie... and after doing the set up I don't have time to watch it anymore....  which is annoying since that is the very reason I bought them. If the situation improves I will update the post.  If not, I will be returning both speakers.  You have until mid-May, Amazon.  Please fix this. It has been 3 weeks since my original post and things have gotten worse.  Now my media player which I purchased from the Amazon App store which has worked flawlessly is now out of sync with the Studio speakers... when they work.  They seem to work fine watching YouTube or short shows on Netflix or Hulu.  But as soon as I settle in to watch an action movie where you really want that big sound....  NOTHING. I'm tired of waiting for it to get fixed and I'm tired of each tech just having me run through the same thing that the previous ones already had.  My issue apparently got escalated... but I can't tell since the tech that was supposedly going to call me back NEVER did.  Normally I don't put blame for my dissatisfaction on Amazon, but this time it is your product.  Loved it when it worked....  but doesn't work enough.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Feb 2020,Frank Wolffe,"I bought this to replace the Echo Plus in my living room. I figured the fancy dancey new bigger Studio would be able to fill the room better. Don't get me wrong, the Plus sounded good, but not get up and boogie loud. Surely the Studio would be able to do that. Not so. I have the bass on my Plus turned down two notches, because it's just that rich. With the Studio bass turned up to max it still sounds thinner than the Plus. On top of that, at max volume the Studio is about 1/2 as loud as the Plus. Total loser on the audio front. Combine that with the design decision to recess the light ring below the speakers so you can't see it respond if its not below eye level, and the Alexa volume/audio volume de-sync which seems to occur much more often on the Studio, and I'm going to have to say SKIP THIS GENERATION. Maybe they can fix it in software or a subsequent version, but right now this Alexa is not worth buying.",The audio quality is less than the Echo Plus
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Apr 2020,Chanda,"I am supremely disappointed with the device I received.  I was skeptical about it as soon as it arrived and I saw how it was packaged.  It was in it's box from the maufacturer and then, in true Amazon fashion, it was packed in a box 3x the size required with 1 sheet of kraft paper as 'padding'.  So, it basically bounced around until it arrived.  I guess I should be happy it works at all? It does not arrive with the needed optical cable to connect it to the television.  I had to buy an adapter to make the one I have fit. I notice about once every 4 or 5 days sound will stop coming out of it completely.  Not while I'm using it, but in the morning, first thing.  I have to pull power from it for 10 seconds and repower.  It will work again for 4 or 5 days and this must be repeated.  This is for audio from the TV, I have not tried to play music through it before pulling power.  I will try to remember that first thing in the morning when all I really want is coffee and the weather report.... Another thing I just noticed today.  While playing music it will randomly drop to volume '0'.  Every 10 or 15 minutes.  With the music 'Everywhere' option I notice none of my other Echo devices (Echos or dots) will do that.  They keep playing.... because that is what they've been asked to do....  Not the Studio.  Just decides, mid-song, that it is done.  I have to turn it back up. For the price, it sounds good.  This is not top quality, but I was not expecting that.  It is good for the price. It also DOES do the things.  Controls lights, runs skills, and everything you'd expect it to, but it just seems to 'get tired' and needs a poke to get going again.",Does not like my music....

I'm an electrician by trade and have installed many under cabinet lighting projects. But I'll admit being 65 I didn't grow up with Wi-fi and Bluetooth. So I assumed it was my problem.

I can ask my Google/Nest hub to show me live video from my Nest Hello Doorbell. I have given up on the amazon Alexa echo-system and am A Google/Nest man now. I highly you all do the same.

The sound was not nearly as good as I expected and I ultimately sent both back.  Trust me, I really wanted this to be great but it was at best so-so.

Murray,"I have pretty much all the Amazon/Echo devices....actually more than my living space requires or needs.  My favorite Echo device is still the original 1st generation hub, I was one of the beta testers to use it so we have 5 years of history together.  Great sound, sensitive voice recognition, has never missed a beat and is still going strong.  But I bought into the 3D audio high-fidelity hype and purchased the Studio to replace my original Echo in the living room. The Studio is OK, meh, just OK for me.  I am not an audiophile so I can't comment on the highs/mids/bass or begin to understand Dolby Atmos technology, you can read the many other reviews for that info.  I do however subscribe to Amazon Music so I enjoy streaming music low in the background during my day to day routine or Alexa responding to one of many commands/questions I ask of her each day.  Audio texting with my friends (also who all own Echos) is a hoot! To tell the truth I really feel that my original had just as good sound, maybe not the deep tones but this Studio was not worth spending the extra money for, glad I got it at sale price.  I also find it drops wifi frequently (never had that issue before)  or I will look up to see the blue ring rotating around and around for no apparent reason and you also have to abide by the Studio space requirements.  I think the spoken word is a little muddier, not as crisp, with the Studio (hard to explain).  I, at times, have to repeat commands or yell at the Studio to turn on/off lights so I don't think this device is as sensitive to my voice like the original is.  I seem to get a little bit more frustrated with using this unit.  AND was pretty bummed to discover that the Echo volume remote does not work with this unit either!  What the heck!  It's an audio device that should have a remote volume control. I mean I am going to keep it but this is not going to be an Echo device that I will be recommending to family or friends.  I just think that some of the other Echo devices have decent enough audio quality, for the average person, uses a smaller foot print that can be placed pretty much anywhere in a room.",Not a necessary Echo device IMO

The Studio is working MUCH better now. Very impressed with a quick and unsolicited response from Technical Support one day after the original post. Thank you, “Tammi!” ========= This Alexa device disappointed me. After installing two original Amazon Echo devices several years ago and then three Echo Dots in various places around the house I was quite excited when I got my Echo Studio. I envisioned full and rich sounds of music for my small home office. Not. While the Echo Studio sounds good (but not great) the Studio sucks hugely at hearing. You have to speak your requests louder than normal and you have to keep your request words clear-and-seperated-from-each-other or Studio will just sit there like a big round rock.

I am so sorry that I did not throughly test my Studio on arrival when I could have returned it for a refund. I'm stuck with it now. Bought from Best Buy because Amazon was so terribly backordered.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2020,TC,"Those of you that have read my reviews know that I tell it like it is.  Most echo device users, who listen to music complain that none of the echo devices are capable of reproducing bass notes properly.  I say, if you wanted bass, then add the echo sub to your current device or change up all together.  I currently run 9 echo devices in my home.  I wanted to have music throughout my home and not miss a beat of a song.  I purchased the echo studio for my garage, yes, that’s correct, my garage.  The only place in my home that needs the sound louder, and the ability to have a bit more bottom end.  This device not only provides me with incredible sound, I was able to get it on prime day for $150.  I most likely would have paid $199 as it’s well worth it.  It uses tone frequencies to measure the distance within a room so that it can control the amount of volume to each speaker.  Upon setup which takes about 2 minutes, I was ready to add it to my everywhere group.  Most audio enthusiasts could agree, for the price, this device exceeds expectations as its design allows for a rich full room of sound where most speakers fail.  I was using a high end portable Bluetooth speaker for awhile, and hated the fact I had to run it through my phone.  Every time phone rang, it interrupted my music.  Each and every alert was pushed through the speaker.  I got tired of this and opted to go echo.  This was truly the best device for the garage.  Truly satisfied with the sound quality, loudness. Not only can I listen to music, but I can control every smart device I have connected to it.  Be smart people, never add locks, or garage door openers to your echo devices.

I purchased this thinking that this device would be a standalone device without needing an Echo Sub, but I was wrong. In order to get that nice thick & rich sound, it is absolutely necessary to pair your studio up with a sub, which means $$$. Echo 2 or 3 + Echo Sub ==> much better sound than Echo Studio. Echo Studio + Echo Sub is MUCH BETTER than Echo Studio. Echo Studio is better than Echo 3 - but not by much.

Nice touch Amazon. Today I called Amazon a 3rd time asking where my refund is after being told 2 previous times wait another 3-5 days. The customer service person never once answered 1 question I asked several time...what is the hold up?! Then told me have a nice day, good bye, and hung up. Good job Amazon, you're losing a 10+ year Prime member. First of all, the build-quality and sound-quality are top notch. For its' size, this speaker really does produce a great sound. I've owned countless Bluetooth speakers, and this one delivered on sound. But I'm all about functionality, and this speaker did not deliver on that. I used this speaker in my bedroom for TV sound and to play Spotify (which I do constantly). I have my Mac Mini connected to my TV and have the Echo connected via Bluetooth to my Mac Mini. For a few weeks it performed flawlessly...playing my Spotify when I fired up a playlist, and automatically connecting back to my Mac Mini when I closed out of Spotify. This would be the first Alexa device I've used that functioned properly. One night while watching a movie, the sound dropped out and the speaker disconnected from Bluetooth...now showing up as offline in the Alexa app. From this point on the issues just got progressively worse. So I've given up on Amazon speakers except for my old Echo Plus (with the rotating volume ring) because it still functions 100% and I've never had to reconnect it to my network. I am now back to my UE Boom 2 speakers...that when powered up automatically connect to my Mac Mini as they should and simply function.

The bass is a bit deeper, and the mid-range seems to be a touch clearer, but we honestly don't notice much of a difference. My biggest heart break with this studio is the voice recognition.  Now our original Echo wasn't perfect, where we had to re-say ""Alexa"" a few times here and there to get it to pick up.  But this studio is simply awful.  We constantly need to re-say ""Alexa"" to get it to wake up.  Once it's woken up, there is about a 15% chance that it simply doesn't pickup your command and it just does nothing.  My assumption (without any research done prior), is that 5 years would have provided advancements in their microphone technology based on all of the different echo devices.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Aug 2020,BoogieNYC,"I prioritize sound quality over convenience so please consider that while reading this review. The Studio is a heavy, solid speaker that has some serious electronic power and heft behind it. It's not quite on par with Sonos offerings but it's relatively straightforward and integrated Alexa make it more useful than a Sonos option. I have a Sonos Beam (an integrated center channel, Alexa-enabled streaming speaker) which is a great option as well -- but for more money and a much larger footprint it should be. The Studio is a bit unusual looking -- but my goal is what it sounds like. And when it wails it does so very well. I don't tinker with 3D sound -- seems like a gimmick to me -- but the truth is I think the sound quality is more than adequate just streaming Spotify, Pandora and whatever else you might find to be worth playing. The main issue I find is that when it's rolling it doesn't respond well to Alexa voice commands. Worse, when I ask Alexa for track info for a song that's playing, the response is too quiet to be audible and requires a repeat or tinkering with the volume. So either the music itself is too loud or the interruption -- eg ""Alexa, who is this?"" -- is too quiet. Frustrating. Given this is a relatively new product, it's acceptable but still something I would prefer to have already been resolved. The good news is I had no problems integrating this in my smart switches at home -- lighting, my Dyson air purifier, my alarms, etc. -- and that was a plus. I'd definitely buy this again and have no qualms recommending it to potential buyers. I also like the fact the Alexa app allows users to customize their sonic experience.

Given that I now listen to more music (e.g., Sirius XM integration through Alexa), I wanted a better table top speaker with Alexa.  This one, the Stuido, is much larger and more robust.  If your reason for upgrading is better audio then this is it.  I looked at some of the competitors which are starting to have Alexa integration (like Sonus etc), but on cost/value/integration, this one seemed to be the best.  I can tell you it has quite good bass sound and it can fill the room.  I've read where some folks don't think the higher end is good enough - well, on balance, I think its because the bass response is so good; plus the mid/high end has a series of internal speakers that simulate a surround sound type of experience.  To my knowledge the Studio speakers do NOT sync with another Studio to produce a true one-room directional stereo sound field.  I didn't really want that (if I did I'd get the Sonus).  My unit sits on the kitchen breakfast bar, a bit away from one wall, and it sounds great.  I've not tried it on the floor or a bookshelf - just remember that the speaker self-adjusts to different locations so it will sound a bit different as you move it around - I recall there are instructions on this aspect.  For now, for the price, I think the upgrade is great, cost effective, meets my needs for enhanced audio.  I actually like the squatty charcoal look! Bravo Amazon! Keep it up. Recommended for enhanced audio as an upgrade to the more limited Echoes.",A big step up!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jun 2020,n0nuf2,"Good day Amazon! So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices. I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range. FWIW.",This is NOT the sound you were looking for
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2019,Jazzyguy,"I have experience with a lot of Alexa devices.  I have an echo dot second generation connected to a Samsung soundbar in my living room.  My son has an echo dot connected to a dock with a battery and speaker in his bedroom.  I have an Ensignia Fire TV in my bedroom, a fire TV stick in my livingroom, and even a fire 10HD tablet.  My parents have had an Echo since it first came out. I purchased the Echo Studio to replace the Echo Plus second generation which I had been using for only a few months in my bedroom.  I liked the Echo plus overall, but the soundstage which it created simply was too narrow for my tastes.  I wanted to get a device which would make music sound better in my room, and I really wanted something to connect to my TV to improve its sound. In terms of sound quality, I would go so far as to say that the Studio is impressive.  Out of the box, I feel the sound is a little flat, but just a bit of tweaking of the bass and treble settings fixes this.  As other reviewers have noted:  The bass doesn't quite reach subwoofer frequencies, but it gets close, and it is more than adequate for my application.  In contrast to some of the reviews I have read, I find vocals to be clear, and highs are crisp and can even be piercing when properly configured.  The soundstage is quite wide, even on regular stereo tracks, and even whnen using music services other than Amazon.  Amazon HD music makes the whole thing sound better, and 3D music sounds even better yet.  I'm hopeful that more 3D music will become available in the future. I was disappointed not to be able to configure the Studio with my Fire TV as a home theater setup.  Apparently, the TV which I purchased just this past July doesn't contain a late enough version of the Fire TV, and updating firmware doesn't help.  I really, really don't want to have to purchase a Fire TV stick for my fire TV; that just seems weird. Nevertheless, I did connect my bedroom TV to the Studio with a mini optical to optical cable.  The sound is fantastic, but there is a catch.  If I power off my TV for a half hour or more, then come back and turn it on, I don't get any audio unless I disconnect, then reconnect the audio cable.  This is not a deal breaker, but it is annoying, particularly if I have to get out of bed to do it. Overall, I'm happy with the Echo Studio, but it would be really nice if the optical audio worked better, and it would be nice to have a wireless connectivity option (other than low-quality Bluetooth audio) for my fire TV.  I understand that I shouldn't necessarily expect atmos support from my current TV, but something between Bluetooth stereo and wireless atmos would be nice.","Amazing sound, but some connectivity issues"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Jan 2020,Total Geek,"One month update: I've had the chance to listen to a pair of sonos one sl and I can confidently say there is no comparison.  The sonos are head and shoulders better where it counts: sound quality.  The studio is good and at least $100 cheaper,  but you get what you pay for.  My studio will get moved to a smaller space in the house. The sonos are taking center stage. Yes,  it sounds light years better than any other Amazon device I've heard. Calling it studio quality is a stretch. My biggest problem to date is that this echo device is worse than any other I've had at listening to my commands.  My oldest and cheapest echo dot is far better at hearing and understanding me over ambient noise.  It's a great sounding speaker,  but is it worth $200? I'm still on the fence.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2019,Christabelle Mendoza,I love this speaker it is very easy to play to music but does have some issues. The microphones seems to not detect your voice as well compared to an echo and usually I have to say Alexa a second time for it to recognise the command and that's with it not even playing music . My echo 3rd gen always picked up my Alexa wake word everytime compared to the studio . I don't like how if you put the studio in a group with a firestick to play movies it won't show up as a echo studio by itself in the Spotify app and I have to stream to the group that it is in and it'll pull up the song my firestick as well and I cant do anything on the firestick while I'm playing music to my studio . I wish i would be able to be able to stream to just my studio when I'm on Spotify and not have it show the music on my firestick when it's in a group for home theatre . Other than that the sound quality it great and the price is reasonable.,Good

And this delivers!  As an owner of a 1st gen Echo, 2nd Gen Echo, Echo for Car and Echo Dot, the audio quality has been my only disappointment with the Echo series.  I thought the Echo Sub was overpriced, so the release of the Echo Studio was just what I was waiting for. Now, does this sound as good as an expensive bookshelf stereo system?  No.  But it is much improved with nice bass response and decent enough highs.  The 3D music aspect is really lost on me, but I've heard it is quite impressive.  It is surprisingly large, and the blue ring is difficult to see unless you are standing over it, but that is not a deal killer.  I will say the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as the 2nd gen, so placement is key.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jun 2020,Albert Hall,"I ordered a pair of these speakers and a Fire 4K TV stick for my upstairs TV. And everything you've heard about the sound quality of these speakers is true. Once all three items were paired in the Alexa app the sound was terrific! The problem is that it is only available using the Fire 4K TV stick. I knew that going in, but I didn't realize how limited the Fire 4K TV stick was. It doesn't work well with some of my preferred apps, for example in fast forwarding content it just gets stuck. At the time of this writing some apps like HBO Max simply aren't available. Why am I docking the speakers for limitations of the Fire stick? Because Amazon should have greater support for them outside of its own products. I have several other streamers available to me like the Nvidia Shield that work well with my preferred streaming apps, but there's no way to get the Studio's great sound with them. Sure, you can pair with the streamers via Bluetooth, but only one speaker. The sound is muted and tinny, not any better than my TV's own speakers. It's been a year since the Studio has been out, if Amazon was going to support it with other streamers it would have by now, or at least make the Fire stick work better with apps. This is critical and I may wind up returning the Studios. Right now the only way to get decent sound with all my streaming devices is to use the Studios with the Fire stick and my soundbar with everything else. It's not a good choice.",Great sound -- if you can get it

Now the fun part, if you have the Echo Studio, you have the capability to play HD and some sort of immersive 3D sound audio also...but now you have to also pay for that as well. It’s kinda nuts.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jul 2020,Pablo Freddy Man,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these speakers.  I bought two of them and have them paired up.  So far it has been amazing.  Here's what I love about them: - In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible.  I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good. - I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding - Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore - microphone pickup is outstanding.  even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me - When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster.  Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantly Cons: - I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks.  I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work.  if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work.  playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason.  even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work.  i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios.  so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what?  of course everything works perfectly.  i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker.  with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly. - i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work.  i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers.  i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks.  irritating! - the speakers can be buggy.  sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason.  i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name.  so i changed it to the one I want.  i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names.  but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection.  I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back. Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system.  I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music.  The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music.  But I'm irritated about it.  The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy. So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4.  I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers.  and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds.  my old home theater system never sounded this good. If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos.  But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music.  And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.","Awesome speaker, have them in a pair! Poor spotify integration"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jan 2020,Mack Hicks,I was so looking forward to the Echo Studio - but the Fire Cube (1st gen) and Echo Studio do not work well together.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2020,Huai J. Gong,"You can't find anything that will compare at this price point. I bought one and added a second to make a pair a week later. Yes it will work as a stand alone speaker but it is so much better as a pair. As a powered speaker it is amazing. What happens with powered speakers typically is that if you crank the volume up the built in amplifier clips at loud passages. That means the amp cannot supply enough power to drive the speakers resulting in really bad distortion. I cannot get Studio to get clip. That means they have been engineered with plenty of reserve power. They are rated at 330 watts each but I believe that's very coservative and they handle peak power demand much higher. As stand alone speakers they handle mids and highs very well. Playback of streaming 3D content from Amazon was very good. My 13 yr old son who is not an audiophile(yet), remarked while listening to Shawn Mendes Unplugged in Ultra HD. ""It is like being in the front row"" Are they audiophile grade? No. Why? There is no bass. Frequency response is only down to 50hz. You can hear bass but you cannot feel it. What do I mean? If you have been to a live venue, the drummer steps on the kick drum pedal and a thump hits you in the chest. That's what I am talking about. You need a powered subwoofer to take the setup to the next level. There is the Echo Sub but I cannot recommend it as it has only a 6"" driver. The limits of physics. Bass is all about moving large amounts of air. A 6"" driver only moves 1/4 the amount of air as a 12"" driver. Unfortunately the Studio does not play well with non Echo equipment. Wanting to see how far I could take the Studios, I took a chance and figured out a work around. I bought an Echo Link and hooked it up to a 12"" 1000 watt powered subwoofer. With much difficulty I now have it working with the Studios using a multi-room setup hack. Right now 2 x Studios, Link and a large powered subwoofer is easily producing a listening experience similar to that of using equipment costing thousands of dollars. And you have the added bonus of voice control. If you have the Fire Stick, you can stream Dolby Atmos content to the speakers. Good Dolby Atmos Home theater sound for under $1000. I think Amazon has done an excellent job here. No other audio equipment manufacturer can touch the Studio in terms of value and being able to add to. Sonos, Apple and Google are miles behind.",A unbelievable bargain for the price.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jan 2020,Cabin Builder,"Let's review the good and the bad. In general, we listen to our music at volume 5 or lower (Alexa volume 5). 1. the Studio's sound enhancement is absolutely awful.  We turned that off. 2. the Studio's flat EQ makes it sound almost identical to the standard Echo.  Testing side-by-side and at volume 4 and under, nobody could tell the difference.  at volume 6 you start to hear the difference and higher volumes you start to get the low end of the woofer.  But we never listen to our music that loud.  so not worth it. 3. the Studio's microphone missed so many things that the Echo never misses.  You have to talk louder and closer for it to work. 4. the Studio's music playback doesn't work consistently.  Alexa will be silent for 10 seconds and then say there is an issue.  However, with the Echo we have never had that response (in years). 5. certain Alexa requests don't work.  Alexa repeat - ""there is nothing to repeat""  after pausing...Alexa play ""there is nothing to play"".  Again, we never get this response from the echo.  It always keeps track of the song that was playing. 6.  The Studio needs to be out in the open for it to sound decent.  We tried putting it on a shelf but it sounded muffled. 7.  The Studio is big for what it puts out.  There are better, punchier speakers that are smaller (and less expensive) 8. The Studio doesn't replace the need for a sub.  Which is why I bought it.  I thought it would have a full sound that would negate the need for a sub.  It doesn't, especially at lower volumes. For the price, you can get a sub speaker combo that will be richer in sound.  And at lower volumes, the Echo has nearly identical sound.  No one in our household or that visited was impressed.","Alexa Issues, Bad Mic and Not Better than Echo for Lower Volume Usage"

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Aug 2020,Clinton W. Salvato,"I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test. Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner. Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one. First Impressions: The studio looks and feels to be well built It seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason). The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works.  As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo.  I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on.  I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings.  I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo.  Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse.  Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and  the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change. Other things I've found to share,  Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance.  My advice here is: Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases.  However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance.  So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4.  Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products.  Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range. Bottom Line: The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose.  As always, while the sound is great from this  device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system.  If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.",Solid Performance in a Unique Product
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Sep 2020,C. Brewer,"We bought one Echo Studio to put into our bathroom to replace an older Echo smart speaker. The difference in sound quality and features in the Echo Studio was breathtaking. From the simple setup (just plug it in and open your Alexa app), to easy linking to your phone, or use of Amazon Music, Pandora, and smart home control, this speaker has it all. I'm an audiophile who still listens to vinyl, so I'm picky about how my music sounds, even when I'm in the shower. This speaker DELIVERS on quality sound and easy access to your favorite tunes with just your voice. No need for a separate subwoofer here, the bass in the Echo Studio delivers full, rich sound. The right and left speakers create a full sound stage that puts you into your music. The auto adjustment of the sound quality (done for you at setup, no buttons to push or knobs to turn, or microphones to mess with) for your room size makes a huge difference in the quality of all music, not just 3D audio. If you're looking for a great sounding smart speaker with a built in hub for your home, this should be your first choice. I have used competitor's products in the past (Siri, Google, etc.) but they all pale in comparison to Amazon Alexa when it comes to smart home integration. I can control my lights, my TV, my garage door, my thermostat, my music, and even my washer and dryer all from my Echo Studio smart speaker! And every day, more and more products are integrated into the Amazon Alexa eco-system, far outpacing competitors. You simply can't go wrong with this amazing product. We loved it so much the first day we had our Echo Studio, we ordered another one 24 hours later for our Kitchen!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2019,RBI,"I was expecting so much more from this""Studio"" thing. I waited from 22-Oct and really wanted this to knock it out of the park.  But the midrange and highs are only OK.  Not bad but . . . not great either.  So far the bass response of this unit is lack-luster and far from meeting my expectations.  It's big, it's heavy, and just like my first GF, it didn't put out the kick-ass sound I was looking for.  From a buying perspective,  I would wait for this product to mature a bit before pulling the trigger.  Who knows, possibly a FW update could clear-up the mids & highs, while keeping the presence real and loud?  I'd call this an Amazon ""Fail"" right from launch since so many little things seem to be in an unfinished state.",Not Bad but . . .
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jun 2020,Daniel,"I wanted to replace my smart TV's wired soundbar with a wireless one and decided to give the Echo Studio a try. I bought an Echo Studio and a Fire Stick 4k. The TV/Fire Stick/Echo Studio setup was simple but the truth is the Echo Studio never really worked well. It simply won't stay connected and will go silent after 20 or 30 minutes. One month after the purchase I still haven't been able to watch a whole movie using the Echo Studio. And every time I turn on the TV, I need to use the Alexa app to unpair the Fire Stick and the Echo Studio and set it up again.  But again the connection will never last more than 20 or 30 minutes and I'll have to stop whatever we are watching, open the Alexa app on the phone, unpair the Echo Studio and do the setup again. I have tried factory resetting both the Fire stick and the Echo Studio a few times, but to no avail. I have other Echo devices at home and never had connection problems with them. My WiFi connection is very stable and there are not many other devices connected to it. I called Amazon Tech Support about the problem, again to no avail. The only way I could get the Echo Studio to work with my TV was through an optical cable, which is exactly why I bought the Echo Studio in the first place: to get rid of the wired connection. Bottom line is: I spent $250 to replace my wired soundbar with a wireless one and ended up with a soundbar that will only work when it's wired.",Echo Studio will lose connection all the time.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Oct 2020,MD,"I was buying this Echo Studio for two purposes: 1. For the sound 2. To become my first smart home hub. On the first, it has a promising result. I like the clear sound and decent bass that come up out of it. I have a good size room and it filled the room easily. On the smart hub, Echo Studio is not that great. I connected about 15 switches and lights around the house. I had issues with some of them losing connectivity despite that the Zigbee mesh should cover the entire house. At times, the routines just wont work and I had to restart the Echo to make it work again. The same with the lights and switches that at times work and then just stop working until I restart the Echo Studio. It was annoying since we are not talking about 100 Zigbee devices and just a few of those.","Good speaker, kind of a bad smart hub"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Mar 2020,Riggs Royena,"First and foremost if you are looking for standalone Bluetooth speaker, then the Echo Studio is a must buy. You'll be extremely happy and at 200 dollars its a home run on value and performance. Highly recommended for that aspect. Now if you are using it as a home theater system, that is a whole another story.  Let me first say I was intrigued by the Echo Studio because of the Dolby Atmos, 3D immersive sound, and just the whole complimentary features I would get being a Fire TV Cube 2nd gen user.  First impressions, lets be honest, the Studio is big and ugly. But guys we can get over that, my wife hated the look of it as soon as I brought it into the house. It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio. Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up.  In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly.  The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone.  Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working. Then through out the night we proceed. Flood gates of frustration opens... Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one.  With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner. Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker. Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path.  But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement. Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out. Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary. Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end.  Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube. Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point. The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned. I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I  dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv.  Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need. I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up. I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.",Amazing Speaker Crippled with Deal Breaking Frustrations.

Still I feel I can hear the original Echo much better as I think it has better mids and treble. Yes I went in and adjusted the sounds still no better. Not happy.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2020,Oktyabr,"From an audiophile:  I've been an Alexa user for awhile now and have dots pretty much all over my house.  I caught a sale recently and decided to give the ""Studio"" a go.  Placed in my master bedroom just one of these fills the room with sound (that whole end of the house!) and it's quality stuff too!  The bass, especially, is impressive for such a small woofer (it out thumps my 2.1 desktop system with ease). Is your money spent better elsewhere?  I have a dot in my kitchen plugged into a Bowers & Wilkens A5.  This is a $400 speaker from a very reputable audio company.  The B&W seems to have ""drier"" mids and highs, which may make me think it's slightly ""more accurate"" sounding, but it doesn't have the deep reach at the bass end of the frequencies as the Studio does.  Both are of comparable volume, maxed out, and both are of similar size and weight.  And the B&W costs TWICE as much!  Let's cover this idea for a minute...  Yes, the B&W may present more of an ""audiophile"" sound but if I had to do it again?  I'd take two Studios and pair them over the A5, for the same amount of money! I have a fairly elaborate home theater/music system in the living room that cost about as much as a good used car.  Again, an echo dot acts as a source to feed music through custom built dipoles powered by a stack of amps.  I love my music (and movies) and enjoy spending time in the living room doing just that.  But the Studio in my bedroom keeps me satisfied to the point that my living room time has gone down significantly. Is the Studio perfect?  I think the mids and highs may be rolled off a bit, producing a more ""laid back"" sound.  Some EQ in the Alexa app may adjust it more to your liking, if this sound isn't it.  For me, it's great just the way it came shipped.  The 3D audio is VERY good and while I'm tempted to pair it with a second one, one has proven to satisfy my listening pleasure far more than I expected.  The bass is deep, without sounding muddy or ""booming"", although I wonder if it wouldn't tone that down a bit automagically, if paired with an Echo Sub.  The Alexa implementation is, as you might expect, excellent.  It's fast, responsive, and the mics are plenty sensitive. I'd love to see what Amazon could do with a 5.1 or even 4.1 implementation of this speaker, for a surround sound setup.","Hard to beat this thing, at this price!  From an audiophile"

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,Dopest Nerd on the Block,"Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up. 1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet. 2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy. 3. Looks great 4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus. 5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost. 6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs 7. And having a 5¼""  speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set. I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear. I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD. First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on. 1. Noticably louder 2. Highs more present and crisper 3. Vocals not as muffled I temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio.  With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe""  get smaller and closer to the speaker. The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker. As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues. Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.",Definite audio improvement compared to other echos

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2020,TheFirstMongoose,"Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference. I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case. Brand new out of the box with a static noise and wasn’t offered a new replacement.","Pretty good speaker, bad exchange policy and service."

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Sep 2020,Love-bob,"WOW a very nice super Echo.  More and more of everything you have come to expect in an Echo.  This is our 4th Echo and by far the best one.  Cons - big foot print maybe 3 times the diameter of a regular Echo.  Now the Pros - everything in an echo plus internet control of alexa devices.  And the big new is the Sound is overall many notches above the regular echo.  We tried a small echo dot - these are ok if you want to do some basic alexa things, plus it has a small speaker that is a small speaker.  The regular echo that we have 3 of is really a nice background speaker with access to the amazon play lists, and you can purchase more music options as you might want.  The next echo up the tree is the basic full size echo with the ability to control alexa devices - turn the lights on and similar.  I was an original X10 system user and this setup is just better than X10 but this is not home automation. Echo Studio I purchased after reading a few reviews - my concern would it really kick up the sound a notch or more, not all of the extras included in the device.  WOW it really is an amazing device for sound.  It takes a little bit of time to find itself in a room and optimize to that space.  Take your time and let the device work its magic.  Then listen.  Deeper bass, great mid range and highs I gave this studio to my wife for her use plus gave her one of the echos for her listening area on the screened in porch.  Her only complaint is when am I going to ask for the Studio back.  Super easy setup once you understand you have to install the alexa app on your smart phone.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,Spoon,"So you did the echo dot, and you decided alexa was part of your life now.  So now you want some better speakers?  You played with those Dot docks that sounded horrible.  You were tired of having to turn on a separate set of speakers or dealing with bluetooth dropouts.  You wanted a simple solution that sounds great?  Is this it?  Is it the echo studio?  No... unfortunately not. 1) Alexa integration is great!  as you would expect from a first party amazon product.  This does work just as good as that dot you're replacing. 2) It is a tight and clean package!  Yes it is.  Very easy to setup, and very slick looking on the shelf. 3) The bass is so much better!  Well yes it is.  The bass is better than that echo plus, and certainly better than the echo dot.  That said don't expect much.  I've had a bose wave radio in the past and know what bass can be managed in tiny package.  This is not as efficient.  It is not bad though. 4) The overall sound quality is Audiophile!  No it is not.  It's not bad.  Think sound quality of a mid quality bluetooth speaker.  I do have a JBL charge and the JBl charge does sound better (although it is boomier, it has a more pleasing and ""full"" sound).  I replaced a Echo dot sourcing in a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Mini.  The Zeppelin mini is about the same footprint, but sounds so much better!  But running a Zeppelin mini means i have another remote, and have to turn on the Zeppelin when listening to music and hook up the 3.5 cable.  This is a ""clean"" solution (see point 2). So should you get it?  Honestly it is a great thing.  The speaker will sound great to 95% of the people (as you can see by the reviews).  To my ears they sound pretty ok!  Inoffensive, honestly that's the best praise.  3 stars for music quality, 5 stars for design.  Averaging 4 stars. What needs to happen to get to 5 stars?  Amazon needs to make it easier to make a good alexa product (because the 3rd party ones are not good thus far), or Amazon needs to poach a couple of audiophile speaker designers and have them go at it.  I know this was certified by the dolby guys, but dolby knows how to make theatre systems, not musical speakers.  Maybe some help from the NHT or Bower & Wilkins guys can help.",You want a first party Amazon echo with MUCH better speakers?
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,David W,Update 1/6/2020 I called Amazon Tech support and explained I could not play multi room music with my echo studio.  I think the developer updated the software for this problem or by tech support removing my saved WiFi passwords solved the problem.  I am giving another star to 4 for the fix. The studio sound slightly better than my 1st gen echo and echo sub combination.  I might dabble with playing movies from my 4K Firestick to see how it sounds. The hardware is second to none.  There are some software issue amazon needs to correct in the future.  This unit will only pair with a Echo Sub and another Echo Studio.  I was trying to pair my 1st gen echo my echo studio and echo sub.  It would not pair.  I called tech support and the first guy did not really have a clue.  The second guy was telling me that the software on the 1st gen echo is different from the software on the echo studio.  He advised me this issue might be resolved in the future. When I just paired the echo studio and the echo sub together I was not impressed.  My echo sub and 1st gen echo setup sounded way better.  I put the echo studio in my guess bedroom and it actually sounds better without an echo sub.  Because of the software kinks I can only give it a 3.  Eventually amazon fixes these issues.  The echo studio is still fairly new.  Many time when echo products first launch they have software issues. I have confidence that amazon will fix the kinks.  If this issues bother you I would wait until they are resolved to purchase one.,Great hardware just some software issues that need to be resolved.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jun 2020,Anon,"I don’t consider myself an audiophile but I love good sound. A pair of Studios seemed great value compared to buying a good pair of bookshelf speakers and a decent receiver/amp, or investing in  Sonos or the closed off Homepods. In short, the audio quality is mediocre to my ears and only shines when LOUD. I really wanted to recommend these, but if you want a flexible/high quality audio system, I would look elsewhere. Stereo pairing seems more of an afterthought in the Echo ecosystem, and this limitation is an unacceptable compromise for me. Features Alexa works as expected. Creating a stereo pair is easy. Connecting the pair to the Fire TV 4K is a breeze.  The 3D features are gimmicky in my opinion and didn’t really add anything to the experience. Aesthetically, I was pleasantly surprised. These look good and build seems high quality. My main complaint -- creating a stereo pair does not do what you might expect. Pairing does not unify the two Studios as a single and persistent stereo pair -- it merely tells Alexa that stereo playback is available for limited purposes -- namely, playback from qualifying subscription services or via the Fire TV. Since the stereo pair breaks, you cannot stream music from your phone or the computer from any arbitrary app, and output to  the stereo pair (unless you’ve connected to via the Amazon music app from the phone).  I really hoped the technology would have been implemented in such a way that you can send audio to one and have it work with both in stereo. You cannot bluetooth or wired line in and maintain the stereo pairing. When scanning for available bluetooth devices, you see each speaker individually only and connecting will be mono to a specific speaker. I was aware of this limitation with respect to wired in, but I was disappointed  to learn that bluetooth also breaks the stereo pair. At first, I thought it was user error but learned that this a long requested and ignored feature request across the Echo device line. Stereo pairing works when connecting via Amazon Music from the iPhone. It takes about 10 seconds to connect and there’s a few seconds lag when controlling via the app, but on the whole it’s usable. Stereo pairing works when telling Studio to play music by voice. It’s not perfect. Often it will inexplicably stop playback or reduce volume. Sometimes playback won’t be in stereo and will come from one or the other speaker (noticeably when asking Alexa to play radio stations) -- but on the whole, it works as expected when working within the confines of the limited feature set. I appreciate being able to voice control these speakers, but I cannot recommend these over a more traditional wired hookup connected to an Echo Dot. I am left with the impression that there wasn’t enough thought given to using these as an alternative to dedicated home audio devices. They are not suitable replacements for a wired or wireless stereo system. I understood there was no Airplay or equivalent wifi feature to select the pair as the audio output for a mobile/computer device, and I wrongly assumed these had bluetooth as an alternative. Audio quality Music sounds significantly better in stereo than mono, but even in stereo the quality is just okay. Sound is muddy and they lack detail I would expect at the  price point for two of these. At first I thought one of Studios was broken -- I just couldn’t believe it was so unimpressive given the rave reviews and price point. The Studios start to impress when loud - it does not distort and detail comes alive.  They easily fill my large bedroom, but they are lackluster for ordinary listening volumes. To my ears, the Homepods are far superior for audio quality. I bought these mainly for music but being able to use a pair for TV speakers is a nice bonus if you have a compatible Fire TV.",Stereo pair - underwhelming and feature lacking
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2020,R. Farrow,"It's very interesting how when you set the Stereo Spacial Enhancement button in the Alexa audio settings for the Echo Studio , it sounds like the audio images for the various instruments are spread throughout the room. Apparently it uses micro delays on the five speakers (three mid-range, one tweeter and one woofer, along with two bass ports) to accomplish this effect. There are tiny holes in the top of the unit from which it constantly samples the sound and adjusts the audio image according to the room acoustics. If the unit is placed properly, that is, according to the instructions provided, (like not putting it too close to a wall) the effect is very impressive.  Some people may not like it. They have the option of toggling the Stereo Spacial Enhancement button off. Admittedly, I had to get used to the sound. I'd turn it off and on again for comparison for about a week. I've decided that I definitely prefer it. If you set your volume to at least 6 (volume goes from 1 to 10), you can really appreciate it. It's certainly different, but I love it. I did not like it when used for sound on my TV. It sounded like you were in a movie theater. Very dramatic, but I have only one Echo studio, and it's extremely annoying for the sound to be coming from the side of the TV. You'd need a unit on each side of the TV to have the effect work properly. You can't put such a large unit in front of a TV to center it. If you used a pair of them it would absolutely blow you away. Apart from all that, it's use as an Alexa smart device is just what you'd expect. I have a few Echo devices in my home for smart home use. The Echo Studio is nothing short of excellent in that regard. I'm looking forward to further developments, as they are on going.",Certainly Different
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2020,K. Driehorst,"I was so excited to learn about the Echo Studio and of course, treated myself to one for Christmas.  The sound is indeed 'bigger' than the regular Echo device and it's nice to be able to adjust the bass, mid-range and treble using the Alexa app on my phone.  The pre-set bass tends to garble the rest of the music and reducing the bass,  upping the mid-range and treble helps but it still sounds like it's 'missing' a lot of nuances in the vocals and instrumentals.  Which brings me to my next long standing gripe with the Echo line.... There is no where to plug in head phones so that one can listen quietly!  When I opened the Echo Studio I was excited to see that there was an input jack and I thought I'd be able to plug my headphones in there, but alas, no sound came out of my headphones.  I was hoping that perhaps the music would have greater clarity with the headphones.  In my neighborhood, the homes are very close together and I'd really like to able to listen with headphones, especially late at night without disturbing the neighbors.  When the Echo first came out, this is one of the suggestions I made right away - headphone jack, please!! Anyway, I do like the Echo Studio overall.  One other thing:  While Amazon evidently has some selection of ""3-D"" music, it would be nice to be able to browse those specialty selections or to see where the 3-D music overlaps with my own music preferences.  Thanks for always innovating, Amazon!  Keep up the great work!",Heavy On The Bass
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Aug 2020,3Musketeers,"* Audio quality - solid, tight bass, right size.  Love the ""initial"" audio tuning based on placement of the room.  I am unable to find that option after moving to a new location.  I would have to set it up as new again.  I would have given a 5 star if the BT audio streaming could be on the par as online streaming. * Bluetooth audio streaming issue - I am sure Amazon must have done this on purpose when the algorithm is tuned for Alexa and online streaming.  The BT streaming is still as bad as ever and very low volume.  I am not the only one that complain.  The audio quality is so bad and one has to change the volume to max to get to an average level.  This would cause a major problem when you ask Alexa something or changing to online streaming. It does not cause that much to add a dedicated high quality BT chip.  If you are using an integrated BT wit the Wi-Fi ASIC for onboarding, then just switch to a dedicated BT chip to take advantage of all the efforts done with this speaker.  This is definitely a trade-off Amazon Echo team and management decided.  Too bad... think of it as having a V8 hemi but you limited to only a V4 pinto when comes to BT streaming. Price - right range ID - good Amazon music streaming option - if you do not have premium subscription, it is still limited.  I tend to use Apple music to stream since I have that part of cell phone subscription.","Much better in sound quality, need major improvement on BT streaming!"

I wouldn’t say it beats Sonos though.  I would give it 5 stars if not for the issues around music streaming which it’s designed for.  We have an echo and this studio version on a play group and this speaker stops playing all the time.  There isn’t a clear consistency either.  It’s extremely annoying.  We primarily use Pandora as we like the fact there station selection is the most robust, but it does it with amazon music as well.  For the price the sound quality is fantastic.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Dec 2019,Jay Bowen,"After much anticipation I received my Echo Studio today!! I immediately opened the box and was like a kid at Christmas!! I immediately set it up and moved on to part two, pairing it to my Fire Cube, or so I thought. What seemed, and for all intents and purposes should have been, a simple process required a phone call to tech support. The technician was very helpful and after 10 to 15 minutes had me up and running YYYYAAAAAAYYYYY!!!! And then my elation turned to utter disappointment. The only means of adjusting the volume is by the traditional, Alexa Volume Up, Alexa Volume down. There is no way to control the volume by your TV remote or even a Fire Cube/Stick remote. Who wants to yell out ""Alexa"" while watching a program. How inconvenient, how disappointing, such a shame. This product could be 10 Stars out of 5, but now is just another 3.5 star very good speaker. And it is that, honestly, it is an excellent speaker for everything other than a sound source as a home theater. UPDATE>>>>>>>>>>>>While I agree that the Studio is an excellent speaker, it is useless either alone or with a paired Studio as a surround system for your Firestick or Fire Cube.  There is not enough bass, at all, and it appears that Amazon has discontinued the production of the Echo Sub Woofer, which would have made this a DYNAMIC paring and very easy to use. I have two, and bought them for this exact reason after watching multiple videos on the setup, the sound and the reviews, only to find that Amazon will not producing the Sub any longer.  Now I have two Echo's on steroids that are just for music, and the usual Alexa stuff.  BOOOOOOORING.  I have spent hours researching for a compatible sub and there isn't one and I can't get Amazon to give me any idea if and or when they may ever produce another, or allow an off brand the permission to develop one. Oh, and the volume control was fixed by upgrading the remote.  That works perfectly.  Not enough for another star, but definitely worth letting everyone know",Not recommended as a Home Theater speaker
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Oct 2020,Alexander,"I purchased 2 of these fantastic speakers because I wanted to enjoy the Stereo Home Theater effect they can do. Setup was a bit tricky but calling into the help line took care of it pretty fast. The sound quality is really something to behold. I was able to go into a Best Buy to listen to it and compare it to other smart speakers. The 3D audio was what impressed me the most, even when compared to the Bose 500, especially when you consider the large price difference between them! I do realize however, that most audio, in music or movies, is not in 3D at this time. Even so, there have been a few times the sound effect sounded like it moved to the side or suddenly moved behind me. So, awesome. The voice recognition through the built-in microphones are very good and no matter what part of the room I am in, they seem to hear me clearly almost each and every time. There was one thing I was disappointed in. I have the speakers connected to my Fire Stick 4K and was hoping the Alexa assistant in the speakers themselves would have been able to do each and every function the remote control was able to do, but it cannot. I was hoping to never need the Fire Stick remote but certain functions such as, TV input changing, are not available. I added the Samuel Jackson voice to the speakers and totally love it. While not for everyone, I find the humor and more, ""adult"" conversation to be a definite improvement to the voice control. I'm hoping it will be expanded to give it all the same controls the Alexa voice has. Overall, I am very happy with these smart speakers and plan to add the sub woofer very soon.",Great speakers with very few issues

Not only was it not booming I was barely able to hear it.  The built in TV speakers had louder volume than this thing did even when I turned it to max volume.  I have no problem with the ""quality"" of the sound just the lack of loudness.  I'm old school.  I want Top Gun the floor shaking volume.  Oh, and to make matters worse the words were out of sync with the mouths moving on the screen.  It's like it had some sort of bluetooth delay.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,David A.,"So I was very excited to get the new Echo Studio as a Father's Day gift this year.  I've been watching them and reading about them since they were first introduced and thought it would be a great addition to my Alexa Family.  Well, I guess I was wrong and I'm pretty disappointed, particularly with the sound quality. I love my music and frequently switch between Amazon Music, Pandora and Spotify.  My primary speaker until the studio was a 3rd gen echo which really sounded great.  I created a group with the smaller echo spots in my various locations within my open floor plan.  It really sounded good, especially the 3rd gen echo which had a surprising low punch and crisp midrange. So along comes the studio with its room filling 3 D sound and well, it just sounds like crap.  My 3rd gen echo sounds so much better.  What gives?  I've done the room calibration and tried different locations but it just sounds flat and one dimensional.  The bass is muddy and the midrange is washed out. Snare drums sound like me tapping my fingers on a table.  I'm underwhelmed. Setup was aggravating too.  There is no way to recalibrate the sound other than doing a hard reset and starting all over again.  Setting up a speaker group was frustratingly difficult.  I had to delete all my groups and start over rather than adding the studio to an existing group. Setting up the free included Philips Hue bulb was way more complicated than it should have been too.  I just can't wait to tackle the dimmer switches I bought too. On the plus side, its a very sturdy door stop. I should have just asked for the Sonos....",I really wanted to like this but.... I'm very disappointed and woefully underwhemed.

Let's just say this has got to be one of the most obscene songs I have ever heard.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Sep 2020,Travis Day,"I bought these thinking I'd use them in my living room as do all speakers that connect to my TV, and listen to music.  When I found out they could be paired together, I actually bought two thinking the 3D sound would be awesome in stereo. First things first, these things are big and heavy.  My wife wasn't a fan of how large they looked on our entertainment stand, but I wanted to give them a chance.  They're 10 pounds, they've got to have great sound, right? Conceptually this is cool, the speaker will adjust itself to the room it is in for the best quality of sound, PERFECT!  That said, I'm not an audiophile and I didn't notice any difference in sound when I moved it around, which might be the point. The speaker itself sounds pretty good, if you really want to turn your music up and feel it though, this probably isn't the one for you.  The bass was okay, the sound was good, but I was expecting a serious sound system to rival the sound bar I already had.  It fell short in that respect. Now for the main reason I returned them, these aren't cheap, so my expectation was that they would work with my FireTV stick.  They did, sometimes, and sometimes, they wouldn't connect at all, or the remote couldn't control the volume.  Having to reconnect them multiple times in the first week was a pain, having the volume not work and having to tell alexa to turn up or down sucked.  I didn't want to give up though so I bought a optical audio to 3.5mm cord to see if that would work better... oops, you need an optical out to optical 3.5mm cable; wait a few more days and plug it in.  Awesome, it's working with the cable, but the volume can only be controlled by talking to Alexa, not ideal when watching TV.  Oh, and if you use the cable, they don't connect as a pair, you can only listen through one speaker.  Enough was enough, I wasn't going to keep something that was this expensive and didn't do what I needed it to, I had to return them. That said, if you're using this to replace a standalone alexa speaker and you want something with better sound.  I think this is a great unit, you can pair it with others(which you can do with any amazon devices) and have some really good (not great) sound.","Good, but some flaws - had to return"

I switched from Amazon Unlimited to Unlimited HDand it seems to really boost the clarity with some separation noticeable. Can see why many consumers have wanted to pair it with another one for true stereo & immersive sound.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Sep 2020,Dominic Rubino,"Bottom line: if you want a high quality speaker with Alexa built in this is a great choice. This is my first smart home device and I'm am very pleased with it. The sound quality is superb. I am particularly impressed by the rich resonate bass it puts out given its size. I think the sound quality is worth the money alone so the 3D features are a nice bonus. Note if the 3D functionality is a major selling point for you there are currently limited songs remastered in 3D (although 3d is catching on and growing), especially if your music service of choice is not Amazon. However, I do think the speaker reacts with video streaming services to mimic surround sound or even 3d if available. I also think the speaker does a bit of the 3d effect for non-3d music. For me this device has been a great addition to my bedroom. It fills the room with high quality sound, it's plenty loud (I rarely ever turn it up past 4 out of 10), and it gives me the full functionality of alexa. Its particularly nice while I'm working from home to simply ask alexa to play a playlist or podcast and not have to open any apps or turn on any speakers, just instant high quality sound. This speaker would do very well in a living room as well (or really anywhere you want high quality sound with Alexa functionality). This speaker provides the volume capacity and quality to serve as the sound system for your entertainment center. Keep in mind its best to have it in a central location for this purpose or if you've got the money, there's a special functionality to link to a second one for improved stereo and 3d effects. I imagine two of the bad boys linked up would far surpass the audio of any soundbar!","Great sound, great functionality"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2020,Rick James Bish,"I consider myself an ""amateur audiophile"" if that makes sense. I listen for subtle differences in the quality of same source music being played on different devices. To me the Alexa Studio is just another speaker. I do not find that it excels at anything. I have Amazon's HD Music and I found the 3D audio to be odd. It almost seemed to degrade overall sound quality in trade-off  for trying to wow you with sound split between all its speakers. I tried it in several rooms with 3D songs from Amazon and at no point did I feel like the sound was around me. I had my wife walk me into the room blind folded after she randomly placed the Studio and had a 3D song playing. I turned in a circle several times and was able to point directly at the Studios location. To me that says it all. It makes sense really. You take a surround sound system calibration. It uses a mic placed at thr listeners location. It tests each speaker multiple times. The Studio uses its own mics, which are obviously not at the listeners location. At best it will be able to adjust sound for the acoustics of the room but its not going to be able to magically configure 3D sound. Also after initial calibration, it seamlessly calibrates itself when it is moved from room to room. Dont get me wrong. The speaker sounds good, especially when listening to HD and Ultra HD, but this 3D audio is a gimmick.",Did not measure up. Less than wowed.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,M-M,"5 stars for Amazon on service, but there is a software update needed to deal with audio delay. I use this as a secondary speaker to an Amazon Link. The link connects to my home theatre system. The link presumably is slower than this speaker as the signal comes from a dot goes to the link, than to home set. So there is a horrendous audio delay, as if your on a big event and you hear the echo. There should be a slider somewhere in the software to delay one of the speaker until it all sounds fine, but it doesn’t work. Amazon support said they could not fix the problem on their own set up after testing my problem and said to wait for an update of the software. Until that day comes this just doesn’t work for me.

This review is about 4 weeks in. The Pros- The hardware is excellent. The sound is excellent 3d and HD sounds is excellent the Subwoofer does a great job The audible channels present make so many different sounds crystal clear to pick out among the many sounds. Our car has a really good stereo + speaker set up that takes listening to music to a whole new level, this addition to our home means we don't have to go drive around tthe block to really enjoy high quality audio. (I know there are tons of options for people to get much better sound, but typically at a much higher price point and much longer set up time and technical know how. This . . .you plug it up and go. For a piece of all in one gear with smart features this is excellent The Cons - There is no remote with the awesome magnetic holder (Why aren;t these included anymore? why are they hard to buy from Amazon?) The  volume equalization between songs is poor, one song at volume 3 is loud and pumping another has to be at 7. (For a smart device and paid service -Amazon music Unlimited, this is a shame.) The volume equalization between the playing audio and the voice feedback is poor. A song is pumping at 3 and the Echo/Alexa voice is inaudible. For the price it is an excellent buy. With Amazon music unlimited there is access to lots of HD and ""3d"" songs. This is great, but the volume issue make it annoying to have to bump up and down volume for every song. it might be nice to separate the basic vlume and hte voice feedback volume so the voice could be a static value all the time. Hopefully Amazon can figure out the volume issues with updates to their services.","Great hardware and great quality! (Volume from song to song is not balanced :(, no remote)"

When I set it up, I was VERY surprised at the amount of sound emanating from this device. About a week later, I decided to see if all the speakers that were actually there were actually working. I put my ear close to each, and all were working except the top speaker. That wasn't a good look. I contacted Amazon and that's a whole NOTHER story. Hopefully, the SECOND representative that I spoke with placed everything in order and I will receive a replacement once more are in from the manufacturer. Suggestion to Amazon. If a product's price is sliced by $50.00, and you know this in advance to Prime Day, think about ordering MORE from the manufacturer in anticipation of items selling out. If it weren't for that little 'gem.' I would have no issues with receiving a replacement in December. Yep, December, I ordered this in September, and because of Prime Day, a replacement won't be available until December. It'll be well worth the wait because if this thing sounds great with FOUR speakers, just imagine all FIVE working. Amazon, y'all gotta do better with the anticipation thing and some of your reps.

Bad move on Amazon's part I don't understand why you couldn't put the lights on the side of the device like the other echo devices all have. Just saying that's my one complaint with it. Everything else is amazing the mic is amazing it hears you while it's blasting music, and it gets ridiciously loud and sounds good thanks to its 5 speakers inside of the thing. I hear people comparing this to a homepod or a sonos and I don't even know how there is a comparison this thing is $150 bucks on sale or regularly $200 it's worth every dollar even at $200.

Setup was easy, just like setting up an Echo Dot, no problem. Music sounds fine. Singing voices are crisp and the bass can only be described as powerful. Even though music is playing, Alexa can hear commands, I don’t have to shout at all. Update: I’ve had the Studio for a few weeks now and it has developed a problem. It received a software upgrade a few days ago, and now, after playing a number of songs, it randomly starts making a loud unpleasant kind of burbling sound. If I say “Alexa, skip” it goes to the next song and plays properly. Then, some songs later, it burbles again. It is not any particular song file, and a song that made the noise will play properly if I say, “Alexa, play ‘song name’”. Amazon support is really nice, but apparently I am the only customer that has reported this. Of course, if they replace it, I will receive a refurbished unit; when I spent this kind of money a few weeks ago, I don’t want refurbished. They say they will escalate my problem to an engineer, so I will keep it for a while, but if they can’t fix it, back it goes. (I still really like the great sound quality when it isn’t burbling.)

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Oct 2020,Jeff Helmes,"Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly. However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day... At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail. Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches. No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability. Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.","Studio is a stretch, but certainly the best sounding Alexa device."
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2020,Jose Hernandez,"I bought this Echo Studio from Best Buy last month because they happened to have a really good sale (loss-leader, maybe?) that included a free Amazon Echo Show 5 and Phillips Hue lightbulb.  At the time it was a better deal than what AMZN had to offer.  I got it to enhance the sound in my study where I already have a Logitech Z625 speaker system connected to my high-end laptop.  I thought it would provide better sound for when I was on a treadmill or rower vs my Logitech Z625 system.  It does provide good sound -- better overall than the Z625 -- if you don't mind losing out on bass.  The highs and mid-ranges are much better than the Logitech, but it really is lacking in bass.  I wish there was a way to combine the two systems (OK, there probably is...I'll try to figure out a cable of some sort or splitter so they both get inputs from the laptop) so that I could have a good balance of bass and mid- to high-frequency sounds.  If you're looking for ""crisp"" sounds and great Alexa integration but don't mind poor bass response, then the Echo Studio is for you.  It's great for a party atmosphere and high volume, just not good if you want to truly experience a well-balanced, high volume, sound.",It's great if you don't mind lack of bass
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 May 2020,Angela F.,"I love the Echo product line! The speaker is phenomenal and sound quality is perfect. The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is because even with a brand new smart TV with Alexa integration, every time I turn the TV on I have to manually connect the speaker with the TV. And if you don’t have a smart TV, you have to use the auxiliary/optical port which every time you use the voice recognition feature for Amazon Alexa, it mutes the line in and you can’t get it undone unless you unplug the audio cable and plug it back in.",Great with an Alexa-capable TV!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Nov 2020,G. Mauldin,"I will start with the cons. Home Theatre, I can't tell Alexa to turn off, I only can un pair in the app. When listening to the tv/home theatre, the sound drops completely if my wife is talking to Alexa in another room, perhaps hearing her through the wall. Yet while using home theatre she often doesn't hear me as if I'm drowned out by the audio she's producing, when she does hear me all TV audio is dropped while listening. If I pause the video the sound isn't in sink for 30 to 50 seconds on resuming, it gradually catches up.  Announcing the studio is bluetooth paired when I turn my computer on too early in the morning to be making noise.  Much of this can be fixed with Amazon programming so get to work people. Pros- Seems like a great centerpiece for the smart home. One studio unit but home theatre sounds good but not 5.1 good. Fantastic sound, the bass is so solid and clear without being excessive, makes me want to stereo a pair while tossing my old fashioned high quality components. Love having it play music from my home computer. The bonus 2 light bulbs work perfectly with the built in zigbee unit and with some struggles I eliminated a sengled unit for the bulbs I was using already.",Mostly fantastic
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Sep 2020,Rob Blackwell,"The Echo Studio is like my new best friend. I can't say much about the 3D audio--it feels gimmicky to me--but that's not the reason to buy this speaker. It just sounds so much better than the other Echos. I had a 2nd generation Echo in my kitchen, and I set the Studio up in the living room. I hooked them up to play songs at the same time. Walking from the kitchen into the living room was a whole other world of sound. You can feel the thrum of the bass and the lower notes. In a single word, it sounds terrific-- so good I'm considering replacing all my Echo devices with Studios. That may be taking things too far--the Studio is a rather big device, be warned--but the sound is so amazing I miss it when I'm in other rooms. Definitely consider the Studio in lieu of the more expensive offerings from Sonos or Bose. As far as I'm concerned, this speaker can't sound any better, and integration with Alexa is top-notch. Plus, you can form music groups so that multiple Echo devices can play your music together. I love this functionality and use it all the time. Overall, if you're looking for a great smart speaker, the Studio is amazing. You'll be happy you bought it.",A terrific speaker
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Mar 2020,Mr. A. McMillan,"In just two weeks I went from a free echo 3rd generation dot (with a Sirius subscription), to two more dots, a echo 3rd generation,  and now the echo studio since Best Buy and Amazon had a one day sale.  My entire condo is now a symphony hall and I've been in heaven ever since.  Each echo does its job as promised and because you get what you pay for,  each upgrade of echo produces higher quality sounding music.  The echo studio has a 3.5 mm line in, so I was able to connect my 18 year old Panasonic plasma tv with deteriorating speakers into the echo studio and the sound is incredible.  I can also use the same line in to connect to my high resolution audio portable music player (which I use at the gym) and hear lossless quality sound from the echo studio...and...tell Alexa to ""play the music everywhere "" so all my echoes produce music throughout my home.  I don't ask Alexa many questions but I'm just 100% satisfied with my home being a symphony hall.  I hope all my echoes hold up over time,  but I'm content knowing I have great value for what I paid for.  My first echo dot is connected to my home theater in my living room,  my other dot is in the kitchen on the wall in a echo holder, my echo 3rd generation is in the guest bedroom and my echo studio is in my master bedroom where my older plasma TV is on the wall.  With music coming at me from everywhere,  my entire condo sounds like stereo in every room.  I gave one of my echo dots to my 85 year old neighbor that lives alone,  so if she falls, she can tell Alexa to call me and talk to me and I can be there for her right away.",My home is now a symphony hall with all my echoes

I recently bought the Echo Studio to replace a 20 year old TV speaker on our old Vizio Plasma TV. Unfortunately for the Echo Studio, the 20 year old internal sound bar sounds better than the Echo Studio. I am not impressed for $199 or even $169.  I am trying to decide if I should keep it or return it.  I will probably keep since the voice recognition in the E Studio is very good.  Its really only an sub par average speaker.  It does appear that older speaker tech was and is much better than many new speaker.  Speaker is a 2 and voice recognition is a 4, so an average of 3.

It is the main area where we listen to music in our house and I wanted something that could produce decent sound quality with range.  This is where the Echo Studio comes in and excels.  The rest of it's Alexa capabilities are just like any of the other Echos that I have used and works well.  It's microphones and ability to pick up requests has improved over the original Echo, but that's not what I bought it for.  It's speakers is where it really shines.  I use it to play music from Pandora, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.  There are notes and instruments in songs I have never heard before on other speakers, which goes to show how well this thing performs. The product is well built and has some heft to it.  It's base has a non-slip material to it, so it does stay in place.  The activity ring on the top is not as visible when lit as the other Echo units, which is a bit of a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, it makes it a little more difficult to see when it is listening/responding to you.  On the other hand, it doesn't distract you when you catch it lighting up out of the corner of your eye or late at night. I haven't tried the 3D audio capabilities, so I don't have much to say about that.

I like the sound balancing it does when placed into a new room, it seems to really affect the sound quality. Even moving it in the same room changed the output levels that seemed to really enhance the quality of the sound. I will say I was shocked at how large and heavy the Studio was. I don't know if I just didn't read the description that well or look at the pictures closely, but I was anticipating something a lot closer to my echo and got a much larger device.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Sep 2020,gr8shopper,"Sound is excellent!! I did not think that I needed an echo until I bought my first Echo dot. As a Prime member, I figured I could at least listen to music throughout the house. Alexa has become a member of the family. In one year, I now have 3 Echo dots, 2 Echo Show 8 (one was gifted to my mom), 1 Echo Show 5, 1 Echo Original, and now the Echo Studio. By far the Echo Studio has the best sound quality, especially for larger spaces and outdoors. I plan to use the Studio for Outdoor movie nights with a portable projector. The only con that I have is I have not figured out how to ""synchronize"" my Echoes. The Studio and Echo Show sometimes get confused. I use the Show in the Kitchen Area and the Studio is in the Family Space near the TV. Overall I love the whole Echo Family. I live with a disability that causes chronic fatigue and severe shortness of breath. I am able to communicate with my kids using my Echo without having to over exert myself. We organize our shopping list on the Echo. Then use the Alexa app to retrieve the list while at the store. The Echo connects to my Chevrolet vehicle which is not just convenient but also really cool. LOL. The Echo Show 5 entertains my tween daughter and her friends with music and videos. My teenage son uses the Echo when he works out. His only complaint is that it is not wireless.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jun 2020,Tracii Kunkel,"I've been on the fence about trying one of these since they were announced, but finally took advantage of the sale and thought maybe it could be a nice replacement for my home theater sound. Well, setup was nice and easy, and the demo sounded great. Although I did note that in order to REALLY get the effect you have to have it center screen.  Which means if I keep this I'm going to have to raise my television a few more inches so this behemoth doesn't get in the way. But I would do that...if it worked. I've had it 3 days, used it 2, had to reset it and set it back up at least 7 times so far. Most because I have 2 wifi connections in my home (one for me and one for guests), and although I set this up with the main one and NEVER gave it the password for the guest wifi, it's already in Amazon so it kept switching over. And there is no way in the app or anywhere else to change wifi connections without wiping it and starting over fresh.  This happened even after I went in and told Amazon to forget the guest wifi altogether.  It's also just come disconnected from the Echo Cube randomly, resulting in having to go into the app and unpair and repair the home theater setup.  I haven't made it through a single movie yet without it having to be reset.  Sound is great, as long as you have it centered. The home theater is great - when it works. Also disappointed that it won't work with my other echos, but I just wish I could get it to stay consistently connected to the Echo Cube.",So frustrating...
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jul 2020,skitch,"I was excited about the hype behind the Echo Studio and the technology looked great.  But for me it was a bit disappointing sound wise from what I was expecting.  The sound separation was not as good as just a simple left end right speaker set up.  The bass at set levels was lacking so I needed to adjust that in the app.  Even with the Ultra HD Amazon music songs and Dolby Atmos movies, there wasn't a lot of blow you away-ism. A bothersome thing was that in the app they have a setting to pair the Echo Studio with a remote.  I thought this would be very helpful because I have an Echo Show 8 next to were I sit and to voice activate the Studio with the remote would save some ""alexa"" confusion.  Also it would be good to use the volume controls on the remote for the speaker.  After many tries to pair a new remote.  I could not get it to work.  So I called Amazon support.  They told me that I could not use the 4K remote and to use any remote the Studio could not be pairs with any other group or Echo devices because it uses bluetooth and only one blurtooth could be paired at at a time.  So to use a remote and have it also used with Fire TV was not possible.  I was told even a remote from just an Echo 1st or 2nd gen would not work.

The sound quality is not on par with ""dumb"" standard wired speakers like my NHT 2.1 that requires separate amplification. Still, the sound is the best of the smart speakers, definitely better than the original Echo Dot, the original Echo and the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, all of which I currently own. One negative: The Alexa app doesn't walk you through syncing with your TV even if it's already connected to a Fire TV Cube, as mine is. I did a chat with support and got connected to the cube, but it still didn't sync with a fairly new Sony TV. So I grabbed a second device to search for how to do that and eventually that worked. The Echo Plus has pretty darn good sound for a device that has a much smaller footprint and heft but the Studio's size gives it better bass and maybe a tad more richness.

At full volume it has the punch I wanted to jam out and the sound is a hi fidelity sound.  One thing to be aware of the default sound setting is the 3D space sound and unless specifically listening to this type of music will probably want to turn off the 3D space sound using Alexa App.  At least that was my preference anyway.  If you buy these don't review or judge until you've played around with 3D sound setting. Also, like the equalizer options to adjust.  Stereo pairing was easy and works great. Have already had a couple neighbors over to listen and the 'wow' reaction is fun to see. These speakers also have the ability to stream the hi fidelity larger file sizes that Amazon offers at an extra price.  I'm currently trying out this feature.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Aug 2020,Gil,I don't know how you can beat the sound of a stereo pair of Echo Studio's for the money.  I ordered 2 and have mine set up as a stereo pair. Will they fill up a large room at concert volume? No but for a smaller room/apartment or for a whole house or secondary system they are amazing.  I don't have them paired with a Fire TV so can't speak to that but my wife and I listen to them by streaming Amazon Music HD and I really do hear things in songs particularly on the high end I've never heard before.  They are so good you tell the difference between an HD stream and an MP3 service.  I don't consider myself a true audiophile but I do spend a lot of money on 2 channel and home theatre gear and I'm very impressed with the sound of these speakers.  I had them set up in under 10 minutes.  The Echo Sub is sold out and not available at the time of this review but I have pre-ordered it and I'm really looking forward to adding it to the speaker group. Note to Amazon: You have a great product here.  I would suggest making a larger scale version of these - say 1.5 or 2 times the size for people who want to fill up a bigger space.  I'd gladly pay more for something like that.,Stereo Pair of Echo Studios Sound Amazing

And once you sync up, it is a pain in the butt to un sync it and reconnect which doesn’t always repair the problem. By itself, a great device.

I’m pretty deep in both amazon and apple products for many years now. And I’m a bit of an audiophile. I don’t have speakers like these in my house but I wanted to set up a hub to control lights etc. in my apartment so two birds is what I thought. Especially since I don’t want to have a full blown sound system in my small apartment. I’ve had the older generation Echo dot and it sounded terrible. I ordered this Studio when it first came to market expecting an upgrade but was pretty disappointed. It’s rather flat sounding in my opinion hence the mediocre review. I really should have returned it. In any event, I am giving away my old Dot after receiving the new generation Echo yesterday. At a hundred bucks it sounds better than the Studio. So now I have the new Echo in my bedroom and Studio in living room. Both handle voice commands well. But I’d recommend the new Echo over the Studio. The sound is open and airy. Highs are crisp and the bass is punchy in a smaller footprint. The sound on the Studio is just blah. Everything else works fine so 3 stars.",I would choose the new Echo over this.

I also think they look pretty cool, although my wife disagrees. The bad: The price is much too high for what you get. The sound quality is good, but for $200 I expect something that sounds much better, cleaner, and with more depth. The ""Alexa"" smart assistant feature is terrible. It can barely hear me and often requires me to repeat a command 3 or so times (which is much worse than even my original (beta) Echo v1. These things are huge (about the size of a volleyball) and are difficult to place around the home, especially when paired with another Echo Studio and an Echo Sub. I really expected much better, richer sound quality for the price. Considering what you can get for the cost of two Echo Studios and an Echo Sub in the traditional speaker market, I'm pretty disappointed with the sound quality, and I'm not even an Audiophile. Finally, it doesn't look like you can use these as TV speakers unless you have one of the newer Amazon Fire TV devices. I expected these to play sound for my TV, including my Roku, PS4, and other video devices, even if that was limited to stereo quality sound, but these lack that capability apparently.",Not polished enough for the price
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 May 2020,Frederick Dunne,"The speaker is as expected. I had to move it around a bit an re-calibrate it a few times. If you are in the same boat, hold down the action button, it will go into setup mode, showing an orange ring. DON'T let go of the button and keep holding it down beyond this for a wee bit more. It will then kick of the whole process of starting up as it did the first time and do the wall bouncing thingy. Anyways, my gripe is not the speaker but the bulb that came packaged with the purchase. I already got a Philips hue bulb in a previous Echo purchase and that works fine.  No need for a Philips hue hub, just the built in zigbee hub that the Echo plus (which I have) or this Echo Studio has. However, this bulb does require a Philips hue hub. What numb nuts is not paying attention to this in Amazon when they put these items for sale as a package? Why not the Philips hue bulb that works with a zigbee hub that the Echo you are purchasing has built into it? Other than that, the speaker works as expected.  I do prefer to turn off the 'Stereo Spatial Enhancement' under the audio settings for the Echo Studio in the Alexa app under 'Audio settings'.",The Philips hue bulb that it comes with does not work with the zigbee hub that the Studio has.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Aug 2020,Robbie Cooper,"I was actually looking for ways to improve the sound on my TV and saw a promo of the Studio. I went ahead and order one and got it quickly, set it up in my master and played around with it. I have Amazon Music, played some of their 3D demo music and was sold on Rocket Man. Immediately upgraded to Prime 3D Music. Connected it to the TV and pulled up Blade Runner 2049, Thor Dark World and Avengers EndGame and on a single Studio was wowed by the sound filling my master. So withing days, I order a second Studio and upon arrival, moved both into our family room and now have it fully integrated with our large TV. That room has 26 foot ceilings and opens to several other rooms but the sound reached everywhere. It also sets up with left and right speakers and you can hear some really crazy subtle noises that I don't even remember hearing in the theater. I now stream every app I can through the Fire Stick (get with the program on HBO Max, Amazon!!!) As for just music, the bass can be a bit overwhelming and there is not a lot of control in the equalizer on the Alexa app. I don't claim to be an audiophile but I own thousands of songs via iTunes and know good v great sound quality. Amazon is better than good and on most songs, especially those that are in 3D, the quality is pretty fantastic. But I also really like heavy metal and given drums and bass dominance in bands like Tool, the really deep tones can be a little overwhelming. But Tool also has tracks in 3D and the nuances that sneak through the heavy bass are really interesting. On more pop or pop rock music, it's not as prevalent and really quite enjoyable. We'll see if I can survive the holiday season streaming my wife's Christmas music. If you subscribe to Amazon Music, I recommend pairing this with a TV whether you intend to use it for a sound system or not. With Fire TV, the remote syncs to the Studio and controls TV and speakers. It makes access to the music catalog and all of their HD and Ultra HD quality music fairly simple. There could be some improvements like better access to genres and then sub sections within but overall a decent way to get artists or albums to play. They also have quite a few playlists pre-created, some of which are pretty good. Overall, for $400 to get 2 Studio's and a couple more Hue lights, I can't think of a better way to get a serious TV sound improvement (that really will rattle the rafters) and a much better than good smart speaker.","Very good sound, excellent Fire TV integration and audio"

The audio is great compared to all other Echo devices. The home theater feature is technically very exciting and connects seamlessly with the fire TV, too bad that sometimes audio skips and with some apps the audio is a few milliseconds delayed. The audio skipping made the feature unusable for movies. When you have this feature on if you play music say from Spotify, that also turns your TV on and plays Spotify from your fire TV. This is also unreliable as sometimes the fire tv doesn’t actually turn on OR it turns on but it doesn’t open the app. We even went to buy an optical cable and this also has two different issues a) you can only change the volume with your voice and b) audio is ALSO unreliable is it sometimes suddenly completely mutes and you have to unplug the cable and when you turn te TV or program off you get some sort of residual audio.

If this is Amazon's attempt at decent sound, they have quite a way to go.  The mid-range sound on these is very muddy.  This is not high- fidelity quality.  It's OK for what it is, and the stereo arrangement is sufferable.  Hooking up just one, however,  was not adequate for my background ""easy listening"" purposes.

The setup was effortless as it recognized my network and added itself via the app.  To my disappointment, I immediately realized that the mid and upper range was directional.  The speaker was in a central location on top of a kitchen counter almost in the middle of a large open space (kitchen, den, and dining areas).  When I walked around the unit the sound was not uniform.  For a few hours, I contemplated returning it, then I moved the studio to a corner of my 11"" x 29"" enclosed lanai with the unit supported about a foot off of the floor.  What a difference!  Now I love it!  The bass is so much deeper than the Echo 3rd gen and voices sound more lifelike.  Where you place this unit matters.  When you find the right spot, the sound quality is wonderful.

As with most Alexa products, set up is simple and intuitive. It really is just a large plump Echo, but upgraded.  The voice recognition, is tremendous. It sounds amazing, and it is sleek in design. What I don't like, is I feel that it could be louder. It is loud.. it was difficult for my son and I to converse, while it was set at 8. It's loud enough honestly, but you know....Americans. I also suppose that the device, while a speaker, is also an Echo, so it needs to be able to monitor its wake word (privacy issues aside). Regardless, it sounds boss in my living room. but in my living room it's still loud. I get that there are alternative speakers, with Alexa integration, on the market that are louder, but I've drank the Echo Kool-aid and am invested. The other thing I don't like, which is vexing, is the inability to use this as a Surround Sound/Home Theater option. ***evidently you can use it in this mode, but only if you are using a more current generation Fire Stick*** I tried to pair it with my Samsung 8 Series, but no dice. Im not an expert, so if someone knows, bring it. Let me close by saying this, I hated this product so much that now I have Two Studios, Two Echo Show 5s, and Two Phillips Light Bulbs.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2020,VHV,"As a sound designer, I spend a lot of time in front of high -end studio monitors. Can echo studio match them? Of course not, but then again, that is not the point (besides being economically impossible). The point is accurate reproduction of a mix, and this device does the job in a very pleasant and unassuming way. With six inch woofer and smartly positioned tweeters, it almost manages to create a stereo image while covering a full spectrum of frequency response. I would expect that paired with another echo studio it could sound better (and more accurate) than many low end, smaller studio monitors, and certainly better than “multimedia” monitors like Mackie CR series etc. The reason for this, besides pretty smart and good engineering, is a built in “room correction” that measures frequency response of your room and adapts echo’s output accordingly. In professional audio, we pay a lot of money for this kind of calibration, and here you get it as if it were nothing. All in all, for the price, this product is pretty amazing.",Pretty amazing device

I have an Amazon Echo and have been happy with its performance since I purchased it several years ago.  However the sound quality and sometimes the voice recognition was not the best.  It was located in a large open area that includes a large kitchen and living area.  The Amazon Echo Studio now occupies that space and eradicates the issues I had with the smaller Amazon echo.  Voice recognition is exceptional.  I can in a normal tone and volume instruct the Amazon Studio from another room and always get the correct response.  And the sound is extraordinary for a single speaker unit.  I do not have the time to listen to a lot of music, but when I do the sounds from the Echo Studio are excellent.  Aesthetically the unit fits the décor of my living area perfectly.  The Echo Studio flawlessly connected to all my in house devices and makes life much easier for me.

But the Bose shuts off after 30 minutes and you need to really point the controller in the right way to start it up again, so the Bose got exiled into my office. But the Bose had much better sound. I expected more from the Studio, but it is nice and much better than the Echo, which sits sadly on the kitchen counter. I had to call customer support to get it up and running. I like the fact that the Studio permits me to include it in multi-room audio as well as use it as a ""Home Theater"" (which it is not). Anyway, it is way better than the Echo and serves for TV sound output, but I don't get the nice stereo sound of jets flying across the living room as one would wish. I am considering adding a second Studio to connect in stereo, but that could end in divorce. Does anyone have experience using 2 Studios for stereo?

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2020,Nick,"I started with an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and an Echo Input (connected to my stereo receiver).  I have since added 2 more Echo Dots, an Echo Flex with Motion Sensor, and now the Echo Studio.  The Echo Studio was very easy to setup, looks beautiful, and fills our living room with nice sound.  My one complaint is the microphone doesn't seem to hear commands very well.  Our Echo Dot upstairs will often pickup commands said downstairs, but the Echo Studio seems to have trouble hearing commands said in the same room.  The only other feature I wish it had was Apple Airplay 2. I created a speaker group with the Studio and Echo Input so that I can play music ""downstairs"" in multiple rooms.  I also created a routine that will turn off all music on all Echo devices, cause sometimes Alexa just gets confused and starts playing out of the wrong device.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2020,MattInLAX,"The Echo Plus is a fairly ""bass"" heavy speaker.  Like lots of its competitors, they emphasize bass, so you think you're getting great sound from a small speaker.  The Studio certainly has an impressive woofer, but it delivers a much more even range across the spectrum of the music being played.  So that should be great, right?  Well, that depends on what you're playing.  If you ask Alexa to play ""best of 3D Music"" (which Amazon will keep reminding you to do) - OMG - it's fantastic.  But then check on the price of a subscription to 3D Music, and not so fantastic.  Regular music through Amazon Music Unlimited is a lot flatter.  But then I do a bluetooth to my phone and play from my YouTube Music Premium account, and it sound great.  So I can't help but wonder why Amazon Music sounds worse than that.  It seems to be a push for you to get the 3D Music subscription.  That's why I give 4 stars.  Otherwise it works well as an Alexa device and the mics are very sensitive. By the way Amazon - time for some new ""wake word"" options.  You want us to load up on devices that end up being close to one another, and yet you have 4 wake words, and 2 of those are not easy to say.","Certainly an exponential improvement over Echo Plus for sound, BUT..."

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2020,J. Olson,"I bought the Echo Studio in early April along with a FireTV Cube so that I could have easy voice control over my TV, and good quality sound without spending an arm and leg on the sound quality (like with Bose, Sonos, or other highly rated soundbars with Alexa integrated). Setup was very easy as with other Echo products. But setup and pairing with the FireTV cube was a bit more complex and confusing - took a good 5 minutes. The Studio speaker is not listed in the FireTV soundbar options, only a generic Amazon soundbar. So I was concerned whether everything would work correctly. For the first few days, everything worked beautifully, just as I had expected. After using it for a few days with the FireTV, Cube we noticed that the audio would just cut out for a couple seconds in the middle of someone saying something on a show. Had to rewind so you could understand what was going on. It didn't seem to matter whether the show was on HBO Now, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. Very annoying. The frequency and amount of time the sound would cut out got worse the longer we used the speaker. To solve the problem, I had to reset the speaker and re-pair it with the Cube - not something you want to deal with in the middle of a show. I put up with this for another week or so, as it seemed to work OK for several days at time. Then when I was trying to reset/re-pair with the Cube, the speaker would say ""Sorry, the internet is not available right now"". That wasn't true because the Cube was connected over the same Wi-Fi router in the same room. For some reason, it would not recognize my Wi-Fi router. The only way to fix this was to unplug the speaker and start all over again. This happened a couple more times so I gave up and decided to return the speaker. FireTV Cube works great, but not with the Studio speaker. I'm going to break down and spend the extra cash on a Sonos soundbar.","Sound cuts out & back in while watching a show, keeps dropping Wi-Fi connection"

One song played, I adjusted the volume. The next song came on either a great deal louder or lower. This has happened several times. Update 10/28/2020 Changed my review to 2 stars.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2020,skisan,"Simply put, not worth the price. The speaker lacks consistent volume output. A device this expensive should have an internal volume stabilizer so all music plays at the actual volume you select. As for the sound, look it's only going to be as good as what it receives and if you're going to be listening to music from the Amazon music playlist, you will really be disappointed. Little care goes into actually matching the mood or category you select and even then this speaker lacks clarity and definition, let alone adequate bass without pushing it. True, the Studio has its own HUB and that's a plus, but, so too, does the Echo. All in all. It's an average sound and does not give good base unless played at a level greater than, I suspect, most people care to listen to. Spend $200 if you feel the need, as I did.

However, thus far the sound is awesome, especially so when playing HD and 3D music but in truth, everything sounds better. The Amazon 'Ambient' station features a delightful selection of all HD music and consequently my listening seems to be migrating to it almost exclusively. Amazon's 3D enabled music selections seem more raucous and  'contemporary' but still the listening experience is excellent there as well. My one negative, and this has nothing to do with the Echo Studio speaker, Amazon's music frequently doesn't play through the entire music selection and skips mid-song to another selection.

The sound quality is much better and it does OK for a huge room where the original Echo was weak and tinny. Unfortunately it is really buggy. It becomes unresponsive and needs to by unplugged and plugged back in at least once every 2 days. Also the volume is really inconsistent. Sometimes Alexa is whispering, and each response can have very different volumes. For example when asking Alexa questions she might answer in her current volume, but if instead she reads something from the news or from Wikipedia the volume may be much louder. Depending on the station music might be either very faint or very loud compared to Alexa's responses. Overall it is probably worth the Prime day 2020 price of $150 but could be much better.

We own Echo Dot(s), Echo Plus, Echo, Echo Tap, 2 4K Fire Sticks, and Fire Tv Cube. As a test, I paired one of our Echo Dots and the Echo Tap to this TV and it worked just fine. So I gave up and called support. They informed me that this flagship $200.00 Echo Studio Speaker cannot be paired to a TV without the use of an Amazon Fire Stick/Fire Cube. That is just crazy to me. Why can I pair my $29.99 Echo Dot to my TV (Which no one would do) but not this $200 speaker? It took me literally half a day to reconfigure the devices around my house to get the Fire Cube into my living room and set up with the Studio. There is no reason for this, it says right on the box that it supports DOLBY ATMOS, so why do I need to pair it to a Fire product??? Anyways, I just wanted to write this review for anyone looking at this speaker to do what we are using it for and does not feel like dealing with the headache. If I did not already own a Fire Cube and I was not able to rearrange my setup to keep everything working pretty much the same at the end of the day I would have returned it and gave it a 2 star. Which is too bad because now that it's set up it's doing and sounding like what we wanted.",Decent Sound but will not pair with a TV without the use of a Fire product.(Per Support)
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jun 2020,Areviewer,"Really like this speaker. The sound is the best I have ever had on any device. Alexa isn't as smart sometimes as I wish she would be. I also, wish you could change her name to more than the options available.  I finally need a catalogue of sorts on what is available with amazon unlimited besides everything. Other than those ideas this is an awesome device. The news briefs are fun. The songs unbelievable. The price is quite reasonable.  I think I would go so far as to say this is the best amazon device on the market in terms of quality and price. The speakers work great together. The subwoofer has excellent deep base. I looked up songs on the browser to see which test the quality of the speaker and found some awesome songs for the tweeters and woofers. Really an enjoyable experience. A must have for anybody that loves music.",Excellent Sound in our Living Room

Actually I bought this speaker for my projector and expected good home theater sound but its not as expected but when we see it as induvial smart speaker then its good. For my projector I used Amazon fire stick and amazon speaker. As ""Smart"" devices FireStick should integrate(connect) with speaker but that is lagging. Thats the Alexa integration given 4 stars. Coming to sound quality. No doubt sound quality is very good but at this price range we should have more volume of sound. I'm using  8 or 9 pts of sound out of10 pts to enjoy the music.. Actually by using 6 or 7 points volume we should get expected volume level. Overall product is good if it is around 120 to 130 price range if more than that... better find alternative if you have concern  particularly about volume levels.",Good speaker but should be more smart
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Sep 2020,Frank,I recently cancelled cable and purchased Fire TV Cube to stream.  The cube has decent sound but does not bring home theatre quality entertainment.  I purchased the Echo Studio and Wow!  The Echo Studio is great and integrates perfectly with Fire TV Cube and Alexa. We enjoy movies with surround sound and booming audio.  The 3D audio blew me away when listening to Amazon music.  We actually tend to watch less TV because of the enjoyment of having the Echo Studio.  Many evenings the wife and I will ask Alexa to play a variety of music while we chill.  My wife will ask Alexa to play an upbeat song in the morning and force me to dance with her until the song is complete.  Good excdercise and gets you moving in the morning before work.  I highly recommend the Echo Studio for hours upon hours of entertainment.,Great sound and works well with Fire Cube

Bluetooth works fine for music, but for regular tv programs I have a terrible lip sync problem that I have been unable to solve. Others have the same problem. The only solution might be to connect a separate fire stick to the TV so that I can get audio via WiFi, not Bluetooth. The Studio works fine, but not as a speaker for Indignia Fire TV.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jul 2020,jarreeddd,"Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration: Sound Quality: While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out. Alexa: While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great. Size: This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals. Room adaptation: This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds. 3D MUSIC: This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app. Built in Zigbee: I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works. Competition: For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited. Using it as a sound bar: I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference. Summary: I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.",Great Smart Speaker

Well, the sound is just okay and the whole 3D sound/home theatre concept is not apparent to me whatsoever. I am no audiophile, but as a layperson I am unimpressed for the $400 investment. With that said, my actual complaint is that it is a CONSTANT in and out connection with the FireTV...near constant crackle, repeat noises and missing sounds. I have to unplug it, and wait for it to reconnect and then have to deal with the voice/sound being off. Frankly, I am disappointed. I expected it to work flawlessly with another Amazon product...it does not. Also, note that the speakers flank the TV so it's not a ""too far from the FireTV"" issue. It's become so annoying that will most likely replace them. Think long and hard if you plan to use it as a home theatre system.

When on your network it can help with answers to thousands of questions. The unit fits into your life anywhere. I put it at a central area so you can hear music on the ground level and the first floor. Sound from music is very impressive; for the size of the unit. We have an echo dot in the living room to eliminate shouting at the studio. The echo dot & the studio are synced as one, if you start a timer on the studio and you’re in the living room the dot will tell you the remaining time. Also, either unit can do other tasks in independently. The studio has better sound; it’s also more expensive.

I tried two regular Fire Sticks and neither worked without distortion. Went through a few optical cables and that didn't work. I ended up buying a 4K Fire Stick and an Ethernet adapter. The audio hasn't dropped or distorted yet, so switching to the 4K seems to have solved that problem. I still can't get the Fire Stick remote to control the Studio, but that's a different issue. No audio distortion is a win. The issue now is that the sound gets out of sync. I have to disconnect the Fire Stick and Studio and reconnect them in the Alexa app to fix it. The sound is good when it works, but it's been a weeks long, fiddly process to get the thing to work. And only sometimes at that. I definitely regret the purchase of the Studio.

We have three other devices of different sizes on two other floors of our home. The sound quality of the Echo Studio is by far superior to even the most current version of the Echo towers and, when linked to the other devices and played all together, our house literally sings. The Echo Studio calibrates itself to the room it is in and the resulting sound quality is immersive and does justice to our wide range of musical tastes. We initially tested the sound on classic rock, dance, orchestral, choral, country, and pop. We play music and audiobooks on our devices daily and love how this device enhances our overall listening experience. The one feature we miss on this device versus the towers is the ability to check the temperature in the room it sets in. But that’s it. Love it. Would buy another one.

After setting up 7 Studio stereo sub pairs, 1 pair of stereo Dot speakers, and a Netgear mesh range extender (total of 23 Echo device's) THEY WILL NOT ALL PLAY THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME.  That's the reason I bought them in the first place.  Customer service techs have told me Amazon has a limit of 10 devises'.  SUPRISE SUPRISE.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jun 2020,Cody Bellenir,"I purchased two studios and an echo sub because my smart household is.l basically ran by Amazon. I really enjoy watching movies and TV but also listen to a lot of music and am pretty picky about good sound. I can safely say that I firmly believe this $500 combo (purchased on Black Friday) is likely better than most setups you could purchase with the same amount of money. I have never listened to the Homepod but I have listened to the Sonos One. Yes the Sonos One and Homepod both likely sound better than the Studio if you are critically listening. However, I do know that the difference is not so significant that I regret my purchase. It was a little difficult to set up the speakers to my fire stick 4k at first because it was my first time doing it. For some reason the speakers would show as unavailable and I didn't understand why. I contacted Amazon support and they helped me troubleshoot the issue and I had it up and running in less than 10 minutes. Movie sounds quality is night and day compared to the speaker on my TV. The experience has been seamless since they've been set up. The only thing that disappointed me was how little of a selection there is as far as Dolby Atmos streaming because as of right now Amazon only supports Atmos on prime video titles. I wish you could take advantage of Atmos on Netflix and other streaming services but hopefully with time they will work something out as far as that goes. Movies still sound amazing but that would've been nice to have seeing as the main selling point is their ""3D sound"". Overall these speakers in a 2.1 setup with the echo sub sound amazing and provide an excellent value for the money and I would highly recommend it. Totally worth it if you have Amazon Music HD.",Two studios + echo sub = amazing experience.

As to immersive sound quality, it’s fantastic, but We had to adjust it’s height to find where that perfect spot was. My husband is an audiophile, and he is quite satisfied with Echo Studio’s sound quality. The challenge has been with Alexa. My husband was ready to send it back until we found that the best way to select music is from our iPhones. It was maddening when we would ask for a particular album cut. It seemed Alexa could usually find the album, but if we asked for a stand-alone song from the album, she couldn’t find it. I do love that she can create playlists or that you can be awakened with the songs of your choice instead of an alarm. I’m much more energized that way.",Even an audiophile can find this satisfying
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Aug 2020,MonsieurGlemaud,"This was a bit of a letdown. I was excited to get it but it just doesn't provide the boom I expected. Voice activation of Alexa doesn't work from a distance while the system is at a high volume. I bought this thing to only work at high volumes so it sucks that Alexa doesn't wake up when I need it most. Another issue is it's ability (or inability) to connect to other Alexa devices. When connected it to the fire tv it would sound great but would constantly disconnect or reconnect with no sound. Sadly, it's just inconsistent. Lastly, the sound isn't that great. Compared to most soundbars, its a great competitor, but if you have a decent (5.1) sound system it doesn't compare. If you have a recent generation Echo and a good sound system, just connect your Echo to the system with an aux cord (with male connectors on both sides). You won't regret it. You can connect your fire tv to it and get surrounded sound without connecting directly to the TV. Alexa voice wakes up from anywhere in a 20×20 room. Plan and simple, there are better options. Hopefully the next generation will have less issues.  And yes my picture is deliberately upside-down to show a frown with the Amazon logo",Just okay

Studio is pla mid-room, on a dresser, 3D is turned off, and bass in Alexa app is set at highest setting. I run it about volume 4 or 5, not ‘party’ loud.  It  doesn’t really sound better (bass) than the dot!  I should return it, but I’ve tried living with it for a week and its now used.  Hate to see it go to land-fill.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2020,Erik V.,"So we have several different style echos, including the old original echo. Our original echo is years old and while we loved it for its loudness and overall quality, this one blows it away. The 1st thing I tested and LOVED was that even with music at full volume, it still hears you. Our original echo could not hear you when the music is at full blast and you'd have to bust out the phone and use the app to get it to stop or push the button. 2nd, the music quality is GREAT. Studio quality, no, but love it and the bass is impressive for such a small unit. We originally were going to order an eco sub to sync to it but after hearing it, the sub is not needed.

We connected ours to a Firestick 4k and the general functionality was pretty cool, although setup was more complicated than it should have been. Audio for shows on various platforms (Prime, Hulu, Netflix) cut out constantly, to the point that we were continuously having to rewind to see what we missed. In addition to the cutting out, there were multiple times that the sound would stop all together. Amazon support was eager to help. We spent over an hour trouble shooting but unfortunately nothing seemed to do the trick. Ended up returning the speaker all together after ~10 days.

I've been an Alexa user since the beginning (I still have my first beta Echo), and Alexa keeps getting better.  I love the full sound of the Echo studio.

I have a set of Klipsch audio speakers for my computer that sits on the same desk, and I've considered replacing them with the Echo Studio plus subwoofer. My wife and I use Alexa for everything from reminders to alarms and timers, shopping lists and home automation (lights, furnace, A/C, etc) and I would have to say I'm 90% pleased with the system.  Any disappointment I have would be related to the fact that there are times I have to repeat myself when giving Alexa a command.  I honestly haven't had time to investigate whether this is room placement or Alexa itself. This round of Echo devices has been epic!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2020,R@UL'S OPNION,"The Echo Studio is way louder than all the other echoes with superb vocals, which reproduce clearly but with room for improvements. The good: The product itself is impressive. As an audiophile, I love the way this smart speaker sounds. It has the right balance of bass with excellent mid-tones and trebles out of the box. Volume: As I mentioned before, it is loud enough to feel the music or to throw a party. I can see that pairing two of them will create enough volume for a large room when positioned correctly. Streaming: I can pair my SiriusXM and Spotify with no problem. Apple Music tested and no issues either. It’ll play music according to where it is available. For example, if I ask for a popular song, Amazon Music will probably have it, but when it comes to specific songs, Spotify will be your streaming service. The bad: Streaming Volumes: The music will play alright, but having different streaming services will mean that each of them has a different volume output. I find Spotify louder that SiriusXM. So adjusting the volume sometimes does bother me. I would like the Echo to analyze the volume input for every service and then output it at the same standard volume and even amplify it so that it can sound equal to the others. Voice recognition: Even though this speaker has more microphones around, I still experience problems when calling Alexa to turn on and off the lights. I have to raise my voice, even though my room is small. But don’t let this bring you down, it could be that I’m not clear enough. I sometimes speak fast. Sometimes calling for a specific song in Spotify from X artist will not work; it’ll instead play the This is X artist on Spotify. The vocals are reproduced easily on this speaker. However, I find it 4/5 on vocal reproduction. The vocals sound like if they were in the middle of the stage and not out in the front. Otherwise, I believe you will not go wrong with this premium speaker. Amazon will probably update them in 1 or 2 years.","Loud and superb speaker, vocals are clear but with room for improvements."

I listen to a fair amount of music and appreciate the quality. The only advice I would give is to put the speaker in your wish list or Cart, then ""save for later"". If you keep going back every couple of days, after a couple of weeks it just drops $40-$50 dollars - buy it right away as the price will go up again very quickly. This may be coincidental but I've had it happen on a couple of high priced items so I'll keep trying in future. The ""3D sound"" I signed up for and the demo songs do sound slightly better but it's unnoticeable when playing regular music so I will likely cancel the service before the free trial period is up.","Nice Speaker - Great Sound, but wait until on-sale for price.

What a sound from such a small speaker, the bass is good and clarity is excellent. I had read many reviews that were mostly very positive, but kept noticing some people had paired two and were blown away with the results. Now don't get me wrong, One is sufficient and fills the room, but two, well it's incredible. I did start off by purchasing one, but with the deal Amazon have at the moment for $169 I decided to go all in and get the second. I am so glad I did! Easy set up and pairing was a breeze. I didn't go for the Echo Sub like many have, as my use is mainly for music and not for the movie experience. Also Amazon no longer carry the Echo Sub, but it still can be bought from other outlets. If I see one at the right price I may be tempted, but as for now, I am more than happy. These are currently being offered with 5 interest free monthly payments if you prefer to spread the cost.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Oct 2020,J. Thompson,"I purchased the Echo Studio to kill multiple birds with one stone: to replace a Gen 1 Echo, serve as a soundbar for my bedroom TV, as a smart home hub, and to serve as the master bedroom speaker group with my Fire Stick 4k. I chose this over an Alexa enabled soundbar because it was offered at a discount with a bundled Echo Show 5 and Hue smart bulb. Pros-It does provide very good sound quality. I would rate it a 4.5. The only drawback in that department is that, at least in my application, the dolby atmos affect is hard to notice. It could be my room or the content I watch, so it's not quite a con in my book. Otherwise, it does all of the things you'd expect an Echo device to do in the ways you'd expect it to do them. Cons-Normally it would only work as a soundbar when you're watching content from specific devices (like my Fire Stick 4k), but there's a mini-optical line in port that allows you to connect it to a television with an optical out with the proper cable. In my case, it would stop playing this port's signal at least once a day. Suddenly, for the past week it stopped this behavior and I thought an update may have fixed the problem. But alas, it happened again last night. Unplugging and replugging the unit is the only way I've been able to correct the problem. The other major issue is that it is out of sync with my Fire Stick, and not even the lip sync tool can adequately correct the problem. It seems like this should be a relatively easy fix with today's technology. So as an Echo device only, I would rate the Studio a solid 4.5 overall. But as a replacement for a soundbar (which is clearly an intended purpose of this device, which can even be paired with another Studio and Echo sub in a 2.1 system), I'd rate it somewhere around a 3.5. If they were to fix what I assume are two software issues, I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a soundbar as well!","Nearly excellent, but with a couple of significant problems"
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Aug 2020,AZDad,"There is a lot to like here. It really does sound outstanding, especially when you utilize the 3d sound; however, I sent my set back. The problem is I really wanted to use these for a home theater. I see a lot of talk on the web about this and they do integrate fairly well with the Fire Cube. The imaging is awesome and the volume is perfect. What I found ruined the experience was the lack of bass. Bass put out by the speakers is tight and accurate - it's quite good. There just is not enough of it for a small home theater. The experience is just ruined by it. Pairing this with a Echo Sub would be perfect, but that is discontinued. AMAZON PLEASE BRING BACK THE ECHO SUB!","Good product, just not for me."

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Dec 2019,Matt,"I own about 7 different echo devices, dots, spots, shows, etc. Along with 4 fire tv sticks. I got this studio with the intention of replacing the built in speakers on my main living room tv, which is only really used with a Fire TV Stick. Setting up the device was a breeze, just as all echo devices are. The real exciting part was when creating the Audio System for the Fire TV stick, which also was an incredibly easy process, and then I was up and running. Overall, while I am not a sound engineer, I think the sound quality was pretty incredible. Granted, I’m moving from built in tv speakers, however, the bass was punchy and smooth, balance feels great. When playing music, it’s a fully immersive sound that fills the room. While it doesn’t compare to a full scale surround sound system for movies or watching TV, it does sound great and is a very easy solution. As all echo devices do, this studio integrates perfectly with my existing ecosystem, multi-room music, etc. There do appear to be a couple bugs, biggest one I found was when asking this device to play Spotify, it won’t play it on that device but in an entirely different room. I’ve seen reports of this bug and assuming that it’ll be fixed soon, as Amazon doesn’t seem to let bugs like this hang around too long.

There's always give and take with Hi-Fi purchases (in my opinion) and this was no different.  Although there were a few speakers on the market that boasted slighter better audio performance, it was at a price point more than twice the Echo Studio and none the a 24bit or higher DAC built in.  I have found the sound performance excellent and having the convenience of Alexia, it was a no-brainer.  Currently, I am satisfied with the bass performance, I find no need for the add on sub-woofer.  I will likely purchase more. Set up was simple and when I purchase another one and if I decide to pair them, the Alexia app makes the pairing process. Like anything else, I also see some opportunity for improvement.

Smaller speakers made an echo effect.  This speaker fills the room with sound without any such effect.",Better than it’s fruity competition!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2020,grkgeorgy,"I jumped and ordered this device as soon as I heard about it.  Setup was SUPER EASY!  If you accept to have your account added before it ships, when it arrives all you need to do is literally TURN IT ON.  It will automatically connect to your wifi by using your password saved via your account profile and activate in seconds! OK - so now to the sound.  I used the sample HD playlist they let you stream to see how that sounds.  It fills the entire room, with rich tones and dynamic range.  I cranked it to the loudest setting and noticed something.  The sound was still clear, but it was not blaring and distorted.  The sound just sounded clean and I enjoyed every song.  I walked to different rooms around the house and it actually travelled through.  I can only imagine pairing 2 studios, which I may do at some point in the near future. I also own an Echo and the sound is loud for this device - but it lacks the range.  It also feels harsh if you blast it.  The studio has definitely improved sound quality. As for the HD music, I did not subscribe since I have a Spotify account.  So I made sure my account had the highest bit rate streaming at 320Kb and guess what, it makes a difference using the studio.  I now enjoy listening to music whenever I’m home.  It feels great having good quality audio delivered at your command.  I’m happy with this purchase 😊",Stellar sound EASY SETUP

The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because of connectivity issues.  I was under the impression that I could use the studio as a center/main channel and use two dots as side speakers for surround but apparently that's not an option at the moment, I was told the studio could only pair with another studio.  Well, somehow I did get it to pair with both dots  (just not simultaneously) and if they could just update the devices to work together seamlessly then it would be a truly versatile sound system.  But without that capability, it's still just another Alexa, not a sound system.","Amazing sound, wish it paired with dots though."

Sound does not disappoint; it is clear, powerful, and ""carries"" much better than my old Echo 1st Gen device.  We can hear it clearly in multiple rooms without being extremely loud. My one frustration was that as the Echo devices that conform to the room, it requires resetting if you move it from one to another for proper detection of room acoustics.  That means I had to deregister and re-register; I am not sure why a command to reset the acoustics is not available.","Excellent audio, but bulky"

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Sep 2020,Sharon Benzil,"This Echo Studio was purchased with an Echo 3rd gen to provide linked sound from our TV (using a Fire Cube) in the living room and another room (to listen to audio from the TV) and while the literature on the Echo speakers are fuzzy on the ability of these two specific speakers to link together, it is implied they can. Wrong. They cannot. Strike 1. After weeks and weeks of owning the Echo Studio, we have now RECONNECTED a Bose Mini Soundlink to the Fire Cube because after weeks and weeks of factory restarts, reconnecting, linking and pairing, pairing and unpairing, and countless hours on Amazon troubleshooting chats (the SLOWEST customer service chats ever), I have given up on the home theater pairing. Strike 2 and 3. The connections are tenuous, drop constantly, and even when the speaker is linked with the Fire Cube, the sound doesn’t come through the speaker and remains on the TV. So frustrating. The sound link between the speakers for multi room music seems to be fairly reliable and therefore, we have decided they can be used for music but not home theater. We’ve resorted to a less expensive, smaller and older Bose speaker for the TV that is flawless in its linkage and provides adequate and trouble-free sound. The $300 in Echo speakers are, for multi room music only, overpriced and I would have returned these speakers a long time ago except we live outside the US and sending these back to the US is prohibitively expensive, and during these COVID times, almost impossible. I would not recommend this speaker to anyone. Find something else. Anything else.

The only thing I wished for was the unit had more power. Since the replaced a 13 year old JBL ipod capable room speaker (was twice the price), the volume is not as loud.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Feb 2020,LJAY,"Let's just say I've been. Waiting some time deciding what I want as a home audio system. Sonos products look and sound great but I ultimately decided to go with the 3D studio for the more bass sound over highs.  I think the studio offers a good balance that's adjustable enough ( we'll come back to these said adjustments in a minute) to get the highs, why not as crisp as Sonos, pretty close indeed. Ok so let's be clear, the easy setup that I watched tons of videos before the product arrived wasn't easy. Yes it connected to WiFi and adjusted based on the placement of my room but getting it connected to my fire TV was almost a phone call away to tech support.  Actually I was on the phone waiting for tech support when I somehow miraculously connected it. It's a moment you will realize as a Firestick 4k owner that your Firestick does not update it's software automatically. The speaker itself is a little bulky but honestly it makes it look more of a beast than the Sonos product I was considering.  The one deciding point was the ability to connect other Bluetooth devices directly to the speaker and I'm glad I did. That feature is the most useful as someone using a phone, tablet, computer and fire TV to listen to music or watch movies it switches effortlessly between whatever audio I decide to play. The audio setting which allows some tweaking to the bass, treble and mids is probably my only complain for the moment.  I definitely think there's limited options for adjustments for the echo studio.  There should be some pre-sets to assist with adjustments for movies, music and games. There definitely should be a way to adjust the individual tweeter's that create the 3D sound, that by the way you don't get to hear unless you subscribe to Amazon music service. The surround sound provided by the stereo spacial enhancement does help to mimic that pretty good.  Also note adding thrid party software such as the Dolby and Atmos on my PC when using this device showed great improvement. It's unfortunate I can't carry that over to my Firestick and some other devices. My other complaint which I will contact support about is when I adjust the few setting options they give me it doesn't save and keep it.  At some point when I open settings option again it resets back to it's original options.

Don't get me wrong, the sound is good, but I expected more bass, and much better sound to justify the double in price. I would say it's closer to a 25% improvement in sound.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Sep 2020,fellow shopper,"I bought a set of these speakers as direct replacements for Sonos Play 1 speakers in the exact same configuration (i.e., room, stereo pair, source of music). I was hoping for better integration with Amazon music, but there is no difference; I wanted to like and dislike the songs being played and I was hoping Alexa could tell me what songs were playing. When playing music in stereo, Alexa says, ""nothing is playing right now"" every time I try to like or dislike a song. This shortfall has been documented previously with Amazon music, yet nothing has changed. Frankly, I like the Sonos better because there is more volume increments which benefits lower volume background music. And why can't I say ""Alexa, volume 15%"" (as opposed to one through 10). I'll admit, more time is needed to assess the speakers capability, but my initial assessment is merely mediocre for a speaker that has the hardware to create awesomeness.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 May 2020,Tim,"The Echo Studio is a pretty good sounding smart speaker for the price and size. I like many things about this speaker, but it could've been better. So far the smart home hub feature has not worked for the three Phillips hue bulbs I own. I use to have a phillips hub but returned it when I got an Echo Plus. I sold that Echo last year and haven't had a way to control my smart bulbs since then. I am disappointed to say the Echo Studio does not work as a hub for my lights. There is a chance they are all malfunctioning or it is an operator error. As far as voice commands go, I recommend putting it about 12 inches away from any walls or solid objects. Since the speaker has 360 sound it will echo (pun intended) back to the mics and require you to pretty much yell to get Alexa to respond. I originally had it next to a wall and had experienced this so I can say for sure the speaker responds better being at least 12 inches from walls. The last thing I can think of that I really wanted but didn't get with this model is the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus does. I mean come on, really? I would have paid the extra 25 dollars for this convenience and to he honest I expect this feature from a semi high end speaker. You probably are wondering about the speaker sound at this point. It sounds great honestly. It is truly like a miniature home theater system with out the true stereo quality you get from surround sound speakers. There is a significant amount of bass and it actually blends well with the mids and highs. I can feel it vibrate my floor, but I should mention we have raised floors which are better at transmitting the vibrations than a concrete floor. I would give this speaker 5 stars had the hub feature actually worked and if it came with the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus. One last thing is not part of the review but more of a suggestion; if you get the Echo Studio, do yourself a favor and subscribe to music HD. I got my first month for half the cost which will normally run you 14.99/month for the cheaper subscription. The sound difference between regular Prime Music and the HD subscription is kind of like the difference between a regular speaker vs bass boosted headphones. Everything sounds more balanced and clear and you hear the sounds you normally only hear with a pair of headphones or a high quality speaker!","Not bad! Could've been better, though..."
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Mar 2020,Chris K.,I purchased the Echo Studio when it was on sale 169.99 and was excited to try this thing out. Well the excitement was short lived. The Bluetooth would connect just fine through Windows 10 PC (connected to my tv via hdmi) and would work fine until I asked Alexa to play a song. Once that happened the Bluetooth would disconnect and proceed to play the song forcing me to reconnect it. This happened every time right on que. Sometimes when the Bluetooth was reconnected there was no sound at all despite Windows 10 showing it connected. In addition the Bluetooth connection would also drop at random moments and while the speaker sounded pretty good at first that was short lived as well. One moment I had a great speaker and then for no reason it suddenly sounded like a cell phone speaker (no woofer/mids). Resetting or unplugging was no help. My Echo Plus was connected in the same fashion and produced none of the above problems working flawlessly. As mentioned in other reviews the placement of the light ring is annoying since you cant see it at eye level (where most people would probably have it) and the voice recognition would sometimes not work. Also I figured I would update the software to possibly fix any problems but the Studio reported back that it had the latest version. When I checked Amazon website the latest Studio software version according to Amazon site is 3389730436 however my Alexa app shows the software version as 3590965380 so I'm not sure if that matters? Well I decided I would give it another try since maybe I got a lemon? I proceeded to initiate a replacement ticket and was directed to a customer service chat. I was told this was not possible and that I could return the product and just buy it again. When asked about the sale and if they would honor that price the customer service rep just repeated that they could only return it. I asked why and again was just asked if I wanted to return it. This product and process was not what I usually experience at Amazon and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the refund process was great as usual. Now I have to decide if I will pick another one up during the next sale which will most likely be Prime Day but this experience has left me looking for alternative options.,bluetooth drops frequently
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Apr 2020,YUCHEN F.,"As a person who wants to use it as a Bluetooth speaker only, I found it very good in the aspect of sound quality. Its subwoofer gives it a totally different performance compared to other speakers. However, I do find it hard to use sometimes with the connection logic. First, I need to download the app to start to use it and a lot of functions are only available through voice control. For example, I tried the radio function in the app but when I close the app in the background, it continues to play the music and I have to unplug it. Overall, I think it gives me the best sound experience in this price range($150-$250) e.g better than bose home 300! but I wish that there could be a function to let me use it as a pure Bluetooth speaker.",A powerful speaker but not easy to use
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,GayGuy Approved,"I wanted an amazing sounding system that could control the music and the volume with my voice command...and boy does this do the trick!  The sound is brilliant. I bought two studios and the subwoofer- don't skimp, get the subwoofer too - you'll be extremely happy that you did.  I paired the studio(s), the subwoofer, an echo, and an echo dot to create an ""Everywhere"" network throughout the house. ""Amazing"" is the word to use for this.  Friends who have Sonos are jealous of how great my Echo system sounds and how easy it is to play the music you want.  One drawback - if you're having a party, everyone starts screaming ""ALEXA play....""  I'd say it's worth that one drawback.  Definitely GayGuy Approved.  A+",Echo Studio Hits It Out of the Park!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Oct 2020,Todd & Melanie,I ordered this during Amazon Deal Days so I got it for a decent price. I think if I would have paid the full price I would have been more disappointed. It is a large speaker with a small footprint. The sound is good and they made sure to dial back the volume level a bit so it does not distort at full volume. Set up is easy as could be and takes only a few minutes to get set up and running. Voice recognition is good is a lot better than the smaller speakers. It is not my go-to speaker when I want to Rock but as a daily driver for when I want to just listen to a podcast or stream music for background music.,Good but not Great
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jan 2020,Mike Karr,"I have a 3rd gen Echo, a couple of 3rd gen Echo Dots, and a couple of Echo Inputs connected to powered speakers. The Studio provides some next-level sound, comparatively, and I am very happy with the quality, particularly when using all together for whole-house audio. I was very pleasantly surprised by the audio synchronization between my Bluetooth connected Bose Mini Soundlink, directly connected bookshelf speakers and the Studio. I expected some delay somewhere in the mix, but nope, it's right on. I've struggled with the notion of adding an Echo Subwoofer too, but the lows provided by the Studio are quite good, and I'm not sure it would make much of a difference. I do have the Studio placed fairly close to a corner, so sound clarity suffers a tiny bit, but it's pretty large, so leaving it out in the open is not ideal in my space.",Easy to Integrate

It has a problem when you use it with a 3.5mm cable where it won’t go back to tv after you do any Alexa commands without unplugging the cable and plugging back in. Lot of complaints about it online. Should have some my research. It’s basically just a big echo because there are better speakers for sound quality.,Disappointed

It is heavy (as it should be for a good bass speaker magnet), and quite loud.  Do not compare this to a dedicated audio device costing a lot more.  It is quite good for the price, totally helpful in that it has full Echo functionality, and easy to install.  It is heavy for its size, so shelf placement and support needs to be carefully done. This is for streaming music as you do something else and still want to hear a full-range sound.

Also sounds 4x as good in terms of power output and clarity. I do not use the hi res audio option ( I tried it as a free trial using my laptop with a hdmi cable to my receiver and floor standing Polk audio speakers) I honestly couldn’t tell which songs were 44 kHz sampling vs 192. Maybe if I was younger I would have been able to). I did notice that streamed audio from my IPhone didn’t sound great, ostensibly due to compression.

It gets LOUD! The bass is awesome! I am not an audiophile so I'm not going to ramble on but for us ""regular"" ppl this is stunning. I don't necessarily recommend it for apartments since even taking the base to its lowest setting is still pretty intense. The only issue, and it is pretty minor, is that it seems to have some difficulty when we tell it what playlist we want to hear. Considering that we only have one right now, it's frustrating when she comes up with random lists. I'm going to change the name if our playlist to see if that helps","Quite amazing, that Alexa!"

It is a complete night and day difference. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can hear the difference in sound quality between this and the gen 1 echo. The sound on this speaker is so much deeper, richer and clearer. The only downside is that the light ring isn't visible on the side of the device and the response ding isnt as loud as on the gen 1 so I can't as easily tell if the echo heard me. With that being said it does a very good job of hearing me and understanding what I'm asking. There has only been a handful of times where it didnt hear me and its when it was blasting music. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good sounding smart speaker.",Great Speaker

Yes, it will play music but if you make the mistake of buying this and wanting to use Apple Music, you will understand my frustration. Some songs show in the app, some don't.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jul 2020,Vincent K,This is a very high quality unit. The sound is quite good. It does require more volume though to sound good then the standard Echo device. IMO at lower volumes the regular Echo sounds better. For a large room the Studio is a must unless you have multiple standard Echo units. The sound of the Studio is huge and clear when you get past half volume. At low volumes the Studio lacks bass were the standard Echo does not.  The Studio is worth the money IMO. It is quite larger in size and hosts 5 speakers instead of the single speaker in the standard unit. 2 standard Echoes might be a viable option to 1 Studio.,Great Sound

Customer service was very helpful but all troubleshooting led to them sending me another device. The new device showed up in different packaging which is a concern since a 3 day old device should be replaced with a new.... but out of the box the speaker was popping and crackling like an old record when the speaker was active using voice or audio.

When I wake up in the morning and power up the computer to watch the news, the sound comes through perfectly . . . until I bump my phone and it comes on. Bye-bye audio from the computer.

A bit pricey, but compared to a decent sound bar, you get a lot more value, considering it can replace your Echo altogether.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jul 2020,John Haider,So I use this speaker oll over the house.....yes it sometimes doesnt sound as good in spots....but it's meant to be a 3d like speaker for all around....so placing it near walls and stuff would effect its sound. Ive used this speaker out doors....and it can really rock an outside party. Soooooo loud. Sounded more amazing outside to be honest. As always there are flaws.....but these flaws are tyoically based on Wi-Fi. Like lower end Wi-Fi that cant support too many items. I know the 3.5 is optical....but it says aux too so I tried it....and it in fact works....but at half volume. The only app I use now is Amazon music. But even with that....i dind myself searching for songs.....unkike YouTube where my songs typically pop up when listening to other similar songs. Amazing music varied so much each time I chose the my music playlist. I never liked ANY of the songs. All in all this speaker is pretty good. I ordered an toslink to mini toslink optical to see how it sounds for home theatre. Love love love this speaker. Gonna order another for 400watts of power.,Looooooove this speaker. Needing another to pair
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Mar 2020,MB,"This purchase was a leap of faith into the world of smart speakers that turned out to far exceed my expectations.  As always, the studio was easy to set up (took less than 2 min) and the resulting sound was absolutely impressive, complete night and day difference when compared to older echo.  Although the bass was strong, clear and added the needed depth I was so impressed with the studio that I purchased the echo sub along with a second studio to create a true stereo environment feeding off of my prime music HD subscription.  With the price point, quality and ease of use, Echo Studio is an absolute win for Amazon...and for me the end user.",Game changing update to the Echo line
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Feb 2020,GDD,Definitely not impressed with the sound quality. I made the decision to purchase based on various online reviews rating it closely to another product I own which is a Marshall Kilburn yes I know the Kilburn costs $100 more than the Studio but reviews were comparing them as close.  Next i know the Kilburn is not the best measure but I happen to own one because I love the convince of being able to carry it around and take it outside. Lastly If you have a large room 20x25 with vaulted ceilings it just doesn’t fill the room. It gets loud but again it doesn’t seem to surround you. If you have audiophile grade or even close to audiophile grade equipment I would recommend going with another option.,Not even close to audiophile quality audio

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2020,Outdoer,"I really like the relatively small and unobtrusive size of the studio.  It really does a good job on it's own, however, I think it kicks up a notch just by simply pairing it with a couple of echo dots also in the room.  If I had a couple of Echo's paired instead I am sure that it would even be a richer experience than it is now.  I am curious as to how the echo sub added to the mix would improve the sound.  Currently the bass delivered by the Echo Studio alone isn't bad at all.  Maybe I will make that addition in future, but right now I am quite satisfied.",Big Sound small package

What do you say when the speaker is smarter then you? This is a GREAT sounding speaker that initially sets it self up... great, then you try to tweak it like utilizing BT from your Samsung Series 7 and nothing works, after 1 week still can’t make it happen.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Aug 2020,Anthony Lunn,"So I own this and an Apple HomePod. I A-B this right next to an Apple HomePod in my house with my music. The Apple HomePod is definitely higher fidelity, but the HomePod is a one trick pony in my opinion and there are a few other disappointing elements of the HomePod. The Echo Studio is all around the better “smart” speaker especially if you already have echo or Alexa infrastructure in your house. The sound is fairly solid; after some EQ in the app you can get it to perform. I think the sound has a better gelling compression as well so songs sound more stereo. There is a 3D mode that works on Amazon music that adds enough separation and sparkle to sound more like a HomePod if you really like a lot of clarity in your home audio. I saved this for last, I was a sound engineer for over a decade and I think both speakers are pretty good for a single speaker that auto adjusts to your environment. You’ll be pretty happy to save the space and have the assistant with either. In the end I go with Echo studio because it can connect to Bluetooth which allows me to stream anything I want to it. The HomePod only allows Airplay.",I choose Echo Studio over the Apple HomePod

I was really excited to receive this speaker for Christmas and for the reviews it was receiving and what a let down. I’m just going to make it quick and simple. The sound quality is good not great, you’re better off going with a Marshall Kilburn which also has Alexa built in for around the same price with a much much better sound. The build is really good but the weight in it is really heavy. Don’t understand for what though. Lastly and the most important for me at least. Is the connectivity, it states is Bluetooth compatible but it is not , unless it is connected with WiFi. If you’re not connected on WiFi it is a useless speaker which will not work on anything. And that is the reason I recommend not to buy it. Please you are better of with a Marshall Kilburn any day over this inferior product. As I will be buying.",Let down!!!
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Apr 2020,John W.,"It's an ok device, but not that much better than the 2nd gen echo plus. Pros: -Like the other echos, it's all-around a great smarthome device. -Decent music compared to the smaller echos. -I can tell the audio quality has slightly more range than the echo plus and can be moderately louder than the plus. Cons: -Despite having more audio range the music doesn't actually sound that much better than an echo plus. This is not really acceptable when the device takes up twice the space. In some scenarios, the audio is worse. Disabling the sound enhancement feature helps the audio quality for most songs. I can tell it was updated at some point to work better, so you can leave it on now, but still needs more patching. -The Alexa voice level is under volumed compared to the music volume. -The ring at the top is slightly too high for proper visibility. -The microphone does not pick up commands as well as the echo plus that was located in the same spot. Not just when music is playing either.",Not much better than the 2nd gen echo plus. Wait for the 2nd generation.
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2020,🌟 Dad Joke Loading 🌟,This is a great speaker to listen to all your music on. It has five speakers and 300 w certainly a very loud speaker and sounds great from all angles and directions. Make sure to subscribe to the HD Service as it's great. I did run into a little static problem after I upgraded to the HD service but simply saying to the studio to check for software updates it did an update and fixed the problem. This is my favorite speaker among my many different echo devices. Get 2 of them for an incredible stereo experience. Maybe future versions might incorporate an echo show style screen as well.

It has a decent woofer speaker, but it's just not there. The homepod and Bose SoundLink mini 2 sound so much deeper than this thing.

After having an echo 1st generation for years, it was time to upgrade. Since we listen to music so much, I wanted one with better sound and this has that in spades. Listening to music through the Studio is a much better experience. Bigger (around) and heavier, but that is and should be expected. It's not audiophile quality, but that's fine - it's more than good enough. Even though the bass response (which is tight and loud) is fine, when the echo sub is available again, I'll be adding that.

I expected the Studio to blow that setup out of the water. I am so disappointed. I have an $89 sound bar with subwoofer that sounds way better. My only consolation is that I was able to purchase it from Dell for $70 using a rebate offered on a credit card. For $70 bucks I'll keep it. Otherwise, I would already have it packed up to go back.

It turns out that the stereo integration only works with Gen 3 TV's. My TV is a Gen 2. It would be nice to get a firmware update to the TV to allow integration so I can use it for Atmos.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Mar 2020,Richard B.,"Update: 5/23: Revising my review since the issues with audio loss requiring me to reboot the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Echo Studio a few times a week are gone. Most likely it was a bug that was fixed in a software update to one of the devices. My only complaint now is that the only multichannel input for non-Fire TV devices is optical and thus limited to DD and not DD+ or Atmos. Original Review: I bought this to improve the sound from my TV. Since I use a Fire TV Stick 4K as the only source, I was excited to give it a try and I really love the integration with the volume control from the Fire TV remote controlling the Echo Studio perfectly.  I'm also happy with the sound quality and really enjoy it when it is working. The problem that brings me to two stars is that the audio will occasionally cut out when playing from the Fire TV Stick 4K and the only way to recover is to reboot the devices. Thinking it was network related I tried a different access point with WiFi to both, ethernet to just the Stick 4K, ethernet to just the Echo Studio, ethernet to both, and the issue does not go away. It happens often enough (every 2 days or so) that I had to go back to the TV speakers to stop my family from complaining so now the Echo Studio sits collecting dust.","Sounds good, but loses audio every couple of days"

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Dec 2019,Erik,"These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience.  In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for.  Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers. The sounds is really impressive for the price point.  I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price. My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience. When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good.  Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great).  The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience. The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass.  Now we're talking!  If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy.  Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient. I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough.  If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one. Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need.  The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes. In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these.  Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money. So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known. In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT  work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs. So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube.  In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position. With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars. Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker. In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys. Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking. Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.","Honest Review from a Sound Designer, Musician and Video Streaming Nut!"

The speakers are well made and have a very sleek design. Cons: Voice recognition is not as good as the Echos or Echo dots.

This sucks because we have it in a slightly enclosed space and we found it sounded better with the bass turned down a bit but we lower it with the app and then when the app is shut off the setting goes back to normal.

It was so great I decided to buy a second Amazon Echo Studio.  My delivery showed up and I raced downstairs like a kid at Christmas. I Opened the box and took the speaker out of it’s nice presentation bag.  Plugged it in and created a home living room group.  Threw on some dirty bird house music which has very good low end and through Spotify they were bumping!  It wasn’t until later that I open up one of my DJ apps on my iPad Pro and try to connect them both through YouTube that I realized I made a mistake.  There’s no way to pair or daisychain these off of Bluetooth they will only play out of the Alexa app or through a fire stick.  I think I'm going to do is buy a dongle with a HDMI out and use a fire stick.

The sound quality with the subwoofer is pretty amazing -- we do often use it to play music and it's a noticeable upgrade.  Also the response rate with the old model had gotten somewhat laggy lately and this responds right away.  The only minor improvement would be to keep the light up circle around the edge or elevate it slightly in the middle so that it is easier to tell when the device is actively listening/responding.,Much better sound than the original Echo
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2020,Remo Felix,I can only speak my truth on this one. I wasn't sure what to expect. All I know is that the echo plus that we purchased for our son sounded great on its own. However for someone that likes sound right in their face with definition. The echo plus wasn't enough. When I came across the echo studio I definitely had to see what it was about. Like all excitement I couldn't wait. Once delivered and after powering and connecting to our network. All I can say it was More than worth the wait. I've watched and read quite a few reviews on this particular device. Long story short none serve this product justice. With that being said nor will mine. This is going to be something that you'll definitely have to judge for yourself. Although let me say this in regards to price point sound quality and capability hands down beat some of the high-priced dollar setups that are out and available. Put it like this if you were to put one in each room along with two plus a sub in your living room there's no reason why you should miss a beat while moving throughout your home and in some cases even in your front or back yard just saying.,Dramatic sound with a non dramatic price

We adjusted the configuration to make this work but i mention this as this seems to be an Amazon opportunity for teams to do better testing on products. Primarily, i purchased this one over Bose for the intent of sound quality and Alexa integration.  My only caution is on two small points.  First, the unit lacks the low volume quality sound that my Bose units have.  I am picky but this is comparable pricing to Bose and I can redirect my audio to my Bose at low volume and have a much more relaxing experience.  Second, the unit lacks universal micro volume control.  The volume jumps from too much to too little for some scenarios.

It goes off and we need to drop it.  A half setting (3.5) would likely reduce that problem.  When you can't find the right volume level to begin with it just requires constant fiddling.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jul 2020,Federico Grijalba,"I've owned several speakers in my life, but this is the first smart speaker I buy. Here are the things I liked and disliked about this Echo Studio. Things I like: - The sound is excellent. Is not perfect and is not the best sound I heard in a speaker. Given the 199$ (or 169$ if on sale), this is great value for money. The bass is punchy but not extremely powerful, and the mids and treble are somewhat muffled and covered by the low frequencies. An adjustment with the Alexa app makes a big improvement. - The ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"" really gives the sound a nice touch. I can feel the speaker fill the room. - Alexa's voice recognition is almost perfect. It always heard me, even several ft away. The problem was when whispering. 30% of the time Alexa just wounldn't recognize me. - The ability to connect via Bluetooth to a phone or computer is simply a must. The Homepod does not have this capability, but Echo does. Things I don't like: - The sound is loud, but not as loud as one expects given the size and weight of the speaker. Other speakers are way smaller and give the same or more volume. - Alexa's skills may not work on all devices and/or regions. As an example: I have two smart switches from Xiaomi and I couldn't make them work with Alexa (I could with Google Assistant). Also, Spotify (and maybe even other platforms) is not functional in regions outside US or Europe. I live in Argentina and had to change my location before connecting Spotify with Alexa. Overall, given the price I'm absolutely pleased with the speaker.

(I got the studio when it went on sale for $169). I hooked up an echo dot to the sound bar so they would have equal amazon integration. They are both excellent values but the Studio sounded better for music. The sound was more balanced and was certainly better at lower volumes. The soundbar w/sub was great if played loudly but this was probably due to the impressive bass and when played at low/mid volumes the bass either dominated or just didn't fit with what the bar was putting out. The studio's bass was sufficient for me but I could always add the sub down the road. We ended up hooking it up through a firestick and now our TV plays through it as well.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jun 2020,Bosleydawg,"First off, I have owned virtually every echo device since inception.  I will make this a short and sweet review for you.  I can appreciate and do like my echo 3rd generation but if I had to do it all over again, I would pass on it and go straight to the Echo studio.  I know, I know.... the price.  Well, simply put... bigger, better, louder and the foot print of the device is good.  Its not too big and its not too small.  It also has a built in hub and I believe it has the appropriate value proposition for what you get. Read the reviews, Take a deep breath of air, relax and have realistic expectations, and you won't be disappointed.  If you love Amazon and like their products, then you will love this one.  This is what I do with everything  I purchase and I am rarely dissatisfied as everything has pros and cons.",Skip the 3rd gen Echo and get this!!!!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2020,Tim C. Edgerly,"I bought a pair of these for two reasons. First, to use with Amazon Music HD for which they are excellent, but secondly as an experiment which was successful. In my eighth decade I began to recognize hearing difficulties with the dialects in BritBox and AcornTV. Realizing that hearing aids would be a good idea, I purchased some last summer which helped some. This year I wondered if it also might be my 50 year old six foot high speaker arrays. These speakers work well for music, but, due to aging components, don't clarify dialogue. The Echo Studios restore the crisp dialogue that I want.  Now, depending on the program material, I can choose to use either system, but I certainly could get by with the Echo Studios alone.",The experiment is successful!

Something with decent sound, however, I didn't want to get a sound bar with a separate subwoofer.  I read about this new speaker and I thought it would be the perfect solution, not quite.  You are able to connect this to your Cube of Amazon 4k fire steak and connect wirelessly and the sound is good, however, your are only able to access the full sound potential through the input for you Amazon Fire device.  So  if you have not cut the cord and are still using cable you are not able to access the full sound potential on that input.  I did order the 3.5 optical cable and plug that in but the sound was not good.  I heard no difference in the volume set at 5 or 10.  The sound is definitely better through the Amazon device. I called tech support and they were not much help.  The answered I received was, I don't know if that would work some people say it does and good for them.

The sound quality is middle of the pack, not bad but honestly very little noticeable difference between this and my much smaller and older Alexa device. My biggest issue is that the device won’t play Spotify after 3 songs. It just stops. I can reopen Spotify and resume playing where the device stopped, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a hands free device. To be clear, I also have a google nest and it works perfectly with Spotify.  After contacting amazon Customer service and getting the run around, I’ve learned that “they’re aware of this issue and working very hard to fix it”. A quick google search indicates that this has been an issue since 2018, so their crack squad of IT folks are perhaps on a 2 year vacation.

With the equalizer adjusted all the way(which is a joke because there’s only three settings bass, mid range and treble) the sound is like a $25 blue tooth speaker you buy at Walmart. I purchased 2 of these and now they are basically echo device. If you’re seriously considering getting this because you think it will be a 360 surroundsound experience or something of that nature you will be heavily disappointed. My problem is I bought these didn’t use them right away and once I started I only had a week to play with them. And now it’s too late to return them. I would rate the current value of each one of these devices at no more than $50 and the price is only that high because you can use them as a hub. Huge disappointment again. This was their second attempt at some cool surround sound with a Alexa hub I don’t know if anybody remembers the echo bass speaker, but that actually sounds better. Amazon makes a lot of good products,  This one though they got completely wrong again. Please Amazon if you decide to make another version of this have some of your quality control guys listen to the device before they sell it on the market. And if those guys don’t come out of that room after listening to the music with a smile on their face then you know you did not get the speaker right again.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2020,Joe,"Ended up replacement my high end Surround sound stereo and speakers for 2 of these and a sub woofer.  These sound nice, while not as high end as Amazon would like to make you believe but still very nice,  My wife and I are happy with the choice,  as these are so much smaller than my stereo and speakers and with far less wires!  All in all it was a good choice and a HUGE upgrade from the previous Echos.  If I were still i my 20's I would say the sound quality is not good enough for a stand alone music system, but I am in my 50's and do not hear as well as I used to anyway so these fit the bill nicely",Not a bad Choice

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2020,BraveNewWorld,This product is excellent in many respects. Everything most people would want to do with it it does very well. There are some caveats however: with Bluetooth the speaker volume is very low so you have to pretty much crank it up to max to stream audio from your devices to it. This means when you use Alexa it’s way too loud. There needs to be better control over various inputs as far as volume goes. Then the most disappointing: I wanted to use it for my television since it has optical audio in. I though great! Issue is that the lag time for the optical audio is ridiculous. You can’t watch movies or tv with it as the Audio source because of the delay. I’ve never seen a delay like this with optical audio and I am kind of irritated. If it’s paired with amazon’s products for streaming the software handles the delay but if you are using anything else you pretty much can’t use this for your television.,Overall very good however the input lag for the optical audio is awful

I wanted to get something to not only play music, but connect to my Fire TV that would sound like a soundbar or surround sound. I live in an apartment so a surround sound system with a subwoofer was out of the question. The Echo Studio not only looks beautiful, but the sound is rich, beautiful, packs a decent punch that’s not too much to disturb my neighbors, and it’s a plus that I can use Alexa and connect it with my other Echo devices. I also really like the feature that allows the Echo Studio to adapt to the acoustics in any room it’s in. I’m not an audiophile, but I do enjoy quality speakers and this definitely impressed me!! I’ve had many speakers in the last 5 years including a smaller Bose one, JBL, Harmon Kardon, cheap ones from Walmart/Target/Amazon/Five Below (you get the point), and the Echo Studio has the most crisp sound and perfect amount of bass for its price.

The Echo Studio sound quality is good and exceeds my expectation for a speaker of its size. Unfortunately, there are several bug issues associated with use of Bluetooth speakers. Most often when I disconnect the Bluetooth speaker use of the internal speaker will not resume and if you speak to the echo its light blinks as if responding but there is no sound. Also sometimes when I disconnect the Bluetooth speaker the Echo Studio will send its sound to another Echo in another room. Ultimately I will need to restart the Echo Studio. None of these issues are present on my other Echo Devices.

I had it paired up to my TV via optical/Toslink and this was alright but I couldn’t control the volume unless it was with voice commands. Not only that but it would have tons of white noise coming from the connection and I tried multiple different cables. So I decided to pair on home theater mode and it got even worse from there. The connection was fine and I could control the volume via the Fire tv remote but lip syncing issues began to occur. I couldn’t watch Twitch or YouTube. I could only watch Netflix and Prime video. I wanted to love the Echo studio so bad. The sounds it produced were so rich in bass, treble and etc. I read reviews from way earlier in the year talking about having the lip syncing issue.

Was about to buy the Echo 3rd Generation but opted for the bigger sound of the Studio and it did not disappoint! excellent build (built like a tank!) and sound quality impressive!

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2020,Tom H.,"I""ve had the second generation Echo alexa for a few years. Music was why I bought it. Since then Echo's features have been expanded.  Recently I found the new Studio. The best sound yet. We love it.  There's a lot of you tube reviews you can watch.  My only issue is the remote for the studio is not available. I was able to buy one for my older Echo, hoping it would work with the Studio. But no good. The remote is really needed. I don't think they made a TV without a remote in 30 years. Hard to yell commands to alexa when you have the volume cranked up. Other than that issue it's the best Echo Alexa music platform.  Come on Amazon, get this issue resolved.",Need a remote for the studio
Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jul 2020,48HD,"Sound is pretty good for such a compact speaker system.  The only thing I can say is in the instructions it states: "" For best sound place at least 6 feet from any wall"".  Well, that is most impractical for just about any room.  Six feet from a wall is usually also six feet from any AC outlet.  I guess if you can re-arrange the furniture to place the unit on an end table at the end of a couch, you could probably manage to meet this requirement.  But other than that I would say it provides a good sound and is easy to install and is functional.",Echo Studio Review

The echo studio has amazing sound quality while listening to music but when you ask Alexa something her response is not as loud as the 3rd gen dot.

The integration of Amazon Music Ultra HD lets this speaker shine. It has a bigger footprint than the Echo Plus it replaced. I wish the treble were a bit more pronounced, however. As for whole house Echo integration, it doesn't always recognize that I'm speaking to it rather than the Echo in the dining room one room over.

I keep it connected to the bedroom TV and I use it to play music every day. I saw some reviews about people having trouble playing music on it. I have had no issues at all. I tell it to play music on pandora or Spotify every day and it works great. Sounds great with movies too. I have considered getting the echo sub for added bass but it isn't really a necessity either because I have a full 5.1 home theater system in the living room if I really want to enjoy a movie. The echo studio works exceptionally well as a soundbar type of setup just sitting behind the bedroom TV and and I likely will put more of them in other rooms for multi room audio.,Exceeds my expectations

Definitely an upgrade from the Echo Plus, but I wouldn't call it 'studio'. Another downside is the zero visibility of the alexa light indicator on top of the Echo if you are not watching over the level of the device. Lets say, if you are sitting and the Echo is your eye level, you will not be able to see the indicator lights. On the plus side, the included ZigBee hub makes this a worthy upgrade from the Echo Plus. I think a more fittingly name for the Studio would be 'Echo Plus II'.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2020,Mark E. Poindexter,"I have been looking for a sound system that is comparable to Sonos 5 or HEOS 7. The Echo studio as a pair plus the subwoofer is the answer. I have heard from other reviews that the Echo studio as a pair without the sub are good. That’s true. But when you add the subwoofer, you really get the added “ umph” that compares to Sono or HEOS. The speakers pair easily. The subwoofer is a little harder but it connects with a little bit of fiddling. The other benefit is that you can run the pair in the same room for stereo or put one of them in another room for mono playback. Sometimes I play them together and if I throw a party, then I can move one to another room and they play the same music with both having Alexa capability.",Compare to Sonos or HEOS.

Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Sep 2020,manfredkwg,"Pro: Great sound compared to other echo devices. Con: Needs a way to select input source. It has a optical input but you cannot choose source, like telling Alexa to play music vs the optic input device. I had to unplug and/or reset the device constantly for it to work with an optical connection. I ended up not using the optical input... Which means I need another speaker. Another con is that it looks pretty ugly. No sandstone option... Why did they try to make it look like a huge dot? Overall if you're replacing an echo or echo dot, this sounds way better.

In addition to listening to music (streamed or bluetoothed), I also use it as a ""soundbar"" for my TV. There are two issues though... the first is that the Echo Studio can not hear you when the volume is turned way up (understandable, but it should have come with at least a simple dedicated remote), the second is that several times per week it stops working altogether and has to be unplugged to be restarted... not real good for a device that is intended to be on 24/7.",A Really Good Device with Some Shortcomings
