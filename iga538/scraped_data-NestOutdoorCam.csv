Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2019,DoctorMD17,"Get a different brand. We have had this for 2 years and there are many things wrong. First, it doesn’t pick up all motion outside. Sometimes I’m waiting to get the notification that I was just on my porch and nothing. Second, you can’t make out anything at night. We had a couple strings of car break-ins and this thing was of no use to police. And lastly, the icing on the cake, they BREAK! Ours broke for the first time a few months ago. The wire shorted and customer service said it was just normal weathering. They sent us a new wire. Last week, it stopped working completely, AGAIN. After over an hour with customer service they sent us just the camera but no new adapter, so, again, totally useless. Now we will have to spend another 1-2 hours with customer service for another mediocre fix. Not to mention, they don’t do priority mail, so now we’re still without a camera for another week. They also don’t credit you the monthly fee you pay for the service, even when their service doesn’t work. We’re moving in the near future and will be switching security camera companies.",Had for 2 Years: Terrible Long-Term Quality & Service

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2017,Kristofer r Miller,"This is probably my most regretted investment in a long time.  It may be because I am ignorant and didn't know this has a 100% required to be useful subscription service.  AFTER you already pay a price higher than any other cameras on the market. It is totally awesome when you first get it and have the 10 day recording.  But after it becomes almost completely useless.  It starts spamming you notification every time the sun shifts, or if there are squirrels in your yard, or literally anything.  Than it only gives you snap shots for the last 3 hours, that seem to not even catch anything and it seems to even be a lower resolution and is less responsive after the subscription.  I tested this by leaving the door my camera is watching at a normal pace multiple times, only to either get a picture of the door after it has closed, or to get maybe my arm or the back of my head, but never anything that would be useful if I were to be robbed. Again, the camera itself has a lot of potential, but the fact that they tie this already expensive product to a subscription that at minimum costs you 100, a year, not including the cost of purchase. In addition, you can get some home security systems installed and serviced for aa similar price to the equipment breakdown of Nest with 1 camera running a 30 day recording.  Only difference is, for the 66 a month you pay for a security company, they actually put  sensors on multiple doors, often a few cameras. This just feels like Nest wanted to utilize the Cell phone marketing strategy, of sell you something that is super powerful, but unless you pay them for a subscription, your very useful thing becomes unusable.  The only way I feel this would be morally acceptable is if it were a rental or exclusively a service, where you didn't purchase equipment that you expected to have a reasonable value. I figured I would at least be able to use this as a security camera I could record to my own storage locally.  However, you can't without a lot of hoops and purchasing 3rd party software. In addition, there have been a lot of articles about how easy it is to hack into a Nest camera, since it is wireless.  And since it is easier to hack into the camera, that means anyone who want's to that has the knowledge, can enter your personal network through your now useless security camera and then have access to the rest of your network. If you sell a product... at least be openly blunt about how tethered it is to your personal subscriptions. To me this feels like buying a vacuum cleaner, that works for a month as advertised, then sends you a message saying you can no longer store any  dirt in the vacuum, and the motor will no longer turn as fast, and will only be functional as a heavy broom at best until you purchase the subscription to the hardware you already purchased and own. I really wanted to love this, and if you don't care about having a company lock your personally owned hardware to a  subscription service, which makes it almost impossible to use 3rd party non subscription services without making your  security footage publicly available, then recording it at a lower quality from a live stream... then this is an awesome product.  I just can't justify this purchase to anyone, when you can use the same third party software, and make rasbarry pi security camera array of multiple cameras, that you can record to your own storage (on or off site) for the same or less money.  Yes it will have a few less frills, but this is a security camera, not a toy.","I wanted to love this, But became Aware (pun intended) of some issues"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Aug 2020,Travis Huber,"I had 2 of the 4 cameras that I bought installed at my house, the first few days into about the second week was great. That soon came to an end when we started looking at them when it got dark. The night vision on these doesn't allow me to see to the end of my deck, about 20 ft, or the end of my driveway, again about 20 ft. I was also trying to get away from a system that only had a subscription service, I thought that I would be able to gook this into a system that I could store locally not in the cloud. I was wrong and severely disappointed. The cameras are overpriced for what you get and only allow screenshots that may or may not catch the motion if you decide to not pay for Nest Aware. Now to motion detection, these cameras think everything that moves is a noteworthy event. A bird flying by? Notification! Shadow moves just right? Notification! Wind blowing the trees around? NOTIFICATION!! you cannot see dead zones or any sort of AI detections without Nest Aware. Picture quality now. So, you bought a 1080 camera what do you expect? Well, I thought better than what I got. I will be getting 4k cameras to install with my system over 1080 after having these 3 short weeks. All in all, if you want to have cameras that integrate into your Google Home system these, in theory, would be great but you do need to pay the monthly or yearly fee for Nest Aware and I would recommend getting the 4k cams instead of these 1080 ones. I cannot recommend these cameras to anyone who does not have a Google Home setup as I would even have a hard time recommending them to someone who has one. One last thing, you are not able to view all of your cameras at once, only one at a time. This was a big issue for me as I wanted to have a monitor that had cameras up at all times.",Returned product- Here is why.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jan 2019,Brad,After researching many of the options for outdoor security cameras I decided on the Nest option.  So far so good.  I originally purchased the 2 camera pack and installed them outside my front and back doors.  The front door was a bit more challenging as I needed to go up the wall and into the attic for the power source but in the end with good planning it went well.  Both cameras are working great and give us a good look at the areas they cover.  We are so happy we have decided to get a 3rd camera to give coverage of our driveway.  These are really nice cameras  and we are very happy.  My suggestion is to plan your placement of the camera and how you will power it carefully before starting.,It works
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2019,Phil,"Lots of positives: - Camera performance is very good - Motion detection is very good - Service reliability is very good But the big downside is the massive amounts of broadband video the cameras take. - These cameras can take 400GB per month!  With Two of them, you could be using 800GB.  Comcast has a limit of 1TB, after that they charge you $10 for every 10 GB of data. - You can lower the bandwidth used to 100GB, but then the video quality drops dramatically. What nest/google needs to do is to add a device that you can put on your home network to record video locally, and then have a subscription for a certain amount of data uploaded to the cloud. I now have many of these cameras. I have had to turn off recording for most of them because of this massive bandwidth consumption problem. Nest / Google is clearly short sighted.  I'm sure I will start to replace these cameras overtime with cameras that do a better job with local storage.",Watch your internet bill.  Consumes excessive amounts of data!

In August 2019, they announced (the same day of the changes) that they were taking away the ability to turn off the camera status lights ""for greater transparency and privacy in your home"".  They should be turned off for outdoor security cameras in particular as this is like advertising to thieves and trespassers where your cameras are to avoid or steal them.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Jun 2020,BC,"Camera seems to be OK quality, however is lacking a key piece of functionality, hence a reason for returning the product and giving it a 2 star rating. Push notifications to your mobile phone can  only be set up to 'always' or when I am not home (based on your phone location). When you think about it, those 2 options are not really useful in majority of circumstances. Either you get spammed continuously with alerts (like kids going in and out of house continuously), or you are not getting notifications when you are home (let's say at night). I would have to continuously open up the app, change settings to what I need multiple times a day to get what I need. Even my few years old Samsung outdoor camera has  a schedule you can set - for example, only send notifications on workdays between 9-5PM (when I am at work) and during night 11PM-6AM while I am sleeping to know if someone is around the house).","OK, but lacking key functionality, hence returning the product."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Feb 2018,E. Gaston,"Good at first, then becomes terrible VERY quickly once your return/trial period is over. Really wanted to like this item, and I would have written a glowing review during the 30 day Nest Aware trial period.  Installation was relatively easy (more on that later), and the app worked wonderfully, as did viewing of historic footage.  Clearly my home internet was quite capable of delivering the upstream needed, and I viewed the cam from a number of different apps and internet connections without issue and with very limited buffering (1-2 seconds at the most, one time).  Alerts worked great. After the trial period ended and Nest charged me for my first month of service, everything went downhill.  Alerts stopped firing.  Viewing live was impossible.  Viewing historic footage became impossible.  The buffering wheel became my best friend.  Nest said it was my internet connection, either on the camera or wherever I was connecting from.  Nothing had changed on my home network, and I was accessing the camera over 50+ gig LTE and from a business fiber connection, same as before the paid period started, along with the issues.  This was NOT on my end, but they refused to continue to help me because it was an internet issue ""on my end"".  Throughput on my home network is the same as it was a month ago.  My downstream speeds are the same at the other locations as they were a month ago. From here, Nest basically ignored the issue, and a quick search reveals this is NOT an uncommon problem.  Think about millions of these cameras, each uploading 300 GB of data per month, and millions of users trying to stream that data--I just don't think Nest has the hardware infrastructure to serve that sort of data load, and the company just gives you a ""priority lane"" during the trial period to fool you into thinking the service is reliable until your return period has ended. As to installation--Everything was easy and straightforward except for the power cable design.  On one end is a huge white block of plastic--the camera.  On the other, a huge white block of plastic surrounding a USB plug in the interest of weatherproofing it.  This is a wire you're going to have to pass through an opening in your house's structure, and they made the thing nearly an inch in diameter, requiring you to drill a MUCH larger hole than is actually necessary.  Luckily, I was able to go in through a plastic attic vent in the eave and down through sheetrock, but it was far more complicated than it should have been, since I was replacing a camera with a normal DC barrel connector wire and had to enlarge all the pass-throughs. Also, watch your fingers around the magnet mount.","Good at first, then becomes terrible VERY quickly once your return/trial period is over due to provider issues on backend"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2019,Roberta Thomas,"Daytime recording is very nice and crisp, but I feel that nighttime vision is just so-so. It will pick up a bug flying by at night, but doesn't pick me up when I am outside with the dog. Either way, the camera will alert you to motion, voices, dog barking, birds calling, leaves blowing, cars passing by.  You can set this up so that it isn't as sensitive to leaves and birds, but then you might lose out on other aspects of what you bought it for. You can also set ""zones"" to where you adjust the camera to certain areas of your yard, pointing towards your door (for instance), etc. It has a lot of ways to tweak the set up so that you are happy with where it is pointing.  We purchased three of these cameras with the option of being able to turn off the glowing green light that shows that the camera is recording but recently Google changed this option and you can no longer turn this off, which means that when it is recording, it glows.  I have called the company and they suggest placing a piece of electrical tape over the green light so that no one can see it glowing green. If you are looking for something more discreet, and don't want a light to glow while recording, or if you are looking for excellent night vision, research other cameras before you buy this one.","Cannot disable the status light, night vision is so-so"

As part of that commitment, we explained that you will always see a clear visual indicator when your Nest cameras are on and sending video and audio to Nest. So we’re changing how the status lights function on Nest cameras, Dropcam, and Nest Hello. You will be able to dim the light on your camera, but it will always be on when the camera is on. We’re doing this to make sure you, and those around your camera, are aware when the camera is on and recording. Starting today, we’re rolling out the following changes: • In Settings for all Nest cameras and Nest Hello, the ability to turn off the status light will be removed. Instead, you’ll be able to dim the status light. When the camera is on, the status light will glow green. • For Dropcam, the setting to turn off the status light will be removed. When the camera is on, the status light will glow blue. • On Nest Cam, Dropcam, and Nest Hello, the status light will blink when the camera’s live video is streamed from the Nest app. The setting to turn this off will be removed.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Aug 2020,Braden gallucci,"This is not a good product considering the cost. If u are fully invested in nest then you are s#%t out of luck. Other wise try a different company and save yourself the DAILY headaches. After i received the replacement cameras one no longer goes off line but the other one is at least twice a day. I find that the issue is not my wifi but in fact the camera because when I try to reconnect it to wifi even the app can not find the camera with me standing right next to it the only way to get it back on line is to unplug it for 5 min then plug it back it and it will work until it looses signal again. The twice daily or more loss of connection has made me put in for replacement cameras. We shall see how it goes. Another update: I think I should have stayed away from these cameras every day I receive notice that one or the other camera has been off line for more then 10 min, every single day. As I do not have issues with the other 2 nest cams or any of my other smart home devices going off line I have to assume that this is due to poor quality. For the cost of the cameras they should be much much better quality. Google's customer service is 100% non existent. Not to say you can not get a hold of someone it's just that they really dont care about there customers they have your money so what more do they need to do. I have a gig of internet no caps or slowdowns so when customer service says it's my internet connection there just trying to push the blame on to the customer. Take it or leave it but dont say you have not been warned. Update: cameras are off line on a regular basis none on my other cameras including nest indoor and hello doorbell never go off line dont know if uts an issue with google or the cameras but the fact that only theses cameras go off line I have to assume it's the cameras. The cameras are just fine. The app is down right horrible and customer service is no where to be found. My biggest concern is changing wifi means you MUST uninstall the camera and reskan the qr code. So my camera above my garage I new have to go back up and reskan the bar code just to change the wifi that literally makes no sense. Can someone on this planet please inform me why I need to reskan the code! According to Google it's just they way it is. That is the answer after 3hrs mostly on hold with customer service. I really hope google sells nest to anyone else because NEST used to be a great product with fantastic customer service.",Expensive poorly made products
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Nov 2017,Whatever,"Updated: 01/29/18. My subscription was about to end and I was planning to cancel.  But then I noticed that Nest updated the iPhone app from 5.15 to 5.17 within the last couple months. So I decided to give Nest another chance. I deleted the Nest app and reinstall the latest update (I decided to delete the app to make sure I have a clean install). I also reset/reconfigured my 4 cameras. And finally, I factory reset my Ubiquiti network equipment. It took my entire weekend to reconfigure everything. It was painful but I didn't want to dump my $1K investment without one last ditch to make it work. AND.... it works. I have been monitoring it for the last few weeks. Video buffering (blue ring of death) is much quicker (less than 5 seconds most of the time. Prior to the fix was 60+ seconds all the time). App responds quicker on wifi and LTE. The overall experience is much better (day to night comparison).  I am not sure what fixed or resolved my issue with the Nest Cloud services. It could be the new updates from Nest or some bad original configs in the cameras or the network. It could be the fact that I reset/rebooted everything solved the problem too. Anyway, I am glad that it has been working for the past few weeks. I have changed my rating to 4 stars since I am satisfied how the entire Nest system is working for me at this time. Orginal review: 11/14/17 1 star - I bought 4 outdoor Nest cameras. I have 200Mb Up/Down internet. I have the Ubiquiti network gears and APs. This review is after 9+ months of usage. These 1080p cameras are very good during the daytime and nighttime. The live feed and video recording are very clean and sharp. The speaker on the camera is louder than all other cameras I had in the past. The microphone is sensitive enough to pick up faint sound in the surrounding area. Setup was simple enough. If this review is all about the cameras ONLY, then I would give the rating of 4 stars (I hate the fat power cords, that I had to drill some big holes through my walls to get the UBS dongles through.)  However, this review is about the cameras and the cloud services as a complete system/ecosystem. My issues are mostly with the cloud services. Nest aware is okay on most features. However, on a typical bright day with a slight breeze in my backyard, the sun casts shadows of moving trees branches. Nest would send me tons of alert notifications. I have turned off this notification out of annoyance. Video recording works very well but my BIGGEST complaint is about accessing the live feeds (technically, there is about a 1 - 2 second delay due to Internet latency) or the recorded videos. Most of the time, I get the blue rings (video buffering). I usually have to wait between 30 - 60 seconds. If I wait more than 60 seconds, I usually close out and restart the app. This issue has been happening on iPhone 6s, 7, or on my PCs. The problem happens when I am using home wifi, work wifi, or out around about on LTE. It happens all the time. My most frustrating times were during the events when I needed to check for the alerts right away, by the time I got to the live feed, 60 seconds already passed. Then I tried to access the recording, I waited for another 30 – 60 seconds. Imagine at 2 AM, you receive an alert in a zone that suppose to be cleared. You click on the Nest app on your phone and you see the blue ring for couple minutes. I can tell you though couple minutes seem like a very long time. :( The subscriptions for 4 cameras are not cheap with Nest. I am okay with the cost but I want the services to work at least 99% of the time without the annoying blue circles. Without the Nest cloud services, these cameras are just paperweights. I searched Nest website and forum for a solution. What recommended was to turn down the video quality.  Are you kidding me? I bought $200 per camera and paid expensive subscription fees and I need to turn down the video quality to work better. FYI - my 200MB up/down Internet and $1K network are not the problems. Unless Nest addresses their cloud performance issues, I am hoping to save some of you some money and time. If you think I did something wrong, I would love to hear some recommendations, if I get better performance, I will be more than glad to change this review to positive. Best wishes, Mike",Outdoor Camera is great. Nest Cloud Services okay.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Feb 2020,Bigfoot,"I bought four nest outdoor camera with the wrong understanding, which I read from the web, that the subscription cost for all camera would be $5/month for all cameras. Apparently that’s no longer the case and the new nest sense subscription is per camera based. I would never pay hundreds of dollars a year for camera subscription. Now I don’t know what to do with the cameras since they only records three hours and are pretty dumb camera without the subscriptions. Google provided the net sense trial subscription without asking for my consent, without asking for my credit card number, and without explaining to me the feature difference with and without the subscription. By doing so, they took away my right to evaluate the camera without the subscription in the 30 day product return windows. In other words, Google tricked me in keeping the cameras passed the return deadline without experiencing the cameras without subscription.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jun 2018,COREYTOWN,"I freaking love these cameras. Over the past couple years, I've been slowly transforming my house into a smart home. Every light bulb in my house is a Phillips Hue color bulb - not relevant to this review but I'm just letting you know. Get good. I knew I'd eventually get cameras but everytime I tried to do research on them I got overwhelmed by all the different options, brands, and minutiae. I would eventually just say UGHHHHH and quit researching. Finally I decided I'd just buy these things and if I didn't like them or something, I'd send em back. I'm so glad that I did. These things are awesome. I installed them myself, it was so much easier than I thought it would be! The trick to get the cord in your attic from where you want to install them is to tape the camera's cord to something called a ""glow rod"" (I noticed they were also called fiberglass wire pull rods and or fish tape in my research), then feed it into the attic through the hole you drilled that's located on that part of your roof that juts out from the outside wall of your house.  Before I installed these cameras I had no idea what a glow rod was, shoutout to that guy that made that youtube video that time. If you've ever went camping and put up one of those dome shaped tents - those flexible rods that join together to hold the tent's structure are basically glow rods. So, if you have one of those tents in your storage room, save yourself a trip to home depot and just use the tent's rod. I'd recommend putting a piece of tape around where each segment combines though, you wouldn't want them to come apart while you're in the attic feeding it to yourself, if the rod was to get stuck while you're pulling it to yourself in the attic and comes apart, you might have to crawl somewhere really cramped and scary to get it. I prefer Google stuff, as opposed to Alexa (sorry Amazon, you know I love you girl). All the TVs in my house have Chromecasts hooked up to them and I have a Google Home speaker in basically every room (am I on your nerves yet? because I'm on mine). Thus, I just have to say ""Hey google, show [what I named that specific camera] on [the name of the specific TV's chromecast I want it to display on] and Google will reply, ""Okay, streaming ABC camera on 123 TV.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Feb 2017,R. Marko,I will start with the negative. I am very disappointed with the resolution because I can not read a license plate 30 feet away. With 1080P I should be able to recognize people and read a license plate in daylight. It is set to 1080p and doesn't have the picture I was expecting. At night you can't recognize people at all. You can see someone is there but can't make out who it is (unless they are standing directly in front of the camera). The plus is it notifies me if there is any movement or if a person is spotted. My wife is addicted to watching our chickens and ducks fly around. I can see when family members get home. The service is great and very affordable. Extremely easy to setup.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2016,Amazon Customer,"Had to revise this review after a few months of use.  As others have pointed out, if you don't subscribe to Nest Aware, the camera is VERY LIMITED.  You will get notifications of events but they appear as snapshots and half the time you can't get them to play.  So MAYBE you have an event with something in it and maybe you can play the event to see everything.  Also, after 12 hours the events are gone.  It looks like Nest Aware makes all these issues go away but if you don't want to spend $10 per month for that, don't buy this camera. Prior review:  Happy with the camera.  Install was pretty easy.  One reviewer already pointed out that a smaller plug on the cord or way to disconnect cord would be nice.  As it is now designed you must drill a 5/8"" hole or larger to thread the plug through (even though the cable is much smaller).  Picture quality is quite good.  Slight delay but not too bad.  The one other think that prevented me from putting 5 stars is the constant reminder in the app that I can upgrade my storage.  I know that, I'm not going to do it, so stop reminding me.  It gets really annoying to x out of that message over and over again.",The longer I have it the more disappointed I have become
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Oct 2016,Cartoon Head,"Just as easy to install and setup as the other indoor Nest Cams. The installation concept, however, isn't really practical (for us anyway). The cam just connects to the holder by a magnet (just like the indoor cams).  You run the hard-connected USB wire along your siding/wall, etc. and they give you nice strong plastic wire clips.  That wire run (about 15' I think) ENDS at a GIGANTIC 3/4"" permanently attached USB connector and weatherproof surround.  The concept is, you connect that into a 2"" round hub which is permanently attached to another 10-15' power cable, and you run THAT to the nearest outdoor outlet. Problem is, our closest outdoor outlet is 100' away on the opposite side of the house!  So we always knew we'd need to drill through the wall.  But the only way to do this is to drill a 3/4"" hole to feed that USB connector through.  NO WAY that's happening! So I built an insert for our vinyl window.  Two pieces of square type 1-1/2"" PVC cut to insert into the window frame (just like the sliding window).  A small 5/16"" x 1/8"" channel cut into the top of one.  Feed the flat outdoor cable through that channel, then screw the two PVC blocks together.  Originally I had the cam installed right in front of that, but that blocked install of the screen.  So instead I ran the flat cable under the screen, off to the side where there was a drainage slit anyway.  Inside, everything mounts to the same PVC.  I probably could have kept that off to the side too (2.0 version), but this works better for me.  (See photos.)  The result is a very clean install, no drilling through walls. ***************** UPDATED 1/10/2018:  We bought into the product hard-core.  We have 4 outdoor cams and 3 indoor, plus 4 of their smoke detectors, all on subscription.  (Yes, VERY expensive... but this is our home security.)  The service, however, has been a disappointment.  It is not usual for us to get an ALERT for movement, then when we go to review it... nothing but the WAIT circle animation.  In a critical situation, it can be 5-10 minutes later that we can connect in and see what HAPPENED 10 minutes ago.  And it's not cell phone carrier delay or anything.  Same thing happens when sitting at a WIRED connection to the web.  So it's the SERVICE that is unresponsive.  The SERVICE that we are paying $400 a year for ($50 fee + 7 times $50 per cam).  This is unacceptable. Really, this is a great product, but SO RIPE for competition.  Aspiring competitors take note:  Build THIS system with a LOCAL ""cloud server"" type 2-Tb+ hard drive (that are common place today) to store ALL of the digital video, have THAT accessible via the WEB or LOCAL (it's YOUR video, stored there IN YOUR HOUSE), and enable optional WIRED connection for all cams (where a wired port is less than 15' away), and you can DOMINATE the marketplace. Because clearly the storage of video and streaming it instantly to customers is where Nest (GOOGLE!!!) is failing.  Allow for an optional IN-HOUSE storage of video and it's a game changer. We're considering replacing the entire system with a wired security/cam option, treating this as a ""prototype"" for better security systems (but we DO NOT want to pay for ""monitoring"".  Thank you, we can do our OWN monitoring.) A great disappointment to an otherwise terrific product.",Great addition to the 3-cam indoor set - But be aware of installation issue
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Jan 2020,Momma Bear,"I have had my nest cams for over 2 years. Here is the good, the bad and the ugly. The good: overall, I am satisfied with the resolution. However, you can not acquire an image at night if you place the cam behind a window due to significant glare. The camera otherwise works as it should with good tech support if trouble surfaces. The bad: beware of nest aware. It borders on shady at best. After 5 months of a 12 month paid subscription, my nest aware stopped working. To add insult to injury, nest will auto renew your subscription (and charge whatever credit card it has  on file) and choose a random camera to assign the subscription to. It is time consuming to address and requires customers to monitor charges closely. I actually thought this was a fraudulent charge and then realized it was Nest. The ugly: nest has suffered significant security breaches in the last year with hackers doing a variety of ugly things with family cams. Nest has attempted to address this with two factor authentication but in bringing this technology into a home, families have to worry about another  layer of cyber security. My general assessment is that while the nest hardware is good, the nest aware needs close monitoring to avoid inappropriate charges. Lastly, cyber security remains a major concern.",Beware of Nest Aware

The image quality is terrific.  The features are rich and powerful, although you have to pay a pretty hefty monthly fee to take full advantage of its capabilities.  Installation is very straightforward, with one huge caveat.  If you are going push the cable through a wall to access inside power (and have a nice, clean installation without a bunch of wires crawling all over the outside of your home) you have two choices.  (1) Drill an enormous hole in your outside wall to accommodate the non-removable waterproof housing on the end of the USB cable.  (2) Cut the USB cable, which allows you to drill a very, very small hole, and splice it back together inside your house.  We went with (2) and are very happy with the results. Two things to bear in mind if you go the same route that we did.  First, cutting the cable will void your warranty.  Second, you only have to splice the red and black power lines, since the shielded data lines are not used by this WiFi-enabled camera. One last point, if you do decide to cut and splice, you can discard the huge (weather resistant) transformer that comes with the device.  Any standard 5V/1A USB wall outlet will suffice.",Great Camera if You Cut and Splice
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Dec 2016,Terminex,"A couple points -requires a subscription to get real usability out of it.  No option to record to your own local pc. -subscriptions are expensive if you have multiple cameras.  I bought 2 (front door / back door) -installation options are limited due to the size of the usb connector on the end of the camera cord & the requirement for an outlet. -packaging is simple and great, just like thermostats (i have 2 and installed them in my parents, and sisters houses, as well as several friends) -they include everything you need including cable clamps & screws.  (Seems minor, but not having to go to the store for these is an important detail that some companies miss) -video is clear -Amazon did not list the outdoor temperature range -4 to 104 I wanted something that would allow me to watch for package deliveries while away from home, and record them.  The ability to talk to people at the fron door was a nice bonus. Installation was fairly easy, except i could not install it exactly where i wanted as the cord was not long enough to reach the outlet.  That was compromise number 1. I also could not install it in any of the best secondary locations, as you have to screw in the mount.  This is not a good option if you have concrete siding like me.  This required me to find a location that had some wood trim i could mount it on. (This limitation will be shared with ANY camera mount that needs to be screwed in.) -the camera does not provide video (live or recorded) without a subscription.  This was not noted anywhere in the description before i bought it.  THIS is my biggest problem.  You spend a good amount of money on several of the cameras, but then you have to spend more per year to actually use it. This is the huge failure in my view.  (It is all about perspective). I was one of the first people to get the nest thermostat.  I paid an outrageous amount of money at the time for 2 of them.  I do NOT have to pay any monthly or yearly fees to use them. This is what was in my head when i purchased these.  Nest customer services is AWESOME for my thermostats.  They work well.  I was looking for the same key nd of experience with the nest oudoor cam. If it wasn't for the subscription service i could deal with the other issues, but the monthly or yearly service to make the cameras useful is a deal breaker for me.",Requires expensive service to be useful

The review below was written while using a substandard DSL provider and now the Nest Outdoor Cam is working fantastic. No longer slower video and playback problems lag in notifications. I would not recommend this unit unless you have a decent internet speed to really appreciate the camera and it’s features. I had been wanting one for a while and wasn’t sure my crappy internet speed on DSL was fast enough to handle it and finally decided to go for it and pulled the trigger and buy it. It works and really hasn’t hogged my bandwidth and it’s great to keep a eye out for mail deliveries and packages left while we are out, seeing who’s at the door while inside and now watching what critters frequent the yard deer, raccoons etc, the nest cam is mounted up above our garage door under the roof line and is set on our driveway and sidewalk leading to the front door. It will pick up anything depending on settings and your zones you select. Great picture quality, very good night vision sensitivity and picture and no one spots it and the microphone feature to speak to someone is handy and was needed during a 911 call to advise a responder that the front door was locked, but entry could be made through the rear door during a medical situation while I was rushing home. I considered the Ring doorbell but the Nest Cam provided the view I was after..our driveway entrance, sidewalk and front door.

We have 3 cameras an all of them have several false positives every day. Unfortunately no way to unplug the wire from the camera itself. So if you run the wires through the walls down in the basement etc, and put silicone to seal it, if and when you have to replace the camera that will be a bit of a nightmare since you can't just swap out the camera and keep the cable. It automatically blurs out license plates so if someone parks in your driveway you won't be able to call the police with their license plate number. Every few weeks they disconnect from the wifi and go offline for a moment even though everything else in the house continues to work fine. The biggest issue is no HomeKit support. That all being said currently its your best option if you need such an outdoor cam now. Otherwise I'd recommend waiting a bit until they fix all the false positives and release an updated version with HomeKit and a removable cable.",Best on the market but that's not saying a lot
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2019,Warby Warburton,"First off, the cameras themselves are very good.  Great quality.  Solid construction.  Excellent installation instructions with careful consideration to making the install neat and secure.  If you follow their instructions and paint the wire itself, it nearly disappears which is nice. The problem is some of the more advanced features don't live up to their claims.  I recently replaced seven Ring cameras (which I loved for the solar power option) with seven Nest cameras.  The cameras are all outdoor including one doorbell. I was paying $100 per year for 60 days of Ring history on seven cameras.  With Nest I am paying $230 for only *five* days of history.  The difference is Nest records everything and Ring only records activity.  The idea is Nest has all the history but intelligently alerts you only about the important stuff. But that's the problem.  Those alerts don't work very well: 1: lots of lag It can take 5-10 seconds before I get even a simple doorbell alert on my phone.  That's a long time for someone to wait for you to answer.  Same with other alerts - too long to get an alert.  With Ring, it was 2-3 seconds. 2: smart alerts don't work I was so excited to stop getting alerts every time my dogs ran past the camera or barked.  But I have 100s of alerts that Nest spotted a person in my backyard only to click on the app and watch a video of my dog running by.  Same for the camera detecting someone talking.  Turns out to be dogs barking 99% of the time. 3: Facial recognition on the more expensive cameras just doesn't work. I get the Nest saw someone new message over and over for the same people in my family.  Light level is good, camera angle is good, it just doesn't work.  Any variation in clothing, the person's position, etc. throws off the recognition. My last two issues aren't about alerts but rather about the lack of a Ring Chime equivalent and no solar power option. It would be nice if Nest had a small device to make a doorbell sound at the back of the house without having to install a smart speaker.  Ring has a very inexpensive chime device the size of a USB charger that plugs in anywhere and uses wifi to just make the door bell sound anywhere in your house.  Great, simple feature. And having a small solar panel with a batter in the camera is a great feature on Ring that makes installations much simpler when there is no power nearby. I'll probably stick with Nest despite paying more than double the annual cost for 1/12 the storage duration solely because of the better video quality but I'm very disappointed with their cloud based features - they just don't work.",Would be worth the price if it did everything it claimed

The connectivity issues kill the deal for me, though.  One camera went offline for no apparent reason a few days after install, and I can't seem to get it back online.  I've disconnected and reconnected, used the home WiFi support, and so on.  It's not the WiFi - I can stand underneath the camera, and watch myself from another camera nearby.  I've gone through the menus and help (which are not fun to navigate, and not helpful.)  I've tried their chat and called, but so far haven't gotten the chat to work - it took so long to answer the chat I had moved on.  Resetting my home WiFi as per their menu suggestion knocked another camera offline, (I managed to get that on back online.) If you do have to reset that WiFi, you have to go within bluetooth range of the camera, take a picture of the code in back (which seems to take a while to get it into focus), and go through an entire reset cycle; so if you have it in a place that is hard to reach you have to get a ladder every time it resets when your WiFi resets. Called customer support multiple times; the menu's led to long waits that eventually just dropped (on their end.)  When I finally got through, they made me jump through a lot of hoops; after getting dropped again after being put on hold got escalated to their level 2 support which was unhelpful and disappointing; I still have one broken camera and no apparent concern from Nest on the issue. In short, a potentially good product, but if they don't fix the WiFi and customer support issues I would save yourself the headache.","Flakey wifi connectivity, bad customer service kills any value"

First, I believe they are the best cameras available to the DIY consumer. Still learning the software and how to localize it's sensitivity to a designated zone. The cameras pick up all motions, sounds and activity, I ran into a problem after my wifi went down and I couldn't get the cameras back on line. I was told by customer support that since I changed my wifi password I had to re-scran each camera's bar code, like I did when they were originally set up. So, I had to reclimb the ladder to get to each camera. NOTE: Each camera has a bar code for scanning and beneath the code is a serial number. Customer support never informed me that these serial numbers work the same as the bar code. NOTE to consumer. Write down the seral number for each camera and avoid the need to rescan if it ever becomes necessary. This will save you a lot of inconvenice.

I bought this to replace a Foscam Camera I had and I was not disappointed. The quality of the design is top notch. It is rugged, clean and sturdy. It comes with an exceptionally long power cable so you can reach a distant outlet. My closest outlet was 10 feet away and I needed about 16 feet of cable to reach it if I wanted to route it neatly off to the side. I got there with several feet of extra cable to spare. It also comes with all the screws and fasteners one will need to mount it on a variety of surfaces. It's that kind of thought, care and attention to detail that make the Nest product brand stand-out. Quality all around. Video stream quality is good (See the attached video) and includes audio so you can hear what is going on as well. What makes this camera shine though is its ease of installation and turn-key setup and operation. Everything just works. No messing around with trying to figure out what app to get to see your camera's feed on your phone. The free Nest app is your gateway to your video stream and associates with your camera during the setup process in a dead simple way. No need to figure out what your camera's IP address, username and password are or deal with router port forwarding. I can't emphasize enough how approachable and friendly the whole setup process is. You can also access your stream from your computer's web browser. No special plugins required! The app allows you to view your live stream and photos of activity from the last three hours, as well as receive email activity alerts when sound or motion is detected. But it is way better if you subscribe to their premium ""Nest Aware"" service which provides a full 10 or 30 day video history with cloud recording, depending on the subscription you choose. The premium service also includes person alerts (different then ""activity"" alerts which only detect motion), the ability to setup Activity Zones that provide notifications when motion is detected in a specific area in front of your camera. As well as the ability to create downloadable/shareable clips and timelapses of whatever is available in your history. I really enjoy the email alerts. I typically receive a notification within 20 seconds of someone walking in front of my camera. This also creates a nice archive of events in my inbox. Activity events are also highlighted with a ""dot"" in your timeline, allowing you to easily jump from event-to-event without having to search through hours of uneventful activity. This is a really nice feature and makes reviewing the days activity a quick and painless endeavor. I am normally not a fan of subscription-based services but I saved $100/month this year by replacing my cable and landline telephone subscriptions with lower-cost/subscriptionless services like TiVO and the Obi202 (which I shared on my YouTube channel HDGeekReview).

It would occasionally pick up signal there but it would never last more than a few seconds.  After that I gradually tried experimenting with other locations and it didn't do any better with any of them.  I finally tried using to at the closely possible point to the wifi through a wall -- just 15 feet away -- and it still wouldn't work.  When I brought it inside it would work, within 20 feet.  More than 20 feet and it was intermittent at best.  I tried a variety of other wifi-enabled devices in the same spot I wanted to use the Nest Cam and all worked flawlessly -- from our phones and tablets (in wifi only mode) to even historically lousing wifi devices like the Nintendo 3DS.  We have never had wifi issues with this router -- heck my iphone picks it up from down the hill about 5x the distance this camera was going to be positioned.  So ultimately this thing is a brick.  I can't even repurpose it as an effective second indoor camera because the mount doesn't work as a regular stand.",Truly terrible Wifi range makes it virtually useless
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 May 2017,Kristian Andersen,"The Good: if you want an expensive outdoor camera with decent images that you can place in an area with high-strength wifi - and don't need the ability to store your data - go ahead and buy this. The Bad: pretty much everything else. First of, if you want to store images for more than three hours, you need to buy a subscription. PER camera. $100/year for the first one, and $50 for EVERY other camera. That's outrageous. With this subscription you get some fancy features too - like the ability to receive notifications when motion is observed in certain 'zones' that you can specify. The problem with these features? They don't work. I have had two cameras for several months and these features work maybe 5% of the times (yes, that's WORKING 5% of the time - not the other way around) - not acceptable. Which brings me to the next issue - support. Or rather, lack thereof. You have an issue? They'll tell you to reinstall everything and start from scratch. Of course this won't work, so you'll ask them to look deeper at the problem. They'll come back a week later and tell you to reinstall everything and start from scratch again. Repeat. I have had this going on for several months - same thing, no solutions. Which brings me to the last problem that you need to be aware of. Remember the wifi I talked about? Well, you better have amazing wifi where you are planning on installing your camera, since these cameras have super weak wifi. When I installed mine, my phone had full wifi, but the cameras could barely connect. They still don't connect properly, although I have tweaked the install location so they can be as close to the router as possible. And no, this is not an issue with my wifi - all other devices connect without a glitch in the install locations. Suffice to say, I'll be uninstalling my system shortly and asking for a full refund - including what I have paid for the subscriptions ($150 for two cameras). The Nest system is extremely expensive, with an outrageous subscription model (that they don't tell you about up front), and under the pretty surface they have a mega bloated clunky backend. Don't do it - find something better.",Trust me - don't believe the glowing reviews
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Mar 2017,John Smith,"Good but not great is the way I would sum up my Nest Cam Outdoor experience thus far.  Installation can be simple if you don't mind an ugly cable going into an outlet.  If you want a clean look, like my wife does, then you will need to get creative.  Basically for me the best path was to drill through the exterior wall and then fish down the interior wall to an outlet.  I had to drill a larger hole than I would like to as the USB connector is permanently affixed to the cable and you either have to fish the whole camera through or the large 3/4"" USB end.  This large end also makes fishing down the wall tricky.  I saw a video on YouTube where someone cut the cable and then reconnected the wiring with electrical twist nuts.  I didn't feel comfortable doing that. It would have been great if the cable had a disconnection to where you could fit it through small cable sized openings, however the waterproofing might be jeopardized then, IDK.....Overall the software is what makes the NEST, if your going to invest in a ""security camera"" then it needs to be reliable and easy to find something that it recorded, otherwise you have nothing.  Due to Nest's expensive cloud recording services, I originally went with a Lorex NVR system, but after 9 months of having it drop cameras randomly and software that is confusing and not user friendly.  I returned the system and decided the Nest monthly fees would be the cost of admission if I wanted reliability, simplicity, and usability.  I'm not sure how many cameras I will be able to afford with the monthly fees, I really wish they would make it significantly less the more cameras you have. UPDATE- added a second outdoor nestcam to my front door,  I decided to go for cutting the wire and drilling a smaller hole and then splicing the wire back together.  The end result was good and I would do it that way in the future.  Also it appears that each nestcam is taking about .5 MBS of bandwidth from my internet connection.",Good but could be great

I'm consistently fighting with the app and website to try an view my PAID service.  The camera you pay for CANNOT run consistently at 1080p because the camera over heats.  I have 100mb by 10mb internet service which is more then enough to run 1 camera but the website and app are always telling me I need to the lower the resolution.  If I put the camera on auto resolution it's always at the lowest setting so its useless because you can 't make out anyone's face.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Oct 2016,Chris Healey,"I decided it would be nice to have some security cameras so I first began with the Arlo system, which was initially very impressive, but became a battery eating monster with finicky WiFi manners. So having poured $400 down the toilet, I was a bit gun shy about trying again with another system.  I've had good luck with Nest in the past, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I wouldn't call myself 'handy' but installation was a breeze.  You just have to figure out how you are going to plug this guy in.  This either means using an exterior plug or drilling a hole through your house to plug it in inside. To make this REALLY annoying the cable is welded into the camera unit, and there is a non-removable plug on the end measuring 19mm.  So this means you are likely going to have to use a pretty large drill bit to make a hole that you can thread this plug though.  Why the heck they couldn't have used a mini USB or some other kind of connector is quite beyond me. Other than this stupid design feature, other set up was a breeze, and I had the camera installed successfully pretty quickly. Once installed, I've found the image quality very high, and the intelligence used by the system to be pretty spectacular.  It reliably tells the difference between movement and an actual person, the software works well both on a computer (with extra functionality) and the app, which is shared with the app used for other Nest products. If you want it to remember recent footage, you do have to subscribe, and that's going to cost you $100 a year, or $50 for additional cameras.  Kind of annoying after investing $199 per camera.  You'd think they'd offer 6 months or so free for new subscribers just to ease us in, rather than hitting us up for more money right after buying an already expensive product. Speaking of hitting us up for money, there is some inexcusable nagware built into the app that constantly reminds us to subscribe and warns us of the perils of not subscribing.  This happens both in the app, and even in the emails generated when movement is detected.  This is annoying and unnecessary in and of itself, but is especially annoying that the same request is made over and over EVEN AFTER PAYING for a subscription! You'd think Nest would have the decency to remove the stupid ads after I paid! In addition to the image quality and intelligence of the alerting, there is also a live microphone and the ability to speak to an intruder. Some people have commented that this would be 'easy' to defeat.  I guess it would.  Take a bat to it, spray paint the lens, or pull it off the magnetic mount and it would be done.  And if the bad guy put some thought in, he could probably do this without being caught 'on tape.' Then again, this is kind of true of any system really.  Just ask Kim Kardashian, who can clearly afford a lot of security. When it comes to security, I think that no system is perfect.  But I got this more for just knowing what is going on at the house.  Was a package delivered?  Did I leave the garage door open?  Did someone just come to the door?  Is someone snooping around back?  That kind of thing. A well motivated criminal is going to scope out the house, disable this system and break in anyway. But the real question is this.  If you are just a regular person in a regular home, is a regular criminal really going to take that much time to try and defeat this system when your neighbor probably doesn't have any security at all? Criminals are generally lazy and would rather take advantage of a situation, so in all likelihood, they will just target another property, rather than plot how to disable this system on your home. For most basic security needs, and the convenience of being able to check on your home in real time, this is a great system with a lot of upside. I'd like to see version 2.0 have a better connector so I don't have to put a 1"" hole in my wall to thread the cable through.  And I'd like the app to be updated to stop hassling me about subscribing, even after I have already subscribed.  This is outrageous and annoying.  But with those two reservations aside, I think this is a great product, and I have already ordered two more.  Now we just have to see if it survives a brutal Minnesota winter!",Pretty Great - Not perfect
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2017,Visceral Soul,"We're very happy with this so far (it's been a week). I can't find the link where I read about this, so I will state that I found it very easy to cut the cable coming from the camera and the resplice it together. This allowed me to drill a small hole in the top of our vinyly window casing and pass the cable through it to inside the house. Then I could just pass the cable through, rather than drilling the 7/8"" hole required to pass the big connector on the end of the camera cable where it attaches to the usb power converter. I used three wire nuts to reattach the three wires to each other, but those are hidden behind our window shades, so no big deal. I found zero loss of power, video or audio quality after doing this, and now I just have two small holes in our window frames, rather than having to drill the big 7/8"" holes through the side of the house. I don't mind the monthly subscription for recording - it costs a company money to host and maintain all the severs to record and store that video. If you want a system that allows you to record to your own computer or an SD card, then look for another option. I do wish Nest included a connector on the camera cable so you could just disconnect it when routing the cable, rather than having to cut and splice the cable yourself, but oh well. In the end these do exactly what we need and the app and interfaces just work. Well worth it for us.",Does exactly what we need and pretty easy to cut and splice the cables to enable drilling a smaller hole
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Feb 2017,CMR,"Mixed results.  As others have said the hardware, packaging, and features are top notch and very well designed and manufactured.  It is almost worthless without the Nest Aware subscription however which is $100 for ten days of recording history or $300 for thirty days of recording history. Without the subscription you will only get three hours of still picture ""Snapshots"", images of noticed activity by the camera, and even then you will never be able to view these ""Snapshots"" from their webpage or account, you can only view them through the App on your phone or tablet, when it is in a vertical orientation. I had an hour long conversation with two support representatives today with Nest, both of which provided me with links that had lovely information carefully displayed, and both of them could not answer basic questions and ran me around in circles fixating on small aspects of my conversation that I understood, but they did not.  In the end I complained that there should be more than these two costly subscription packages, like a 5-Day option or 1-Day, that could be much more affordable than the two they currently have.  They insisted that they had more than two options as I could also pay monthly at $10 a month for the ten day recordings, or $30 a month for the thirty day.  I had to point out that their way was more expensive than their already pricey solution, and I would not be interested.  They assured me they would share my feedback with their engineering team, which seems like a waste.  I asked them to speak to management and sales instead. tl;dr  Nest Aware needs cheaper options with less days of available recordings, once it does, this review will be five stars and I will return to showing off my Nest camera and recorded clips with everyone I know. Edit: Nest just quietly added a 5-Day option for $50 a year for one camera.  I'm very happy to hear this, unfortunately for me it was after I was charged for the 10-day plan last month.  But overall I think this is great and I will be contacting them to move my camera to the 5-day plan.  My original review was two starts.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Mar 2019,Michael Albany,"I got this product because the flag on our porch was stolen. After about 6 months the network connection kept going out and support suggested that I move the camera closer to the router. I repositioned the camera from the left of our door to the right taking it from 20’ away to about 15’. It got worse. After a bunch of back and forth it was determined that a direct line of sight to the router was required. This meant the camera now faces away from the street so we can see the front door. Flag was stolen again. Network issue resolved I looked into getting it to playback video so I could see when a package was stolen. Video is only available if you have a subscription. Stills are only kept for 3 hours without one as well. No stills or video of a package suspected to be stolen. 2 $30 flags, 1 $15 package in 18 months and nothing caught on camera. Subscription cost is about $300 a year after the first year. No. Can’t justify that cost. Video quality is ok but not great. At high resolution it’s good in daylight and night vision works, but it’s not going to be admissible in court unless the crook waits to have their picture taken. It’s also slow to respond. My mail person doesn’t move fast but she can get to the door, drop the mail in the slot ant leave and IF the camera catches it at all, I get a blurred image of the top of her head as she’s leaving our 9ft long patio. The motion detector is great at catching the leaves on the plants moving in the wind.  I have 70 notification of that over the last 3 hours. Oh and one possum visiting.

We have two Nest 2nd Gen Thermostats and three 1st Gen wired Nest Protects and I love them. I personally had a bad experience with the 1st Nest Cam, but really wanted to give this a 2nd chance. I was hoping that the power cord would be connected through a micro USB port that I could switch out the cord for a Ring Stickup Cam solar panel that I have, but alas, no luck. This thing is really meant to be plugged in at all times. I'm guessing that is because of the constant recording which caused my first Nest Cam to feel so hot I was afraid it was malfunctioning. Hopefully we won't have this issue with the Outdoor Cam. Here are my thoughts so far. I'll update if anything interesting to share comes up. The Good: - The camera is rather large compared to the Nest Cam and seems watertight enough to not have issues being plugged up outside in an uncovered driveway. - The night vision is really nice, and far superior to what I have with my Ring Stickup Cam. Like there isn't even a comparison. - The notifications are almost instantaneous. Of course I'm at home with everything all on the same wi-fi, but still impressive. - There are no delays in live streaming. This is especially impressive considering my Canary (which I love by the way) has a 10 second delay. - Setup was incredibly easy. I scanned the QR code added the wi-fi and password and we were ready to go. It took less than 5 min to get going! - My husband and I tested two-way audio and it works really well. The sound is clear at close range and if you shout you can hear it from the ground. Right now it's about 10 feet off of the ground. - Also, the landscapers were here working outside today and set the motion sensors off but the trees swaying in the wind have not caused the sensors to activate. The Not so Good: - I'm still annoyed at the cost of the monthly/yearly subscription fees. - I'm not electrician by any stretch of the imagination, so someone please let me know if I'm overthinking it, but the plug is not grounded and that bothers me for being outside. The Other: - The packaging is nice and standard Nest. I'm a sucker for good packaging. - There is hardware included to mount this indoors or outdoors. It comes with 12 screws for some reason which is way more than you need to install. I've included a bunch of pictures, but so far I'm really happy with the picture quality and performance.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jun 2018,B-Rad,"Pros: Install is relatively straight forward. Overall, it's just easy to setup and get going. Maybe takes an hour total for a one camera install. This is its biggest pro. Ease of setup and use. They lowered the cost to $50/yr for 5-days continuous recording. Not bad. Does feel like robbery though considering the quality of the video... Cons: * Over alerts for random things. ""spotted movement"". You watch, maybe a piece of paper fluttered in the wind on your patio table. Who knows what you're looking for. It'd be nice if it showed you a box where it spotted movement. * You'll get alerts every time you go into the things periphery. Annoying for us because I put this on our patio and we spend quite a bit of time out there. I guess the Nest IQ is supposed to fix this issue by recognizing faces. * The video compression is extreme. If you have a lot of movement going on, it will be a pixelated mess! If a robber didn't want to get spotted, all they gotta do is bob and weave their head and you'll never be able to identify them. If a person just stood still for 10 seconds, you might be able to identify them. Maybe this is better with the Nest Outdoor IQ but that's to be determined. And for twice the cost (I paid $150 for this), that's a big gamble to take. * The delay between live and what you see on your phone is several seconds. I can't imagine trying to talk to someone with this thing. * The cord sticking out the bottom of the camera is pretty annoying. It isn't super flexible either. It looks ugly. * Google could cut this at any time and then you have a worthless piece of tech. Plenty of startups out there that were cloud cameras have already done just that. Just know what you're getting yourself into on that front. Biggest issue here is that the compression (even on highest quality - I have a high-end 802.11ac router with a gigabit internet connection through AT&T Fiber) is horrendous. I am really disappointed as review videos I saw didn't make it seem like it was that bad but it is actually terrible. You will not be able to make out faces at a distance. You will probably need a camera to be right in the face of someone AND hope they remain still because if the video has a big change (like a fast moving object taking up a lot of the screen) then the video just turns into pure confetti. Watch some videos online to get an idea of what I mean about video compression - if you don't know. Verdict: Don't buy. I will probably end up selling this on Craigslist at some point but until I find something better, it's what I am using.",Can't recommend if you want this for security purposes

Unfortunately, that's about where the good ends. While the camera's themselves are good quality, the app as well as video viewing on nest's website is another story. I have had nothing but problems since setting them up. I was aware that I needed to pay a monthly subscription to view video history, and had no problem paying for that. However, after subscribing to Nest Aware Plus, the nest app did not recognize I had a subscription. I waited a few days to make sure it wasn't just a syncing issue. Contacted support through the chat feature in the app. Spent around 45 mins texting back and forth before they had me delete and re-install the app, which resolved the issue. However, I've had multiple problems since. As part of the subscription I was paying for, I am supposed to be able to view recorded history for the last 10 days (video stored on the cloud). This feature has not worked for me in either the nest app on my or thru their website on my laptop. Spent over an hour chatting with support thru the app about that. The rep had me try adjusting multiple settings  - then asked me to logout of the app and log back in. Did everything that was asked, and still wasn't working. To make matters worse, by logging out it ended the chat - so I was unable to continue trouble shooting the problem and wasn't about to waste another hour starting over with a new rep. I am also unable to view videos of event-based recordings (i.e. when motion or sound triggers a event to be tagged in the video history). I get notified if there's an event - but when I click on the event it only loads a still shot of the event (it should be playing the recorded clip so I can see what happened). I just did a google search to see if other's are having this problem and found a thread on google's support forum with comments from many users reporting the same problem (despite having a Nest Aware subscription). Another disappointment was the Nest Aware app surprisingly lacked a basic feature that my inexpensive Wyze Cam (and app with 14-days free cloud storage) has. You can't set a timeframe for motion detections (i.e. say you only want to get notified if there is motion detected at night while you're sleeping). The only option is to set a schedule where the camera turns off completely. One final complaint is the cord/power source. Google does not currently offer a shorter cord for this camera - and because the cords are custom - it's not possible to easily swap out the existing cord (a 15' or so cord comes out of the back of the camera. This cannot be removed from the camera. That plugs into a power hub, which has another 10' cord that plugs into a regular power outlet). So if you're not running this camera 25' feet away from a power source, you've got a lot of cord to try to conceal. Unfortunately, I will be returning these cameras. Was really hoping they'd be my upgrade solution for a continuous recording camera to replace my Wyze cameras...but not the case. If the app worked as expected, I'd be willing to keep them and overlook the other issues. But alas. I'll keep looking.",Returning these cameras.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2018,Allan R,"If I had known what I know now about their support products, such as their app and website, I would have NEVER EVER EVER purchased a camera from Nest.  The app is a straight up joke.  Virtually none of the features work, including the Home/Away assist feature, which is only sort of important!  It's supposed to work with phone location, and change your notification preferences depending on whether you are home or not.  I do not want constant notifications when I am home, but more importantly, I DO want notifications when a person approaches my house and I am away.  But of course this feature simply does not work.  I have to manually change it every time.  Also, even when I am away, and I have it set properly, many times it does not work.  I will go back and review the activity from the app, and I will see a time when a person or something should have triggered a notification to my phone, and it did not happen.  The solution from customer support is always to ""uninstall the app"" or attempt some other ridiculous ways to try and fix problems.  It's almost as if they are sitting around laughing, seeing how many different stupid hoops they can make users jump through, as a joke.  ""Sir, the solution to this is you need to stand on your head and eat your shoe, this should clear up the problem"". Despite repeated please to Nest customer support to add custom notification sounds, it still has not been added.  As with any smartphone, I am bombarded by various notifications throughout the day, from text messages, phone calls, emails, other apps, etc.  It would be nice to be able to personalize a chime so that I know it's a Nest notification, and I can view it right away. As far as the website goes, I recently tried to input a new payment method.  Did not work properly, and did not make the new card the default payment method.  The solution offered is to unsubscribe to my Nest Aware, then get a partial refund on the unused portion of my subscription, delete my old payment method, then input a new card, and re-subscribe.  Of course be sure to pay in full for the new subscription, even though this is our fault for our website not working properly! I could write a 100-page book on the many problems with their app and website, but I think you get the idea.  It's a complete nightmare, and clearly they have no idea how to fix their many problems, as the solution is always to ""just start over"".  Delete everything, uninstall everything, see if that helps.  The camera picture quality is decent, but there are other options which are probably just as good.  Save yourself the headache and find another ""smart"" camera system that works better.  It's not a high bar to clear.","Product is ok, all their software...apps, website, are a NIGHTMARE!"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jul 2020,Teresa,"Well, I now have 9 of these cameras. I  know, you must think I'm paranoid or something, but 4 of them were gifts for family members. My family members are aging and the Nest Cameras help me keep an eye on them. I pay for all 9 cameras on my Nest account which runs me well over $300 a year. The picture quality is best during the day (duuu) and I run them without night vision at night which seems better. You can get a 10 day subscription or a 5 day. I need to switch all of mine to the 5 day, which is good enough or 24 hours without a subscription. You can save clips and rewatch any time. The sound quality is very good. The only downfalls I have are 3 of my cameras are more than 100 feet from our internet connection which makes the cameras a little unstable at times. Nest has control of the bandwidth which we learned during the COVID outbreak when I received a message from Nest that they were turning down the quality of our cameras due to overload on the networks. The cameras sometimes doesn't pick up all the action, for example you backing out of your driveway just under the camera's nose. Not sure why this happens, maybe someone reading this knows. Obviously, they are good cameras, why else would I buy 9. Very easy to set up, I can now set them up with my eyes closed. *UPDATE 7.28.20 My new cameras are dark compared to my 7 other Nest cameras. Something has definitely changed in the quality of these latest Nest cameras. ---Please see my photos which were taken on the same day at the same time facing the same direction.---",Not Bad if You Can Afford the Pricey Subscription (UPDATE 7.28.20)
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2019,Henyaman,"There are quite a few issues here on these cameras. I've had the indoor and outdoor both for a few years. The software, on Apple or Android is too slow to really use alerts. If someone is at your door you won't get the picture up before they walk off.  The cable setup is pretty terrible if you have to run it through walls (I think this was modified in the newest outdoor cam) but the most worrisome part for me and what is making finally move off Nest products has been the ""integration"" with Google lately. They are moving off Nest and slowly starting to have people login to Google first. Sure, just what I want a company that makes money collecting info and data to be behind my cloud cameras. Then, as if to give everyone an extra swift kick they decide to showcase the biggest drawback to cloud products. That being you have no control. This week they removed the ability to shut off the LED that shows the camera is on. We have ours off outside so someone sneaking around at night wouldn't locate and avoid them. Same internally, we have it on most of the time and I don't want to see an LED on my mantle but now that Google is in play they decide to just remove that feature and force it always on because of some complex they have trying to improve the world or whatever. I bought the cameras, I can decide how I set them up on my house. Or, apparently not. So goodbye Nest.  There are more pro's and cons of these you can read all over the reviews here, I decided to post mine as I have had these for a few years and am unhappy in the current direction of Nest and would not buy them again.","Not what I had hoped, and getting worse with more Google's interference"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Oct 2016,Righteousdude80,A brief summary. The camera unit itself is well made and has crisp say and night resolution. The power cable is horrible- the camera end is not removable and the male end is 3/4 of an inch thick. I was planning on drilling a hole in the eave and hiding the cables in the attic but since the hole would be a massive to just fish he line through- i couldnt do that. Annoying neglect in design. My camera also kept going offline intermittently. Through problem solving I discovered that it doesnt do well on the 5ghz wifi. Switched to the 2.4 ghz wifi and it runs solid.  Wouldnt have been easy for a non-techy to figure out.,Annoying neglect in design
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Jul 2018,SharpieItBlack,"Update, A Year Later: Overall, I am still very happy with this camera. They have made app improvements I believe and therefore in the past year I feel the app and connection to their server has definitely improved since then. The only time my camera ever goes offline or drops connection is when my power or wifi goes out. But once reconnected it works perfectly fine. I only need one camera right now as it's on a patio of my apartment, but if I had a full house I would definitely invest in more. Update July 3rd: The mobile app and desktop views of my camera keep saying I can't connect to Nest services. I got outside and the green led is lit saying it is connecting and streaming. But every time I open the app it says I can't connect to Nest services. If I can get into my camera view, it does show recorded events while I was unable to see them. But it's a huge pain when the app won't connect to the server or cloud or wherever so I can actually use it. Taking a star off for unstable app. Original: Shipping: Very fast so I could set it up really quickly. Actual Setup: Without revealing too much about my home; I have very fast internet both down/up speeds so the feed won't drop unless my wifi drops (the fault of my ISP not the camera itself). It took several tries for it to connect to the Wi-Fi network, however once I got it connected it has been quite streamlined. The Nest app is installed on both my Android Galaxy phone and Android Galaxy Tablet. It runs well and simple to navigate. Not everything is available in app, and must be done on your computer (such as account details and subscription details, but that's to be expected and not an issue). I live in a one bedroom apartment in a conservative area, and as a social minority I fear for my safety. As well as an owner of several gaming systems. This camera has alleviated tons of anxiety in regards to my safety and security. Physical installation portrayed some road blocks. But after some thinking I got it eventually. Luckily there is wood around my patio door so I just screwed the clips into that. And luckily I have an exterior outlet as well so I don't have to risk breaking my lease by drilling into a wall. Concealing it hasn't been as ideal but I got it to work eventually. The magnetic back is STRONG. Especially when attached to a metal object. I have a metal hanging planter I secured the magnet to and it holds well. I put flowers in the planter to better hide the camera. Infrared lights are not seen at all from the outside unless you're staring directly at it and are extremely close in proximity. I mention this because I've seen some similar type cameras with IF lights that are really noticeable. Suggestion: Add a feature to turn the green led off. The green light is fairly bright and noticeable when the surroundings are all dark (especially at night). Not sure how this would be implemented but it's a thought. Video Quality: It is so so. For a smart phone security camera connected to Wi-Fi, if actually has way better quality than I expected. If people want better resolution they're gonna have to spend A LOT more and for way better business-grade cameras. This is for your home and it'll work just fine. I only have the one camera so I cannot speak for a multi camera setup or a larger home. But for a small apartment it works great.",Works great for a small/medium home

The quality of the video, and the speed at which I could pull up a live view isn't even close to being comparable. The added bonus is the speed and accuracy that Nest Aware is able to see motion, identify it as a person, or other moving object, and then pop up the notification on my Apple Watch!

Ok let me just start off by saying that like most shoppers I spent a lot of time researching and comparing different types of cameras and What I was looking for was for something easy to use, easy installations and wireless. I’ve lived in my home for 2 1/2 years and never had a package stolen and within 2 weeks of installing the cam right around Christmas I had 2 packages stolen, and thanks to the crisp and clear image of the nest cam I was able to identify the car and spotted it the next day. I contacted my local precinct and they waited for the perpetrator to come back to his cAr and as it turns out he was still wearing the same clothing as captured in the video. He was subsequently arrested. Bottom line is if you’re looking for a good quality image and a camera that is easy to use with awesome alerts look no further. I installed it with ease in 30 min or so and can now monitor my home from anywhere in the world. Not to mention the ability to talk to anyone coming to my door live.",Must have for homeowners
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Nov 2017,the product truther,"I waited a while after purchase to submit a review.  The Nest outdoor cameras are very nice units, but there are a number of issues that buyers need to consider as they invest in this product. First off, the camera video quality is very good in daylight as well as in darkened conditions.  These cameras have a very nice feature of a microphone and speaker that allows one to listen or to speak in a zone.  Another nice feature are the notification settings where the user can elect the sensitivity of notification event and can elect to be notified via email of any occurrence detected by the cameras. The cameras are installed in a fairly  straightforward fashion that relies on power sourcing from a typical home electric 20a/120v plug.  This reliance can be problematic as camera placement can be dictated by your specific power sourcing options available.  If the consumer elects to use internal home plugs, this will require drilling a 3/4 in hole to fish the power cord into your home. The cameras use a wireless Internet method of ""vaulting"" your camera video within the Nest Cloud app, and there is a monthly fee associated with this process.  $250 for the first camera and then $60 per camera there after.  Not exactly cheap. Things to keep in mind, due to the nuances of wireless Internet capabilities, the consumer needs to ensure that a sufficiently strong Internet wireless sourcing is available and can dictate placement of cameras to avoid weak or dead spots of your wireless Internet.  In my case, I have fairly expensive Asus wireless router and use 2 amped wireless repeaters to help push my wireless coverage of sufficient strength to help with operation of the Nest cameras. There is also the issue of video clarity and total bandwidth usage.  The lowest setting on the cameras require about 30 GB of data usage and can grow to 120 GB per camera at the highest setting.  As you can see, if you use 4 or more cameras, this data usage can be problematic with your ISP's allotment of total data usage allowed.  I personally use 6 cameras, and I have to set some cameras at medium settings and others at high so that I can avoid going over my 1TB monthly limit.  And, this usage is 1 way to the Nest Cloud.  I don't think that Nest expects consumers to ""monitor watch"" these cameras for extended periods as this would push your data usage considerably higher.  Something to keep in mind for sure. The above review aside, in totality the Nest cameras are a fine choice for security camera selection.  The cost is reflective of their quality, I just want the consumer to appreciate the costs of operation of this wireless model vs a more traditional wired camera solution that incorporates an on premise hard drive.",considerations!
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Dec 2019,Ataritron,"So here's my take after a year+ using these. I like the cameras, hate the subscription service. Just got some wyze cameras and they do the exact same thing for $0 monthly. For $25 for wyze versus $200+ for nest, absolutely can't justify or recommend these to anyone. Probably depends on your needs and these are outside cameras versus the wyze inside cameras. Overall, I'll be getting rid of these and finding another solution.",Too expensive
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jun 2018,Little Jim,"I'm really liking these Nest Outdoor Cameras. They were easy for me to get registered and set up online for the different locations. I hired an electrician to do the hardware install. It only took a few seconds after the cameras got power for me to see a picture on my iphone and have the electrician make slight changes in the field of view. The app is fairly intuitive and easy to figure out. I did have a slight problem with the two farthest cams from the router. The front door cam would reload quite often as would the driveway cam which also would drop out quite often. But moving my router off the floor and up to the top of a file cabinet about 5 feet off the ground seems to have solved that issue and now i'm not seeing any cams drop out and the only reloads i see is when i first open the app my iphone or launch the website on a computer. One of the things that held me back from getting Nest was the Nest Aware subscription price but they have added more options with lower prices that looked reasonable to me. There is now a 5 day option which lowers the price considerably. I bought the 5 day for two cams and the 10 day for another. But I'm thinking I'll probably go 5 days on all three cams as I really don't see the need to save 30 days or even 10 days worth of video. It's easy enough to download something to my computer if I see something I want to save on my hard drive. My electrician has installed a lot of security cams, though never any Nest cams, and he was very impressed by the video quality.",Great product
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Nov 2018,Brad Murchison,"After the Arlo system failed to live up to its hype, we ordered these as a replacement. I was skeptical at first, where a lot of these reviews say the cameras are useless without Nest Aware and talk about its high price. It seems like Nest listened, and created a free package. This package is still limited compared to other services, only offering clips 3 hours back, and only recording clips when motion is detected. However, that it still plenty useful. If it's not for you, then they've also included the addition of a $50/year or $5/month Nest Aware package, which includes more intuitive features like person detection and 5 days of continuous recording. The cameras themselves take great wide angled views.  Set up is a breeze, download the app, make an account, and scan the QR code on the camera with your phone. The mounting method is a magnetic swivel base, that attaches to the back of the camera, and then to a backing plate that's screwed into a wall. While this may seem insecure at first, like someone could just grab your camera and run, Nest has included a bunch of cable tie-downs, that you would snap over the cable and drill into the wall. This makes a quick grab and snatch nearly impossible, meaning they'd have to stick around and unscrew all the tie-downs. The camera is also locked to your account until released, and would alert you once it detected it was being moved. While these cameras are more expensive than Arlo or Logitech cameras, I'd say that you get what you pay for, with great build quality, picture quality, and the sheer convenience of not needing to ever replace batteries. If you're looking for a home camera system, I'd say this is a good choice.","Great, even without Nest Aware"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Apr 2017,Michael Kennedy,"I have one outdoor security camera and 4 indoor Nest cameras.  I've had these for almost a year and I have mixed feelings about them.  The ease of installation is great, especially the indoor cameras are a no brainer to install. But the subscription fee to the recording service is expensive.  The price to record 10 days worth of footage is $100 for the first camera and $50 for each additional camera per year.  That's $300 a year to record all my cameras for only 10 days of history.  With no options of creating your own video server I don't think the cameras are worth it. The free service they do offer, will take still snap shots if the cameras detects motion, this is super hit and miss.  It often misses people and if it does detect a person, it always seems to be their back.  It's great at sending pics of vehicles driving by the house and small creatures like cats, birds and skunks.  How it regularly misses humans is beyond me.",Price of camera + subscription fees = to expensive
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Apr 2017,Mitch,"First let me say I am a big Apple fan - I have many products and was looking forward to Homekit. This is of course, AFTER I invested money in Nest/Dropcam/Protects/etc. who are now owned by Google. Thought this was going to be an issue until I used these products. I have tried almost every other home camera on the market today; even configurable IP cameras, NOTHING is as easy as these are. They auto-learn if your power goes out (come back on AND connect to your network in a matter of 15 seconds), the app is easy enough to share with people you live with (my wife is NOT tech savvy and Nest is wonderful), the infrastructure is great (never in a couple years since Google bought them have ever had an issue with the service, and the service is outstanding (see more). I was hesitant to spend money on the subscription service - as anyone is. I would cancel ANY other service before this one. Having the opportunity to see who is outside of my house/walking by/mailman/garbage man/dog walker/whoever else after the fact in near seconds after opening up the application is priceless. The person recognition is fantastic after I set up the ""zones"" and the audio is crystal clear and instantaneous. iOS users when something is recognized via a notification you can ""force touch"" from the lock screen and see an animated GIF of what it saw: EPIC, so you don't have to go into the app and rewind. Additionally, finding camera alerts are easy, tap on the purple dot in the timeline (in app) and it rewinds to that exact moment for you. And exporting the videos or pictures is seamless too, and takes only a matter of a minute or so. Seriously, for a piece of mind, nothing can compare (we watch our dog using an inside one). OH and also, if your Nest Protect goes off, the camera automatically takes a video and sends it to the registered users so you can see what could have caused the trigger (for me it was the steam from the shower in the room across from the Protect). Alright, I could rant all day about this device - really. I do like it - for a Google product (and that says something). Especially in the Midwest, I have had this device well below zero, and above 90 degrees Fahrenheit with ZERO issues. I just make sure the power cord is somewhere behind a locked door or garage so it cannot be disconnected by someone tampering with your device. Hope this helps in the decision making for anyone.

Hawley,"I got this camera to monitor my front door and porch, mostly to see who's out there before I open my door. I'm home most of the time, so police-report quality images of thieves or vandals weren't really my goal, and I'm not concerned about weeks of backups. The picture is wide angle, high resolution, full color during the day and vividly infrared in the dark. Installation was not complex (took me about an hour from start to finish). Sound quality is very good coming in from the camera's microphone, and maybe a little less brilliant going out via the camera's speaker. It does NOT do well if my phone is picking up my voice via bluetooth earbuds, which is, like, 98% of the time. While this camera is very high quality--really, the picture is amazing, both night and day--I'm docking a star because even if I keep the app foregrounded on my phone, it takes a few seconds to load and show me the current picture, like, who's knocking on my door, or is the cat on the doorstep waiting for her dinner? What would be ideal is a desktop app that I could just keep running in the corner of my monitor, where I'm working all day anyway.

The Nest Outdoor Cam seemed to have all the features I wanted, the one in particular which I contacted them to make sure it did was be able to watch live feed 24x7 without any timeouts so I can have the feed up all the time on one of my monitors. After using the camera for about a month here's what I found: Live feed - the live feed is NEVER truly live, it always lags about 30-45 seconds behind what is happening in real time. I have it pointed at the same area as my Foscam and I always see everything first there and then 30-45 seconds later on the Nest live feed. I believe the reason for this is no matter how you connect to the Nest Cam (ios/android app, browser) you are always connecting to their servers and not the camera directly if you are on the same wifi network as it. So the cam is sending the video feed to Nest over the internet and then you are pulling it back from Nest's servers to view it. And this camera is essentially sending and saving all video on Nest server which can chew up a lot of bandwidth. No open standard support - you're locked in to using the Nest website or app, you cannot use any 3rd party cam monitoring tools like Blue Iris, ContaCam that leverage the universal RTMPS streaming protocol. Lag, lag, lag - It's always laggy either watching live or already recorded video. At times it will just sit there and blue circle for a while and looking at the real time feed or playback of recorded video either via a web browser or the ipad app is always slow and laggy as well. You would think already recorded video would playback smoothly as I'm just streaming video from Nest servers but that is super laggy, I have to create clips and download them to watch it smoothly which is a pain. I doubt it's my network either as I have gigabit cable (700Mbps down, 45Mbps up) and a high performance mesh wifi system (Netgear Orbi) as well. I've tried it on medium video quality also and still laggy. Mounting - the mount could be better, almost impossible to mount it on a horizontal surface like under a soffit and have it point in the direction you want, limited to pointed downwards. I had to end up buying a 3rd party mount that had more flexibility in setting a viewing angle. Pay to save - Unless you subscribe to Nest Aware it's only going to show a live feed. With my Foscam I use ContaCam on my PC which records clips when motion is detected and then Dropbox replicates them to the cloud which costs me nothing. I'm OK with paying a bit for Nest to save my footage by $10 for 10 days is not really worth it, add more cams and you're paying even more. If the $10 got me 30 days I'd be happy. Clips - creating clips with the web browser (can't do it in the ios/android app) is cludgy and difficult. Moving there little controls around is cumbersome and laggy. All in all I really wanted to like this cam but I doubt I would by another one or recommend it to anyone else, the lag is mainly what killed it for me.",OK but has a lot of issues
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2018,Zoey S.,"The camera is relatively easy to install and stays put even in heavy wind or hail.  Video quality is pretty decent, even at night time, though don't expect to be able to make out faces of anyone more than 20 feet out. Pretty decent camera all in all... except for the service required if you want to save any video from it.  $100 per year to record 10 full days worth of video which is both expensive and way more footage than most people will ever need, especially since you can create and save clips indefinitely.  On top of that, their service seems to go down pretty regularly and is extremely slow most of the time.  Viewing a live feed is almost impossible as is viewing prerecorded content as it just keeps buffering.  That's not to mention the constant disconnects it experiences despite the camera itself being right next to the wi-fi router inside and having the highest priority of all our devices. It's still nice to have but if they would improve their servers to remove the constant slowness and disconnecting issues then offer a much cheaper alternative to saving the camera footage, I'd give this five stars.  As it is, the Nest subscription and interface are the biggest problems with this product.","Great camera, crappy subscription model and servers"

Hawkins,"i have been using dropcam, nestcam and now google nestcams for many years my original is still working, but not exactly up to the resolution of the latest products. the quality of this pair of cameras looks good, but the industrial design was derived based on a very narrow usage model. let me explain ... The camera is hardwired (has no connector) to a c.10 foot long white cable with a USB-A connector on it. that has a locking cowling attached to it that has a diameter of about c.3/4-inch. That connector and cowling lock into the puck style power supply which itself is hardwired to another c.10 foot long light grey AC power cable. You cannot change either cable, regardless if you damage the cable, need a different length or want to avoid making a large diameter whole through your home wall to thread the 3/4” cowling through. It’s not exactly flexible, and other than enabling a relatively water resistant power puck to be placed outside (if that’s your desire), it’s hard to see who gains from the design limitations.","Good product, but limited installation flexibility"

Personally i purchased this as i thought it would be easier vs cabling but i was wrong. Positives: -the alerts you get are pretty nice where the camera detects if its a voice, motion or person. -solid design overall and as always nest provides the tools and doesnt seem to cheap out on packaging Negatives: -the wire sticking out if not my concern its the monster hockey puck that you connect the usb to the outlet. -the usb that connects from the camera is also large and you need to drill a big o' hole to fit it through. -quality of the wifi is really trash in my opinion. =i have old and new devices that have full signal however the camera is choppy and cuts in an out in the same spot = having to pay for storage is also frustrating BUT you really dont need it if you check the alerts immediately For me personally there is not massive benefit to owning these compared to a hard wired system going to a computer.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Apr 2017,Ed Stubbs Jr.,"I'm really enjoying my outdoor nest cam! It was a breeze to setup. The configuration to get the nest on my wifi took under 5 mins. The instructions are step by step and very easy that anyone could accomplish. After connected to wifi I took it outside to see if the wifi signal could reach my location and it did.. Great! So next all I had to do was drill a hole for cable.. I used a 3/4 drill bit which was just big enough to slide the end of the USB cable cord thru so it fit perfectly.. I mounted the cam mount and magnet.. plugged it in and we were in business.. The app for this thing is soo soo simple..It's great.. very user friendly and easy to use..I just love checking it all the time! And being able to see live coverage of Everything is awesome! I only have one camera and I don't think 100/yr for 7day footage is bad at all.. Also being able to make my own clips is amazing and great when you want to share something with someone.. I did a ton of research before I bought this, between arlo and ring and other systems out there and I'm glad I chose nest.. Now my only gripe about this is sometimes the live feed will go offline for a period of time randomly and I have no clue why. But it comes back on.. other then that I love this thing!",Way better then expected! Love the user experience
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2016,Timothy J Gale,"The camera has great video quality and functionality, but the wire makes it hard to easily mount.  The USB end of the power cable has a locking ring that makes the hole need to run it through almost in inch wide and you are limited by its length. I do like the magnetic mount  but unless it's up high, it would be very easy to steal this camera. By far the worst is the yearly fee for 10 and 30 days cloud access. NEST charges for each camera, $100.00 for the first and $50 for additional ones.  So please beware that to get the functionality that NEST advertises, there is an excessive amount of yearly cost that must be factored in.",The camera has great video quality and functionality

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Apr 2017,D. L. Munchrath,"Pros:  Outstanding packaging. Quality build. Clean Look.  Ease of set up.  Quality images.  Wide viewing angle.  Sound and speech.  Full time recording to the cloud. Negative:  Unable to schedule when motion alerts are on/off (Are you kidding me?!?  So I either have to manually turn off the camera when we are using the area, schedule it to turn off completely, OR put up with non-stop alerts telling me that I am on my own patio).  Fairly expensive on the cloud recording.  Must be near a plug in that can be covered with the camera view or it could easily be disabled by a bad guy. UPDATE:  Nests response to my inquiry: ""Thank you for getting back to us about this. Besides creating a schedule for your camera (which turns the camera on or off as mentioned previously), you can also either set the Nest Cam to only send alerts when no one is home, or you could manually turn off notifications under your camera's settings. Note that there is not a separate setting that you can enable/disable for personal alerts, as these are only a certain type of activity alert.  Since this is always how our cameras have functioned, I'd be unable to provide information as far as if or when we'd offer the ability to schedule alerts while having the Nest Cam remain on or enable/disable person alerts separately."" So they are aware but because THAT'S THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN they don't intend to do anything about it even though their competition has the feature and it would seem to be very basic logic to program.  I downgraded to a 2 star as a result of this response. Our apologies for any trouble this may cause you, and as always don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything else we can do for you at this time.",Good cameras but lacks basic scheduling logic for notifications.

I use mine to watch the driveway of my mountain home-away-from-home for strangers parking and to see how much snow is piled up, especially after the plows have been through - useful for when I'm driving up there and need to park. Set-up was easy. For my purposes it works just fine. My reason for 4-stars and not 5 is that the cables are very long, I can see why but if you don't need all of that length what do you do?

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jul 2020,Ever_Would,"These are great cameras. I purchased a two-pack and liked them so much I purchased another two-pack. The install is easy and all the hardware is included. The most difficult part of my install job was adding a power source at the install location but that has nothing to do with the camera install.  Adding each device to my network, app, and integrating them into my “home assistant” was pretty easy. But it did take a bit of work integrating them with Alexa home assistant. I had to uninstall and reinstall the skill a few times and also had to adjust settings in my Google Nest website user profile.  I was also able to share the cameras with members of the household using the Google Home app. The cameras perform very well.  They have a very wide angle aspect which picks up a lot of space.  This is nice since you want as much coverage as possible by a single vantage point. The features all work very well including night-vision, motion sensor, and sound sensor. The app also provides a lot of customization like setting up notifications for detecting motion, sound or persons. The subscription to Nest Aware expands the functionality and adds some nice features and probably worth the cost since it has been priced at $6/month and now supports all the cameras.  This subscription really enhances the Nest Hello doorbell/camera features by adding Familiar Face detection and Package notification and if the pricing were to revert back to a per/camera cost, I would only subscribe the Nest Hello to Nest Aware. I should mention that the subscription also includes saving video/audio capture to the cloud for an extended period of time; not long but long enough to review suspicious events in the prior week or so.",Easy home security upgrade
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Mar 2017,Razz Man,"I owned a Dropcam Pro for years, which eventually became the Nest Cam. I placed it outdoors using a pretty well designed, Dropcam Outdoor Enclosure. I worked pretty well, but I did get some steam up on the lens. And from time to time I needed to take it apart and clean off the inside of the enclosures lens. So, I was excited to see the Nest Cam camera designed to be located outdoors. In addition to my order for the cameras, I ordered a 20ft USB extension. Dont do that, the outdoor version has a completely sealed and attached power cord. The instructions call for this to be wired to an ""outdoor outlet"". If you have a home with waterproof outlets, they would be placed in convenient, obvious and visible locations. If I wanted to vandalize or gain unlawful entry to an home ""protected"" by Nest Cams, first thing I would do, is, unplug them all. Problem solved. But, the engineering for outdoor use is excellent. Right down to the giant, male-USB jack that is permenentally connected to the lead wire of the camera. This eventually plugs into what must be the transformer/transmitter. If you use this outdoors, there is no way to extend these cables. In my case, I run the cables inside, conveniently through the rafters of my garage. Because of the size of the locking sleeve on the male-USB connector, I had to drill one, giant hole. The sweet spot was a 7/8"" boring bit. The cable is small and flat. It potentially could be fished through a coaxial, wall grommet which would seal up a smaller bore hole. There really isn't a grommet made it finish off this hole which you would want to seal to keep out critters. Your only hope is a tube of silicon caulk. Overall, the quality is terrific, and I like the use of a magnetized base for easy positioning. Kudos also for the extra hardware supplied like stainless fasteners and cable clips. Nice touch.",Holey Moley!
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jul 2019,Mariusz,"Hello and thank you for reading. I have been using the nest outdoor camera for well over a year now and I have to say that I am very pleased with the width of the lens. I would have to use two amcrest cameras that I have to cover the same area as the nest camera, a major plus. The motion detection is great. I really like the fact that you can set up different zones and get alarms based on what zone movement is detected in. I don't really care about when someone walks on the sidewalk, but when there is a movement detected on my stairs, I'd really like to know then. With this camera I can do just that. A big minus and the reason I didn't give the product five starts is the lack of an Ethernet port. I understand that it's supposed to be wireless but I do loose signal from the camera, there are days I loose the signal several times a day, but that might be to an improper router placement, but I cannot change that at the moment. The WiFi signal isn't the major issue here though. No camera is truly wireless, you always have that power cable that you have to connect. If this camera had an Ethernet port I would be able to run a cable, up to a 100m I believe. This would allow me to place the camera wherever I want. Currently I am limited to the length of the cord and my power outlet placement. Besides, I can hide an Ethernet cable quite nicely, not so much with the power cord. Thank you for reading, I hope this review has been helpful.",Lack of an Ethernet port is a minus
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Sep 2018,Rowe,"I got a pair of these for our family cabin.  I didn't buy them to PREVENT a crime but I did get them to record and store activity that might need to be reviewed later. I am not disappointed at all.  Nest, as usual, makes great hardware and has the mobile integration down SOLID.  These are easy to setup using a mobile device and they are fantastic quality.  I am going to purchase more of these for sure. The subscription is nice...You get some decent features for the money but honestly, you don't have to use the subscription to have some great benefit...Here is what I learned when the free trial of the subscription ended: 1) I still got alerts in real time with texts and screen captures 2) I was still able to see live views and scroll through time. 3) I was still able to see and store footage to my nest account What I noticed that went away when the subscription stopped 1) Recognition of people versus ""movement"".  That's kind of important but even w/o the subscription, you can tune this. 2) Scrolling through the history and getting a live real-time preview or ""Time Lapse"" of the camera.  I didn't think I would care about this but actually it's kinda handy to have.  Still, you can live without it but it's somewhat painful to scroll through history without the preview to ""guess"" when an event happened.  Once you stop scrolling through time, it will show you the recording but ... They did this on purpose hoping you would prefer the time lapse feature.  I agree. I can't think of anything else at the moment.  I think the subscription is worth it and honestly it's not that bad.  It's $50/year for one camera and every camera you add after is only $30 a year.  So for 2 cameras, it's $80 a year.  In my situation, I think it's totally worth it.  The alerts are fantastic and the AI behind facial recognition is fantastic as well.  The cameras even alert you specifically to PEOPLE TALKING which is a pretty cool feature.  Have someone at your door pounding it and yelling?  Yeah, nest is going to report that to you and record the whole thing. So many other reviewers here do a much better job at the review for these but for me, I review based on practicality and these cameras are very practical!  Love them!  I can't wait to purchase more. Pro Tip:  Nest account lets you have multiple properties.  Ensure that you create a property for the cameras FIRST before adding them.  I already had a nest account for my home with the thermostat so when I added the cameras for our vacation home, I did not make another location and that made things very confusing for the home/away features.  I basically had to undo them and redo them again under a new location.  Normally it's not that bad but when they are on subscription, it's a huge PITA.  The more you know....",Fantastic Camera!

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2017,Bado,"As an owner of many Nest products (4 Thermostats and 13 Protects), they were obviously my first choice when I decided to add some cameras. Since Amazon was having great Black Friday deals, I decided that it was time to pull the trigger. Set up, as with all Nest products, was simple. Installation wasn't difficult at all, other than having to drill some pilot holes for the mounting plate and the cable clips. A couple of minor nits: 1) I don't like that it has to plug into an outlet. I would prefer being able to have an electrician connect it to existing wiring in the walls. This would, of course, make installation harder and costlier as drywall/stucco etc repairs would need to be made, but it would be nice to have the option. 2) When I first connected, the video I was receiving was horrible. The camera is literally 6 ft from my router, on the other side of the wall (wood frame, stucco). Using my browser, connected via hardline Ethernet with a REALLY fast internet connection (100+ down, 5+ up), the signal coming from the Nest website was choppy, grainy, and continuous buffering. I did notice that I couldn't sign in to my app for a bit, so it's possible the site was just coincidentally having issues when I was trying to do this. However, the video feed in the phone app was better. The picture was clearer, though still choppy and buffering.  I decided to order another network extender, just in case, that I could put on the other side fo the wall, right by the door where the camera is. As I was still setting the extender up, I noticed that the website's video feed was now working nicely. So, apparently it was a problem with the site, but still... was annoying. At any rate, I installed the extender and all seems to be well now 3) When I set up the network extender, I needed to change the wireless network the camera was connected to. This required re-setting up the camera from scratch again, which meant getting on a ladder to re-scan the QR code on the cam. That was obnoxious. Would have been nicer to just use the app to tell it which connection to switch to. That being said, so far I really dig it. I have a second cam to set up out back this weekend, and an indoor cam to bring to our vacation condo","So far great, with just some minor nitpicks!"

The listen and talk features are nice too. Setup was pretty simple and straightforward. I purchased a silicone skin to make it less noticeable against my house. My problems are with the notification settings. During the free month of nest aware, which lets you review up to 10 days of video, the notifications were sporadic at best. The ""person alerts"" came through but it seemed to pick and choose which motion detections to send. I would get a notification for a flag waving in the breeze but not a car parking in front of my house, but then I would get a notification as a person walked by on the sidewalk in the distance. It was bookmarking all motion it detected for later review, just being very random about which ones it thought I wanted to know about. One thing is certain: when I leave my home, both with and without a subscription, it would send a notification for the very first detection, wether it was a person, dog, passing car, pedestrian, etc. then, radio silence for most of the day. After the nest trial ended, the person alert has gone away and the notifications for motion and sound are as random as ever. I am still able to stream live video perfectly but even if I got a notification and wanted to check in, they only keep snapshots every now and then for the previous few hours and video playback has been impossible for me. The need for a nest aware subscription wasn't clearly stated when I purchased this product, and it's pretty useless for security without one, and even then I'm not sure it would let me know about the things I want to know about. I'm considering selling it and pursuing another solution.","Poor notifications, pretty useless without a nest subscription"

The camera works as advertised - running the wire can be tricky if you're doing on your own with limited knowledge on how to drill into siding or bricks. Once you have the wiring figured out, it is pretty straight forward install. I like the fact that nestaware comes with 30 days trial right out of the box but I wish there is a way to delay the start of the trial period (for me, it started as soon as I registered the product). The quality is pretty good for something that is constantly recording. Provided is the video quality comparison based on data usage setting. One drawback is the notification for the zone movement. It can be overwhelming at times but other times, it downright doesn't notify you no matter the movements in the zones. The video streaming is also slightly delayed. It maybe because the videos are uploaded to the server first and you're streaming back from the server, in some sense it is like watching a slightly delayed DVR. Pro: - Easy install - Looks good and blends in well. Con: - Slight delay with video feed - Notification for zones More updates to come as I just started using it.","For now, happy with the purchase."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jun 2019,Peaches,Update: After 6 months this camera often goes offline; and usually when I am away from home and need it most! Nest (Google) customer service is also useless! This camera should have lasted for more than 6 months! I would not recommend. The main feature I like is the constant recording it’s very useful compared to other cameras which only record when motion is detected. It allows me to scroll through and see all activity. The night vision on this is pretty useless unless someone is up close. I purchased a set of 2 cameras 6 months ago and Picture quality deteriorated on one camera after 6 months. The night vision is distorted and blurry. The cameras are plug in so you need to be close to a socket. This isn’t as convenient as battery cameras but the constant recording is worth it if you are monitoring a high traffic area of your home.,Junk

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Mar 2020,Dustin Sartin,"These cameras have been a great addition to our outdoor security. They worked with our existing NEST doorbell camera. We used one of these for our driveway/garage. It has given us additional peace of mind when leaving the garage door open. Also, when I’m traveling, it’s nice to see my children out playing basketball in the driveway. The second camera is currently being used as a baby monitor for our toddler, which is nice because our little one will soon be trying to climb out of her crib. The motion detector will send us a notification so that we can intervene when the time comes. This camera will be re-purposed to a back-yard/pool security camera/monitor after the baby monitor is no longer needed. My favorite feature about the NEST is that I can review 24/7 movements and sounds very quickly by scrolling through the day, so to speak. I also like that they do not require batteries; I don’t want to have to “maintain” batteries in my security cameras. Only difficulty is getting power where you need it. I added an receptacle  in my attic so that the power was minimally exposed under the eave of the house.",Great purchase. Highly recommended!

Please note that you will have to purchase subscription if you want to keep more than last 3 hours of recording but they now offer 5-day option for $50 a year with 50% discount for the second camera subscription so it's very reasonable. I wish they would offer 3-day option or even 2-day option since you get notifications as motions are detected and you can save and download video clips so I have never had a reason to look back more than 2 days ago. One of the benefits for the subscription is that the video is stored in secure cloud so even if your camera is tempered, stolen, or destroyed, you can still access the recording up until that moment.  This is the biggest downfall for other security cameras that records on memory card without subscription. I love this camera but more than anything, I love the software app it provides. Nest really nailed on the design and user experience aspects of security camera. Imagine that you went away for 3 days and came back to find out that somebody drove into your retaining wall, damaging it but just took off.  If you had to rewind and review the 3 days worth of recording even with fast speed, it would take some time and would be tedious.  Nest app has easy way to filter only when the motion was captured so you would find it immediately. It also provides advance feature where you can hand draw any specific areas to create zones so that you can easily filter based on motions detected for that specified zone.  This allows me to ignore and not get alerted whenever cars are driving by in front of the street every day but do get notification as soon as any car or person crosses any zone that I have created.  Just look at the attached pictures to get an idea of how useful and amazing this zone feature is. If you are looking for outdoor security camera, look no further. Remember that camera/hardware is just the half of what you need from security and usability point of view.  You need good software to have full coverage. ** UPDATED 11/1/2019 ** Both cameras are still working wonderfully after a year and half and I couldn't be any happier.  Highly recommend this camera for both hardware and software! I hope this helps and if it did, please vote so that it helps others, too.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Feb 2017,Gabe G.,"The Camera itself is great!  The reasons why I rated it 2 rather than 5 is that there is no local storage or viewing. - If the internet goes out it is useless. - With Comcast's new data cap it makes it an even harder sell.  It uploads 24-7, so if you have it set on 1080p (which looks awesome, by the way) it will eat up close to 500GB of data on its's own.  You can set it to only be on during certain times, but I don't know when you would not want to monitor your front door. - Also, if you want to take advantage of any of its features (besides live viewing) you MUST pay a monthly fee which makes an expensive product even more expensive. Like I said, the build quality and picture quality is awesome, but be prepared to keep paying for it through the subscription service and additional data if you have a cap.  I would not recommend this camera to a friend due to it being exclusively tied to the internet ($$$).",No Local storage!
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Nov 2016,Cody C.,"As with other Nest products, the camera works incredibly well and is dead simple to setup and use. I have a major gripe with the design of the cable though.  The fact that the cable is hardwired to the camera and terminated with a plug that is over 1/2"" in diameter is flat-out unacceptable.  This is meant to be mounted outside and, in best case scenarios, wired to an outlet that is not accessible from the exterior of the building.  In my case, I mounted it on the exterior of my garage and ran the cable through the eave soffit.  The idiotic design of the cable meant I had to drill a very large hole to run a cable that is 1/4"" across, then fill it with silicone and a rubber gasket. Nest needs to rethink the cable design for the second generation (or better yet, update this product mid-cycle).","Great camera, stupid cable design."

Stee,"These outdoor Nest cameras are meeting every expectation for me.  And a big bonus was the change in subscription plans.  The new 5 day recording option really helps enhance the ""bang for the buck"" from these cameras.  To have 5 days of 24/7 recordings on 2 cameras for $80 a year is a great value. The cameras themselves are outstanding.  The video quality is fantastic both night and day.  The app for the iPhone is intuitive and easy to use.  The activity log is quite powerful and makes for a quick review of the highlights of the day. I have also noticed no decrease in my homes overall internet bandwidth.  I'll likely add another camera to my home sometime this spring.  These little buggers are addictive. UPDATE 11/2018 - I've been very pleased with the usefulness of my first two cameras and ordered a third on Cyber Monday.  Two things I learned during my second order from Nest.  1.) These cameras really would be worthless without Nest Aware.  My third camera is currently waiting (up to 5 days) for my Nest Aware subscription to kick in.  Going back and only getting the limited still images vs actual video from history seems worthless.  You get only a fraction of a person, fraction of a car, etc and so on.  I would not recommend buying these cam's if you plan to use it for live only.  There are cheaper options.  And 2.) I cannot believe Nest is taking up to 5 days to process an order for an existing account, new camera.  It surely seems like they should be able to enable my camera the moment my credit card cleared.  Very unusual.",Great product and a great value with the new 5 day recording option.

When you do finally connect there is a ten second lag time and my wife stood directly facing the camera and the blocky pixels were so bad I couldn’t recognise her! I really have become very suspicious of all the good reveiws I read because the product is ‘not fit for purpose’ ie: a security camera! When you add that you HAVE to buy a subscription to view past events it becomes even more like a bad joke.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2017,Tom Burke,"It is very rare for me to write a ""hate it"" review, but this time I must. Nest Cam Outdoor is made useless by the fact that that there are WAY too many false alerts--and this is while using the crazy-expensive Nest Aware subscription which is supposed to use ""advanced cloud algorithms ... to give your camera smarter alerts"". I can't use it at night--when I most need it--because my phone would be beeping constantly from all the ""ghosts"" it sees (see the photo below--the creepy white centipede is typical). It also gives lots of false alerts during daylight hours, apparently because of light reflections on my house from passing cars. So why have it if the alerts are so annoying that you have to turn them off? And yes, I know about the detection zones you get with Nest Aware, and I have wasted far too much time tweaking them futilely. Also, the cameras too often go offline. This is despite my having a mesh WiFi router system that gives a very strong signal everywhere on my property--one of the routers is just ten feet from my Nest Cams. I also have the power supplies for the cameras plugged into a high-quality Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) that eliminates any brownouts or noise on the power line. And, my internet connection is through a fast fiber-optic service (FiOS) that is very reliable and also has battery backup. So, there is really no excuse (at least, not at my end) for the cameras ever going offline, which makes me suspect that there is a problem with Nest's (expensive) cloud service. I won't be renewing my Nest Aware subscription since it's a complete waste of money. I just wish I could return the useless cameras, but unfortunately it's too late for that.",Great for detecting ghosts!
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jan 2017,Nickski,"I will start by saying that this product does almost everything that it is supposed to do. My complaint is that they advertise that the camera can tell the difference between people and small animals.  It can't. As a result, I get lots of false motion alert notifications of someone approaching the zone, when it is just a squirrel or a cat. This becomes frustrating after awhile. I also had to disable the noise alert, because many times when a car goes by on out street, it sends a false alert. Update 4/29/17 Still too many false alerts!  I will say that every time a squirrel, or a cat walks across our porch, I get a motion alert.  This gets a bit frustrating and, like the boy who cried wolf, you start to not pay attention to the alerts.  Of course it will be one of these occasions when a legitimate intruder will be detected and we will not know about it, until the damage is done. Also, I added another camera in another location/zone.  Be aware that for each camera you want on your recording subscription account, it costs $100/year for a 10 day recording period before recording overwrite occurs.  So, if you have 5 zones to monitor, it will cost you $500 per year! It would really be nice if Nest had an option for local recording on my computer.  I suppose that the subscription fees is how they make their millions of dollars per month. Update - I feel like I am a victim of ""the boy who cried wolf"" so many times, I don't even bother to look at the images when notified of activity anymore because there is a bug that flew in front of the camera, or a squirrel went by on the ground.  Also, both of the cameras that I currently have in use go offline on a regular basis, even though the camera that is furthest away is only about 25 feet away from the WiFi signal and the other is only 9 feet away. Multitude of problems for something that is so expensive.  And then I have to pay an expensive subscription cost in order to get full functionality.

Gawne,"We loved Nest Cam while the 30 day trial subscription was active.  Once that expired however, this camera is next to useless.  You only get 3 hours of still images to review, so if something happens at 1am in the morning, you'd better set your alarm for 4am to review the event.  It is too bad the Nest camera gets so stripped down after Nest Aware expires - it turned a really positive experience into a completely negative one.  We'd return it if we could.  We've replaced our Nest Camera with much less expensive Yi Cameras that have improved functionality that doesn't require an ongoing subscription.  To be fair, we preferred the Nest Camera with Nest Aware to the Yi Cameras, but the ongoing subscription price isn't worth the slight boost in features.","Only good if you pay for the expensive Nest Aware subsciption - without it, this camera is really poor"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Feb 2017,Jon W.,"This is my third Dropcam/Nest Camera. I would say that the quality of the streamed video is on par with my Dropcam Pro. The specs may be better, but I can't tell the difference at all. Nest ""automatically"" detects your connection speed and chooses a resolution for you to view your streaming/recorded video in. My experience has been that it will lower the resolution significantly in that process so that you're viewing something roughly equal to VHS video quality the majority of the time. For the most part that's fine as you can tell if someone has broken into your house or if your dog has gotten into the trash. The problem is that you can't tell what he got out of the trash because it all just looks like a pixelated mess. The setup for this camera is actually really nice though. The quality of the camera, the wiring, the mounting hardware and even the plug are fantastic. Everything feels really solid and made to last. The magnetic mount is probably the best thing ever. It allows you to perfectly position the camera where you want it to get the exact shot/angle you need. I'm actually using this camera indoors because I preferred this mounting method and the white case of the camera. The wide angle view allows the camera to be mounted in the corner of my home where it's able to see the front and back doors in the same shot. The night vision works well also. I'm able to see things (with drastically reduced resolution) in the dark up to 25 feet away. While I may not be able to see a person's full facial details in the shot, I can tell if they've broken into my back door 25 feet away. Within about 15 feet you're able to make out a pretty good amount of detail in the dark. Last, and most importantly, this camera requires an expensive recurring service fee. The fees are as follows: $300/yr or $30/mo for 30 days of history for the first camera, and then a 50% discount on each additional camera ($150/yr). $100/yr or $5/mo for 10 days of history with a 50% discount on additional cameras ($50/yr). If you only had one camera and wanted just the 10 days of history you would pay $700 for the first 5 years of ownership. That's ok when compared to a monitored security service. However, if you wanted to have 3 cameras (front of house, back of house, and interior) you would pay $1,548 for that same 5 years of ownership ($348 for a 2-pack of outdoor camera, $200 for the interior, $200/yr of 10 day history). That starts to get pretty pricey. This is the primary reason I had to lower my stars on my review. There needs to be a better option for recording footage. The camera is completely worthless without their service - unless you only want low-resolution live streaming. I was considering an additional camera to look out my back porch but the additional monthly or annual service fee was too much. If there were a cheaper 48 hour option this would eliminate most of the cost concerns. You would have 2 days to login and download footage of an event if you needed it and it would reduce the amount of server space Nest had to make available while saving everyone money. Pros: GREAT installation options Well made camera Above average night-vision Works with Alexa! The Streaming timeline makes it easy to review the entire day Simple, but useful web portal and phone/table apps Cons: Video has never looked even close to 720P quality To make out facial details the person would need to look directly at the camera from no more than 15 feet away Cost prohibitive for multiple cameras - a never-ending fee for every camera is not a good pricing structure No Home server option to hold your videos locally instead of in the cloud","Great setup, high price, mid-quality video"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jul 2020,Prisoner of Planet Moron,"My home faces onto a cul-de-sac, and I had previously installed a dusk-to-dawn light on the front wall of my garage.  As added security (and for something fun to play with), I purchased this Nest Outdoor Cam. The installation was completed today, and I am quite impressed with the quality of the product and the ease with which the camera was activated and integrated into my smart home environment. The physical installation was a bit challenging, as I am very much a senior citizen and it is SUMMER (90+ degrees) in Gulf Coast Florida.  Some years ago, installation of the dusk-to-dawn light required both a junction box and a corresponding hole through the soffit into my attic.  With some difficulty, I enlarged the soffit hole, and with greater difficulty maneuvered the camera wiring through the junction box, through the soffit, and into the attic (warm up there!), where I connected the power cord. Worked like a charm!  The camera is at least 40' from my router, being separated by interior and outdoor walls, but connectivity has been rock solid.  Alexa lives everywhere in my home, including garage and bathrooms, and Nest Hubs of various types are also well-represented.  Using the Google Nest Skill, all these gadgets were soon happily co-existing with my new camera. Pix include: 1) garage, showing Nest Outdoor Camera above pre-existing dawn-to-dusk security light 2) same, close-up 3) detail of connection through soffit 4) screenshot from my PC:  daytime camera view 5) screenshot from my PC:  nighttime camera view (dawn-to-dusk light is on) I have yet to experiment with all the various settings, but simply using the camera defaults has provided very satisfactory results, including notifications via both push and email.  Fine tuning to follow.","Quality Product, Easy to Install and Operate"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2017,mxb,"These cameras are great. I can only speak from my experience with the app on iOS, but it works beautifully so far. I am a network engineer and had no problems installing, configuring, and since then keeping my 4x outdoor cameras connected and running. On that note: you will need a high quality wireless router and high speed internet connection for constant video uploading! Get this before you setup your system. The app is nice and it alerts me any time any camera detects motion. I get alot of alarms for cars passing my house, but it definitely works. For those concerned these are easy to remove or steal - mount them higher out of reach. The magnet is STRONG and it would take pretty serious force to remove - if someone wants it that badly they probably also have no issue breaking into your home anyway. The cable is hard attached to the camera and cannot be used on any other account while they are paired to yours - so even if a camera is stolen, it's worthless for resale. Also, if it comes to that, you'll have the culprit on camera before it's stolen - so who cares? I have one camera mounted above my garage door, one above my front door, and two in the backyard. They all look great in daylight and the infrared vision at night works nice too - but it isn't as clear, of course. I pay $25/mo for the 4x cameras with 10-days of Nest Aware backup (less than $1/day) and have had no issue at all reviewing past alerts from home or on-the-go. I can see when my mail is delivered, when my trash cans are picked up, etc - and the overall environment is cool since I have a Nest thermostat all tied into it. Most importantly - if you get these cameras, ensure that you get a UPS battery backup for both the cameras and your internet router/modem. (I'd recommend 2x battery backups - one for your internet, one for the cameras). Because these stream over the internet - be careful not to leave a potential weak point of failure. I have heavy locks on my power box, my outdoor junction box where my cable comes into the house, and battery backups running on my router, modem, and another one where all my cameras connect for power. I tested it a few days after installation and each camera uses less than 10 watts even when using the IR lights, meaning all 4x cameras kept running on my battery backup for almost 8 hours.","Fantastic cameras, nice app - get a battery backup"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 May 2017,RainNW,"UPDATE 1/19/2019: Nest Aware, the core benefit of the Nest Camera product, is a complete train wreck. But it is not what you expect to hear. Sure, Nest Aware is great -- it detects people, dogs barking, all sorts of important things. However, where the system breaks down in is the actual billing system. Its a complete train wreck. I have been back and forth with Nest Support trying to re-activate 4 cameras for TWO MONTHS. It goes like this: Order placed. Order goes for days/weeks without being activated. Support contacted with free service offered. Doesn't activate in the timeframe promised. Contacting support again. I have reached 4 contacts now with no resolution. Although, some comforting statements during chat: ""I understand how inconvenient it would be for you,""  -- yup, ending in a comma. Likely a canned response. FIRST REVIEW: There are a lot of good security cameras out there, all with so many great features. Here's why I selected Nest Cam over the competition. Pros: 1) All around great video both day and night. The night vision is impressive and perfectly suited for its sole mission: a security camera 2) Easy to install and get running. I had both cameras up and going within a few minutes. 3) Paid service is reasonably priced and additional cameras are discounted. The paid service offers a great value like detecting people, if someone is in the pool, etc, not just recording history. Cons: 1) Inconsistent user experience while on mobile app vs. website. I hate having to find a computer to sit down at so I can get full access to the camera feature sets 2) Requires constant AC power. Has no battery backup if a cable is cut or simply unplugged. This is especially puzzling as the recommended installation is to plug it into an outdoor outlet. 3) Indoor routing of wiring is not an easy process. Right now I have mine routed along door jams and closed windows until I am brave enough to start drilling through the walls with nearly an inch wide bit. The waterproof cable from the camera that plugs into the puck (which then has another AC power cord) has a considerable diameter to have to push through. 4) Cameras take considerable bandwidth and require careful planning of your WiFi router placement and configuration. I have a 3 radio access point, and I put them on a dedicated channel. The cameras also seem to have poor antennas inside. And since the optimum placement of cameras are on the exterior of your house, its sometimes not a great mix. Overall, I am happy with the Nest Cam, and I believe I will be purchasing a few more to complete the coverage of our property. It has made a great compliment to our Ring Doorbell. UPDATE: I added two more cameras to a four camera setup, giving us a nearly 360 view of our house. While our neighborhood is uneventful, it gives us piece of mind and gives us situational awareness of the property. You can't beat that!","1 Year Update: Nest Aware Train wreck, Do not buy"

Simple, I wanted 24 hour recording with less cables.  The ARLO CANNOT do this. Installation- a breeze minus having to drill a 1"" hole through brick to fit the USB cable.  If you cut the cord it voids warranty to this was the only way. Picture- great.  Probably the best out there. Sound- Picks up sound very well.  Mounted 13 ft up and can pick up conversations of people in my driveway. Connection- here is the bad.  Both are not mounted far from my router and my internet speed is 100mbps.  Just a little less by the cameras themselves.  Both my cameras go offline multiple times a day.  After multiple phone calls (they always pick up without a long wait) they told me they're not made to get a signal through brick.  As outdoor cameras you would think most are mounted to brick because the majority of houses are brick.  However, nest says this isnt the case.  Keep this in mind when choosing. Bottom line- choose a good camera system with feed that doesnt require WiFi that way you dont run into issues down the road.",Why I would go elsewhere for camera's
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Jun 2019,Sara,"I've only had these cameras installed for 3 days now, but as long as my wi-fi/internet isn't being stupid, they work great! They don't have that Hubble-Telescope-quality picture the super expensive cameras do, but what these cameras provide is more than sufficient. They came with a free 30-day subscription to Nest Aware, which I highly recommend unless you plan on watching the live feed of the cameras all day long. Aware stores what the camera sees for 5, 10 or 30 days, depending on what subscription you pay for and it's not expensive. The install wasn't terrible, just a pain in the arce because I wanted them in hard-to-reach places, so I did that to myself. The only thing I'd change about them is the length of the cord from the camera to the power converter. I only have (1) outlet on the exterior of my house and the way I had to route the cords to hide them (sorry, not removing the siding just to hide the cords when they are the same color), is more than 25' long, but hey, that's what extension cords are for. The Nest app is really convenient and easy to use as well. I'd highly recommend these cameras if you're looking to save thousands of dollars on the expensive set-ups. I'll probably end up getting (2) more if these first (2) maintain a good track record :)","So far, so good..."

You know - the commercials where you see someone eyeing that package on your front porch, or some ne'er-do-well milling around your car in the driveway - and you yell at them through the camera and they run off scared silly.  Well, guess again.  They could be standing 5 feet away from this thing and you could be screaming as loud as possible.  If there's a bird chirping or a running car 200 yards away, the thief isn't going to hear a thing you say.  Even indoors, we had the near a running fish tank and you can barely hear it over the little filter motor and the gurgling water.  It's mind boggling really.  My $8 clock radio with its tiny amplifier and speaker can make a noise around fifty times louder than this camera.  I mean, its like all that's in there is the same thing as in a typical cell phone.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Mar 2017,Dusty,"I purchased this to thwart package thieves and because I am a bit paranoid. So far I am pretty impressed with the my purchase. The video quality is great and the connection is reliable. First, installation was pretty simple, though I wasn't thrilled with puncturing my exterior. I decided to mount this on the aluminum flashing that surrounds my front door, rather than drilling through the vinyl siding. Once I decided on location and got over having to drill into my house, installation was pretty simple. I will echo other reviewers and state that the included cord is way too long if your outlet is near your camera. Following the lead of others, I did not connect the included AC adapter and instead plugged the USB end into an extra iPhone adapter I had laying around and it works just fine. This allowed me to reduce my slack from like 10 feet down to a foot. I use the Nest app on my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10. I do have two Nest Protect sensors, but not the thermostat. While the Nest app works pretty well, there are a few bugs that still need to be worked out. My biggest annoyances are 1) only about 85% of the notifications include the GIF and I still get quite a few that include no preview and 2) there are times where the app just won't load the video when I click on a notification and I have to force quit and restart the app and then manually find that point in time. Outside of these bugs, there are some usability annoyances. It would be nice if you could just arrow between events in the app. You can try clicking the little colored dots, but my experience is not consistent. Therefore, jumping from event to event is a bit of a pain. Also, it is annoying that the software cannot distinguish lights from people/animals/cars/etc. I often get notifications about activity only to have it be headlights that shine in the zone. Since my home is located at a ""T"" intersection, it is unfortunately very common to have headlights in my walkway. The Nest Aware subscription is a bit expensive, but there are not many competitors out there, so it is what it is. Also, there hasn't been a firmware update in over a year (Jan 2016), which is a bit concerning. The picture quality is great, so no issues there. I would love to add more of these around my home, but given the cost of the camera and the subscription service, I don't think I will until things come down in price some.","Great video quality, App has some bugs, Some usability issues, Expensive cloud service, Reliable"

It uses a magnet (held on by a screw to the wall) to keep the unit actually attached to the wall. My first thought was: This could be relatively easy to rip off the wall. So, I made sure to wrap the attached power cable (it does NOT unnattach from the unit BTW) around a rafter to attempt to deter that. But, that was never an issue. The picture is good but don’t be expecting to be able to read license plates from the road. In your driveway, maybe, but the distance is not anything more than should be expected of a camera of this size. Connection to Wi-Fi was easy and I was up and running in less than 15 minutes after the install which took me probably about 45 minutes (longest part was running cable through crawl space and fishing it through the siding). Keep in mind a part of the power cable is roughly 3/4 inch wide, so that is something that needs to be accounted for when doing your install (as it CANNOT be detached or at least could not on my version). But, this was not a show stopper for me. Once installed, I was happy with the picture. Night vision is surprisingly good as well (close range). You will be able to make out a face if they get close enough to the area you have selected to overwatch. The app is very user friendly and allows you to attach and link other cameras, however, the montly price goes up the more cameras you add. But, the subscription service is a must have as it keeps 10 days of recorded material on the nest “cloud”. I paired with one indoor camera as well. (Of note, I hung some decoy cameras and also put up some Brink’s Home Security for additional deterrence). The notifications that the cameras send you can get old but it does differentiate between “motion” and “person”. Expect to get a notice everytime a car drives by or a bug crawls in front of the lens. But, this was not an issue for me. Also, the noticed stop when the app smartly detects that you are “home” once you link the app to your location. I used this product for over a year and the only time the camera quit working was when my internet or power went down. (That is the only draw back - no internet: no access to the camera from your smart phone which is the biggest plus of this product) WAYS TO IMPROVE: There needs to be an option that if a “person” is detected during late night hours (ex. When you are sleeping) that you can set the app to wake you up. I know this was one of the things I wished that app had. Also, removable storage in the camera that keeps recording when the internet is down so that it can be removed and viewed at a later time (with maybe up to a week of storage?) not sure how feasible this is since there is probably limited space. Overall: highly recommended for peace of mind. Durable. Easy to install and de-install. Note: I did not use this product in the extreme cold. Also, the spot I mounted it left it covered from rain/snow. It did survive Georgia heat with no issues though (do not mount in an area that is exposed to direct sunlight). Hope this helps!",Peace of Mind
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2018,Travis Palmer,"I want to say first and foremost that this camera does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I am very impressed with its features and its cloud storage abilities.  If you have high speed internet in your house and its reliable then these cameras will work well.  Literally all you do for installation is pair these cameras and plug them in that is it.  The app on your phone is also wonderful and detects relevant motion perfectly.  I live in a neighborhood where many people are walking by and many cars come and go.  This camera records every car and every person going by and records it as ""events"" you can scroll through the event video thumbnails and zero in on just who is suspicious easily.  After I installed these cameras at my front door and back I started to notice all the odd behavior happening in my town.  People walking around at 3 and 4am.  Wild dogs running around and a lady who specifically lets her dogs pee on our little patch of land by my mailbox.  You will be surprised also how peoples behavior changes once they know they are being watched.  This camera has a bright green light that lets everyone know hey your on candid camera.  The only downside to this camera is what people have been saying.  It is difficult to pass through your house.  You need to splice the wire and get it through.  Well worth the trouble once you see the results.  Also I wanted to mention that nest offers a cloud service for video storage for only $150 for two cameras for the YEAR! so if anyone complains about that then they are being cheap.  Peace of mind does have a cost and in the internet world that is dirt cheap.  All in all these cameras are great.  Search no more",The app on your phone is also wonderful and detects relevant motion perfectly
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Dec 2019,Cedric,"The product has great built quality and the setup was easy. However, I soon to realize the customer service from Nest is subpar. The Nest App on iOS shows the expiration date of the trial, and I was granted one year of free trial according to the App. After one month of the date of purchase, I received a prompt stating the trial is ending soon and I contacted the customer service regarding the inconsistency via Chat. The case got escalated twice and I chatted with three different representatives. All I asked was for Nest to honor the trial expiration date showing in the App (12/30/2020). The representative insisted that the App was showing just a system glitch, but yet the glitch persist as of today. The representative insisted that the customer should know that all Nest Cameras come with one month free trial, but yet the product page and purchase page didn't mention anything about the length of the trial. Without solving my problem, the representative started selling the different subscription plan to me, and I felt a sense of disgust. I'm regretful for choosing Nest and their poor customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. It reminded me of how Comcast/Xfinity used to be. Would not recommend.",Disrespectful Customer Service
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 May 2017,T,"Camaras are very easy to operate and install. Software and apps work great. There are a lot of false alarms for tree shadows on windy days and we have a bat at night that triggers motion and we get about 10 clips a day of ""the bat"" but it also catches every car, person and potential threat which we like, having been victims of several breakins recently. Our biggest complaint would be The cameras going offline for 10 minutes or more periodically thru the day This is more than likely due to poor internet service from Comcast and not an issue with the Nest product. I made sure an upgraded my modem So that it has multiple upload and download channels and I also bought a wifi signal repeater to insure each Camara has a strong connection to the home network we supposedly pay for 10mb upload/25mb download speed we occasionally get that performance but it's not consistent and we don't bother complaining to them because it would be more useful to tell a tree stump. Other complaints are similar to other customers the cable end on the camera cord is just way to thick and requires drilling a 3/4"" hole thru the side of your house if you want to run the wires inside, without that thick end I could have easily fit the wire thru a 1/4"" hole. Hopefully  enough of us complaining will result in a redesign on that,  otherwise installation is great. The field of view is very wide, images are very clear when zoomed out but get very very grainy when zooming In. there is an important trade off because of the frog-eye GoPro like wide angle lenses if you need to read a license plate or identify a persons face the subject of interest really needs to be very close (within about 10ft) of the camera. In order to capture a clear image of the thief the camera really needs to be mounted down where that same thief can probably damage the camera but I suppose by that point you may have a picture of them on the server. If you mount it up high out reach you probably won't be able to clearly see the face. But you will know when they came and how they got to you. So far we like them, but I would highly recommend you check your internet speed and wifi range before purchasing, if your performance is less than what nest recommends I would check with your ISP and find out how much more it will cost you to upgrade and factor that into the total cost of your system.",User friendly cameras

Great quality, easy to set up, no hassle. But! The Nest app is garbage. The entire thing reloads if you have even a slightly unstable connection (not just a loading symbol-it kicks you back to a screen that says you’ve been disconnected from the service with a “try again” button that just basically reloads the app), there’s no pause button for the video, you can only skip in 15 second increments, you can’t adjust the timeline scale to scroll through just seconds instead of minutes-it makes them tough to recommend in my opinion. Nest just needs to get their act together-they’re owned by google, so their app should reflect that. Other than that, if you just need them for recording, they’re great.","Great cameras, bad app"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2018,StarMile,"Some days I love it, other days I hate it.  Check your wifi signal where you want to install thoroughly before installing!  The whole point of this camera is that it is outside, which inherently means that your wifi signal is probably weak.  I have bought extenders, and gone through heroics trying to make this thing work.  Some days it is fine, other days it just straight up does not pickup a wifi signal.  Nest support has been little help. Should also note that this requires an ADDITIONAL subscription for saving videos.  If you have another Nest cam, you will need an additional subscription, it is not one fee.  This wasn't clear to me so I was disappointed in this.  Other cameras like Blink I believe are one fee for all cameras. Other complaint is that you should be completely and totally happy with where you are installing before actually installing.  The dock what goes onto the wall for holding the cord cannot be moved without ripping it out of the wall.  It clips into place, but then cannot be unclipped.  When I didn't have a wifi signal and needed to take the camera down and bring it inside where there was a definite strong signal, I needed to rip this out in order to troubleshoot.  This was very annoying. PROS:  Good image quality.  Sensitive motion detection means you get notifications for passing cars, but sometimes wildlife doesn't set it off.  I like that I can speak through it for when people are visiting the house and I am not home.",The cons outweigh the good for me.

Fortunately I have outdoor outlets nearby so the the installation was pretty easy and the wires easy to conceal.  I had previously tried the Arlo Q inside the house facing out but the IR illumination reflected on the windows and washed out the image and I didn't want the battery outdoor units.  I was impressed with both Arlo and Nest imaging and motion sensing but the Nest won for the outdoor application.  I am so delighted with the Nest that I am willing to pay the $10/mo monitoring fee for each camera.  I will probably get an Arlo Q to monitor the inside of my house.  In spite of the hi def claims, it's difficult to id someone on the camera just because it can't capture that detail.  And of course, the more ambient light you have, the better the imaging.  Day time video is dramatically better than night.  The smartphone app (I use Apple iphone) is very good and easy to use.  I did have to add the Netgear WiFi extender ($30) to improve performance of the camera in the back patio but it was an easy enhancement and it no longer loses wifi connection.",Very pleased!

Also within that first 3 weeks, I caught a USPS delivery driver throw a package instead of gently setting it down. I also caught a man letting his dog poop on our lawn.

We have 8 Nest Protect alarms in our home and wanted to add an outdoor camera. Definitely not worth the price tag this product has on it. Video quality is poor, even when set at highest resolution. Cameras frequently lose connection to WIFI router even in close proximity. Night time motion detection is essentially useless, you’ll get plenty of alerts to car headlights, but beyond that a person can walk right up to your house undetected. The app is very buggy and often does not provide details as you’d like to see. It comes with a 30 day trial of Nest Aware, which again is useless when cameras are jumping on and off network connection all day. To summarize, I would label this as a novelty product at best right now. Nest has marketed this product for a “clean design” look and neglected to add quality you’d expect when paying this much for a web cam.",Not worth the $

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Jun 2018,John,"First, of, this is one really well built and clean design camera, and stellar build quality! The positive: - It's super easy to setup and get working - It looks AMAZING on the wall! - The phone app works great and is easy to use - The web interface is ok, a little slow at times compared to the phone app. - It's easy to download recorded video The negative: - The 1080p video is heavily compressed, especially when people or branches move, most of the time the moving person is just a blocky compression mess, especially if they are in the shade, little chance to identifying someone by there face. But if you just want a camera to see if the babysitter has arrived, or the courier guy is out front, this camera works great. And this wasn't an issue with my internet, as I have 20 Megabits (1.25 Megabytes) upload speed, even the Nest support agent agreed, my internet should be fine. - Night time video is very grainy and average. - You get a lot of notifications if you have it turned on, even with the paid subscription, with only people alerts, often enough I'd get an alert with no one in it. - The WiFi, it's great if you're close to an AP, but if not, it's not great... at all. I'd love for a PoE ethernet powered one, I don't see why not, you can power the camera and connect it to the network at once, everyone wins, no need to find a power outlet where ever the camera goes and will always have a reliable internet connection to the camera. Also, something worth noting to international customers, it seems that Nest only has servers in the USA, so your footage will get uploaded to the US (at least if you live in NZ) and then back down to your country. I don't know how I feel about my security camera footage living in the US, I'd rather it be stored locally in NZ, under NZ laws. Having said all this, I think this is probably the best outdoor security camera for this price and ease of use you can get. Just a shame you can't pay $x/m tp greatly increase the video quality which you upload to Nest, especially if your internet connection can handle it. I returned this camera and bought a Hikvision DS-2CD2085FWD-I 2.8mm camera, which I would only recommend to advanced users. But it has AMAZON crystal clear 4K video and has little grain at night, and all for the same price as this Nest camera. The only downside with the Hikvision camera is that you pretty much have to do all the config/setup yourself, including your own inside or offsite video storage. It's not a plug and play elegant solution like the Nest. If you want ease of use/setup, and don't mind lower quality video, the Nest is for you, but if you know your stuff when it comes to computers, and want to have manual control over everything, then I'd suggest getting the Hikvision camera.","Super easy to setup and use, though video quality could be better"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Mar 2017,Robert B. Hamilton,"You simply can't beat these cameras.  Nice and wide field of view.  Crystal clear.  Works perfect at night.  And the Nest system pulls it all together with a great app on iOS or Android or even PC.  Fencing, clips, video storage on-line.  Check check check. These cameras do require a plug-in power supply.  They also have a large unsightly white circular disc that acts to reduce your 120V current to 12V or whatever the camera uses.  That ugly white disc has to mount on your wall and it's unfortunate.  Since you have to plug in anyway you might as well just go with a standard brick adapter.  Otherwise the install is a snap.  Adding your camera to your account is simple.  You scan a tiny little square tag with your phone.  Then you screw a magnetic holder to the wall, plunk the camera in the holder and nail the wire to the wall.  Plug in and away you go. But that simplicity comes at a cost.  First the camera is expensive but the costs don't stop there.  The whole Nest system is expensive.  You have to pay Nest to store your video.  Every camera gets it's own costly yearly subscription.  Ouch.  I justify this by comparing it to the cost of monitored alarm systems.  Then again, you don't have to pay your alarm company for every door and motion sensor.  You pay one flat monthly fee.  Nest should allow you to install 3 or 4 or 5 cameras on one account. So I've had to reluctantly deduct a star for cost and the ugly circle adapter.  Otherwise this is the perfect camera system.",Works great but costly subscription.  Ouch.

I spoke to 5 different people, spent 3 hours on hold with them over their chat support  because no phone number available and the manager wouldn’t compensate me at all for the wasted time and inconvenience. I won’t buy any google products again due to their terrible support. I also sent a message to their Facebook Messanager which is what their help website says to do and have gotten no response at all.  Here is a recap of my experience: I spoke to Franando first, sent pictures, told him about the issue. I spoke to him for 45 minutes but he could not process my replacement power adapter order and said I would be called immediately and received no call at all.  4 hours later I chatted again because the help site says that phone is not available. I spoke with Gilbert for an hour. He was successful getting the part ordered for me but I asked him twice about how I would be compensated for the inconvenience. I waited and waited because I was then supposed to be connected to a manager and waited 15 minutes and no connection. I then started a new chat connection with Allen Marie and I finally got a case number created for the first time.  She said I would be connected to a manager and I waited for another 30 minutes with no connection. I have been told three times that I would receive a call and have received zero calls. I have now spent 2 hours and 15 minutes waiting for Google Nest and to talk to a manager and get compensated this huge inconvenience and frustration and horrendous customer support. I have now spent so much time asking for compensation for this inconvenience that Google Nest has caused by sending a defective product.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2017,Charles V,"So far I have purchased and installed two of these and I am pretty happy. I am not concerned about the pricing plan assuming that I can utilize the create clip feature that I have not yet tried. Assuming that works I think the pricing is fair. There are a few quirks: 1. When setting these up on your WiFi it takes a long time to get the appropriate responses back from Nest. I've become convinced there is an actual person there intervening on each connection. The set up app seems to work better than the PC version. The find networks function also seems faster if your device is on the same SSID that you want to use for the camera. I was unable to make use of the scan feature for set up (not sure why) and had to enter the numbers from the back of the camera. Do write these down before placing the camera or covering it with a skin. Due to placement, I had weak WiFi signals and ended up using two NETGEAR AC750 WiFi Range Extenders (EX3700-100NAS) to create dedicated 2.4 Ghz SSID's for each camera. Someone else said it worked better on 2.4 so I just believed them. My advice is to be very patient. Let the system respond before you start cursing much or give up. 2. I had an issue that ended up being related to power fluctuations where I installed one inside my garage. My window air conditioner in the garage is on the same circuit and as it would cycle this caused the issue. This was like a mini brownout (milliseconds) and would knock the camera offline sometimes without it ever coming back. Only the camera by the way and nothing else connected on the same circuit. If you are offline long enough, meaning not WiFi connected, you will sometimes lose your settings. I ended up installing an APC Back-UPS 425VA UPS Battery Backup & Surge Protector (BE425M) between the camera and wall socket. This solved that issue and the camera is no longer dropping out. 3. A small issue on reflection due to putting one in my garage looking out to the porch. I like it much better than trying to find power anywhere convenient outside. It is about two inches from the glass. I have double pane windows. I mounted this on a standard camera tripod standing on top of a table using the threaded magnetic base that comes with the wall mount by Wasserstein. After turning off the status lights I would get an ""inside the garage"" reflection at night if the garage was not completely dark.  This was all due to backlighting. This was easily solved by making sure the camera had the window curtains pulled tight behind it completely blocking the light (plastic clothes pins work great for this). 4. There is a very brief time during the day (one minute or less) where one of my cameras ends up pointing toward the sun. This is really unavoidable given the placement restrictions. This causes a whiteout of the camera and it shuts off the view and (I think) recording feature for some time (longer than it should). The WiFi remains connected however and the camera will come back on automatically after about five minutes. This is somewhat annoying. 5. As several people have already mentioned. The second piece of the cord, the part that connects to the electric socket, has this ridiculously large round connector to push the USB male end into (coming from the camera). This is not a transformer or anything else useful. It merely adds a few more feet of cord between the camera and electric socket (if you need it). Throw it away! You are better off using a normal USB wall adapter. If you need extra length you can also use an USB extension cable. Both are available on Amazon. Hope this is useful.",This is a 4.5 review with lots of advice

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Dec 2017,Quani,"This was my first outdoor camera purchase and I couldn’t be more satisfied. Actually, I would be happier if Nest ceased their subscription fees but aside from that, I’m absolutely content with this product. Prior to purchasing, I scoured Amazon for the best affordable outdoor camera and sifted through many reviews. This option was at the top of the list. The fact that many reviewers confirmed that it worked seamlessly with their Echo solidified my decision. I also own the drop cam and have been content with it so far. The picture is crystal clear and the night vision is satisfactory. It lags just a few second behind real time but that isn’t an issue for me. Installation was incredibly easy, as the camera can be mounted by a connecting magnet. The magnetic force is strong and heavy winds haven’t shifted the camera a bit. I never use the microphone feature, but upon installation tested it out and was able to hear clearly. It picks up audio very well. It also rarely buffers and accurately detects motion. I love how seamlessly it works with both my echo show and fire tv. When I receive a motion alert, I’ll ask the fire tv to “show me outside” and it instantly shows the view. The only complaint I have is the bright green light that makes it very conspicuous when otherwise, one wouldn’t be aware of its presence. With the exception of that minor annoyance, I’m a happy camper.","Works Incredibly Well with Echo Show, Fire TV"

So glad I purchased 2 of these camera's. I got one set up in the front of our house facing the driveway. We have had some late night egg throwers. And would love to know who's doing it. Hoping this camera shows us. Also, this subdivision has had numerous vehicle break in's off and on in the past few years. So, I know this camera will be the tool we need to catch some baddies. I received these cameras in 2 days everything I needed to install except I did order one of the brackets because I read that you can get wider angles. It was 15.99. Glad I ordered it separately. First I  tried the camera on the mount it came with. The mount is solid and magnet is very powerful pull to hold camera. However, I was able to get a wider angle and views when I installed the bracket that I ordered separately. This  camera is very clear. I took a few pics. Some during the day, and then at night, with automatic night vision and one without night vision and I turned my porch light on to see if there was a difference. Very happy with this cam so far. Thrilled I was able to install it all by myself, which is saying alot for me. Yay. The app is super easy. I installed it on my laptop so I can see footage in larger screen.  I also downloaded it on my note 8 cell phone. I did not sign up for the service. Trying to see if I can get what I need without it. So far, so good. And the fact it has sound is very cool also. Amazing what crosses your porch and driveway in the night, different wild animals. February 4, 2019 Update: I LOVE THESE CAMERAS.  So far we have caught 3 young guys trying to break in my son's locked truck in driveway and they also went to house next door until it started raining. I could hear them saying oh NO, it's starting to rain come on. Then they proceeded to run in back of subdivision to their get away vehicle. We got to them first. (That's all I will say). Had a Fed X package go to house next door instead of me. I got a notice saying package  WAS delivered to me. It was NOT. I zoomed in on FED X person and you could tell by the box it was MY COMFORTER SET, that I had ordered. So luckily I was able to get it back  from neighbor. Took her a while. I had to show my footage on my cell. (I think the older woman was going to keep it, my packaged had been opened and taken out of the zip up thingy). I have seen a couple of Foxes, a coyote, lots of raccoons and a big snake cross my driveway. And I live in the city. I pay the 5 per month deal and get recorded footage up to 5 days which is all I need. If something important is on the camera I just use my cell to copy it before the 5 days is up. Great cameras. I am ordering 2 for my rentals. So I can make sure if somebody tries to steal my rental AC again, I will have them on camera. Every angle. Cameras are everywhere. If somebody does something they shouldn't be doing they are MOST LIKELY BEING RECORDED. Some of them you can not see the cameras, hidden. My yard maintenance people even have them on their trucks and trailers (the battery kind). They caught a guy stealing their weed eaters off their long enclosed yard truck/trailers. The camera picked up their vehicle and tag and of course the man. They went to the guy's house. Apparently he had been stealing a ton of stuff all over from people. They called cops and not sure what punishment the man got, but all the stolen stuff was taken to the police station and they got their weed eaters back.",I feel safer already !!!

Mossberg,"Good cameras, good picture, good app, but the unforgivable and glaring omission from these is the inability to store video locally and organically. By that, I mean you cannot take and store video directly from the camera to a local storage medium such as a NAS. The o ly way to save video is to choose clips via the app or online and download them from the nest service. That means if you lose internet or you dont have a subscription, these cameras are basically worthless. At this point I'm too heavily invested in these to switch as I spent hours trying to run the electrical cords through the siding and attic but I'm not happy with the options available.  It's pretty much subscription or bust, and you better not lose internet connectivity or your security is basically gone.","Fix your program, Nest"

After hours of time installing the cameras, 2 of them just no longer works one after the other during the summer. Replaced them and in a few days broken again. I went to Fry's Electronics and one of the representatives told me that a few customers brought them back with the same problem. They seem to break when the weather is especially hot, like over 100+ degrees and Nest outdoor camera is specified at 103 degrees maximum, read the spec and verify. The ones that broke were the ones in direct sunlight so that figures. I checked a few other brands, they are not easy to setup but they are rated at 113 degrees, 10 degrees more than Nest. I am sure Nest is aware of this problem, just some users are unable to figure out the reason. Nest should not claim this camera as outdoor with 103 degrees max rating. I want to like this camera, I have the Nest Hello and the indoor camera and they are wonderful, so I do know how to set them up for sure.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 May 2018,D. Hoefner,"It's okay - as others have noted it generally does what it says in terms of capturing video. That said, the software is very buggy and the camera struggles to stay connected to Wi-Fi despite close proximity to the router. The iPhone app frequently logs itself out, and does not support FaceID or TouchID, so you are forced to re-type your email and password each time you want to see an alert, which is frequently a passing bug. Annoyingly, the camera often fails to alert for human or dog activity altogether (even though wind, bugs, rain and the like often trigger an alert). For a reasonably expensive subscription service (the camera is crippled without the subscription) I would expect this camera to be better. UPDATE: Have been struggling with Nest support after changing subscription plans. I get varying answers depending on who I talk to, and nobody has been able to get my cameras working again. Most recently the person I spoke with on the  phone cited ""engineering"" and ""back-end"" issues that remain unresolved at Nest. FURTHER UPDATE: Video playback remains extremely slow and unreliable. The camera frequently does not alert when there are people clearly and largely in the frame, but will send hundreds of alerts if there is snow or trees blowing in the wind, etc. Per other comments here, it seems that Nest is not sufficiently supporting this product on the back end.",Okay but buggy and unreliable UPDATE: still poor quality

I selected the Nest Outdoor camera as I'm a fan of the Nest thermostat; I figured this was the magic bullet.  Installation was easy, however I didn't know that the entire housing wasn't magnetic and isn't a strong magnet.  Therefore, I can't set the camera to the best angle, but its close.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Mar 2017,Al bondigas,"The delivery was the best part of the deal. That said, Nest is a great idea with a lot of functionality that needs a lot of tuning up for the mass market. The bluetooth configuration is clunky and disobedient. You really have to be right next to it within 10 ft of the camera to configure, so if you're trying to use it as a hidden camera it becomes a little obvious if you have to stand on a ladder with your mobile device to configure it if you change your wireless network. The instructions are anemic and you really have to seem to will it to work navigating the websites FAQ's. Take a picture of the back of the nest camera so you can configure the device without having to remove it. It is easy to remove off the magnet base. Not easy enough to be moved by the wind, but a snowball or a branch might, so fasten the cable close to the camera base to prevent it from falling too far. It uses tons of bandwidth, so make sure your wireless doesnt have limits. Its about 50 gigs/month. The resolution is pretty good, but not so good that a little compression would degrade the quality. It needs to implement a compression scheme for its cloud recording to storage of the video. Seems like the best part is the design of the cloud part of the interface with the camera more so than on the home camera or delivery to the cloud system. Hopefully this will get more refined as time goes by.","Great idea, but still a little clunky and data hungry"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2016,PVJ,"I've put off video security for years because I couldn't make heads or tails out of the complicated systems which require a DVR, hard drive, etc, not to mention having to send cables through the crawl space. This is a game changer! It's all in one little unit - NO OTHER COMPONENTS NEEDED! Power: Needs to plug this in, however it comes with very long length of cable so it should accommodate most situations. The only issue I could see is if the plug is low enough for an intruder to unplug the unit. Of course they would likely (but not necessarily) be filmed walking up to it, which would trigger an alert - so maybe that's not a huge issue. A wireless unit however might be very convenient - except when it's time to change batteries ;) Having an all in one unit like Nest Cam is a life saver - yes, it's pricier than the DVR kits but you get no muss, no fuss installation and the data is stored to the cloud so no one can simply take the hard drive and make off with evidence. Yes, there is a subscription fee - $100 for one year/ten day monitoring, which I believe means it will save ten consecutive days of data before it records over it. They also have a thirty day option. It's well worth it. Set up: Easy to get up and running and attach. Can I just say the magnet option is AMAZING! I needed to attach one screw!! The instructions are blessedly super clear and well laid out with text and graphics - thank you! I typically dread setting up new electronics - there are always hiccups and lots of frustration - Not with this one! Coverage: I thought I might need two cameras for the front of my home but the angle of the lens is wide enough that one gets the job done. I may need two for the back as there are some trees that obstruct the view. Picture/audio: crystal clear and audio is very sensitive (also can be turned off). I'm really impressed with the features: alerts if the camera detects a person in view, camera will shut on and off if it detects your phone in/out of the house, you can monitor on your phone or computer, and lots more features. Cons: The upper limit for heat is 104 degrees - as I live in the desert where it can regularly be 110-118 degrees, I'm wondering if I need to bring the camera in or if I can take my chances. I'd hate to cook a $200 camera (or multiple as I plan to get more). I suppose I could bring it in during the day and put it back out at night as it cools off - but what a pain - not to mention not feasible when I go out of town in the summer for a few weeks. I may experiment with setting the camera up indoors near a window - wonder what effect the glass will have on it? I can't recommend this enough - go for it - it feels so good to have this level of security for just a few hundred dollars! I'm on the fence as to whether to purchase the indoor camera - it's received some mixed reviews - so going to mull that over for a bit.",Not your mothers video surveillance - Great Product!
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Dec 2016,Gary Woodsmith,"Good quality, nice design, strong magnet, good viewing angle, good software. Do note that these cameras will use quite a lot of bandwidth so keep an eye on your data caps for your ISP. The data usage estimation range is on nest cam outdoor webpage and located under specs. I talking a range around 60GB-300GB+ per month per camera depending on activity level and resolution. Just keep that in mind, it didn't really come to my attention until I saw the spec page myself. The software features are really top notch, really makes it feel worth the monthly cost. You can set custom activity zones, name them, set their color and shape. You have the option of sharing a link to the camera with or without a password or you can invite someone to have full access to your cameras as long as they register their own free nest account. It feels as though they thoroughly thought this out and use their own products. You can link your nest account to the MyQ liftmaster garage door app, a neat bonus feature. cons: Would like clearer video, but looks fine considering the price. It still gets the job done well, but don't expect to zoom in and get useful details. A suggestion to nest would be to design the attached cables in a way as to make it easier to run behind walls and holes. Needs more color selection when creating activity zones, there are four colors to choose from, the washed out purple being difficult to distinguish from the regular gray activity dots on the nest aware feature.",Yes buy this
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Aug 2019,Porcupine racer,"I had these for a year with the subscription. One of the cameras was fairly consistently disconnecting from the WiFi. It was on a 2.4 gHz channel with a direct line to the router, it did go through a garage door, but usually had no problem, just once or twice a month it would disconnect for a night or two. I'd have to go outside, take the camera down, rescan it, and reconnect it. If I was home. If I was away on travel, SOL. The picture quality was decent, but don't expect to get any details 20 feet out. It would generally notify me of motion, not sound. There were several occasions that I would watch some playback and notice a person walks by or a package was delivered and it didn't catch the movement. Kind of a big deal when it would catch the gentle sway of a breeze through the tree. I can't say that I'd recommend this product, it's not bad, but for the price, go with another company. The tier 1 support is also very hard to deal with. They often refuse to escalate you to tier 2 support. It's really quite ridiculous.",Not worth the cost
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 May 2017,Steve E G,"The camera is only held on with a magnet to the mount, which makes aiming it easy, but worries me if a bird lands on it. And it gets warm, attracting bugs. I have very good WiFi at home, but the 1080 image quality is just flat out bad. Nowhere near what the hype would have you believe. I am seriously considering getting rid of these and investing in some wired cameras with a local hard drive system that backs up to the internet. The image quality is not good enough to clearly identify a stranger's face. The night vision is good if you have a camera that is not facing out a window (the infrared emitters reflect off the glass, ruining the image), and if you do, you can turn off the night-vision and still get a decent image if there is some light source. If it was just to see comings and goings, I would be satisfied. However, I really was expecting to be able to clearly identify people at a little distance, and these seem to struggle to provide good quality images, let alone 1080 images. plus, the 10 day history is a little expensive at $100 a year for one camera (then $50 per). For the cost and hype, I expected to see HD. Almost never actually get it.",Not quite as good as the hype
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Aug 2018,Jeffery P.,"I went back and forth between Ring and Nest. What eventually won me over was the quality of the Nest camera, specifically the night vision. Ring just didn't have the quality of picture during the night. I've now had these Nest cameras installed for about 6 months and absolutely love them! I had to downgrade the quality that my driveway camera records in because it is so far away from my router. That's not Nest's fault, so I did not let that effect my rating. However you should be aware of that when installing your cameras. I should also note that I do pay for Nest Aware, I have a review of that below. PROS - Nest gives you amazing instructions on how to install the cameras, makes it relatively painless. - They work. Very little downtime. - Cold and heat haven't effected them. I installed mine in shady spots because it gets 100+ degrees where I live, but no issues. - Alerts send to my phone/watch whenever a person is detected. (Must have Nest Aware for this) - The design is solid and looks great! - Easy to use App to control the camera - Quality recording, up to 1080p. I have mine set on lower quality because of router placement. - You can create ""Zones"" in which you want to receive notifications when something happens (person, motion, or sound) within selected zones. This is really handy! (Nest Aware only) - There are so many options/settings in the app/website to set your camera up just how you want it. CONS - The alerts with Nest Aware are 90% accurate. But it does miss some people from time to time. - You are dependent on your WiFi signal, no local recording. - No battery powered option, have to run a cord. - Night vision is great, but if you turn a porch light on it can slightly distort the image. NEST AWARE I did decide to purchase Nest Aware for my cameras. This takes a good camera and makes it a GREAT camera. It allows you to have a recording history (5 days, 10 days, or 30 days), get intelligent alerts, and create zones. I choose the bottom tier which is $5 a month or $50 a year for 5 days of recording backup per camera. Since i have 2 cameras the second one is 50% off. So I pay $75 a year for Nest Aware. This is well worth it for 3 features. First, having a 5 day back up history is nice. Without this you can only view 3 hours back of your footage. Second, the intelligent alerts are amazing. The camera can tell the difference between motion from a car or dog and a person. I only get alerts from people. This works about 90% of the time. Third, the zones make it so someone walking there dog on the sidewalk won't notify me. But someone walks up my driveway I get notified. This feature cuts the majority of the unwanted notifications out. Personally I think it's well worth the price. If you don't like subscriptions but want some of these features check out the Nest Cam IQ. CONCLUSION Overall I am very happy with my Nest cameras! I highly recommend them. Great product, great company, and great customer service.",Very Happy With Nest!

I installed the Nest Thermostat last year and love it. The camera was everything the Thermostat was and is. Excellent packaging quality parts and a real APPLE EASE about the installation. The sophistication of the package assembly lends itself to a series of steps that are not only easy to follow, but flowed with the packaging.  Right here I rate the product as superior. Following installation and using my phone and my Mac to view various activity including sounds (alerted me by smart phone similar to a text message), I began to explore the HISTORY feature of the camera.  To my great dismay after 30 days the history is completely unavailable on the computer and the prominent presence that it occupied (the bottom of the screen) is now blocked by a banner asking you to subscribe to Nest Aware.  Very frustrating; I can see limiting the history, but to wipe it out all together renders the camera useless; unless of course you want to stair at your screen all day for what is available, which is the active or ""Live"" shot. So when you consider the cost of the camera, be sure to include the History subscription fee...Because without it the camera is just a window.

One month in and I love it! Our driveway is the only blindside of our house and it bugged me that I never knew if someone was coming in. The Nest Cam solved my problem. For those worried about the yearly subscription, there is now a $50/year ($5/month) option. I’m ok with that. If something was to happen, you can save anything you have recorded to your phone or computer. Very easy. Installation was easy for me. I took measurements and thought it out how I wanted to do it. The 1” housing on the USB plug is big and I definitely didn’t want to drill a hole that size in my house. So instead I was able to put the wire through the weather stripping for my garage door. I was able to attach the transmitter inside the garage and only needed 2ft of extension cord to reach the outlet. Definitely drill pilot holes for the bases, it’s your house, make it nice. My router is about 15ft from the camera so connectivity is rarely an issue. I’m getting push notifications into my phone for motion and person detection. Sometimes a big change in shadows or a tree nearby blowing in the wind will set it off but it’s not annoying to me and it’s nice to check in on the homestead. I knocked one star for the large housing on the usb cord forcing many customers to drill a big hole in their house. I’m handy so I would have done it if it was necessary, but to a general consumer it’s intimidating and will probably add cost because they would have to hire a contractor. Another reason is the mic on the camera is cumbersome. Good investment so far. I’ll update if anything changes. My ISP gives me 1000gb/month and I was under 300 for the first month of use. This includes streaming TV (no cable) + general web browsing. My download speeds are anywhere from 20mbps to 65mbps and the picture quality is clear.",30+ days in and loving it.

Best buy i ever made. There has been soe wi fi connectivity problems on one, and some notification issues on one but the customer service is unbelievable.  You get someone who reads the notes from previous calls and offers intelligent help to sort out issues. One of my original cams had some notification issues, and after trying a couple solutions, they sent me a replacement.  And it wasn't one of those "" when we get your first one back, we'll send you a replacement"" deals.  They sent me the new one and patiently waited for the bad one while i recouped from a hip injury. The replacement lost its wi fi connectivity but I'm not sure if that was a technical issue or a ""non-geek"" user issue :).  At all times i had someone's direct contact info and had follow up emails to make sure all was in working order. Without me asking for it, they reimbursed me for a time when I lost the subscription to Nest Aware, and added on 2 months for free.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Nov 2016,Drjb74,"I purchased the Nest Cam for a couple of reasons.  I like the size factor.  It is small and discreet.  I also have several other Nest products with I have been very happy with so far. The 130 degree viewing angle allows me to capture the entire yard where the camera is set up.  I also like the HD image.  It makes it easy to identify people/cars, etc.  Having a microphone allows me to talk with people in the yard from inside, such as when my kids are playing outside, I can watch them through the app, and call them to come in when it is time. Setup took about 30-45 minutes, simply because I had to mount the camera, then go inside and run the cable, and then come back out and adjust the camera, etc.  Very easy to do.  The magnet mounting setup is nice as it is easy to put up, and allows for a full adjustment of the camera to any angle.  It is also strong enough to hold the camera in place.  I have not noticed any movement at all from wind, weather or anything else. Connecting to the app was extremely quick.  Clicked on add product, and it found it right away.  The app even tells you to plug it in inside to connect it, and then take it outside to check your wifi signal and see if it will continue to work at your desired location. The only negatives I have are that the attached power cable has a USB end, with a large locking collar around it.  I had to drill a 3/4"" hole in the side of the house to be able to thread the cable inside to the outlet.  I filled the hole with foam to seal it up, but I wish the cable would detach from the camera, or that it me a smaller style to not require such a large hole. I also wish there were other color options, as they now have for the Nest Thermostat.  While the white is nice looking, it stands out a little bit on my brown colored home.  A bronze or black color would have blended in better for me. Those two things are fairly picky, but otherwise I have been very satisfied.","Simple to install, easy to operate."

I don't like the lag time from detection to alert, 10 to 40 seconds. Certainly more than enough time for a ""porch pirate"" to remove a package from your porch and get away. The thing I really don't like is the fact that nearly all the features that made me choose this camera will cost $100 a year after the 30 day trial. ($150 for 2 cameras) This is the third attempt at fulfilling my security needs with a wifi camera. It is also the third failure. If you opt for totally wireless, you will have to contend with batteries and 2.4 ghz bandwidth. You may as well go with dummy cameras with hopes an intruder sees the camera and leaves. With these and other wifi cameras you still have to get power to them so there is really no advantage over poe. Some poe systems require additional hardware but newer systems are able to connect directly to a router and can also provide push notifications to a phone or tablet.

I get it that it takes time for the camera to gather the image, process it, and then send it via cellular link to my cell phone, but one of the advertised uses of the device is to communicate in real time with people in the camera's field of view and a 25 second lag renders that function impracticable.

Picture wise, I have no problems. Installation and service is were these fall flat for me. Installation is fairly straight forward. Mount the camera with all the supplied hardware and route the power cable. If you are going to power your camera from an outlet that's inside your home, you need to drill and fairly large hole into the side of your house to pass the usb connection through. This hole measures 5/8"" wide. Not a huge hole, but a awkward size to just uses silicone to seal up. I wish Nest provided a grommet of some sort to take up 80% of the hole. When I bought these, each camera came with 1 month free of Nest Protect service. This is a great service, but not worth the money per month, per camera to have it, especially that these cameras are already priced at a premium to begin with.","These are great cameras, but they have there flaws"

C..,"These are the best we have tried and I have no reason to try anything else at this point. The subscription fees are very reasonable and you get about a week's worth of full HD saved to the cloud. Picture is as good as it gets for this product type. We've been running multiple Nest cameras for about 8 months now, both indoors and out. Up to 6 cameras currently. We do have a very high speed internet connection to handle 6 full HD streams 24/7 + everything else modern day throws at the connection, before upgrading from comcrap internet we would sometimes get messages about wifi signal but apparently it was just a lack of internet connection speed (as I suspected) It's so great to be out of town, or simply away from home, and be able to pull up a half dozen live* HD camera streams from your home. *There is often a 3-5 second delay, sometimes there might be a 10 second day, tested by walking through the camera's field of view while watching live on the app. Sometimes it's only about a 2 second delay. For the purposes of the camera, in a practical sense, I consider all of those to be live, though. I also have Arlo cameras. They are nice in that you can put them anywhere you want (within WiFi range) without running cords, and there's no subscription service, but they simply do not compare to 24/7 recording, nor do they compare to the Nest's picture quality (regular arlo I haven't tried the Pro yet)",The best surveillance cameras we have tried
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Feb 2018,The Technological Consumer,"I have a home setup with all of the Nest home products.  The thermostat, the Nest protect, and a collection of Nest cams (outdoors and indoors).  My very first Nest Outdoor camera had an issue where it would frequently disconnect and was basically unusable.  I contacted Nest support, gave them some information, and they shipped me a new camera within a day or two.  I setup the new camera, shipped the old one back, and the new camera worked perfectly.  The replacement camera has been operating continuously for about the last 6 months.  The winter weather has had more than a few days below 0 Fahrenheit and the camera did not have any issues or lack of feed.  The night vision sensors are great and have a decent range.  As long as you have them enabled, you can see in the dark.  I bought my second outdoor camera and haven't had any issues either.  I installed a bunch more for family and they are also going strong. One issue I have with this camera is the diameter of the cable connection between the AC adapter and the rest of the cable.  It has about a three quarters of an inch diameter, so when you are running these cameras outside, you have to drill these huge holes in the wall (3/4"" or bigger). They fixed the issue with the Nest Outdoor Cam IQ by reducing the diameter of said part, but I can't justify the extra cost for the change. You are required to purchase a Nest Aware plan if you wish to watch your video history.  I wish they had a free 1 day cloud video history option like some of the other brands of cameras have.  I have these Nest Aware subscriptions and they will quickly cost you more than the actual hardware.  The price point of the plans are definitely the biggest con here. Overall though, I am very happy with the cameras.  High quality hardware, great picture, and an amazing mobile interface.  Customer service has been great also.","High quality hardware, great picture, and an amazing mobile interface."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2017,San,"Every time that you have to  reconfigure the camera, either because it's the first time you're setting it up, or you just changed the WiFi password, you have to connect it to your computer, I've never got the app to work well setting up the camera, and I'm an advanced computer and gadgets user and hardware technician. The app just doesn't recognize the camera, it doesn't find the signal from the camera. The other complaint is about the image quality, either on Auto or on 1080p only, the image is not good enough to capture the face o people or license plates of cars at a not that far distance, but I guess there's no other ""smart"" camera that has a better video quality for now. The most important feature of a security camera is, guess what, video quality to record the face of criminals or their license plates, the technology has to improve a lot. It's just too expensive to be just a toy that maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to use it to show to the cops.","Decent, but it could improve a lot for it's price tag."

After a month I noticed that you have to pay a subscription otherwise your camera worth nothing, it is just a brick or a paperweight. Well I tried the subscription and the functionality came back!!, but then multiple problems started. 1. One day the full nest service went down. 2. Push notifications were not sent, despite the activity was registered and that the configuration in the app was set to send notifications. 3. The two steps verification failed.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2018,Maxx,"Incredible camera. Super easy to install, everything you need is right in the box, almost. I did have to buy a small electrical box to install on my house to hide all the excess power cord. I would recommend that everyone buy an electrical box to install on your house to house the extra power cable. Before I purchased this camera, I really didn't want to have to use a cloud service for my video, but after thinking on it for a bit. I realized this was the best for real security. If you have an enclosed camera system, then your home is not really secured. The bad guys could just break in, steal all your stuff, and just take the pc you are using to run your security system; not very safe. If your video is sent to the cloud then it's game over, that video is safe and protected! The cloud service is incredible. I can watch on my smartphone, my ipad, on my FireTV with alexa, and on my PC! It lets you set up zones so you can receive notification if something happens in that zone. The video is awesome, I can read the license plate numbers from mine, and my wife's car. Also, for those complaining that the video feed resets after 30 minutes if you are trying to use the cameras as monitors, on the PC the feed never resets. I keep it on all day long while I am working. If you don't have a good internet provider, and you don't have WiFi coverage for the areas where the cameras will be setup, you will not have a good experience. I actually setup another router just to make sure the cameras have enough coverage. Very happy with this purchase!!! The only negative is the pricing for the cloud service could be better, and have more options, but for piece of mind, I feel good!",So easy to setup.

I decided to purchase two outdoor cameras after both of my doors were being simultaneously knocked on late one night. It is the best purchase I have ever made. I feel so much more secure and safe with these two cameras. The Wifi signal reaches about  30-40 ft from the Wifi router, so I'd say the signal is pretty good.

We have had the indoor cameras but just added this one for outside. The ease of setup was even better than when we added the inside cameras.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2017,GK,"Excellent design, dual band (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz).  Works great at 5 GHz but you need a dual band router to use this frequency. I've learned the hard way that the 2.4 GHz frequency band is very unreliable due to all the competing interference from other devices. There are some issues:  First, since this is designed to be used outdoors you might not have a convenient power outlet outside your house.  The problem is the power plug is about an inch in diameter and it is permanently connected to a power module that is the size of a hockey puck.  The ""hockey puck"" then connects to the camera through a USB 2.0 type plug with a casing that is about 3/4"" in diameter.  So it is not possible to drill a small 1/4 inch hole in a wall to connect to the camera from a power source inside a home.  The hole has to be about 3/4"" in diameter and that will accommodate only the cord from the hockey puck to the camera.  A good solution would be a USB 2.0 computer extension cord.  I tried this and a standard extension cord of this type will not work properly with the camera.  So you are very limited in where you can place the camera outdoors if don't have a convenient outdoor power plug.  The USB extension cord will seem to work but the camera will only work intermittently and it took me hours to realize that camera placement and frequency band were not the problems - the problem was the brand new USB 2.0 extension cord I was using.  Second major issue - you need to sign up for the monthly or yearly subscription to their cloud recording to really use this camera and that costs a minimum of $100 per year for the first camera and $50 for each additional camera.  If you pay monthly it is more expensive.  I'm very impressed with the superb quality of the video, the wide angle of the camera, the software, the design, etc but it's pricey. Overall however, the system is well worth it to me.  The usual 720p camera resolution on competing WiFi cameras don't come close to the clarity and resolution of this camera.  Also the setup and software that Nest supplies is excellent and trouble free.",Great camera but pricey and with some issues
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jan 2017,D. Pellegrini,"For a first gen outdoor nest cam - this is very good.  I have half a dozen nest cams in my home and office - and had a few drop cams before that - to say I quite like them.  Many of the other reviews will walk you through what comes with this camera, how to mount it etc - but I had a hard time finding answers to a couple questions I had: 1. Can you use the camera without the power adapter?  The short answer is NO. For those not aware - the wire that is non-removable / attached to the camera ends with a USB plug.  There is then a second wire that the USB plugs into - which terminates in a electric plug.  I didn't need all of this wire - and would have liked to just plug the USB directly into an electric adapter.  Well, I tried it - and the camera does power on - but does not seem able to hold a wifi connection without this extra power adapter + long wire.  Bummer. 2. Can you rotate the black camera part in the housing - like the indoor nest cams - so say you could have the wire come out the side or top of the housing - but keep the logo / camera rotated around the other way / right side up?  Nope - the black part of the camera is part of the white housing - they are positioned together.  The app will let you rotate the flip the camera image 180 degrees - but nothing more precise than that. In the future it would be very nice if they would add a detachable wire to the camera - with color options for that wire, and a rotating camera eye in the housing.  Different cord length options would have also been a nice touch.  Otherwise this is a very nice camera.  I also bought the highly rated black silicone housing - to better blend this camera into its environment - unfortunately the cable is still bright white.",I had a hard time finding answers to a couple questions I had...
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 May 2017,CAC1031,"I had the camera installed for about two months aimed at my front porch but which also catches the sidewalk on the fairly busy street in front of my house. About three weeks ago I had two Amazon packages stolen from the table on my front porch (deliverers didn't minimize visibility--a separate issue) and this camera caught it all.  When I saw the message that the packages had been delivered, yet they weren't there,  I went back through the day and found when the thieves walked by,  waited a minute, and came back and took the packages (a value under $70).  I made a clip, gave it to police and within a week they had identified the the thieves. And THEN,  three weeks later, the detective contacted me asking if I could look into my video to see if it caught a guy walking by who stole a kid's bike off the front porch of my next door neighbor in a certain time frame.  Not only did the camera catch him walking by,  but because of the angle, you could actually see him walking off with the bike.  Police posted a still from the clip on their website and are apparently still waiting for identification. I am thrilled with the usefulness of this camera,  not just because of the above, but knowing when people show up at my door for any reason is extremely helpful.  I've used the talk feature just once, but you never know when it will come in handy. My only complaint,  which I hope will improve over time,  is that I set alerts to come when there is motion detected in the zone I established within my yard so as not to be alerted when people are just walking by on the sidewalk.  That didn't work very well --I kept getting alerts from outside the zone--so I""ve turned them off.  Obviously, this would not be such a problem in less active view areas.",Extremely useful!

The Nest has a MUCH better picture (I had both the normal Arlo and Arlo Pro), Better sound, and it records EVERYTHING for 5 or 10 days straight depending on the plan you get.  The Nest cameras were very easy to install and setup and they easily connected to my home network.  (I had trouble getting all the Arlo cameras to connect to the base station.  They seem to have a limited range.) There are two down sides to the Nest Outdoor cameras:  1 - You have to run power to the camera.  2- You have to pay for the recording.  But, you need power to the camera to have it record 24/7.  And paying for the recording is reasonable  with plans starting at $50 per year for 5 days worth of video. Overall, I am VERY satisfied with the Nest Outdoor cameras.  I was thinking of keeping the Arlo Pro system, (I have 5 cameras), but after using both, I am going to sell the Arlo and replace it with Nest Cameras.",Amazing Home Security Camera System

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2018,Michel Faleni,"This camera has everything you might be looking for, it can operate without a monthly fee, without a recording device, monitors or any of that extra material that was needed before. Records 24/7, so you don't have to rely on the so unreliable motion sensors of every other camera out there. slick design that seems super strong. Great quality, the zone setting is amazing, as it allows you to set exactly where to look for motion/action. All in all great product. Cons: wires are extra think, so to put it through a wall is a bit of a project, need to to use a 7/8 concrete drill bit, which runs for another 50$. After so much engineering, they could have thought about the extra thick usb weather ready connectors. Also if you want/need anything longer than 3 hrs of recording, you need to pay a monthly fee for each camera. I understand businesses are there to make money, but monthly charges seem a little steep when you have more than one unit. Makes you think about buying the extra one. P.S. i am a heavy amazon buyer, and NEVER write a review. After buying at least 6 to 8 different security cameras, this is, hands down, the best version of what i needed.

Larvenz,"Attractive camera that goes well with just about any style. It has a very organic aesthetic that somehow can bridge just about any exterior styling. The camera offers very high quality imagery, and you can easily make out faces, assuming you've installed it in such a way to allow that. Set up is stupid simple, allowing you to scan the camera barcode and associate it with your Nest account (or create a new one and associate it). Its functionality is fantastic and I love the ease of installation. It comes with a fairly long cable that eventually plugs into a power outlet. The fasteners included are great. It comes with a number of cable fasteners and high quality screws to set them into your wall. Using a little additional hardware I purchased separately, I've installed mine through the exterior ceiling using a 1.25"" bore hole drill bit and an eye grommet that has an insert to allow the cable to pass through. You can caulk around the cable and have a reasonably watertight fit. A 1"" bit is a hair too small, as the USB plug is fairly large. I didn't like the idea of someone being able to come up and simply unplug the device from an outlet. ***One thing to note is that there is a monthly cost associated with the Nest camera service, and that service is PER CAMERA rather than a one size fits all that would include all your Nest cameras. Keep that in mind.***","Very nice outdoor camera, easy to install, but it could be a little better in terms of the service agreement"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2017,B. Boyd,"I have 5 outdoor Nest cameras in two separate locations as well as several indoor cameras. In general they work, but there are a few serious defects you should know about before you buy one. Unfortunately, AFAIK no other vendor has a camera that covers all the bases so I've been willing to roll with Nest for now. On the plus side, installation and setup are a snap. IOS app is easy to use as is the web interface. Cameras have been through one winter in a cold, wet place and one summer in a hot place and are still fine. The indoor cameras turn off when we enter the house and turn on when we leave. On the negative side: - You cannot get person alerts within a zone. In my case, a sidewalk is in view but I don't need to know about every person who walks by. Conversely, I don't need to know about every squirrel and rabbit in the motion zone I set up. I really want person alerts ONLY within the zone but Nest does not support that (I have confirmed it with Nest). If you have person alerts on it will notify you of any person detected in the camera's entire field of view. - Image quality is good for things that are very close (under 10 feet) but not good for a greater distance. If you have a small, tight space - like a short driveway off an alley - you should be able to see a license plate. If you don't, you'll be able to describe a vehicle in general terms but that's about it. - Alerts have a strange randomness. I'll get an alert for a bug or squirrel, but then when I review the timeline there was a person that I didn't get a notification for. - If you have a lot of cameras, the spend for Nest Aware (even the 10-day history) starts to get into the hundreds of dollars a year (after, of course, you've already spent many hundreds on the cameras). The camera is pretty much useless without Nest Aware, as it's required for history, clips, person alerts, etc.",Pretty good with some serious defects
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Dec 2017,Candace & Jeremy Coyle,"I absolutely love what Nest is doing in the marketplace.  Their products are innovative, stylish, easy to use, and best of all... they work the way they should!  This camera is no exception.  Install took me a bit, but that was just due to me taking my time to run the wires are cleanly as possible.  Once installed, setup was a breeze with the Nest app on my smartphone.  The customizing options are plentiful, but not overwhelming or unnecessary.  I like how you can choose what definition you want the video recorded at... so for folks who have a slower internet service plan -or- are limited by data caps, you can lower the recording resolution to save on data usage.  In my case - the full HD 1080p recording is perfect.  I was able to easily setup digital zones within the camera's view to stop getting annoying alerts when a car drives by, but still get alerts when someone actually enters my property line.  Nest Aware subscription is kind of expensive when compared to the competition, but the competition doesn't offer as good of a camera in my opinion... so it's a trade off.  But for me - $150/yr for 10-days of recording history for both my cameras is worth it... and far cheaper than a standalone security system from any of the major security companies. One tip for anyone installing the cameras:  Even though they are fully weatherproof, I personally recommend installing them underneath an eve of the home (meaning - not just out in open airspace).  This will prevent them from getting too cold in the winter with all the falling cold/moist air, and too hot in the summer getting beat on by the sun (the directions actually say not to let them get basked in sunlight).",Excellent product all around.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Oct 2018,J. Hinkle,"I've been very pleased with these cameras.  Set up was very easy, the picture and sound quality is great and the options for setting up motion zones and which alerts you get avoids the hassle of getting ""false alarms"" from things like cars driving by.  We have a busy street in front of our house and the Ring Wireless Camera we tried first simply didn't work as it was constantly sending notifications every time a car went by.  This Nest cam also detects and logs cars as motion, but it is smart enough to be able to identify people and you can set your notifications so that you only get alerts when it detects a person and not for general motion (though those are still logged and you can review them in the app. The other thing I love about these vs. the wireless camera options is they record 24/7 and with the subscription ($50 a year per camera for the basic option) you can go in and review the last  days of footage (longer periods available with higher price tier subscriptions).  With the wireless cameras that only record motion you're out of look if say someone broke in and in failed to detect motion.  With these you could manually review the footage and generate clips and stills even if the motion failed.  That said, the motion and person detection on these has been great so far--much better than the Ring Battery Cam we tried first that was not only triggered by cars in the street but also often failed to record us coming and going out the front door.",Great security camera if you have outside power outlets.

It's all a blur.  I was hoping to capture license plate numbers if somebody pulled into my driveway with bad intentions when I looked at archives.  I did purchase the 30 day archiving option which also includes the ability to set up 4 different monitoring zones.  So far, my largest misgiving is that the unit will occasionally go off-line.  I have an extremely strong signal (-45 dbm) as my router is just feet away inside.  I've had it go off-line while I am using my desktop computer, so I know that my wi-fi was up.  The weird part is that it tends to go off-line when something large moves into range.. like a UPS or FedEx truck delivering to me.  I did contact support.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Aug 2017,Squeaky,"I LOVE these cameras. I cannot recommend them enough to friends and family. The picture quality is better than anything that's out there right now (in this price range) and the recording 24/7 is what really takes the cake. I have a RING Doorbell PRO for the front door, and three of these to cover the other areas. The RING says it's 1080P, but side-by-side comparison shows that's it not even close. I've even had SWANN 1080P wired cameras to a DVR, and the quality wasn't this good. Daytime and nighttime. The price for the NEST Aware is a little steep. $10 for the first camera and $5 for every additional for only 10 days of archive. In the grand scheme of things, it's not that expensive. If you have one camera, that's the cost of two cups of ""designer"" coffee. The best feature, which I think is downplayed a lot, is that it records 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Most other cloud based cameras (RING Included) does not do this. They only record when it detects motion. If it misses something, it DOES NOT RECORD. The NEST has a very easy app (and website) that you can view and save your clips. The motion settings are also very nice (must be setup in web browser). You can custom draw and color coat the motion zones. For example, my garage door code pad, I had that a separate color. I can quickly look through, and see if anyone tried to use it based off the color of the motion. You could also opt for local storage cameras too, but if you're worried about theft, guess what's going to happen to a camera that is storing data local? Get stolen with it. 10 days may not sound like a long time, but if something happens to your house, or something gets stolen, you're most likely going to notice right away. And if you are worried about extended vacations, then just up your plan to 30 days while you're gone that month. I've also read other people talking about a 1 - 2 second lag with the live video. Unless you have a local hardwired system with a monitor plugged into it, you're always going to have a lag. Especially if you are not at home viewing over your internet. 1 - 2 seconds is HIGHLY acceptable for 1080P content to stream to your phone, LIVE. The only downside to these is installation. The hole required to fit the cable is almost an inch big. That's a big hole to drill in the side of the house. I really don't think anyone at NEST was thinking about that when they decided to use an USB connector for the power. The cord length seems to be sufficient, and the mounting bracket is very easy to use. It's magnetic, so you mount the part on the house, then it ""sticks"" to the camera, so you can fine tune the direction. If you have metal anywhere, you don't even need to mount the bracket, just stick it up there. Also, if you ever (for whatever reason) need to change the wireless network name, the only way to connect them again, is by scanning the QR code on the bottom. Make note of that if you are going to mount these 50 ft in the air... I have three of these cameras, two I have NEST Aware subs on, and one I use for monitoring when I need to. These cameras are great if you just want to stick them up and go, without messing with setting up local storage, running wires everywhere and hoping if someone comes and robs you, they don't take the computer the data is stored on.",I can see clearly now...
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Apr 2018,GEO_TIME,"Works great. Installing is was easy. Setting it up with app was also pretty easy. 2 things I hate. First is the wire. It’s made to be installed by a home owner so there is a 10 for. Cord off of camera that must plug into another round hub with a usb, then that has a 15 ft. Cord that is plugged into a standard outlet. I can’t find a simple way to put this thing up without having excess wire and that wire hub outside mounted to side of the house. What I am going to do is blast a hole in the cinder blocks below with a 1” bit and fish wire from camera through. It has to be a big hole due to the connector. This will hide all of the extra wire and hub. The second thing I don’t like is the fact that you have to pay to record video footage. But it should be expected I suppose. Just another subscription. Overall it’s great for homeowners. But having electrical knowledge I know they could provide options for expert installers as to limit the wire and hub showing out side. But the camera quality is great. Picks up sounds and any movement. It picks up cars on the road that are over 50 ft away. I wouldnt count on that though because I don’t think they say it senses that far in specs. Overall a good buy.",Works well

I bought the cameras because I got a free Nest thermostat when I replaced my A/C.  I access them through my IPhone.  I have outside and inside cameras.  I am running them through my standard ATT Wi-Fi that is in a back bedroom.  They compete with my Sonos speakers and Wemo switches without a problem.  I use them to see in front of my home when the mail comes, garbage is picked up, and lawn service arrives. I use them on my outside desk to watch who comes through the back gate, the squirrels and my dog.  I recommend the monthly service to begin with.  My neighborhood has youth that try to open car doors at night.  I record them.  I also record my Rumba cleaning my house during the day when I am at work.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Aug 2017,F. Brammer,"Initial Review 8/11/2017: I hate reviewing products after just a few hours or days of use because of the shiny new object effect, and here I am doing a review when I only installed these cameras last night. These are very solidly built devices.  I recently tried a cheaper consumer version and I can tell you these are much more substantial!  I read some complaints about the cords.  I think the cords are perfect.  Power and data are affected by the quality of the wiring and insulation.  These cords are designed for outside use in an electrically noisy environment.  That's a good thing.  They aren't that difficult to run. The field of view is great.  I wouldn't mind a larger one, but there are probably problems with that too. It seems to do a good job of detecting people.  It seems to ignore our Yorkies. I'd like to use it for another few weeks before ""recommending"" it, but I'm very happy so far. Update 8/14/2017: I think I've figured out the Zones and when I'm notified and the other flagged activity. 1. It seems to do a great job of identifying ""People"" versus other objects and animals.  Every time it's notified me of a person, it has been a person moving in the ""Zone"" or camera.  I like that.  There have been times where there was a person moving, but the camera just said there was activity and didn't say it was a person.  It seems to pickup people about 80-90% of the time. 2. Obviously, there is some algorithm at work determining how much of the data/image is changing and at what rate.  The camera seems to rarely flag my Yorkies moving around the backyard, I'm good with that; otherwise, it'd just be saying there's constant activity in those zones.  It's probably because between the size of the dogs and the position of the camera they don't take up much of the ""frame"".  Bugs occasionally, but rarely set off the ""activty"" alerts.  When bugs have setup off an alert, I can see why.  They were moving fast and took up a decent amount of the frame.  We learned we have a cat that visits our front door about 2-3 times a week to do some hunting. 3. Zone setup is easy.  The hard part is figuring out the angles.  For example, if a person is standing on my front porch, from the position of the camera, their head is in the street, torso is in the yard and their lower half is on the stoop.  Do I just zone the stoop or do I want to extend it out to catch the activity ""earlier"" in the approach to the house?  That catches more cars passing by, particularly at dark when the headlights are passing through the zones... Anyway, I like it.  I just need to get it set right for my wants.","Impressed, after a week now..."

I have only had this for a couple of months, but it works pretty much flawlessly. Just plug in, check your location and be sure your wifi signal is working via the app on your phone or tablet, or computer.  I have mine located on a detached garage about 40 ft from my router and it works great. I love the fact that it will send you notifications on your devices when it picks up movement or people. You can program specific zones to monitor within each cameras ranges.  You can also specify  which camera setting you want, i.e. 1080, 720 or Auto. You can turn notifications on or off. You can schedule times your camera runs. I also records sounds pretty well. I can hear conversations up to15 ft away from the camera and you can also talk through the device if that is something you need. Perhaps at your front door etc. You can turn the monitor light on or off on the camera also.  Pictures are pretty clear, but with a super wide angle, some items may appear smallish, but you can zoom in to see things better once it has recorded.  My only complaint is when you zoom in on an item, the clarity is not the best, (night mode mostly) but perhaps there is a fix I am not aware of yet.  $10 month or $100 year for 10 days of stored video in the cloud. A little more for 30 days of video.",It doesnt get much easier than this for an outside camera.

Nest will try to steer you to chrome (of course google owns them), but firefox does work.  Just don't ever expect a Microsoft compatible app if you were thinking of viewing on a PC.  ""Camera off"" notifications (which cannot be blocked unless you turn off all Nest notifications in your iPhone settings) are actually WiFi signal lost.  Not a big deal unless you get a wake up notification at 2am.  And no turning ringer off on your phones doesn't block these notifications nor can the Nest app.  Nest considers this a safety feature.  At my house common to get brief cable issues multiple times a day briefly losing WiFi.  Never did get the ""away from home"" feature to work that supposedly sends notifications only when phone out of range.  Bottom line is you have to activate camera notifications from your phone settings rather than Nest app unless you want stray notifications all day.  Resolution is okay - but not as sharp as you might think for 1080p.  Cable connector is large - about five times the size of the cable so expect to be drilling a large hole if you have to go through a wall - on the order of an inch in diameter.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2016,OnTheEdge,"I installed my new outdoor Nest cam in late September without problems.Having tried a couple Foscam outdoor cameras, I've been very happy to avoid some of the problems I had with the Foscam cameras.  Just one example, Foscam would make software updates every month or so, and these didn't occur automatically, so I'd have to call customer support, and often waited 30 minutes or more for assistance.  Nest cam automatically updates (as does my Nest thermostat). I really like the wide camera angle and high quality video, and especially appreciate the ability to designate areas in the camera's field of vision which should be highly sensitive to motion. I also highly value the email notifications when there is unusual or significant motion, particularly if it is a person, but not if the motion seems to be less significant or inanimate. I'm able to view live streaming from my iPad at any time, which is invaluable when I'm traveling. While it's not critical to me, the ability to hear any sounds in the area via the embedded microphone, and respond and speak via the embedded mini-speaker, would certainly be helpful for those who have reason to interact with people in the vicinity. (My camera is pointed at the back deck and beyond, and not normally intended for interacting with people in the area). The reason I don't give a full 5 stars is because the camera is a bit pricey ($200), plus $10 per month for 10 days of video history or $30 per month for 30 days of video history.

Scott,"I ordered two of these cameras, set-up was a breeze. The hardware, product design and aesthetics of the product are GREAT. I've been using the two outdoor nest cams for a couple of days and have been pleased with performance and was considering adding two more cameras to the system so I would have four total. However, that plan came to a screeching end when I realized that the monthly monitoring/service fee of $10/month for 10 days of 24/7 history only covers ONE camera. Each additional camera is $5/month. So, quick math, purchase price of 4 cams, $686 and Annual subscription of Nest Aware for three cameras (purchased annually for year 1) $350. Annual subscription for year 2, $350; year 3, $350 (as so on). At the 3 year mark, I would be at $1,736 in cost. Each successive year adds $350 in monitoring. What I was expecting when I ordered the camera is a cost investment of $686 and an annual monitoring cost of $100/year. At year one, I would have been at $786... by year 3, $986... this is what I was expecting, not the $1,736 that Google/Nest is charging for Nest Aware I do have the ISP network bandwidth to run these cameras over my network, however, with the hidden costs of running these cameras, they are going back.

They really Look great and work great.  Video is really good.  24 hour recording I think is the reason for having security cameras.  Like most I think the cord could be redesigned for running thru walls or soffit.  I’m not crazy about the magnetic mounts while they are convenient and hold strong.  I’d prefer a mounting bracket that attaches to the camera making for a little stronger unit and harder to knock off or steal.  Maybe just me but I’d like more secure mounts for security cameras.  If you mount these well out of reach it’s not really an issue.  But above a door while being in reach they can be easily disabled.  Love the wi-fi no cables to run to a recorder. Love the app seeing everything on my iPhone or iPad.  I do recommend these and I would buy again.  I prefer the ac power over battery units that record only if they detect motion.

I have seen some reviews on the service and I will echo that the advanced features are great, on paper, but in reality, they just don't cut it. For me, I set up a zone for right in from of my door, essentially my door mat, and most of the time, when someone is at my door, there is no notification. The nest video feed recognizes that there was movement in the zone, as there is a green marker in the video history that is indicating that there was movement detected in the zone, but there is no notification. However, when my neighbor leaves through their front door, I will also get a green marker on the video feed indicating movement in the zone, even though they didn't go anywhere near my front door (8 feet away). I only sometimes will get the pop up alert and generally about 30 seconds after someone enters my zone. So, you can have someone come to your front door, knock on your door, and leave before you even get a notification that they are there (UPS drivers are notorious for knocking, waiting about 2 seconds, and then leaving). I made numerous calls to Nest, spoke with numerous technicians, had an open trouble ticket and nothing was ever resolved. It just isn't that great of a service. If you have a house, where your zone would be your front yard, and you have little traffic, maybe this would be ok. If you live in the city, where you need to specify a small area, in order to filter out neighbors and pedestrians, and you want an immediate notification when someone is at your door, I say skip the advanced features. They are worthless.",Great camera. Mostly useless special features.

Bluetooth connection process is a bust. Don't install them where you can't reach the usb connector to hook it to your laptop. They look nice but are a disappointing product.

Love the fact that you can create your own monitoring zones, and the ability to determine how the camera reacts to each zone (with regards to notifying you of activity). The Nest app and website are very user friendly and the notifications we get on our phones are great, because I can see a thumbnail of the picture on my lock screen. I never knew we had so many stray cats in our neighborhood. :) I love how versatile these cameras are; you can basically put them anywhere, and position them however you want. The magnet that holds the camera to the base is VERY strong. I also love that we were able to route the cable under our siding and into our garage (that part... wasn't so easy, but my husband is a total champ). That way, we don't have any cords going in through the garage door, and no external outlets that need to be secured. I also love that you can buy silicone skins in different colors to match your home/surroundings. I got one in gray and one in brick red, and they match our house great. (Please ignore the white cable; I'll be securing it and painting it to match the stone eventually.)",Great Home Security Cameras.

I've had a great experience with my Nest Cam Outdoor. Pretty darn easy to install and setup. The Nest Aware service is extra, but I knew that prior to purchasing. I believe you need to make sure your WiFi signal is strong enough to connect prior to purchasing the camera; this will help with a lot of potential headaches. The actual software to notify me of recent activity or seeing an actual person works perfectly. Someone here placed a negative review that the notification is too late and does not actual catch the ""activity"" in the act, thus a waste. I disagree, I received a notification of activity, and the screenshot had a bird in the clip (see my photo). I saw the video and the bird is quite fast, yet it was still able to catch it and notify me. That's pretty darn good. Overall, I'm happy with it. My only gripe is the placement of the power brick that's smack dab in the middle of the length of cable.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jul 2017,Ryan Wagner,"We already had several Nest indoor cameras, and so we decided to buy a couple of the outdoor cameras as well so that we could take full advantage of the night vision. Previously we used a couple indoor cameras and suctioned them to windows to monitor things like our front door, but the downside with that approach is that the night vision has to be disabled otherwise at night all you see is a reflection off the window. By actually using the Nest Outdoor Cameras we are able to use the night vision since the cameras are no longer placed behind windows. The quality is superb just like with all the Nest cameras, and the cloud recording is reasonably priced. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the power cord. We essentially had to punch holes from the outside wall to an inside wall, and then plug them into an outlet inside. From what I've read these power cords are not rated for installation in attics or anything, and so passing them through a wall is really one of the few options. That did work out well though in the end, and we filled the holes with ""Great Stuff"" gap filler. The holes needed to pass the cord through was much larger than I would have liked them to be, but using the gap filler helped make sure we didn't leave a hole for weather/insects to get through into our house. There may be better solutions for that, but it was the easiest we could find.","Great Cameras, Installation Options Could Be Better"

It freaks out at shadows and completely ignores people sometimes. We've been on the phone with support for weeks trying to figure out why it doesn't turn on and off when the app says it should.

If you're planning on running more than two Nest cameras just buy a real security system with a DVR. To use the Nest camera to its fullest potential you need a solid Wi-Fi router as the camera is also a data hog (300GB a month). The 20 foot included USB power cord always seems to be 4 ft too short to reach the nearest electrical outlet.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Oct 2016,D.Perkins,"Received my camera a week ago.  It was easy to set up.  The daytime viewing is excellent, however, the night vision is not as clear as I would expect it to be.  When mounting it, you need to be able to extend the camera out beyond the mounting surface so the night vision isn't affected by the surrounding material.  If it can see the surrounding mounting surface, it causes a glare interfering with the night view. The video recording is an excellent tool to allow you to go online to see your entire day, if desired, but especially to monitor your alerts. Setting up to their app was quick and easy.  You will need to mount your camera in an area that is closest to where your wifi router is so it can pick up the signal.  I have a router at one end of my home and an extender at the other end, which should allow me some flexibility in where I can put my cameras. I would prefer immediate text alerts instead of the email alerts because there is a delay between the activity and the alert.  We are currently using the camera to try and help us catch a feral cat before winter sets in.  After we catch the cat, I plan on relocating the camera to a different part of our yard for security purposes.  I just ordered a second camera for security purposes and may add a third.  There have been some teenagers breaking into ungaraged cars in our neighborhood and in our town recently. 11/8/16 Update:  Not sure why, but I am now and have been shortly after I posted this review, getting immediate alerts when the camera sees or hears something outside, which is exactly what I was hoping for.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Jul 2017,New York,"I love this camera. I already have two indoor cameras with Nest Aware subscription, but at my new location I needed an outdoor camera as well. The traffic is really big on the street, lot of people coming in/out and walking by, and with a bus stop right in front of my door, so I had to keep an eye on the outside area. Therefore it was a no-brainer to buy my outdoor camera from the same brand/company I already use indoor. It is Nest. It works really well. The emails notifications are super, I only need to click on the link below the snapshot picture on the email and it takes me to that timeline on the 24/7 recording video history. But I also use zones, in fact 2 different zones, with different colors each. And, even if I just browse the timeline on the video history either on my phone or on the web, I am only looking for the colors of the zone I am interested in. It is that easy. Otherwise I would have to go through hundreds of markers what is going on the street. That would be really crazy. Nest really made it super easy and unbelievable pleasant to know only what I want to know. I only was afraid of the drilling part of the installation when mounting it on my building's wall (concrete/masonry), because I had to make 3 holes on the wall to mount it. With my brand new hammer driller it worked out much easier than I expected. Well, I am a female, and never driller before. I did not even had a driller. I had to purchase one, so I had really no clue about how to drill and what is what. But it was not that difficult. I also checked out some YouTube drilling tutorials. Oh, yes, and with the camera the package includes all tools needed for mounting the camera on walls, and routing cables  through out. So, you do not need any extra. Maybe an extension cord for your driller, unless you use a battery based driller. Enjoy it !",Super convenient to follow up (Nest Aware subscription) and really great quality video recording 24/7.

I can also talk to them via the app, and they can hear me clearly.

The phone app and website are easy to use and offer full screen viewing.  The 2 way sound is a plus.  I use it to hear thunder during heavy storms.  The audio isn't great since it gets blown out by wind easily but good for those storms that haven't yet kicked up the wind in the area.  Set up was easy if you have any wifi setup experience.

My major complaint about the Nest Cam is the Nest Aware service (which without the service the Nest Camera is practically useless unless you want to watch the live video feed all the time) which feels like a beta product with limited real world applications. My scenario is something was removed from my property and I only noticed the missing item afterward, but I am not sure when over the last 5 or 6 days to was stolen. In my case due to neighbors walking their dogs and families going for walks I have numerous email alerts and even more fales alerts due to lights from cars activating other zones. It seems a dramatic change in light levels will trigger a zone alert. So, I know something was stolen from my property and I can't find at least when and any photo from the timeframe unless I want to review days of video or hundreds on email which I would have to look at individually. My opinion is the Nest Aware and therefore the Nest CAM is a beta product which in the future could be a useful product for homes on busier streets but not now.

The value of security cameras is not in hardware but in software. Nest is beginning to prove that. Creation of security zones works. The software can differentiate between people and other moving objects. I'm taking away a point for the following reasons: (1) If a zone includes a glass window, then any image (of an object outside of the security zone) in that window is seen by the software as a moving object and alert is sent. The software needs to be able to differentiate between a reflection and an actual moving object in the security zone. (2) There should be global settings and local settings for each device. You should be able to setup whether global will override local settings or local will override global settings. Necessary if you've multiple cameras and a many devices. (3) Occasionally, configuration changes require pulling out the camera and connecting it to computer, this is a pain. The camera device should be completely remotely managed and configurable. (4) When at home, devices should be able to connect locally to the camera to review alerts, at least for the last 4 or 5 alerts. It takes too long to connect to the Cloud server and find the reason for the alert, when you are already at home. Finally, on the hardware side, there needs to be some type of security protection for magnetic mount for the camera. I understand that the camera itself is its protection but I'm talking about situations during power failures, etc. I have used Ring camera too, which is excellent as a doorbell replacement but Ring doesn't have security software as good as Nest. At the end of the day, it is the software that differentiates.",Excellent security software but it would take more to make it great!

I bought a plastic wire grommet and drilled a 1"" hole for the wires. I mounted the magnetic plate over 2/3 of the grommet after I ran the wire and filled the grommet with silicone, so you can't see the hole unless your unclose and its mounted high so you really can't tell. As for the quality, daytime is excellent, night vision is pretty grainy. I have outside lights that stay on all night so it rarely goes into night-vision mode. Your gonna want a pretty good Wifi signal wherever you mount this, our house is a town home and the back signal was weak so i ended up buying a range extender for it and it works great now. We use apple products, including the apple TV4 and the app there allows you to watch the cams right on the TV. bought into the 10 day history recording, its $10 for the first cam and $5 for each additional, $15 per month is worth it for us to have the security. We get notices when people come to the door and at night we get notices of all the wildlife that transitions.

Needless to say they are not. Cameras daily go offline multiple times. No rhyme or reason and my network is great, bandwidth plenty and both cameras show full WiFi bars. I’ve had nest support ticket open since 2 weeks after I had them installed. Even nest agrees my network is good and all router settings are exceptional.  They keep having me do the same diagnostics over and over like changing my router band or deleting and re add the cameras, nothing works. Even was online with support when one went offline and they could see it on my account as offline but could not trouble shoot why it happens. My belief is they know this camera has issues and are stalling. Checked blogs and others have offline issues as well. Regret going nest.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Mar 2017,CO momma,"I really do love this camera.  It's so easy to setup just about anywhere.  The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars are for the following:  The camera works great, but, there are some performance features that are needed.  If they were added, I would rate the product as excellent/5 stars.  Here are the features I would like to see added: 1. Enable multiple wifi's to be connected to the camera.  Being in an older or bigger home, you often have multiple wifi's and repeaters in order to get good connection throughout your house, and, all other electronics (phone, Roku, Apple TV, etc) will allow the product to automatically switch over to another approved wifi if the current one setup drops.  This is very much needed for the Nest camera, because it currently only allows for one wifi connection to be set up at one time.  If you want to change it, you have to remove the existing one, then add a new one, and, you have to enter in all of your camera details in order to make the change.  2. It would be great to set up the notifications so that you can customize what you want to be notified of.  Right now, you only have the option to be notified of everything, or nothing.  I want to customize notifications, so that, say, if it spots a person, I am sent a text, but, if it just hears a sound or notices activity, I am not sent a text.  But, I will say that the fact that it does notify you if it specifically spots a person is AWESOME.","Great camera, just in need of a couple features added"

They are such an upgrade compared to the awful low def cams I had with ADT. Just make sure you have good enough Wi-Fi and enough bandwidth... and are ready for the install. Install Notes: They are kind of a pain to install and don't seem very well designed for outdoor use. We had to drill some rather large holes in our house in order to hide the cables and whatnot cleanly. You have to drill a hole big enough to fit the over sized USB cord. With that said, a little silicone and stucco paste w/ paint and it looks really professional. It may be a pain to uninstall them some day though. Changing the WiFi network setting is a ridiculous process. You have to either scan the camera with a small qr code that is hard to capture, or use the numbers written next to it. I highly suggest writing down these numbers and storing it in your phone. Anyway, this is just a continuation of the install and hopefully won't have to be re-done very often.",I'm loving these so far.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Sep 2017,Darren Venn,"If I were just writing about the camera and Nest software I'd give this product 5 stars. The camera works really well and the Nest software records well. It is a beautiful looking design and I found installation to be straightforward. The BIG fundamental problem is WiFi. We bought 5 of these cameras to install around the outside of our house. Once up and running, we found that they went offline ALL THE TIME. It was very frustrating. I called Nest support and they were extremely helpful. Seriously, their support line is great. But... they couldn't help me. After a long time on the phone the Nest support guy determined that I had an ""environmental problem"", i.e. the camera kept losing the connection to our home WiFi. Anyways, after suffering through this for some time, I finally decided to get some WiFi Access Points to mount outside, right next to each camera. I chose WAPs that connected via ethernet cable to our Home Network. Voila! The problem is fixed! The WiFi signal from the WAPs is strong enough, and close enough, to avoid the camera's WiFi connection going out. But... this now makes me think that the fundamental design of this device is silly. The whole point of WiFi is to avoid having to make hardware connections - but... you have to drill holes and make hardware connections for this device anyway. To install it, you have to drill holes to mount it, then drill holes and run the cable down the side of the house, then you have to drill THROUGH THE WALL to connect the power cable to an outlet. It would have been much more sensible for Nest to just have run two cables from this device, one for power, one for Ethernet (or maybe just one, with Power over Ethernet). As it is, I had to do double the wiring and mount extra devices to get this to work. I'm sure this is a problem for MANY people, as Home WiFi is designed to stay limited to the interior of your home. It's not designed to reach your outside walls. I'm all installed now, so it's too late for me, but future purchasers would be well served by a redesign of this device that ran both power and Ethernet over the cable, and ditched WiFi altogether.",Fundamental Problem with WiFi

Beware the install. The camera has two leads with plugs, one from the camera terminating in a USB that plugs into a converter box that then leads to a regular wall power plug.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2016,RisingPhoenix,"I've wasted so much money with other cameras. Hundreds of dollars, if not a couple grand. This camera makes me feel like a company finally cared to develop a durable home security camera. -I've owned Foscam IP cameras. Ultimately, their wireless modules died and they would have to be plugged in to communicate then, defeating the purpose of why I bought them. -I've owned trail cameras, one of which arrived faulty (that's what I get for buying refurb.) and another which ultimately died. -I own a Zmodo NVR security camera system, which actually still works, though the recorder faulted and makes it difficult to interact with. -I own a porch motion light + security camera combo which ultimately faulted. -I own 3 FLIR security cameras, all of which either arrived faulty or faulted over time, rendering it useless... It's about time I found something that works well out the box and is easy to set up. As someone who has owned the FLIR cameras, let me tell you - this Nest camera is significantly better. The FLIR camera has practically no night vision performance. It's just pitch black. The FLIR also has poor software for motion detection. It continuously picks up false readings on motion, which could either be a teensy bug flying around, or just clouds casting shadows. This camera has not produced the plethora of false alarms that my FLIR cameras have. This was also very easy to install. At first I was dubious as to the security of the install (because the body is magnetically attached to the base), but the inclusion of wire loops means that this camera is no more easily tampered with than any other. It is a sleek design that looks quite marvelous and functions just as well. Regarding software - this camera has done great to alert me of motion in the area. I have utmost confidence in its ability to accurately send me notifications if it sees something. The recording history is also very easily accessed and scrolled through. I actually love the app on my phone and its ease of use, and I love that it both highlights the region in the timeline when motion was detected, and that it will include a snapshot of the suspected object in my email notification. This camera has made up for all the wasted money in the past. While I prefer NOT to pay a monthly fee for a recording history, I'm happy to have a working solution and can appreciate that my hunt is finally over. A camera with great resolution, easy to access recording history, easy to install, with live feed, all in one stylish package. Way to go, Nest. You've restored my faith in humanity.","FINALLY someone has made a good, cost-effective home security camera."

I purchased the camera in an attempt to get the best resolution possible.  Unfortunately, to maintain even basic functionality as a security device, there is not much that you can do without a subscription.  All the fancy features do not work without said subscription AND you only get to look back for 3 hours of recordings.  For the amount of money that you spend on the hardware, you would think you had an option to at least record locally without advanced features like people recognition and face recognition, but that is not the case.  You also have to deal with the possibility that you will go over data caps that your ISP has set and be forced to reduce the resolution to save data.  If this device requires me to run a power cable through walls, doesn't allow me to store information locally and forces me to record at a lower resolution and THEN on top of it pay more for a subscription, why would I get it?  I am returning this because the negatives overwhelmingly outweigh the positives.",this camera (or these two cameras) are not really useful without a subscription
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Jan 2017,RJ,"The performance is very good, like my Nest indoor cameras, but I'm not a fan of the magnetic mounting. While it holds the camera in place well, it's easy to knock it out of alignment when trying to use the cable clamps to secure it. But once it's mounted, it stays in place. I'm also not a fan of the magnetic mount since Nest does not offer a free replacement if it's stolen, like Ring does with their doorbell. With Ring you submit the police report and they'll ship you a replacement for free. With a hard-mounted camera someone could cut the wires but you still have the camera to reconnect. With the Nest Outdoor Cam they'll cut the wires and walk off with it for spite. And you're out $200. I also wasn't happy with having to drill a 3/4"" hole in my wall to fish the cable connector through when the cable itself is about 1/4"" wide. I don't need the waterproof USB connector to the power module since the outdoor cable run is about five inches and then it goes into the wall. There should be some way to make the waterproof cable connector optional during the installation. But now that they're up and I see how they work, I'm thinking about buying two more for full exterior coverage. :-)",Works well but the magnetic mount is a weakness

Nest Support: ""Can you please hold on for a moment. Let me check if I can find something about this in the manual...."" .... Nest Support: ""It says that the maximum time laps you can create is for 1 hour"" Me: ""Sir, the hour refers to how long the time laps video will be once it compressed the captured time frame. The manual says you can create time laps videos from up to 24 hours periods"" ------- These guys have no clue what the Nest Cam, what a time laps video is etc. I'd say if you are blind, they will read the manual to you but that about all they are good for.

I am a family child care provider and I bought this cam to have in my playroom so I could monitor the older kiddos in there while working with the little's in another room. We have several issues with this cam. 1. I have an iPad mini I was hoping to use as the monitor but learned that I could not get the app because it required iOS 10 or higher. I  then learned that my iPad reached it's max updates so if I wanted iOS 10 or above I needed a new iPad. 2.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Aug 2017,Max V.,"This is a really great camera. It took me maybe 30 minutes to install, but it was easy because I had an outdoor outlet to connect it to. I like that I don't need a DVR or any equipment inside the house besides a decent internet connection and router, which I had anyway. The video quality is awesome and so is the sound. The camera looks modern, like it belongs in 2017 instead of those old-looking bullet cameras. I also like the added security that the video is directly uploaded right away instead of being stored on-site like some other systems and the added cost of maintaining on-site storage. The only thing I don't like is how big the hole needs to be if you want to run it through a wall, but I can see why they had to do that as it makes it easier for the consumer to have a regular AC power plug on the end. Overall, Nest makes great products (I also have Nest Thermostats on our other property) and I will definitely be buying more from them in the future.",This is a really great camera.

The installation instructions are great!  But wait until you get to trying to figure out how to use what you see on your screen of your iPhone.  You are on your own.  All the pamphlet does is show you how to physically hook up the camera.  I had someone do it who was in the business of doing this.  $450 later the cameras were working fine.  It wasn't so bad because the guys spent about 4 hours hooking them up plus 2 hours travel time. Nest just can't seem to put together simple instructions on how to understand what you see on your screen of you iPhone and how to use it.  I know that they know, why won't they just tell us what all the symbols mean and how you put the camera thru its paces?

Installation was super easy. Vendor is great. I now have four Nest products in our home and have discovered that we really couldn't live without them. I love the outdoor camera. On a recent trip to Europe I was able to monitor my home from Germany, where during a severe thunderstorm I noticed leaves piling up in our driveway gutter. I called a neighbor to help clean the area and thereby possibly avoiding flooding ion our basement. This little gem has paid for itself in so many ways already that I could write pages and pages on why you should have one in your home. So much better than signing up with one of those expensive Home Security outfits. This Nest outdoor camera is easy to install, features day and night vision with audio that lets you talk to anyone that comes near where the camera is mounted. Ours is installed by the front of the front doorway allowing us to see the delivery people, mailman, and our landscaping people. Installation was super easy. Took less than 30 minutes, and I am the least bit handy! I can barely hammer a nail straght in the wall. So for me to get this camera, mounted, installed and hooked up to my wifi in less than 30 minutes was quite a miracle and acco0mplishment indeed.",Love this product and it works like a charm

It has become more simpler and user friendly since then. It was super easy to set up in the house. Also very easy to setup. I am tech savvy but it is designed for anyone to setup with your current existing wifi setup in your house. Of course you need to know the router password. Also the quality of the camera is pretty clean. When you zoom in it gets a bit grainy but a great way to see what is going on. If you position the camera correctly and effectively you can monitor and deter any potential threat also to have a piece of mind as well. We got the camera for use as a baby cam mainly because we already have the nest thermostat and that app never failed us. It was a no brainier, I wanted a system that had solid app support with great quality camera that I can just buy, setup and not have any issues with operation.

It will send you notifications of any movement or speaking even, it sent a notification of the neighbors talking even though the cam didn't see them.  it is a bit touchy and ""delayed"" trying to speak thru the camera, but you can do it and you can hear very well thru the speaker.  The cord is very long and its convenient to plug into an outlet outside.  If it gets unplugged it will send you notification.

The area is rural and internet access is limited, with sometimes poor connectivity so I was concerned how well the image would display etc. To my surprise it’s a crystal clear, high def image with great vantage point from the peak of our house. The two way audio provided better results than FaceTime, and for us the alerts are not a problem, as we need to be aware when something is detected. We purchased the annual plan for $50 to save recorded data, which I feel is well worth it to provide security to our vacant property.

The zone feature is very nice as well. Keep it up Nest and please don't make it worse in future iterations.

Herman,"Really a great camera, easy to install, looks sharp; my only complaint is that the USB plug on this that has to be fed into the house if you don't have an outdoor outlet for it is ridiculously big. They tell you to drill a 1"" hole to feed the wire into the house, which is huge considering the wire fits through a 1/4"" hole! I ended up cutting the wire, feeding it inside through a 1/4"" hole, and then reconnecting the power to the USB plug (you only need to connect the red and black power wires, the green/grey A/V wires don't actually do anything since it's on wifi). My warranty is probably voided since I cut the cable and reattached it, but there's no way I was drilling a gaping 1"" hole in the side of my house just to get a 1/4"" wire inside. Considering the overall attention to design and the price of the camera, I'm not sure why they couldn't figure out a better way to route the exterior wire than to drill such a large 1"" hole....","Great camera, but annoying installation issue if routing power from inside the house."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Oct 2016,Gunther Sanderson,"A year ago I tried the Nest indoor camera, and ended up returning after 30 days. The hardware was good, but the software and product were buggy and substandard. I decided to give the outdoor camera a try this year to see if it was any better. I was intrigued by the person detection AI feature, as dealing with no relevant motion alerts is the biggest drawback in the industry. I'm happy to say that Nest really nailed this product. Setup was quick, under five minutes. The person detection really delivers, so far it has been accurate 100% of the time. Solid construction. Much improved app. I would have given it five stars, but there are still a few nits. First, the non removable watermark on the image. Come on Nest, this is really obnoxious, and not something not appropriate for paying this much money. Second, the $10/month cloud storage fee for 10 days. I get it, that costs you money. How about $5/month for five days storage? That's more than most people need. The person detection is really the differentiating feature with this camera. For the price, there are other cameras with the ease of use and picture clarity, but the detection is what sets this one apart.",Big improvement over the indoor camera
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2018,William D. Anderson,"We purchased the Nest Cam Outdoor because we wanted it to alert us if someone entered our yard.  We mounted the camera under the eaves in the front of our house. The camera hardware is excellent and the installation was easy due in part to the magnetic mount.  We were able to get the camera onto our Wi-Fi network and started streaming high quality video very quickly.  The Nest Cam Outdoor provides a high quality color image during the day and a very good black and white image at night. There are two modes for providing security.  The first is a motion detector and the second detects only people.  We found the motion detector to be too sensitive for use outdoors.  We got a false alert every few hours.  We were alerted every time a squirrel ran through the yard or wind blew the tree branches.  At night we were even alerted when car headlights caused moving shadows.  So next, we turned off the motion detector and used only the people detector mode.  This time we did not get any false alarms but were only alerted to people in our yard about half the time.  Several times it did not alert us when someone walked right up the driveway and up to the house. We called Nest Customer Service.  He was very nice and checked our setting to make sure that we had everything set up correctly.  He said that there was nothing that he could do to improve the performance.  He said that I should return the camera if I was not satisfied.  Of course, Amazon provided a quick refund.",Doesn't provide useful alerts
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Sep 2017,Newt,"This is my third Nest product in my home and one of the best. It's extremely simple to set up and install. Setup takes less than two minutes (existing Nest products) and imported into the Nest App. I used a power screwdriver to mount the two brackets and cable clips. I spent more time deciding where to put the camera than I did installing it. The first night, it captured a moth flying around in my backyard (zero external lightening) in complete darkness. Bad things about Nest: extremely sensitive to images. Tons of emails and text when anything moves in the backyard....umbrella, wind chimes, rabbits. Etc.  Maybe add facial recognition to software to prevent family members setting off alerts! Excellent product.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Jan 2017,Sam,"I have two of these; one for the driveway, another for the nursery (I couldn't find a compelling reason to buy the indoor version when there doesn't seem to be a difference other than the outdoor cam is far more aesthetically pleasing). I've owned them both for several months and am ready to review – starting with the negative. CONS • A few nights ago, the cam in the nursery timed out for about 35 minutes. My wife could see that our daughter had awoken and started crying (because she was hungry) before the cam stalled, and was still crying when recording resumed. This camera has ONE JOB, and it failed at a critical moment. I have that cam set on AUTO for image quality, which is supposed to ensure continuous recording, regardless of image quality. I also have a strong WiFi connection through our house. It is absolutely unacceptable that this happened. Now, I've read enough reviews on here to know that Nest's first response is to blame the owner's WiFi signal, so I bought a WiFi extender that arrived today. We're going to give this one more try (my wife is extremely hesitant to trust this product anymore), and if it fails again, I'm tossing this thing in the garbage. • The image resolution is decent, but I guarantee it's never 1080p. I can't imagine in what unattainable circumstances you'd have to place this camera to achieve 1080p, but it's obviously one of those lab test labels that never performs in the real world. • While most people will want and need a video history, spending for Nest Aware is worthwhile if: A) You have money to blow; B) You absolutely must have a record. Nest is really out of touch with their pricing; either you have expensive hardware and cheap service, or vice versa, but not expensive cameras AND history – unless you're Nest! For basic home security in the average scenario, you're going to need at least 3 cameras. Even at the new price, you're looking at $785 for the first year alone in product and service costs, with recurring costs of $200 every year thereafter. • The app functionality seems to have changed recently. You can zoom in on an area and enhance the image, but now, if you want to change the enhanced area, you have to back out of the cam view altogether, then go back in and double-tap the area to enhance. It took a while to figure that out and was very frustrating. • The power cord situation doesn't make sense at all. It should be located in such a way as to be able to pass through a wall without being seen or accessed from the outside. PROS • I started with a CCTV system that had enough wire to wrap around the Earth twice. The DVR that came with it wouldn't work properly, and after a tremendous amount of hassle, I gave up and chose this plug-and-play option that fit with my attempt to make my home smarter. • I already owned a Nest Thermostat and one Nest Protect, and it's nice to have uniformity of brand, especially being able to access the whole system through one app. • It's more attractive than just about any other camera you're going to find, period. • The Zones function is easily the smartest and best part of this camera, especially in being able to differentiate what kind of alert you want, if any, from motion in each zone. Of course, it only comes with a (costly) Nest Aware subscription. VERDICT The most important aspect of ANY security component or system is reliability – if it doesn't work 100% of the time, then it is entirely useless. It's beyond aggravating that I could count on a $20 baby monitor more than my Nest Cam. And the $100-for-one-cam, $50-for-additional-cam video archive (which lasts only 10 days, btw) is obnoxious. Until the firmware is updated to ensure reliability (if that's possible) and they come to their senses and make Nest Aware reasonably priced, I recommend going with something else.","Unacceptable performance, service overpriced"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2017,TechConsultant,"I’ve tested multiple branded IP cameras but haven’t seen a camera like this in the wireless category. The pros, extraordinary range considering the quality it still retains. The setup process is fairly simple and the cable is quite long enough. The magnetic mount process requires 2 screws to install the surface plate. The magnet holds the surface place and camera together. Very rigid. Viewing the cam through the mobile app and through a browser provides a friendly user experience. The Cons, a minor one in terms of installation. Be sure to measure the length of the cable before putting tight cable clips. As you pull the cable, the camera will move from the magnetic mount. For longer camera footage, a subscription is required. The default saves 3 hours. However, great camera and definitely recommend! Time to try the next one up!","With Nest, you can protect yours!"

Do NOT buy these Nest Cameras, they are useless without paying the subscription. Let's say you keep the camera for 5 years at the minimum $50 per year per camera that's another $250.00. If Nest care about their customers they could package the Nest Aware Software and just sell it for a one time fee like any other software, instead of having you paying for the use until the camera craps out. Nest misled customers by giving 30 days free Nest Aware, and customers don't find out that the cameras are useless without the subscription until after the 30 days , by then the 30 days return period expires. (1) The live stream video quality is greatly reduces without the subscription, worse than a crappy old VHS tape. (2) everything slows down without the subscription, live stream takes longer to load, etc. (3) No video clips without the subscription.

Having a couple years favorable experience at assisted living I decide to go with a couple of these at home. I don't like the subscription fees, but decided the convenience and reliable off-site storage outweighs the cost. The camera is simple to mount and even simpler to add to my account with Nest.

There are two downsides though. The first is the optional monthly fee.  The second is the length of power cord.  While Nest does give you a lot of length, I simply did not need it all (I'm in a townhome with outdoor outlets nearby where I wanted/needed to mount my cameras).  You have to find a way to tie up the extra power cord and hide it. I used to have a Lorex system that came with a 7 inch monitor, but the video quality was never good enough.  These Nest cameras are incredible. The fact that they seamlessly integrate with the Nest app is also great.  I already had the Next Thermostat, so adding Nest cameras made a lot of sense.",Great Cameras

Arlo was great for about 3 months, then all went down hill.  Batteries would only last 2 days, then 10 days.  Eventually I stopped using ARLO and gave them away since they were that bad. I decided to try NEST, it was easy to install and set up.  The app works great and has nice clear picture.  I definitely recommend NEST over ARLO.  The worst part about them is there is extra cord wrapped up around the camera.  It would be nice if you could drill a small hole and slide it through, but not possible due to the size of the plug.  You could cut and splice it though. I bought a RING doorbell for my mom.  That system seems to be nice as well, but at this point I think I would stick with Nest.",Arlo was great for about 3 months

Setup is a mess.  The iphone setup did not initially work.  It had trouble recognizing the QR code and the bluetooth device never showed up to enable pairing.  Tried the PC setup and that didn't work either, when connected to the PC over USB it did the normal windows thing asking me to set it up as a mass storage device but I was expecting it to ask for drivers or have some type of setup program included with the CAM.  Tried the installation a third time using the iphone again and selected the manual method using the 6 digit code on the back of the CAM.  After a few minutes it connected and is working now.  Video is very good. I previously had a nest thermostat and loved it (was destroyed in a house fire) but I'm not impressed with this CAM. For the money I expected a much easier setup and something much more durable (with temperature).",Not impressed with Temperature Range or Setup
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2016,TJW,"Nest has really thought this out.  I had the camera up and running within 10 minutes of getting the package.  Mounting it permenantly outside was a piece of cake - the toughest part was getting the self-tapping screws for the metal mount to bite into our wood siding. I'm still tweaking the settings on the camera to prevent false positive notifications, but with the various zones and settings available with their premium service there are plenty of options to tweak. While I originally got this camera thinking it would be cool to check the weather at home - snow mostly, I find that by far the most value is in the alerts.  I have one zone set for the front walk, and one for the driveway.  Nest sends me an alert whenever there is activity in either zone, and it can even differentiate people from vehicles.  I don't believe this service works nearly as well without the cloud service that is an extra change, so that is something to keep in mind. Overall, this is a well thought out, simple, great performing outdoor camera!",A great job by Nest!

You couldn't make out a face if it was standing 2 feet in front of the camera. Just a bunch of colored pixels. I contacted Nest multiple times and they always had an excuse and were not helpful. First it was that there must have been changes to my internet - the only change was that I purchased the pricey subscriptions. The second excuse was that my internet was too slow.  I have more than enough internet capacity and upload speed than recommended.  I even upgraded my internet, bought an access point /wifi range extender.  The third excuse was that we should've known the image quality would decrease because we were now storing to the cloud (it was stored during the 30 day trial, too).

Drop Cam app was great and I was very happy. Then my second cam was a Nest. Better camera, but I was forced to switch to the Nest App. Crap. Took them over a year, but they finally got it almost as good as the Drop App. Added a third cam. All good. Just added this outdoor cam and was well pleased until all of my notifications stopped working. Support is worthless. All they will do is tell you to uninstall and reinstall the App, which wont fix anything. Then they ""escalate"" you, which means you've spent an hour of your time for nothing and it will take them three DAYS to get back to you.

The installation was problematic mainly due to design problems with the supplied cables.  First off, why white?  This sucker stands out like a sore thumb on my new olive green Craftsman house in Idaho.  Admittedly I knew it was white before I purchased it.  I wasn't sure of the size. It Needs choices.  How about black.  The wiring is a whole different kettle of mess.  Fixed length cabling with a clunky connector right in the middle and a whole lot of extra wire that I had to hide in a blank unconnected outdoor outlet box.  Nest will undoubtedly fix these issues or not sell a lot of these cameras and when they do they should offer a decent trade in for these clunkers.  The quality of the picture is as usual terrific.

That is precisely why I bought the cameras and needed storage. I couldn't get this done online so I called and was told that there was new software that had a glitch. I was assured that if I called back in a few days they could take care it. Called two additional times during the following 10 days, held more than 30 minutes each time, and gave up. When I returned from my trip I made contact with Nest customer support. They apologized and gave me 90 days of 10 day storage in return for the trouble that I had. The only problem was they couldn't connect the front door camera to the cloud. It seems important that I know who's been at my front door. I was told that they didn't know why it wouldn't connect to the cloud but I had to be physically where the cameras were to disconnect them from the account, open a new account and reconnect them.

I called in, held for 30 mins, gave up, called back in, held for 20 more minutes and reached a person.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Mar 2017,ej,"In general i feel very good about the set of outdoor Nestcams. Previously tried a very an expensive installed system from a local company. ‘took a huge loss to have that system removed. The cameras were equivalent to NestCam, but not nearly as compact, attractive or ease in installation & usage… The local company installers didn’t take the time, or include us in deciding the best locations for cameras… NestCams installation & ease of use, far superior. We found the most effective locations. Consequently fewer cameras are needed, and less camera footage to monitor. NestCam software is sometimes very slow in bringing up a screening from a post, but usually not too long. I worry a bit if there was an intruder if cams might be too slow. Right now, they’re a good deterrent… The persons who’d been intruding & stealing from us are now leaving us alone. One complaint: Wanted our cams installed through-the-wall near the camera, not down the wall with an exterior outlet which would make it easy to unplug or possibly remove. A smaller connector or re-connectable one would be better. Installation through-a-wall requires an unnecessarily large hole. Otherwise installation was fairly simple. Thought we would need a new outlet: hired an electrician, but didn’t need one. Software: NestCam software is absolutely superior to the outrageously expensive system I hated & had removed. It might have been appropriate for a business, with time & funds to hire someone to monitor the cumbersome software. Occasionally the NestCam system misses sending a notice when a person has been in the camera’s view. but you can go back & find that. Easy with the dots posted along the time line when there's a person or significant movement in view. There are 5 min intervals on the timeline, making it easy to check a particular time. I receive an email notice with a small pic & time for when the cam note movement. Those are valuable. Some misses, some probably not necessary, but i like having them there as they save time having to look through all the footage. You can use a smart phone or an iPad, but i use my desktop cpu. At first i received daily off-line notices. Adding a second router as a booster has corrected that. We have thicker stucco exterior walls. My old, near capacity, cpu, is most likely the reason the software is sometimes slow. It can take a very long time to see the feed i want to check. A little scary because if there’s a problem i want to see what's going on as quickly as possible. As said that's most likely because of my very old computer... Our cams see better with our porch lights on at night, which is something we have always done anyway, however lights aren't necessary. Our cams are installed higher than suggested as we have a two story house with stairs to our front door. Despite that one cam does a good job of monitoring our front entrance, stairs, driveway & cars, a substantial area. Nest support people have been very helpful & generous.  Previously I thought dealing with a specialized security business would be better. Wrong. The NestCams are much better, easier to more carefully & intelligently install; easier to monitor & deal with all around. I definitely recommend them. I feel fairly certain when i upgrade to a better cpu, the software will run faster which will make checking the feeds quicker.",In general i feel very good about the set of outdoor Nestcams

More resolution would make it possible to recognize faces and license plates.

I mounted it on the overhang roof on the 2nd floor since it is easier for cabling into the attick and getting a better view on what i wanted to monitor. since it is a bit higher up, you can notice it doesnt zoom too well. also it notices cars driving by on the road (nice), but it doesnt see me entering the garage which is much closer in! of course elegant design, but the vision at night is also not as good as it was with the indoor. I had really expected this guy to be the indoor with an outdoor casing, but it is not. One of the downsides of this cam is also that when it is mounted, you can change its angle, of course, but you have to do that manually. it would have been good for an outdoor cam to be remotely adjustable.","reasonable, but pricy cam, only for specific uses"

Nope. The hardest part was scanning a QR code. Then, it was registered to my account and online. I didn't have to open any ports on my router or at my cable modem/router (from my ISP) to bridge mode or anything... I just scanned the QR code and was online and working.

There is almost a 10-second delay in voice communication. You press the talk button to talk and then release it to hear the response. But the person at the door doesn't hear what I said until almost 10-seconds later.  If the person at the door manages to stay around that long and responds verbally, there is another long delay before I hear their response.

I only needed ONE Nest cam and the wide angle view is really nice. The picture is nice and it is nice to view for any internet connected device. I did have to install a WiFi booster in my network as getting through so many walls, the WiFi signal was crap.  Now it is full bar! Being able to set the zones and tell by the colors in the playback as to which zone was triggered by movement is NICE! Very sensitive to sound.

Unless you sign up for the monthly subscription this camera is pretty much worthless. You will only get a notification if there is motion and you need to open the app to see it live. No recordings are stored only a screen shot of the past motion. This makes me not want to purchase the door cam or the thermostat by nest. NEVER ANOTHER NEST PRODUCT AGAIN.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Jan 2018,Apollyon,I really liked this while the service was free. The integration in the home app is great and the picture is also great. BUT $100 a year minimum and $50 for additional cameras on a cloud based service is not worth it. EDIT : - 2 stars after using it w/o the service for a few months it is 100% useless there is no way to record or take a picture (besides screenshots on your phone) in the app and it just randomly locks up and wont refresh. For 100-150+ a year you could get a local NAS and buy a new 4-6TB drive every year for those prices and save a lot more than 10 days worth over the years not to mention then the feed isn't owned by google.,Cloud service not include and excessively expensive.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jan 2019,Ben,"I was looking for outdoor cameras after an attempted break-in earlier this year. We live in Minnesota, so I was worried that the temperature operating range on nearly all cameras would not be suited for a Minnesota winter. From reading and talking to neighbors, I realized that a wired camera was the way to go (over a battery powered one). I was thinking that I’d have to go with the much more expensive Nest IQ outdoor, but read somewhere that despite the regular  nest outdoor’s rating only going down to -4 F it actually worked fine in colder weather. I went ahead and bought several of these cameras and am happy to say that they are working just fine despite spending the last several days far below the operating limit and handled last night at -28 without any obvious problem. I’m pretty impressed and feel good about my purchase.",Don’t worry about the cold.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Feb 2017,J Hall,"We have two Nest cams and one of them works great almost all the time.  My only real complaints with that one is it's in our front yard and every time a car passes by or headlights shine on our yard, we get alerts.  We're at the intersection of two roads, so this happens very often.  I typically ignore any alerts that happen after dark for this reason, and a lot of the alerts during the day are simply a car driving by or somebody walking on the sidewalk.  I can't seem to get the camera to angle further towards the house, or I'd just do that. Overall, it's great though, to be able to be on the road and see your own house.  It makes it very easy to check for visitors, or packages that I am expecting, etc. For Nest Aware, although I have two cameras, I only bought a subscription for the outside one.  My inside camera is pretty much for emergencies only, so I'd have plenty of time by default to get clips of any activity I'd need to save; no need for a history there.  Outside, I sprung for ten days history.  30 days seems excessive, since you always have the ability to mark and download clips from the Nest Home website.  If I don't know I need a clip for ten days, then something bad has happened anyways. I enjoy that these plug in, although I almost wish they had some kind of redundancy to accommodate power failures or internet failures.  We had an internet outage a week ago where fiber installers cut our line while installing somebody else's, and then didn't get back out to fix it for 24 hours, so we lost a day of monitoring and service.",... have two Nest cams and one of them works great almost all the time

Tips:  Don't even try to set it up remotely, it doesn't ever work.  Just plug it into your PC and setup takes about 30 seconds.  Then take it outside and mount it on the porch or house.  It comes with a free 30 day trial to Nest to be able to watch past recordings, which we later subscribed to.

It works great. The Nest Aware app is flaky. MANY times people have been on my porch and the camera didn't even register it. I only know because I scroll through the video each day. Here's an important tip!!  Before you install the camera, write down the entry code on the back of the mounting plate. You need access to the QR code on the camera or mounting plate or the entry code on the mounting plate in order to update your router (I got a new router). I found this out the hard way and had to get a ladder to reach the camera for the QR code. Fortunately for me, the camera was close enough to the new router to recognize it without having to completely remove it from the soffit/attic where it was wired and take it closer to the router per the phone support person I called.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jul 2017,Charles,"The hardware is great and the installation was pretty easy. I really would like this device to work well, but the iPhone app leaves a lot to be desired. I have two zones set up, one for the yard and one for the street. The GREEN zone for the yard covers from my front door to just short of the street, and includes my driveway. The RED zone includes the street. I have notifications ON for the GREEN zone and OFF for the RED zone. This should give me notifications when someone comes into my yard, but not when a car goes down the street. (It works great this way for my RING doorbell!) Yet, the Nest app sends me notifications for the GREEN zone when a white vehicle goes down the street during the day, or a vehicle with headlight on goes down the street at night. The street is in the RED zone. I also get notifications for the GREEN zone if a passing cloud causes the front yard to suddenly get darker or brighter. I get notifications in the GREEN zone when leaves blow into the yard from palm trees across the street. In short, I get way too many spurious notifications from the app. It's like the Outdoor Cam that cried wolf.  My Ring Pro Doorbell and app have a sensitivity setting, but otherwise app setup is very similar. Either the recognition algorithm with the Ring doorbell is much better than the Nest Outdoor Cam, or the sensitivity setting makes the difference. I just hope Nest fixes the app soon, because all of the spurious notifications are nothing but a nuisance at this point.","Great Hardware, inadequately implemented software in iPhone app. Can't wait for the app to improve!"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Mar 2018,Occam,"Packaging was put together extremely well.  Everything was easily accessible and understandable.  The installation instructions were clear and well written, and the actual installation process was very easy.  Nest Aware, their online recording / smart alert system, is super simple to use and configure.  It is $5.00/m for the first camera and $3.00/m for the other one - and it keeps 24/h recordings for 5-days straight.  The notifications are very cool - it will differentiate between dogs barking, people talking, and will understand if a person is in view or just an animal. The one thing I didn't like is that the two-way talk/listen functionality is only one way at a time.  So, if I want to say something to someone over the camera, I can't hear anything they are saying while I'm talking. It also doesn't record any audio while you're talking through the camera.  Considering how advanced audio/video technology is today, this is kind of a ridiculous issue to have on an otherwise awesome product.  Still think it deserves 5 stars though.",Great Product.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2016,J. Schaub,"Summary: The video quality has been excellent, and the phone app is outstanding.  I like it so much I'm planning on purchasing two more. Features: I love that it has a microphone and speaker, but probably not as much as my kids do.  They love yelling at each other at the front door now..  The video quality is excellent, and I like that it has ""AUTO"" for quality so I don't have to manually try to adjust video quality to match my internet connection.  The zones work great for limiting alerts, and I like that I can ignore any alert that doesn't say ""Your camera thinks it spotted a person"".  I don't really care about anything but people showing up in my alerts. User Interface: The website interface and the iPhone app have been excellent.  I really like the timeline view on the phone and the ability to easily watch the events that triggered the alerts.  It's easy and intuitive to scroll through the timeline to find events.  Like: are the kids home from school? did the UPS guy really just throw my package like that?  The web interface for downloading clips worked great, and made it easy if you ever want to keep that cute moment or need video evidence to publicly shame those neighborhood punk kids who smashed your halloween pumpkin. Installation: I decided to place it above the front door, and spent a bunch of time researching the best way to plug it in without breaking fire code, and make it look nice.  It looks like running low voltage through the exterior wall of the home is OK, so I drilled a 7/8"" hole in the stucco above my door and fished the USB cable through the wall.  I then ran the cable around the door trim down to floor level where I mounted the DC converter to the wall.  I also cut the A/C power cord and put a new plug on it to avoid having a big mess of extra cable wound up next to my front door.  I'm fairly happy with the install, and with a little patch work and paint, it isn't hardly noticeable. Misc: I've talked with some of my friends who have more traditional video security systems.  They rave about local storage, battery backups, etc.  I really am happy with this level of security and find the cost and the convenience of setup and installation (which were my barriers to getting a traditional security camera system) were exactly what I needed to jump in. Complaints: * Wish the website ""home.nest.com"" didn't use flash for the video playback. * I occasionally get inconsistent alerts on my iPhone.  Wife's phone will beep, but mine is silent * Temperature rating up to 104 F.  I live in Arizona where 104 F happens at 9 am in the summer time.  I'm not sure if I should chance getting another camera until I have a chance to see how this one behaves in the summer.  I'm betting that it just won't do 1080p in the heat.  My camera stays at 720p in AUTO anyway (I assume because of WiFi signal), and I'm happy with the picture quality there.  I would be very disappointed if it dropped to the lower 360p in the heat.",Front Door Camera: security and ability to see when kids come and go

The motion detection feature works well, it does take some adjusting so that it's not picking up close flying insects. The night vision works pretty well.

My favorite feature is being able to save clips that I find valuable or completely funny. I also like having the ability to talk through the camera and that it connects to my Wi-Fi and plugs into the wall so I never have to worry about replacing the batteries or having them die when I'm gone.

The cabling and housing are high quality and the picture comes through nice and crisp. One thing I wish Nest would do is either lowest the cost of the cameras in general or lower the cost for the est Aware subscription. Obviously this isn't a major barrier for me, but I could see others hesitate. All-in-all, I like the cameras which certainly beat having an expensive monthly security system. The biggest downside to using this as your primary security system is internet connectivity.

The image quality is good (1080P with no digital zoom has its limits). Installation was as easy as possible and everything was up an running in less than an hour. The software is truly excellent. NestAware notifies you when it sees movement or recognizes people and allows you to set zones in its view for it to care about so it won't notify you every time the neighbors pull in. It shows a timeline with activity highlighted so you can quickly and easily look back and find the interesting bits without wasting your time scanning through unnecessary video. Google went above and beyond to make sure that the kit was complete, clean, and thoroughly labeled. If it seems packaging is a silly thing to rave about, wait until you see it. Each component was individually boxed and labeled with simple instructions and graphics.","Good product, great software and packaging. Five Stars. No Question."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Feb 2018,Code Monkey,Love these cameras.  Was aware of the subscription model for longer recording before I bought - but trying to record on your own is a PIA and it will cost you time and money too. So the fact that they offer the service in my opinion is great.  The viewing and history tool works well and will show you snapshots at key activity in the timeline.  Sometimes I get frustrated with the UI a bit (I wish there was a BACK button like a browser) but nothing that’s a huge downer. We have WiFi over LTE at our property and the network is on a subnet - so to setup our own cameras would have required paying for a dedicated IP address.  Nest cameras don’t have that limitation so that was a key selling point for me.,Nice integration - great features

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jan 2017,Desert Tom,"I bought one indoor and one outdoor camera.  I didn't want to plug this into an outdoor outlet because it could be easily stolen.  I plugged it into an outlet in my attic by my HVAC unit and ran the cord to the ceiling in my entryway outside.  This gives me a view of people at my front door and of the street immediately in front of my house.  Since it is a small entryway, the 130 degree camera is much smaller angle.  I drilled a hole in the ceiling large enough for the USB attachment which is much bigger hole need for just the wire.  I mounted it about 7ft above the ground.  So far, the quality is good, but somebody standing at the front door seems a bit far away.  I am pretty happy with the camera and the software, but not too thrilled about  paying the monthly fee for the subscription.  I did find a 3rd party app called Blue Iris that looks promising if you want to store data locally without a subscription.  It does not run on a Mac, so it isn't going to work for me (search youtube on how to set it up with Nest.)  There is a one time fee for the Blue Iris software and a trial version to make sure you like it.  For the Nest software, the timeline is a great feature to find motion on the video.

My only complaint would be that a subscription is required for some functionality and that you must log on from a computer to do a few things (save video clips,  set activity zones,  etc.) I like that it can customize my notifications even based on if I am away or home,  but wish I could set to only notify me when a person is spotted instead of just motion (the notifications do specify which though.) Otherwise I've been pleased with this purchase.  I feel more secure with the ability to see my property in real time from anywhere while away.  The video quality is decent no matter what the conditions,  but I can't speak for the audio quality since I have the sound off  (some states have specific laws regarding audio recording so I play it safe.)",Worth spending a little extra

You are not really buying the camera as much as you are buying into the Nest ecosystem.  I would not recommend this to anyone not considering the cloud service too. The Nest Aware service is the big value added of this product.  The recording is sold, payback is easy and timelines very easy to find events that were recorded.  You can draw zones and set alerts customized for each zone on each camera. The installation hardware is where you can find cut corners for most consumer products, but not here. Well thought out, and the product and packaging reflect that. Love the people detection feature, where you can set alerts for when humans enter the picture, but I wish you could set it only for people detected in one zone as opposed to any seen on camera. I expect that, and other cool features to be added to the""aware"" cloud recording service in time. New stuff has been added in the year I have owned Nest cameras.",Pricy quality

I'm not happy with this camera.  While the audio and video are great, utilizing Nest Aware's service is a huge waste of time and money.  If you cannot sit and review footage minute by minute, you may miss hugely important things.  For example, I have had both people and animals walking into defined zones on my property, yet the camera does not register them at all.  Now if you want it to detect every car that drives by, or hawk screeching (yes, it notes those sounds, but apparently not much else). After having me clear cache/cookies and reset zones, and it not fixing the problem, they claim these are glitches and to mount/unmount cameras.  The problem with this is that unless you've had the time to review and download every second of footage before doing so, you lose it.  When you've got weeks of footage you've yet to go through, and you cannot even ""potentially"" fix the problem by rebooting the system, this is a huge inconvenience and completely unacceptable. We used this camera to keep an eye on our property while out of town - it was upon returning that we discovered it wasn't flagging such obvious motion.  It was only when I spotted someone on my property through a window, and then checked the Nest Cam to note that Nest Aware didn't even register the person as being there, that we discovered this HUGE problem.  We now wondering what else we missed while we were away. Oh - and without the Nest Aware service, this camera is even more useless as a security system.  You only get three hours of footage, and got luck staying on top of that if you have a normal life and cannot drop everything to review your footage constantly.",I'm not happy with this camera

When wifi/internet speeds are optimal, the picture is crisp and smooth. Nest's night vision feature works well, even when stretching the distance you're attempting to capture, exceeds expectations. The addition of a well placed IR LED extends that functionality with ease. The interface with Nest App and webpage are functional, though lack a simple 2x/3x/4x high speed review for daily footage. The Time lapse option is welcome and useful, but too cumbersome as a daily review tool. The cameras are fairly easy to setup, although there were two occasions where I had to restart the process. I think that the product and its purchasers would benefit from some sort of a wifi signal strength monitor showing the camera's connection to help adjust for maximum connectivity. Aside from those two UI areas that left me wanting (and can be solved with software updates) it's a good product and absolutely captures the essence of what you'd want in a camera system.

We have experienced stable periods of being online for days, then constants dropping offline the past week.  It may be affected by other devices being on the wifi - particularly streaming videos, games, etc. Seems to work better when no one is in the house. The other issue to consider is power - you need an outlet close to the installation location, or will be running an extension cord to it. So - common location, up high on the exterior -- will likely require installing additional outdoor outlets.

Video quality is great even at night. My hone internet is slow but I can still get a good live feed. I liked the Nest Aware trial but wish they had a 24 hour package for a minimal charge. Shortest is 10 days for $10/mo (+$5 per additional camera) which is too much. Since this is for security mostly, I would know if there was any illegal activity within hours and would only need access to the last 24 hours. There are other ways to capture the feed but Nest Aware is superior and I think they would get more subscribers if they offered additional packages.","Great quality, easy to install"

Finally filled the need to my driveway and it is just a great!!  I had to switch to the Nest app from my Dropcam app (FYI Dropcam app is much smoother and less buggy).  I do like the 'mini-clips' of motion that are sent to me with the Nest app.  I also LOVE the fact that I can allow the owner of the house next to me 'view' my driveway....which also see's his driveway.  He resides out of state but can now check in on his rental property here next to me... at least see the activity in his driveway.

With no indication of needing nest aware. But you do. I'm really disappointed because there's no second option to have the video sent somewhere else. It's either get nest aware or don't get any video play back. Not to mention nests motion detection doesn't work half the time. I watched it as cars, people, and myself walk by the camera and it didn't alert me. But with nest aware it alerts me every time. The quality is great! The installation was simple!

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2016,pinwheelsunshine,"Edit: 02/14/2016. The problems below still persist after the recent iOS Nest app update. It has been months since I bought them in November 2016 and they still have not resolved this basic issue. I very much regret buying four of these expensive cameras. Edit: 04/02/2017. Chatted with Nest support about my snapshot history for the last three hours being totally blank (I don’t have a NestAware subscription and am limited to these snapshots). This has happened quite often since getting these cameras. I know there should be activity there. They tried some things like remotely resetting my camera which didn’t make much difference. During the chat with them, my history will suddenly be viewable on the iPhone. Then a few minutes later, it will be totally blank. This is true for multiple cameras. This gives me zero confidence that I’ll be able to view my history in a timely fashion in the event of an emergency. Also doesn't encourage me to give them any money for NestAware when I'm so often disappointed with how things work as it is. Edit: 04/14/2017. Tried getting notifications working again as I periodically do since my original bad support experience in late 2016. The menus have changed slightly in the iPhone app and on the website which makes me think they attempted to improve notifications. Long story short...they still don't work. After walking around in front of the camera on and off for a half hour (alerts set to ""only when away"" and I currently have it set to Away), I finally got one single email to come in SEVEN MINUTES AFTER THE MOTION ACTIVITY EVENT. This is with me on wifi and monitoring my (push) email, so the problem definitely is with Nest and not my email. Ugh. Sigh sigh sigh. Please see my original review below for even more reasons not to invest in Nest. Will attempt to get notifications working again in a couple months. Not at all reliable now. Original Review: 2+ weeks of dealing with Nest senior level support has left me beyond frustrated. I'm getting notifications for activity when I'm home despite ""only when no one's home"" being enabled in settings. After jumping through a ton of troubleshooting hoops and ultimately creating an entire new Nest account, the problem persists. Got a final phone call today after the ""engineers reviewed my case"" and senior support passed along the word from up top that the engineers say I need to have location services on for my issue to be resolved (which does not have anything to do with my problem as I've described it countless times). After explaining (for the 10th time) that I have the problem with location services both on and off, he proceeded to tell me that ""it's a known issue and they're working on it."" I bought FOUR of these expensive cameras for several reason but notification support was a huge one, and now I've been asked to ""keep an eye on updates"" for an indeterminate time to see if it is fixed. (Also found out after buying them that notifications only show up ONCE every 30-minute interval for each camera, which is totally unacceptable.) Except for this frustrating experience, the iOS and web apps are pretty good. But that does not ameliorate all of the other issues here and I refuse to rate the app more than one star until this is fixed. Will update this review if something changes. PS: What you're viewing ""live"" on your cameras is sometimes 5-10 seconds delayed. I have fast internet with excellent wifi. This is ridiculous. Does not make me want to pay the monthly subscription for Nest Aware when they can't even get free functionality performing well. PPS: My cameras go ""offline"" sporadically quite often. There's nothing else I can do to optimize their location or wifi settings. All cameras are within 10-15 feet of an 802.11ac wifi router. The one that goes offline most is actually about 5 feet from the router. I wish I had the option to plug in a cat6 ethernet cable, but it's wifi only. I'm at a loss with this product.","""That's a known problem"" (Notifications broken)"

Now, it is December and the temperature has dropped down below 40 degrees F on several occasions. Now, when it gets cold at night, the cameras go off line and I have to power cycle the cameras to get them to come back on. I might have thought this was a single defective camera but both cameras do that. For a camera rated as an indoor / outdoor camera, this flaw makes these cameras unacceptable over priced junk. Installation and set up is fairly simple, BUT you have to drill a HUGE 7/8"" hole to bring the 1/4 inch wire into the house because the connector, which is molded and cannot be removed, is a 6/8 inch plastic cylinder molded around a USB plug, just bad mechanical and electrical engineering, all around.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Jan 2017,WCRServices,"As an original Dropcam owner, I waited patiently for the day Nest would announce a waterproof option. I joined the waiting list in July and received the camera in September 2016. Initially I installed the camera in our backyard a captured more night creatures than I knew existed. Eventually though, I had a real security concern of watching our front yard for package deliveries and if my garage door was open or closed. Fortunately we have a tall large tree in our front yard that yields the best place to install the camera to overlook our home. Together with my son, we trenched the yard to bury an in-ground electrical cable from our house to the tree. Then selected a nice flat spot on the tree where a previous limb was cut off. The white camera in a brown tree was like a sore thumb with a large band aid, therefore I purchased a silicone glove to help camouflage the camera. It looks great now. Unlike others, I'd rather not advertise the location of the camera but rather use it to capture those who are dishonest in their ways. The camera is fabulous with its waterproof design. So far I have not cleansed the lens from rain or debris as it doesn't appear to trap water, water spots, etc. The camera has withstood high winds and powerful rain storms already. I was concerned with it's magnetic base if a squirrel or bird could knock it off its mount, fortunately that has not happened. Since the camera is mounted in a tree, I did protect the 5 volt cable with a Gardner Bender Flex Tubing purchased from my local hardware store and secured the tubing to the tree using Everbilt Hose Repair Clamps and EMT Hole Straps for a nice clean finish. With the Stunning Video—130° field of view it captures the entire front of my house to include the garage door, front door, front windows, side gate, and portion of my backyard. We have installed the Nest app on our cellular phones and any movement in the camera's field of view instantly notifies us when movement occurs. It notifies when the garage door opens/closes, when packages are delivered, and when friends arrive.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Dec 2016,Nando,Very clean and seamless interface coupled with good hardware development has led to this being a great product for the purpose defined. I have had it installed for nearly two weeks so perhaps an update will come after a few months. One thing I like is the ability to define the area in which you can monitor. Only downside is that you must pay for the upgraded experience which is expensive for what it is. 150 dollars for two outdoor cams comes with the ability to review 10 days of history. Out of the box with no cost is 3 hours and no defining the area. I think Google/Nest need to drop this price - especially since storage in the cloud is so inexpensive.

It is attractive, has sharp images, and it's helpful in monitoring who's at my front door.  However, neither the sound or motion options have worked.

There is also a delay even though the modem is only 10-15 feet from the front entrance where the camera is located.

Thankfully nothing shady has been captured but I know it will capture anything that takes place.  The speaker was a nice feature on this device that I thought worked really well.

We also have the monthly subscription and can see if there is snow/ice/storm damage, who is stopping by driveway etc. We were looking for a cost effective alternative to traditional security system and also easy installation, so we chose Nest outdoor cam. If you want to install it in a secondary building on your property like a shed, work shop or barn, remember that you need strong wi-fi signal near the building. We had to hire electrician to get an extra outlet to connect to the camera, because we didn't have one closer to where we wanted the camera to be installed.

My only issue was finding that one of the cameras had a slightly reduced field of view. I did not realize this until it was fully installed so I did not give the company the opportunity to provide me with a replacement (too much work to swap it out). The concern I had for these outdoor cameras, which I realized when I bought them, was that they are very easy to steal due to the magnetic holder!  I solved this problem by building metal cages around them. They can still be taken but the thief must work much harder.",Good Security Cameras

A few months ago I added the Nest outdoor cameras to my subscription.  I absolutely LOVE my DropCam/Nest cameras!  I also have a competitor home automation outdoor camera that integrates with my security system.  I greatly prefer the Nest constant stream and ability to save 7 days or a month of video vs. the little clips saved by my other home automation cameras.  I like being able to access both from my PC and from my iPhone and iPad.  When traveling I have a great view into what is going on at home.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Apr 2017,Anu,"I needed a camera outside my front door in the porch. I bought the nest outdoor camera first since it was weather proof. I didn't want to pay a monthly subscription. I was okay knowing my nest camera will give me only a 3 hour window of recordings. This is what was advertised. After I purchased and installed it, I cancelled the free 1 month trial of Nest Aware through their website (cannot do it from the app). At this point I realized I cannot record clips, least download them. It only gives you snapshots, which are just images. And you cannot even download them. What's the point of a security camera that you can't download the footage? So I returned it and bought the Arlo Q Plus. If Nest had the same features of Nest Aware but for 3 hours window with the free plan, I'd have kept it. The 30 day trial of Nest Aware coincides with their 30 day return policy. If I had not looked into what's available in the free plan, I'd be stuck with it. A little sneaky of the company IMO. That said, if you are okay paying $10 per month for Nest Aware, this is a great product. If you are not going to subscribe, look elsewhere.","Great product, bad subscription model."
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jan 2017,Allan Nicholson,Video quality is excellent but frame rate is low(15) which makes fast moving details blurry if playing an activity back. Notifications and device support is pretty good for capturing events. Should also mention that the audio is pretty good and you can hear peoples conversations 10ft away when outside. I am not convinced they don't have some wireless connectivity issues as I have 4 cameras and periodically each one will randomly drop off the network. Nest support is pretty unhelpful and wont supply the logs for the devices and say there is low wifi (which I don't believe at all as a network engineer.)

Two negatives: a)  the power cords are too long for my set up and there is no good way to either buy shorter cords or wind the cords up other than just wrapping them together and tying with velcro, not aesthetically pleasing or professional looking, b) the wifi connection drops too frequently, presumably because the camera is outside and the wifi is partially blocked by the exterior wall (which shouldn't be a surprise for an exterior camera).

The field of view and motion detection work really well. I like the instant notifications and the ability to quickly review what caused the trigger.

The app can sometimes be buggy and I need to completely shut down the app and re-open it. The website page seems to be better, however less convenient at times. Make sure you have a strong internet connect with a good upload speed. We had AT&T with about 2-3 Mbps Upload and the camera was frequently going offline, we have since switched to Charter Spectrum with 5-6 Mbps Upload and the camera has only gone offline once since the switch. The night vision does struggle a little bit, I live on a VERY dark street and my camera has a corner of my house in it's very near view which I think somewhat negatively impacts the night vision as my house shows up VERY bright and everything else is very dark. Installation was pretty easy, I have this mounted on the underside of my soffit on my garage, which is unfinished above the garage so I was able to easily go up in that attic space and run a regular extension cord through the attic and plug it right into the outlet that my garage door opener is plugged into on the ceiling.",Great camera if you don't want to fuss with batteries.

Garrett,"My orginal opinion of these security camers was really good:  easy installation, clear pictures, worked really good detecting people/movement, and the voice feature actually came in handy twice, although I thought it could have been a little louder.  However, that was during the “free trial” period.  Now, I realize that it has the potential to be worthless in actually catchng/stopping a thief.  Without the subscription, I have lost the video capability.  Instead, the “video” is a series of still pictures, taken every 5-6 seconds, which I am assuming is the way it was created to be and not something wrong with either of my cameras.  Turns out a lot can happen in 6 seconds.  Our truck can make it all the way out of the driveway in that amount of time (so I never actually see the vehicle), the postman can make it into the view, leave the package and be walkingout out of the view with the camera only picking up his legs/feet.  Again, this is a good camera, but just know that it might not be much use if you don’t plan on spending the money for the monthly (or annual) subscription, which is now a cost that I must now try to budget for.",Needs subscription to be dependable

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2017,Robert Triplett,"Great Camera, but tricky installation.  I'll let you read the other reviews regarding it's operation.  I have 2 other indoor cams and love them.  The magnetic mounts on this thing are genius and work beautifully. They make the camera infinitely adjustable.  I mounted mine in the soffit (the underside of an overhanging eave) near my front porch and garage.  I ran the cord through the soffit and into the attic above the garage.  I used an existing light socket to install a ""Outlet With Pull Chain Socket Adapter"" to plug it in.(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015SHT3W/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  The main problem was mounting this thing and not having to drill a massive (7/8"") hole in my soffit to fit the power adapter through... for only a 1/4"" wire (really bad design Nest and you can do better than this!  It appears they fixed this issue with the Outdoor Nest IQ camera... but that's another $100).  I searched on here and found out you can cut and then splice the two power wires back together (the ones in the center I just taped off because the camera doesn't use them).  Since the splice is inside, weather isn't an issue and it would be just fine.  I used car speaker wire splicers to re-connect the wires, taped it all with black electrical tape and it worked perfectly.  Keep in mind this method will void the warranty though. I just had to drill a 3/8"" hole in an inconspicuous spot to run the wire through.  I also didn't want to drill holes in my soffit for the mount.  My soffit is thin (1/8"") plastic and the Nest mount is magnetic.... so I grabbed a couple quarter size rare earth magnets.  I put them on the attic-side of the soffit and then ""snap!"" attached the mount on the underside of the soffit.  No screws required!  It worked perfectly!","Great camera, but tricky installation.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2018,Armando,"Installation of these cameras was a breeze. My network and internet connection is plenty fast enough to handle the cameras. If the support was any good for Nest Aware this could be a 4-5 star product. The main problem that I've had is that the Nest Aware trial was stuck on my account for one camera and would not expire. So I got stuck with one working camera and one that would only live stream. Just so happens that the second camera was the one that watches over my business products. Don't bother trying to call their support, after being placed on hold for over an hour several times before giving up, I went through the email support. Email support takes up to over a day for a response. You could tell by the grammar and syntax that English is not the support staff's first language. Which after being told that there was a problem with my account being stuck in trial mode, I wasn't offered a fix for the issue. After sending them another email they basically told me to unplug the cameras and put them back on. As the issue was obviously on their side with the account being stuck in trial mode I figured it's time to cut my losses. Well done Nest you got me for $290 dollars, now I'll be going to a camera system that works. Don't waste your money on this product. It could be excellent but it's pretty obvious that it's a cash grab with no intent on retaining customers.",Good cameras with terrible support.

MY BAD. I will normally always read the reviews and do research before buying anything! I will say this - the camera is good quality and was easy to setup. Picture looks good and night vision is good also. After I physically installed it and got it working I figured that I was all done, then I got to reading the email from signing up for the Nest account. You get given a 10 day TRIAL for your camera. If you want this camera to be of ANY use for security after that YOU HAVE TO PAY!! NOWHERE do they mention this in the camera description or listing that I saw!? Without paying the extortion money that Nest wants from you, this camera is virtually useless in a security application. Without the Nest subscription you get about 3 hours of footage for review, and that is it. So for example, you go to bed and someone breaks into your house, car etc. You wake up in the morning to find the damage/loss and want to go back to get the footage of the person who did this. Well, if it was more than 3 hours prior to you looking at the camera, guess what, you are out of luck! There is also the the ""zone"" feature. If you don't pay for the subscription you are also unable to designate a zone for movement recording. This useless also because if you have it looking at your driveway like we did, then every time a car drives by in the top of the picture, it registers an alert. I had heard of Nest prior to buying this camera, however I had not heard of having to pay for something you already paid for!! I use a different brand of camera for our indoor security that has on-board SD card storage that is accessible for months, AT NO EXTRA COST!! Long story short...

The build quality seems very durable and on par with the other Nest products - polished, durable, and in this case, weather resistant. The only thing missing that keeps this from being a 5* product is the lack of hard wired Ethernet option. You have to have a wireless router with a strong signal in the area of installation otherwise the fee won't upload to the Nest servers and you then wouldn't be able to access it.

The best features of this camera are that is small, unobtrusive and I can see what's going on at home from my cell phone. This camera has a great field of view and you can set it up to email you alerts when the camera spots activity. You can also limit alerts to a specified field of view.  The infra red feature is great, I was able to observe two bears that came to my front door in the middle of the night. I would highly recommend this camera.

I have tried several of the newer security cameras from Logitech, Arlo, and Bink. I was happiest with Nest's quality over the rest. The software is not only intuitive but they have a Android TV app so I can pull it up on my TV at any given time. The ability to enhance the picture to any area while still recording is also a great feature. Zone detection and 2 way audio is also a plus.

Using Iphone7s to control. The product is very good. Almost same as their promotion video. Easy to use and install. And the built quality is very good. And I believe most of people buy this because it detects movement and let notify you through your phone and other family member. Here is my experience with ""App Notification"". App is great. Easy to use. Not complicate. But, when the cam see some movement, like people or car approaching, this app sends a notification. But there is almost 1 minute delay to get the notification through my phone. When you watch their promotion video, delivery guy is approaching to front door, and nest cam send notification to user, and user uses the app and talk to the delivery guy using Nest cam speaker and microphone. Which is not happening in real world. when you received the notification, they are long gone. And this notification is so sensitive, it acts by sun shade moving, falling leaves, even mosquito flying.

I would say the only thing I don't like, is the cost associated with storing footage. So keep in mind, one or multiple, you'll have a fee every month. Pricing it out, you may want to look into a system with a DVR. As for this specific camera, it has a much different power cable. It does have extra leanth to run where necessary. Only problem I have with it, is it's replacing one I have outside in a 3rd party enclosure, and this power cable has a large connection in the middle that will not fit through my current conduit.

You get alerts on your phone when it spots a person, hears a sound or notices any motion activity.  It also takes snap shots of the activity that you can quickly pull up and watch.  Once the 30-day trial ends, you lose the person alert and snap shots.  We liked those two functions so much that we ended up buying the subscription service for $10 a month.  We love the cameras so much that we even bought a second one.  Great camera just disappointed that I am now paying a monthly fee for its full capabilities.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Nov 2016,John Schwartz,"Net Outdoor Camera is ok.  I have two of them.  They have a good picture and do work well with the subscription service, but I have yet to buy the service, still using the free 30 day trial.  One thing that I don't like is the cameras keep ""dropping off"" the WIFI connection at random. Unless your WiFi is within 50 feet of the camera, or dependent on the signal strength, that is the main negative I have with these cameras.  I had to install a WiFi extender to make one of my cameras stay connected.  The ""drop off"" or what the message says is ""Your camera is off-line or turned off"", which it is not true, is frustrating.  I had a power outage at my house for about an hour, and when the power went back on, the cameras never did turn themselves back on even though they are plugged in, couldn't figure that out.  I had to physically turn off by unplugging them and re-plug to turn them back on.  One more thing, if you use your own USB converter, you will need a 1500 (1.5 amph) milli-amp USB output connection to keep camera on, otherwise it will turn on with a 750 (.75maph) mAH, but once camera start to ""work"" it shuts itself off.

Requirements: Wink hub, or other automation system that can control lighting LED wirelessly controlled bulb Lamp Champ USB light socket. Optional for electrically experienced, a shunt bypassing the switch, leaving power to the fixture on permanently. Link and program bulb with Wink system. Remove old bulb, and install Lamp Champ Install Nest Cam Plug into Lamp Champ. Perfect!  I have yet to wind the cord up, and paint the exposed portion near the lamp, but things are functioning perfectly. The Wink controls the outdoor light.  Yes, the bulb and Lamp Champ add to the overall cost, but I was not a fan of drilling through stone walls, long outdoor cable runs, etc..  And it is far cheaper than hiring a contractor to install.

It's a good quality, but you're limited by your bandwidth from your internet provider.

With three cameras, you would be at 900 GB a month of data usage, out of the 1024 that you get from the ISP. Another problem I had is my router's ability to connect these cameras. The cameras WILL work on either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, but they won't work on a router that automatically chooses which band it'll use. I have a Nest Thermostat that has no issues with my TriBand router allocating bands, but these things just would not work. I ended up having to turn the SmartConnect feature off on my router and have to connect my devices to the three different bands accordingly.

The two-way audio makes it even safer to be able to communicate with someone at the front door of my home without having to open the door.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Aug 2017,Diani,"Excellent.  The only glitch is on the notification. The camera didn't catch a second incident  almost at the same time as the first..  I just have one example, so when I left the house it caught that and notified me but one minute later I had a delivery come thru which didn't notify me.  I only knew this because when I came home there was a package and I looked at the time it was delivered and it was about the same time I left. The other thingy is I did not install it outside and just thru a window.  It works great during the day with light but at night it will have a circular view because I don't have a porch light that's on all the time.  It reflects off the window and you can still view footage but there is the round circle around the view.",Excellent. The only glitch is on the notification

But really, the features are great. I love the alerts and being able to spy on my family as they come and go from the house.

The set-up was very annoying, using an outdoor outlet while having to deal with the two fixed-length cables.  Any solution that looked good left too much excess cable to deal with or included the charger hanging out in plain sight.  I finally had to remove two deck boards and hid the excess underneath.  The size of the charger and the plug make it impossible to run the cable through small gaps; you should be able to disconnect the charger from both cables.  I installed a lockable outlet cover to protect against an intruder simply unplugging the system, but the charger cannot be more than 10 feet from the camera, so it is still vulnerable and there's no way to secure the USB plug.  The video quality is great but I'm seeing some lag between motion and alert that I have to monitor; it may have been unique to the set-up process, so some real testing is in order.",Very Good But Not Great

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Oct 2016,KKams,"Pros: The picture is so much more clear than the Arlo, Ring, and Samsung outdoor security cameras we have tried. It is recording 24/7, so even if it doesn't catch the motion you can still go back and look. The app let's you scan through the day with ease in a few seconds, flagging where it catches motion. This makes it so easy to figure out what's been happening without spending a ton of time watching through recorded footage. No battery to charge or replace, which is a problem with the Arlo and Ring cameras. It looks beautiful on the white fascia! Cons: You do have to figure out how to plug it in. We had to drill holes to get the wire into our attic, and install an outlet up there. It's not hard, but it is an extra expense. There is a charge for the cloud recording service. $100 per year for the first camera, and $50 a year for any additional cameras, for 10 days storage time. This compared with the free service of Arlo, or $30 annual fee for 30 days of cloud storage for the Ring, makes it a bit more expensive. But in the end it's not a huge cost compared with ADT or another security monitoring service. Overall, great little camera!",Nice Camera!

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 May 2017,Five 28,"I decided to buy a security camera and initially purchased a cheaper camera on Amazon. Once I got it my adult son started telling me about the Chinese made no-name camera and how they have numerous security concerns. Apparently your live feed is streamed and anyone can view it if they know how to access the servers. I was also uncomfortable installing their software on my PC and phones. I decided to return it for a Nest Camera, which apparently is much more secure. The installation only took a couple hours, which included having to drill a 1"" hole in my soffit and then climb into the attic to pull the power cord in and secure it to the rafters with the included clips. I have a light switch in the attic but it didn't have an outlet, so I went to the hardware store and bought a 2 outlet light socket adapter for a few bucks, removed the bulb, screwed in the adapter, replaced the bulb and now I had two sockets available. Once I secured the power adapter for the Nest to the rafters I plugged it in and it worked as expected. When I ordered the camera I also decided to purchase the Wasserstein ""skin"" product in brown to better match my house. I'm glad I did because the white camera would have stood out like a sore thumb. Now, the brown color blends in and the camera is barely noticeable. One thing that I don't care for is the magnetic mounting system. Sure, the magnet is really strong and I don't think the camera will ever fall off, but from a security standpoint I'd much rather have the option of securing the camera in place with screws so that it can't simply be pulled off the magnet. Securing the power cord is supposed to prevent the camera from being stolen but it wouldn't be that hard to design a simple mounting system that doesn't rely on magnets. As far as image quality goes, it's pretty good but doesn't seem to be 1080 quality when set at 1080. I have it now set to ""auto"" to conserve some bandwidth. I've noticed there is about a 3 second delay in the camera feed when viewed from a phone or PC. The digital zoom feature is also pretty worthless, as the more you zoom in the more distorted the picture becomes. I've had my iPhone sitting on my desk with the Nest app on watching the live camera feed, and the iPhone gets pretty warm and the battery runs down pretty quickly, and after around 4 hours from a full charge I start getting ""low battery"" warnings. Nest advertises that they have ""person alerts"" which reduces the number of false motion alerts that you'll get. While it does alert when people are in the camera view, in my case I've noticed that birds landing on an outdoor light fixture would set off an alert. I also agree with others about the Nest subscription options. I don't need 30 days or even 10 days. If something happens I will know about it the next day, so anything beyond 1 or 2 days is not really needed unless you go on vacation or are away from home for extended times on a regular basis. Nest should offer a 24 hour subscription option for $20 a year or a couple bucks a month, with the ability to add extra days storage on demand for a few more dollars to cover vacations, etc. I think lot's of people hesitate purchasing a Nest camera due to the necessity to pay a monthly fee. Reducing this fee as much as possible would more than likely increase sales.",A good camera with a few issues

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Sep 2016,Philipp,"I've purchased 4 Nest Outdoor Cam's and installed two of them so far. They have been installed for two weeks. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Pro's: - The person recognition is incredible. It works so well. Even when it's just the back of someone walking. Outstanding feature. - The magnet mount is awesome. Let's you install the camera but still change the angle at any time. Really like it. The So So's: - the iPhone app is just ok. I find it hard to scrub recorded events. Somehow I always miss the exactact activity. Not horrible but not great either. The negative's: - constant notifications caused by shadows. No matter what I do tree shadows or moving plants will set off my notifications at least 10-20 times a day/per camera. Honestly shadows should be expected for an outdoor camera and the nest aware system should filter them out. I have stopped paying attention to my notifications and will probably turn them off very soon. So the system has effectively become useless for me from a preventive security point of view. If I could at the very least tell the app to only alert me when it recognizes a person.... but that's not possible. Either all activity, activity in a zone, or no activity. Strange. - the power cable. What a horrible mess. I actually planned my house won't security cameras in mind and now have this super long cable coiled up next to my camera because it can not be replaced with a shorter cable. Then there is that aweful power brick with yet another long cable. I get that they are trying to weather proof the system but this is a bad solution. I am using a spare iPhone adapter to forgoe their power brick. Still have to deal with the long cable, though. - nest aware pricing is just too high. I would need 4-5 cameras to monitor my outdoor area and that is going to cost a fortune. Without the subscription the cameras are pointless, though. I think nest needs to make this more affordable for multiple cameras. So for now I will keep the 2 cameras that I have installed and hope for updates that will deal with the notification mess. But I will return the two other cameras and hope a better solution will come along. I would not recommend the current iteration of the Nest Cam Outdoor.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 May 2017,Tom Backman,"Although called an outdoor camera, I use the camera indoors.  It has no battery, or battery backup, so it must be plugged in at all times.  The setup was easy and I was able to view through the camera by downloading the app on my phone as well as logging into Nest home on my computer.  The video is clear and the fish eye lens allows me see a wide area in my home.  There is a 3 to 5 second delay in what you think you are seeing live.  I believe for this reason the two way audio does not work very well.  It works like a walkie talkie where only one side can talk at a time.  So if you are trying to talk and the other side says something, you won't hear what was said.  That combined with the 3 - 5 second delay makes communicating very difficult.  The camera tends to randomly go offline periodically, which is also annoying. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with the camera is that it won't record anything unless you pay a monthly fee for a subscription.  Nest tries to hook you here, by forcing you to take a 30 day ""free trial"" to the subscription, so you have to wait 30 days to see how the camera will actually work when the subscription expires.  The subscription to ""Nest Aware"" that records and stores 30 days of video to the cloud, costs $10 dollars per month, per camera.  So buy a few cameras and in a few years you will be incurring costs into the thousands of dollars. This is really disturbing to me because other cameras offer stored recording to the cloud for free.  Nest is under the (Google) Alphabet umbrella, which is one of the largest cloud storage providers on the planet.  We all know it would cost them virtually nothing to allow some video storage to the cloud, but they have chosen to try to make some easy pure profits, by hooking users into a monthly subscription fee.  That really bothers me.  I will now only purchase cameras that offer free video recording storage.",Works - but much room for improvement

This ingenious magnet Mount allows easy extremely versatile aiming of the camera. In fact I would say this is the best security camera mount design anywhere as far as ease of positioning aiming Etc. In the cup magnet it's a really solid grip on the curved camera and leaves you pretty convinced that it's not going to move on its own. Another big positive for this system is the account setup which provides for email forwarding of alerts images Etc. It's very easy to do. The extra long cabling is to provide easy installation for people with outdoor power outlets that are not close to the mounting position. I really admire this company Nest, for  going off in a New Direction and being Innovative and creating a quality product. Really Everything You Touch speaks of quality materials and refined engineering. I did not try out the audio system the speaker and microphone but this is a nice thing to have for doorway entrances. Some Cons: In this day of  free cheap CLOUD memory everywhere, it is unreasonable that this company charges $100 a year for cloud storage. Unfortunately Nest only provides that one storage option and that's not reasonable for people like me who are sort of techies who like SD cards and FTP storage Etc. Also the camera enclosure does not meet any outdoor  weatherabilitie standards, Iso etc, all it says it can handle rain. And Nest  warns about image function in very cold and very warm weather situations. We get bitter cold sub freezing blowing snow sleet dust everything up here. Really hot humid Summers. So I ended up going to a different camera with a more weather proof housing, and that allows free cloud storage or onboard storage or your own FTP storage.",Great clever quality design but $100 cloud storage is unreasonable.

In practice they're on even less - a minute or so a few times a day to see what they're doing.  Current consumption was much less than the 1.5A spec.  They work perfectly.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Dec 2016,Heather,"This camera gives me so much peace of mind. It was relatively easy to install on the roof/wall corner of our porch and we have the power source plugged into our porch light, using a light socket adapter. The only down side to this approach is that our porch light must remain on at all times to supply power to the camera, but we were able to avoid drilling a hole through the outer wall to plug the camera in inside the house, or risk plugging it into a porch outlet where the power cord could be cut or unplugged by a motivated thief. The camera provides a very clear picture and the notifications when it detects motion, a person, or sound that are sent to our phones, gives us great peace of mind, with our first house. We supplemented the nest outdoor camera with an indoor one inside, as well, and feel much safer and protected with our ability to monitor things at hoe while we are away. The added bonus of being able to communicate with delivery professionals when they drop off a Christmas package (telling them the best place to put the product, etc.) or yell at our cat to get off the kitchen counters had proved invaluable. Setup through the Nest app for both cameras, and our Nest Thermostat as well, was a breeze and makes checking on everything at home so simple. I really feel good about this purchase and have recommended it to a few other friends who are buying a house nearby.

It is surprising how well it works in low light and being able to zoom in is a plus. Now for the bad. It seems Nest wants you to subscribe to their service after 30 days that allows you to not only remotely monitor the camera but allows you to view and save previously recorded data. I think it is pretty sad that they can't give a customer 24 or 48 hours of pre-recorded access with the purchase of their camera. I will look for that type of functionality in the next camera. I would have given a higher rating but having to subscribe to a service that limits the functionality is a show stopper for me.,I like the camera very well

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Mar 2017,CAD,"I've been on this DIY home video journey for about several years.  It started about 2 years ago with my purchase of Ring.  It's motion detection was lousy.  A UPS guy would deliver a package to my front door and Ring would start recording when he was 4/5ths down my driveway.  This journey actually seems much longer because this has been a very frustrating journey.  After Ring, I paused in my search for a better video system because I was waiting for Ring to get better.  But my recent search for a system started about 6 months ago when my neighbor across the street noticed that a guy was lurking in front of my house and approaching my front door and wandering around the side of my house into the backyard.  This was at 11:30pm and I was sound asleep in bed.  My neighbor called me (I didn't answer because I was asleep) and then called the police.  No break-in or damage but it spooked me enough to begin investigating a video system.  I wasn't interested in ADT or CPI or any of the large companies that were going to charge me $50/month to monitor my house 24/7.  I just wanted to know what was happening outside of my house when either I was asleep or not at home.  So I first started with Amcrest.  I bought an 8-camera system that needed to be wired for power and internet.  My electrician told me that the way my house was built, he could install cameras in the back of the house but not the front.  The cost for wiring a system in the back and a totally separate system in the front was $1600 (Just for the installation!).  I passed on that.  He said I needed to look into a WiFi system, which then led me to ARLO Pro, which has rechargeable batteries (cool) that last about a month or two (depending upon how often the motion detector goes off), and it was connected via WiFi.  I've used the ARLO system for about 3 months.  The thing that I like most about ARLO is that you can position these cameras anywhere since they don't require a power cord to plug in and they connect to WiFi, and it was a very user-friendly interface (which Amcrest was not.  Amcrest is really for IT guys and not for the lay DIY person who just wants the thing to work).  The thing that makes me crazy about the ARLO system is that the cameras only turn on when they detect motion and by the time they detect motion, the activity has almost left the visible screen.  There were also times when I would pull into the driveway, walk into my garage and a camera that is pointing AT the house would not turn on.  But if a leaf blew in front of the camera then it would turn on. There were a hundred false alarms per day as something tripped the motion sensor but when actual people (like a UPS driver) would walk up my driveway, put a package on the ground and walk away - the motion sensor would pick him up AT the door and as he was walking away.  ARLO picked up a LOT of false motion and failed to pick up or was slow on real motion.  That kind of stuff made me bat shit crazy.  I worked with ARLO's discussion board to try to fix the issues (Ghosting; Pixilation; and slow detection times) but the product is what it is at this stage.  So I went searching for a system that would give me 24/7 video, would have high-quality cameras (1080p), night vision, audio, microphone and look nice.  I had heard about Nest but I also didn't want to pay the monthly/ yearly subscription, but I looking into what the subscription meant (what features were available) and thought I'd give it a try.  The purchase comes with a free trial period, so I thought maybe the 3rd time is a charm.  And it IS!  I only ordered 1 camera because I wanted to test it out and my camera came this morning.  I followed the easy installation steps and got it installed and operational within an hour.  I have an outdoor outlet in the front of my house and I bracketed the wire down the trim of the house and then plugged it in.  (I'll get an alert if it is unplugged or the wire is cut).  At some point in time, I'll have an electrician come and drill a hole in the exterior so the wire is not exposed, but I'm really happy with the product as it is.  I've left the house several times and checked my phone to see what was happening while I was away.  The phone app is easy to use, the video is really 24/7, the installation was easy (I ran into zero issues getting up and running), and I now get alerts that are meaningful.  The Nest Aware actually has algorithms that know when a person is in the frame, rather than a bird flying by.  AND, I can scroll through the entire video of the day within minutes, AND download a video clip to my Photos on my phone.  I'm so happy with this purchase, I just purchased another one that will arrive tomorrow and I'll install that one as well in the back.  And, as I learned more about the subscription, I'm Ok with the cost.  It's 100/year for the first camera and then $50/year for each additional camera.  So for $150/year I can have both the front and back of my house monitored 24/7, and I have use of all the advanced features that come with Nest Aware.  I'll still use my ARLO inside (they do work quite well inside), but the Amcrest cameras will be donated to charity.","WAY better than Ring, Amcrest or ARLO"

Quality is good but wireless is a little weak.  Make sure it's close enough to your access point so that it can keep a connection without interference.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Oct 2016,Enduro_Dad,"Great camera & service, probably the best value for the quality of the Nest Aware service and seamless configuration. This is the 3rd brand ecosystem I've tried: D-Link, Yi-Home and now Nest. By far this is the best one. Likes: - Ease of setup. There is hardly anything to configure. - iOS app quality: A lot of care went into the UX, and the updates are frequent. - Push alerts are consistent and extraordinarily accurate compared to other cameras/services. - Simplicity - Although you sacrifice some features, getting this configured properly was very simple. - Nest-aware quality and performance. I have the $10/mo plan and I'm happy with the performance and quality of the web app. - 24x7 recording. - Water resistance, nice sealed sturdy housing with good accommodation of IR heat dispersion. Dislikes: - I wish it had a micro SD card option for local recording if the Internet connection goes down. - Magnetic mount is convenient for positioning, but for an outdoor cam it should have additional security mounting. The only way to secure from theft is via clips on the permanently attached flat cable. Hopefully a 3rd party solution will turn up. - Night vision is unusually pixalated when there is motion. I'm not sure if this is a limitation of IR recording in general, or if it's an issue with the camera. For example: I can pick up license plates easily during daylight, but at night, even with enough IR light, it's overly pixelated. This is with 1080 enabled, very close proximity to 5ghz 120mbps wifi. Overall I'm very happy with the camera and service. It's a whole package solution, I wouldn't get one without the other. It's expensive if you need multiple cameras, and you have to consider monthly cost. Compared to D-link: Nest is better all around. I do miss the advanced configuration of the D-Link cameras however, like FTP support, and most D-link cameras support Micro-SD local recording. Plus no monthly fees. However, the D-link iOS app is poorly designed and supported, and web access is bizarrely complicated. You kinda get what you pay for. Compared to Yi-Home: I'm really impressed with the Yi-Home 720p cameras, especially considering how cheap they are. The hardware is almost as good as Nest and there are no monthly fees. However there is no streaming service provided, you need to access your SD card to view older recordings and there is no desktop web viewing option (everything is via the mobile app). You really need a fast broadband connection for it to be useful. Plus the night vision & audio quality isn't as good and the push alerts aren't as consistent. If you need to depend on a camera / service, the Nest is worth the extra expense.",Very impressive! Missing just a couple features.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Nov 2016,QC and Wolverine,"We recently installed the Nest Outdoor Camera, and really like the ability to see what is going on in front of our house as we have been concerned that some packages may have been stolen while we were away.  Nothing caught yet, but realized there are some things we were not prepared for with this: Installation:  We have a Brick exterior, so in order to anchor the cord, needed to Hammer Drill and drill bits that can handle that kind of impact(FYI - you will need a 1/4 drill bit to get the anchors into the brick.  The 1/8 drill that Nest tells you to use is only if going into wood that does not require the anchors), and it helps to have a second body directing you with the camera to determine the optimal angle.  Because my camera is only 8 feet or some from the power outlet, it left us with a lot of cord to figure out what to do with it.  It's great to have up to 25 feet to work with, but need to have a plan for the excess. Nest App:  Love the ease, especially since we also have the thermostats.  We get a lot of false alerts due to headlights at night, rustle of trees etc.which can be very annoying especially in the beginning  We now primarily take notice of the alerts that say they have recognized a person.  The speaker seems to be hit or miss,  On the phone app, is in an awkward place if you also want to lean in to speak.  On the other hand, it picks up sound well.  The zones are especially helpful as it lets me know where it is picking up activity, and let's me turn off notifications in certain areas that have helped reduce the false alerts. Note: as soon as you connect it to your account, the 30 day trial to Nest Aware starts, so make sure you don't start connecting it until you are ready to install.  We discovered the need for additional tools after first test, so we lost about 2 weeks of trial period. Overall picture is good, sound pick up is good, and easy to use.  Would recommend this product, just be prepared for the installation challenges.",and really like the ability to see what is going on in ...

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Sep 2017,William Barrett,"These almost work really well - but they end up being frustrating as can be! The worst problem is that none of the history/recorded access methods has decent review mechanisms, and the motion detection is hit and miss, so one can totally miss an important event. One can also go mad trying to pinpoint an event one knows exists. On my other screen I now have the camera playback looping after I clicked a recent time - it's doing nothing. This is pretty typical. The resolution of history search is really odd on the PC as well as the Android apps. One has a slider that jerks and jumps.  There is no fast forward or backwards. There are fat dots for motion detected - but, like i said above - it detects maybe 50% of the motion events. Combine this with the pathetic scanning capabilities and you miss things unless you are extremely lucky or can afford to have someone sit through the full feed. That said - the quality is really good. The mounting is interesting.  Magnetic - so mount it high and hope a rock isn't thrown. I don't know how much wind it will handle. You need to route the cord carefully, as it is so rigid the magnet can't overcome its bend. The bargain (10-day history) service is $10/mo + $5/extra camera. I don't know how much it costs to hire someone to sit and watch the history to tell you what happened?  You can try the app and you might get lucky.  Well - maybe the Apple app is better?  the Nest does have that annoying ""we know what you want"" feeling to it. I've struggled with this thing, and the Indoor version, for 3 months now. and I still wonder why in the world I bought this thing. I'm better off with a warning sign on the lawn.","Good camera, underwhelming history viewing."

Ryan,"I've had this camera for about 4 months. No issues until recently. I signed up and paid for the Nest Aware program, which sends you notifications. Over the past 2 days, the Nest Aware system has been failing to send notifications. I already spoke to a customer service representative. One issue is hardwired into their program, in that once a notification is sent, it won't push a notification for 30 minutes. That happened at 130am when miscellaneous activity triggered a notification, then 10 minutes later it missed sending a notification after spotting someone. The second issue, was it blankly missed sending me a notification, no 30 minute buffer involved this time. I logged on to the camera, and it records these as events, which is successfully did. The fault lies in their Nest Aware system. Unfortunately, I already paid my annual membership in advance, so I'm out 2 cameras and a shoddy subscription service.",Not Reliable for Protection

The image, whether daylight or nightvision, is stellar.

If you read before you purchase you'll know what you're getting. What you're getting is a high quality, simple setup, easily accessible camera. The app is fantastic and easy to use. If you can get your power inside it is difficult to steal without being viewed on camera (depending on location of setup). I haven't used the playback on a PC yet but would guess it's as simplistic as the app. I'm already wanting another camera and highly recommend this camera for the family wanting surveillance on their home/property. The stream is great live and playback is seamless. I've received a few 'person alerts' already (from myself setting up and the family returning from a walk). After playing around with setting I synced my phone so Nest knows when I'm home. Well done Nest. It's everything I wanted without dealing with running many wires, messing with batteries and/or a hard drive/card, all while viewing away from home.  I spent a lot of time reading other products before I purchased and glad I did. I don't feel you'll be disappointed.",Great camera

It was incredibly easy to set up and install, and it works like a charm. I like the fact that it is a wired cam that you can plug into an outlet. While the tradeoff is that you have to find an elegant way to route that wire so it looks unobtrusive, in my opinion that's way better than having to replace batteries endlessly on something mounted high outside your house.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,02 Dec 2016,ImConfused,"I had a Uniden four camera system for the last three years.  I had no idea my system was such garbage until I got a couple of these.  No comparison to any other camera I've used including linksys.  They are more expensive because they worked flawlessly, the user interface is intuitive and offers more features than most other systems.  The only downside I see is their optional monthly annual service is a little too costly for me to buy with multiple cameras for the extra features.  Would still recommend Nest however.  Also I say this having previously owned a nest thermometer which was a complete nightmare.  My wife and I were on vacation from our home in Phoenix and received a call from our friend who is caring for our dog and the AC had magically switched to heat when it was over 100 degrees outside. It melted candles, food etc and our poor dog had some mild heat exhaustion but she did recover fortunately.  Threw the nest thermostat away the minute I got home, a few hundreds buck down the drain along with the hvac bill to perform a system check and install the new thermostat . Still giving credit to Nest for the cameras though.",I had no idea my system was such garbage until I got a couple of these

The basic storage pkg. is $10.00/month or $100.00 / year for 10 days of video storage in the cloud.  Or....  $30.00/month  or $300.00 per year for 30 days of video storage.  Other then that you will have to settle for ""snapshots"" of any intruder the camera catches. (It caught my wife - see snapshot). Those are sent to your Email.  You still get to watch ""live stream"" of your camera though.  The camera is fairly easy to set up (considering you have the tools and the know how to do it.)  Usually requires a ladder, drill/large bit, small bit, screw driver, etc. Fairly easy to install though.  Once up it is fairly easy to connect to your WIFI system.  Works pretty good too.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,13 Oct 2016,Zzyzx Oh,"I bought the indoor unit first to check out the video quality, and it was very good unless you zoomed way in on something, at which time even the 1080p image was grainy. So, at that point I ordered the outdoor version in hopes I could place it on my porch ceiling and hide the wires in the ceiling. But, there is an issue with that. Electrical codes in USA usually prohibit the AC-DC end of the wiring from being hidden, so the videos show them being fastened to an exterior wall. There is no warning about electrical codes, so some clever DIYer will ""do better"" and create a potentially dangerous situation by hiding the cord.  The alternative is to get a long USB extension, but there is no guidance about how long the 5v USB cord can be before voltage drop becomes an issue with camera or Wi-Fi performance. So, I have changed my plans and will use this in my garage, and go for a power-over-Ethernet camera for my porch. But, it was worth a try. I do think NEST could be more accountable in educating buyers and potential buyers on the codes they need to follow for their own safety.",Do-It-Youself isn't always Do-It-Wisely; Be Aware
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2016,D. James,"Really wanted to love this cam. Long time user of the Dropcam Pro and have enjoyed it a ton. We decided it was time for another camera and wanted an outdoor view so the Nest Cam Outdoor Cam was a natural fit.  First the good.  Its nicely designed, comes with a decent amount of cable and has a unique mounting kit that offers flexible placement of the camera. You are instructed to set the camera up inside before taking it out to determine its final mounting place. I did so using my phone and that all went very smoothly.  Then you're instructed to take the cam outside which is where things went south for me.  I took the cam outside, toward the front of my garage where I wanted to place the cam.  As soon as I got there I lost signal. Of course, wifi can be spotty so you might wonder if that's my problem or the Nest Cam Outdoor problem. I took my phone and tablet out to the same spot and was able to get a decent but less than full strength signal.  So I thought maybe the Nest Cam was a bit weaker and would need a better signal to work.  I bridged another wifi router in the room that the garage is attached to and still couldn't get a steady signal. Then I thought ""well, I guess this cam won't get to see the front yard but will just monitor the inside of the garage"" so I moved it several feet back inside the garage where I have full strength wifi on my phone/tablet.  Even in that spot I was getting spotty performance from the cam.  My last effort in troubleshooting was to take my Dropcam Pro out to the same spot to see if it would exhibit the same issue.  It performed flawlessly.  Very responsive, smooth video with hardly any delay.  That was enough for me to decide to return the Nest Cam Outdoor cam.  It did run decently when I was inside the house near the wifi/router but its too big with an unruly cable for indoor use.  So, I'm a bit bummed that I bought this on Black Friday instead of the standard Nest Cam for 70 bucks off as I am guessing the standard Nest Cam would perform as well as my Dropcam Pro.  Planning on trying to find a decent used Dropcam Pro or Nest Cam to try to get back down to a Black Friday level price and I'll hold off on trying to get outside coverage for now.",Wanted to Love it...Had to Return it.

The quality is the same as the Nest Cam indoor camera. This first generation product answers the demand from Nest owners for an outdoor camera. The power adapter and the excessive length of cable needs to be rethought. The camera's USB cable is about 10 feet long. The power adapter adds another 15 feet of cable for a total of about 25 feet of cable. My cameras are mounted about 10 feet from electrical receptacles, so I end up with 15 feet of excess cable, which looks horrible against my house. Because of the excess length of cable, I purchased USB electrical receptacles, so I wouldn't have to use the included power adapter. All of my outdoor electrical outlets are on a GFCI circuit, so the outdoor receptacles do not need to be GFCI receptacles. With the Nest Outdoor Cameras attached directed to the USB electrical receptacles, there's no excess cable and the appearance is much improved.",Finally Nest gives us an outdoor camera!

I've already abandoned one and given up after just 6 months. I bought them when it was produced by DropCam. Then I get an email about a new, improved, outdoor model so I got my hopes up and decided to order 2 of these so I could keep track of my Christmas lights. At first they worked acceptably, but with frequent outages. Now, neither of the two outdoor cameras will function. I decided to rehook them up to my computer to go through the setup process again.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Sep 2017,Amber Morales,"I waited a long time to review these. Along the way, I have also field tested Yi, Blink, Ring stick up and a few others. I use these as security cams (and wildlife) at a vacation home. Having said that, these cameras are great...They really stand up to the elements. I've used them in 10° weather with no problems. The picture is top notch. As far as I can tell though, there is one huge flaw...The mount. The mount is magnetic. It's strong, but three times now I've had the cameras knocked off their axis by birds...yes birds. Once they are moved, the only way to move them back is physically...meaning they are almost useless as security cameras for remote or seldom used locations, or places you don't have anyone nesrby to immediately fix them.  I worried when I purchased them (I purchased 6) that this would be a problem and talked to a rep who""assured"" me it would not be an issue....I'm here to tell you in no uncertain terms, it's an issue and a huge one for me, and people like me who depend on these cameras for security. NEST...Please come up with a better mount than this? This can't be the best you can do? It's a security camera...It should at least be secure. If a small bird can knock it off, so can a rock, stick or a person. Aside from this one flaw, which I consider pretty big, they are great.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Mar 2017,Michael A Morganford,"Although the nest cams are pretty expensive, so far I think we are getting our money's worth. The nest cams are very well made, easy to set up as possible, and most importantly, they WORK unlike a lot of other wireless cams. I've had some dropcams (nest original company) running for like three years I think non stop, with basically no problems. So I hope these outdoor cams have the same longevity. The subscription service adds the capability to set zones and better monitoring, but personally i would like it to be $10 for like 2 cameras or 3 cameras. Currently it's at 10$ for the first camera monitoring/recording and $5 for EACH additional cam per month. And I think that's the CHEAPER per month rate where you only can go back 10 days. So overall a great product, we're able to EASILY access from our phones, and even share the live cam views with family with a simple link and password. Just wish the cameras themselves were cheaper, and the monitoring cheaper. Video quality, night vision, reliabilty, all that is there and more than adequate for your home security system. I actually mentioned that at the end because those parts are boringly good with the nest cam. Much much better than some other wireless cams I tried that basically were a waste of money due to horrible software, impossible to set up phone/pc access, bad image quality, control panel would never even properly connect to the camera, etc etc.","Although the nest cams are pretty expensive, so far I think we are getting ..."

The company should include longer and shorter cord options in the purchase package. There should be battery backup and removable storage backup in case of power outages too. Also, you should be able to configure the app to send you alerts when it detects a person, not for every movement. I get a lot (I mean a lot) of alerts because of passing cars. It's better than Arlo though. I pretty much never got an alert for that system so I got rid of it quickly. Beyond all this, the setup was easy, installation was a breeze, the app is very intuitive and support promptly responded to my question.",Worth the buy but it has bugs...

I got this camera because I trap-neuter/spay-release stray cats in my neighborhood, and I thought this would be a perfect way to know when they are showing up. That was a huge mistake, and I know it is not operator error since I occasionally get notifications that a cat is at my feeding station or approaching from the backyard, but more often than not I can be actually watching a cat approach and I never get a notification. It didn't even tell me about the raccoon raiding my bird feeder last night but I can view it on the timeline! I've tried various tweaks, set up four completely separate zones, set notifications for motion inside zones, added motions outside zones, canceled person notifications - nothing has helped. Since it occasionally does what I expect, it is worse than useless because I cannot rely on it and find that I still need to frequently check for cats.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Sep 2016,jbsibley,"This is a great camera with two really annoying quirks for me. It's super simple to set up. The image quality is great. The microphone is very sensitive, I was surprised how much I could hear. The DVR is top-notch and the software simple and powerful. However. The camera ships with an unbelievable amount of wire attached to it. That's fantastic if you're 50 feet from the outlet, but if you want to mount the camera 6 feet from the outlet like I was you're going to have a giant, ugly coil to deal with and there's no way to shorten it - it's a data cable with a custom waterproof USB on it. I REALLY wanted the ability to share the stream with my tenants. Great, no problem. They can't control anything or use the DVR, which is fine with me. BUT, to use the link to watch the camera, they MUST be using flash player, which iPhones and iPads don't support. Nest won't tell you this, it just gives a ""camera not available"" error, which is a huge waste of time. Other than those two serious annoyances it's a good camera, and still probably the best on the market for most people.","Great camera, minor annoyances."

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2017,Arnold Carson,"My overall experience is meh.  I like Nest thermostats -- have purchased many iterations and would do so again.  But the camera isn't as exciting.  My first CAM was dead on arrival.  Amazon immediately sent out a replacement, and the replacement is installed and working.  The actual camera seems to be well built (experience with the first one notwithstanding).  Day-time viewing is all you would expect, although to be clear, the camera presents a wide-angled view, but the application does allow for digital zoom.  Night vision works well, but is limited to what can be illuminated by the infrared lamp on the camera.  The microphone also seems to work well enough.  As for speaker ... I've tried talking to my dogs (my primary reason for having the camera), and they hear *something*, but I've otherwise been unable to validate the quality of sound.  The installation has the potential to be simple and easy -- but you do need an outlet relatively close to where you want to mount the camera.  If it's optimal to mount the camera upside down, you can configure the camera to invert the image 180 degrees.  My first choice of mounting location was too far from an outlet without additional extension cords.  My second choice had some sheet metal flashing nearby, and the magnetic mount clamped to the flashing without the need for any additional screws.  My chief complaint mirrors that of other reviews -- many of the analytic features (""Nest Cam detected a person in the area"") require a subscription to Nest services.  Full functionality is not a one-time purchase, but simply an initial investment in an annual subscription.  I will probably not invest in any additional cameras from Nest.",It's okay

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Dec 2016,Shortstack,"I was very hesitant to buy this camera because it's a Nest product.  I always hated the Nest thermostat because it's a useless piece of fashion tech and does nothing that your $20 programmable thermostat can't do.  It's basically a Fitbit.  However, after doing the research and observing a friend's Nest cam, I got over my reservations.  Don't get me wrong: this is a piece of fashion tech, complete with ridiculous packaging and little cardboard drawers to hold screws.  But there has clearly been a ton of thought and testing that has gone into it, and that just makes it work better than other products with less flash appeal. I chose this camera because it has continuous 24/7 recording, which means when you get a notification, you don't just see the back of the UPS guy's head.  That's the biggest feature in my mind, and most (or all) other consumer wifi cameras don't do that.  It also has excellent video quality, and the person alerts and activity zones are a huge convenience.  Both the web and mobile apps are very user-friendly, packed with features, and make a lot of sense.  I get notifications on my phone and email, which I have set up to go off only when no one's home, which is great because my wife is often home and I don't need to be notified when she picks up the mail from the front step. Now for the criticisms:  I really wish this was battery-powered, with maybe a cord to keep the battery charged.  I really wanted to chose the Ring stick-up cam over the Nest because it's battery powered and has a solar panel to keep it charged.  However, since the Nest records 24/7 and the Ring doesn't, I assume it needs more power.  But it would be so great if they could do it with a solar panel instead.  Installing the cord is easy, and I had JUST enough length with the 25' cord to get the camera where I need it from my exterior outlet box.  There is no way I would drill a 1"" hole in my house.  As an architect, I strongly discourage that, and they shouldn't even suggest it.  I really wish I didn't have to screw all of the cord clips into the siding of my house, but I was able to hide them pretty well. I also think it's silly the way the cord comes out of the camera as hard-wired and stiff.  It limits how you position the camera head since the cord will ""pull"" the camera toward where it's clipped to the house.  If you pull it tight, you don't have enough cord to position the camera, and if you have too much, it will push the camera away.  It's a very fine-tuned process.  I don't know why they didn't make the cord connect to the camera with a gasketed plug connection instead. The wifi antenna strength is not great, although I don't know enough to compare to other outdoor cam products.  I made sure it was in line-of-sight to my router through a window, and it still disconnects a few times a day.  It seems to reconnect seamlessly and doesn't have much downtime though.  I even returned my existing router and got the latest model from Verizon and although it improved, it still loses connection occasionally.  It will not connect to the 5g wifi at all (out of range).  The router is about 20' inside the house (and of course I will not move it; that's ludicrous). The email notifications are great, because they say ""your camera spotted someone"", ""your camera thinks it spotted someone"" or ""your camera noticed some activity"", and there is a thumbnail image in the email, which means you don't have to open the app every time.  Most of the time it sees a person, it's a UPS guy or the mailman, and most of the time it's activity, a squirrel ran across my steps.  Note that the person alerts are only available if you buy the $100 per year subscription, which seems totally worthwhile for me.  It would be GREAT if Nest could figure out how to put the thumbnail image into the phone notification, so I wouldn't have to open my email OR the app, both of which take time to load up.  And concerning the Nest Aware subscription, I don't think it's right that they charge you more for more cameras.  It seems to me that $100 should cover multiple cameras, but they charge $50 additional for each one. Finally, for the apps, it should be easier to click on events.  The interface is really cool, but it makes no reference to the events that it just emailed me about.  There should be a list of events, sort-able by person or activity in each zone, that I can click on and have it go to that spot in the recording timeline.  Overall not a huge deal, but it's a little frustrating when you know from the email that the Lasership guy threw your box from 20' away, but you can't find the footage without scrolling through the recording for 10 minutes. In conclusion, following from this I bought an indoor Nest cam and look forward to using that.  I have two Vimtag cameras inside my house now, and the 24/7 recording along with video quality push Nest head-and-shoulders above those ones, even without Nest Aware.  The Vimtag ones have on-board storage and make it easier to click on events, but that's not good enough to beat Nest.","Far superior to comparable products, great interface, but could be improved"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Dec 2016,Thomas R Patchen,"Small, elegant cameras which are easy to install... delivering clear video with a lot of great features. I was wary of getting wireless cameras because I did not want to have to bother with changing batteries all the time so these cameras were exactly what I was looking for. They plug in and send the video via wifi to the Nest website. I do not have a smart phone and use a PC to view the video. The video and sound are very clear and you can even talk to people through the cameras if your pc has a microphone.... though the 5 second time delay makes it a little awkward. It's very easy to go back and review a full day because the screen puts symbols where there has been activity. It's also easy to set activity zones and make video clips. Yes, you have to pay $12.50 per month ($150 divided by 12) for two cameras for 10 running days of video storage with Nest... but I think it's worth it... though a 5 day option for a little less money would be even better... hint, hint.","Small, Elegant and Powerful"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 May 2017,J Bailey,"This is my first review for any product that I have ever purchased. So I decided to write one for this product. As a LE officer in one of the top 5 Most Violent cities in the US I  have purchased and seen many cams in my work. Nest by far has one of the best on the market. Yes, being able to hard wire a cam is better, but when it's not practical as in my case, the Nest cams are the best. It's not a sales pitch...just a fact. I have been able to use two Nest cams for the coverage area where it took four cams from other manufacturers. The night vision is excellent and does a fantastic job. I was like most people when it came to using the Cloud for storage. Didn't want to pay that extra money. But unfortunately criminals adapt to technology as well. A new trend has started where they will take the security DVR or recording device with your other belongs. No recording device...no video. Haven't seen a Cloud stolen yet. Lol. Possible hacking? That's why you make sure your password is secure. I commend Nest for their work on staying out in front of the criminal mind. As for what should you chose?...the choice is yours...I have already made mine. Also I have the Nest cams on the inside and outside. They all work better than advertised. If you have Wifi issues just use an extender as I did. Works perfectly. Now while at work watching over others I have equipment watching over mine. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Hope it helps.",Nest by far has one of the best on the market

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Nov 2016,Mr. Middle,"Worst waste of money I've spent. * No zones: if you aim it to capture outdoor activity, say the front entryway and it can see sidewalk and some of the street, be prepared for 25 emails a day when the wind blows a tree, a car drives by and anyone walks on the sidewalk.  TERRIBLE * Constant nagging for monthly subscription.  TERRIBLE * Horrible to setup outdoors if power is indoors - needs a 2 inch whole because of the poor design.  TERRIBLE In short, after reading that Amazon tried to sell off Nest but failed to do so, this sub-company makes one of the worst products highlighted by Amazon for sales.  I will be uninstalling this POS for a different make/model that has zones and lets the police tap in so I don't have to pay a fee for image storage.",Good camera but all else is horrible.

After that, I installed the camera on the back of my house overlooking my garage and parking pad.  The kit contains everything you need although I also used zip-ties in a few places.  The field of view is very wide and it provides sharp resolution.  I installed the Nest app on my iPhone 6 and my Android tablet and they both work perfectly.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2017,REVIEWER71,"Like a lot of reviewers, I love the camera but the subscription is a complete rip off from my perspective. Pros: 24 hour recording and you get a 30 day free trail of the Nest Aware (the subscription). Can the difference between a person and a car. Alerts are sent to you device (phone, tablet, etc). Allows you to talk with the person via Bluetooth. Quality appears to be very good; however I would recommend getting the silicon skin. Cons: The subscription cost too much without a lot of options. It picks up cars driving in the street and sends you alerts for no good reason. Camera power is 100% wired and you'll have to find a power source in or outside of your home.  Running the line isn't like running a cable--there is a 7/16 size hole you have to drill through (if you are not leaving everything outside).  Wi-Fi does and Bluetooth does the rest.","Great, but too expensive with a subscription."

Mitchell,"If wireless with quality video and reasonable sound is what you want, this is the best.  I tried Ring Cam and Netgear Arlo.  Both were suggested as a good choices.  Not for me.  Ring video quality was not good enough and neither had sound quality good enough for anyone to hear you talk to them.  I did not like the recharge battery deal with the Arlo. So if my concerns I listed are yours, this is the one you should buy.  I have two.  Many complain of the subscription rates but the 10 day deal may be improved on.  I am going to test a camera monitoring software Blue Iris for a $60 one time fee that will cut the cord with Nest.  That may or may not be an option for all to cut the subscription cost down stream. UPDATE:  Over the time I have used the cameras, I now have four, I have one major complaint the lack of timely notifications from the nest aware subscription service.  Example I just received an email alert of activity that occured 2 hours ago.  Not good service.  I get the impression that Nest is not keeping up with their end of the service that we pay a lot for.  For this I have reduced to 4 stars.  I never tested the Blue Iris yet but may need to.  Anyone have a work around to improve security notices?",Best of the wireless gang for now. updated 1/20/2020

It was either this Nest Cam of the Arlo Pro 2. Well i decided to go with the Nest Cam after reading all the reviews on here and other security and camera sites about the Arlo Pro 2 having ALOT of battery issues. I am not disappointed that I went with the Nest Cam at all!!! Pro: Great Picture Quality Looks Great The Alerts it sends you are very helpful (must have Nest Aware monthly subscription) Price is very competitive with other cams on the market No having to worry about batteries No need to have a hub or anything it just runs off your WiFi The Nest App is Great and works wonderfully Cons: Has to be plugged into a power source so its not 100% wireless like the Arlo 2 to watch vids more than 3 hrs in the past and to access most of the great features you have to subscribe to their monthly service, but i honestly think that isnt a big deal because it is very reasonably priced.

The biggest problem is that nest charges you to keep history in the web and you cannot upload it to your own storage device.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Oct 2016,DTB,"Installation very easy. Download the app, open an account and scan the bar code on the camera and you are ready to go. Mounting was also quite simple. I just put the magnetic mount on a down pipe. Didn't need to screw it in as the magnet was strong enough to hold it there alone. It comes with a comprehensive mounting kit which seems simple enough. The video feed quality is quite good. There is a noticeable lag of about 1 to 3 seconds. I have cable 100/40 internet and a N wireless router only 5 meters from the camera so I don't think it is a result of my internet. This is not a problem for my use. The push to talk works fine. The speaker in the camera is certainly not loud though as long as you are standing within a meter or two of the camera it is acceptable. However the person talking into the camera really needs to speak loudly/shout to be heard. The motion alerts are not particularly useful on the free plan. It picks up many false positives. The washing on the line is enough to make it send an alert. I understand that under the paid subscription this is addressed by being able to send alerts only when it detects a person. A particular gripe is that you can’t set alerts on a device by device basis. They are either on or off for all devices linked to your account. For instance, I have installed the app on my iphone, Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire. All three go off when movement is detected. I would rather just to be able to select alerts for the iphone only. I have somewhat got around this by sending alerts via email only rather than via app based alerts. This becomes a particular annoyance when I linked my wife's account to the camera. She is not interested in receiving activity alerts but it isn't possible to just have me receive the alerts. If I shut off her alerts then it also shuts off mine. To get around this I have flagged the Nest alert emails as spam on my wife's account and now they just go into her spam folder which solved the problem. Overall impression is that this is a nice bit of kit. No real complaints so far. We purchased the camera to keep an eye on the pool so that my wife could duck inside for a minute or two but still watch the kids swimming on her phone while she did so. For this it is perfect. However I would question the utility of this camera as a security device at the front door unless you went with the paid subscription to limit alerts to “people” and zones only. Otherwise I think you would soon turn off all alerts. I have no regrets having purchased it so far.",Great camera but you need a subscription to really get the most out of it

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Oct 2016,Chuck,"Very high quality build.  Even the parts supplied for the install (screws, etc.) are the best.  You just can't strip the heads on these screws.  I wish  all screws were this good.  There are some nice updates to this camera since my other Nest Cam (indoor) purchases.  The quality mode now offers 480, 720, 1080, or ""auto"". Installation was easy though I just built a house and made sure to put electrical outlets high at the four corners and high near the doors.  If you don't have an accessible (though not too accessible) electrical outlet, you may have some work to do. There are two power cables; each about 12 feet long.  The first has a standard electrical outlet plug (two prong) and ends in a power adaptor for a USB plug.  The second cord is is the USB that plugs into this adaptor and is hardwired to the camera. To install, you tie up the cord (screws and holders provided), and install plates for the adaptor and the camera.  The camera attaches with a strong magnet and is adjustable at any time.  So, you can install the camera about 25 feet from an electrical outlet.  The camera and cables are white.  The instructions say that you can paint the cables, and they do seem to have a paintable ""feel"" to them.  All of the connections seem to be watertight. Unknown to me is whether you can skip one of these cords if you don't need the 25 feet.  Not sure if you can plug the USB camera directly into an apple adaptor and plug that in.  My next install will only need about 5 feet and so I may end up looping 20 feet of cable unless I can find out the power requirements. The only reason for not assigning five stars is the monthly fee ($10/mo for the first camera and $5/mo for every camera thereafter).  There are good reasons for a cloud recording service but, for this monthly fee, they could give away the cameras.  Nest has made some charitable changes to their software.  If you don't pay for the monthly fee (it is only an option), the camera can still be sent to email you a still photo of any activity.  Nest has done an amazing job of preventing you from recording from the video feed.  I've tried a few creative ways and can not make it work.  I also don't like seeing a Nest ad for the monthly service taking up space on the feed.  Since this is Google, I presume that those who don't pay a monthly fee will someday see ads for potato chips and soft drinks on their security feeds. The minimum and maximum operating temperatures are exceeded every year where I live, so we will have to see how it survives -30 and 110 degree temps.  The included materials only advise that picture quality may be affected.",Very high quality.  Everything you need is included (assuming you have the needed electrical connections).

Brown,"Amazing product and we've already chased off 2 people trespassing at our vacation rental property. If you want ""easy"" and ""it just works"" then I recommend this camera! We have a Nest thermostat and indoor camera at our own house and we just bought a vacation rental property. We installed 2 Nest thermostats and soon after we added this outdoor camera. WOW! Within 1 week we caught a suspicious couple trying to enter our home, we got an alert and my wife (From TX) asked them what they were doing. They got nervous and said they were at the wrong house and left. But when they left they didn't try to go to any other home. And then last week we caught 3 young men from the rental house next door come to our house and try to use the hot tub (ours was empty at the time). Again, my wife got an alert on her phone and then from her phone asked them what they were doing. They got spooked and ran away. Well worth the money, a MUST have for vacation rentals or for general security.",A must have camera for peace of mind and security

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Jan 2017,Rick B.,"Great camera, works well in rain and sun.  Wifi signal is strong through multiple walls outside.  You get what you pay for.  I use the Logitech cameras at my parents house, Nest at my house, and the Netgear Arlo at my parents house.  Nest the is the best in terms of quality and stability.  Doesn't go offline, and keeps a consistent, high quality connection.  The Logitech Logi cameras would be ranked second.  Quality isn't as high, but they have a daily review function that shows what happened during the day in a time lapse mode which is actually really useful.  Other than that, the Nest software is better.  Arlo is a distant third.  Battery power is nice, but in order to save power, they quality isn't very good, and they have to turn on when they sense motion, meaning that you miss a large majority of the motion because the camera is switching on.  For example, we have an Arlo by our front door.  If there is a delivery guy, the camera only catches him walking away after he's been within range for about 15 seconds.  So as he's walking towards the door, camera isn't recording.  Dropping off package, camera isn't recording.  Walking away, camera finally starts recording.","Great security camera, rarely (if ever) goes offline, worth the price."

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Mar 2017,James Slack,"I did a lot of shopping and asking for suggestions before this fairly expensive buy. The neighborhood Sargent touted an old neighbor that had the nest and he said it was far better than his Arlo system. 24 hours into having this set, I love it. The hardest part I had was figuring out where to mount it strategically enough to cover enough ground with only two cameras. The alerts I get are frequent, but really nice. The cameras do a really good job of not picking up nonsense and alerting you. For example; I have a flag waving in the line of sight constantly and it has yet to send me an alert, yet a car going by or the mailman coming down the sidewalk from next door, bam alert with a screen shot right to my e-mail, phone and it even picks it up on my smart watch. I really enjoy nest products and looking forward to expanding on additional cameras and their other tools soon as well. Their customer support is also top notch and was very very helpful with some questions I had once delivered, even did some shopping for me to make recommendations for camera covers.",Great cameras!

Ogier,The outdoor cam has worked great. It was pretty easy to set up. I just drilled a whole from my porch into the attic and was able to plug it in there. It has worked flawlessly since then.(it's been 2 months now) Great product. The only thing I wish happened quicker was the notification of movement. It usually takes 20 or 30 seconds so the Mic ends up not being that useful.,The outdoor cam has worked great. It was pretty easy to set up

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Aug 2017,Lynn,"I installed my Nest cameras in February of 2017 to help validate that I did not have a barking nuisance issue with my dogs, as they had been accused by a neighbor. We were found not guilty!! I installed cameras in both the front and back of my home, and Let me tell you, it has been an eye-opening, enjoyable, and enlightening experience to have the cameras! I have caught drones flying by my windows at night,  far closer than is allowed by federal law. I reported it to the police. I saw my landscaper left the gate to my backyard wide open after he cut the lawn, and was able to contact him immediately to tell him to close the gate before my dogs got out and were run over by a car!  I am amazed at the wildlife, and sometimes a bit concerned LOL, that comes out and about in my neighborhood during the evening! Deer, foxes, raccoons...  Very enjoyable to watch them from the safety inside my home, playing back the video in the morning! And just this week, my neighbor's car was broken into and he reached out to me to see if I had captured it on film. Of course, my Nest cameras picked it up and we turned over the film to the police. These cameras give me an amazing amount of Peace of Mind. I couldn't recommend them more highly.","I have an amazing amount of peace of mind, and couldn't recommend these cameras more highly!"

The resolution is great and the 24/7 video is perfect for what we were looking for.  $100 a year for 10 days worth of recording isn't that bad for the amount of data stream required to record everything.  Just wished they secured the camera a little better.  As of right now, it is only held on by the main power line and a magnet.  No nuts and bolts to hold onto it... maybe it's a good thing for some but for our application, we feared that it may one day be yanked off and hauled away lol I mentioned that the resolution at 1080p is great but it still was not able to pick up license plate number ... even in sun lit day and only 50 feet away.  The details just wasn't there even at maxed out resolution.

Yap,Good that they have an outdoor version now. I use this even for indoor as it looks great too. The video quality is better than older dropcams and nest cams. Could do with two improvements - I would want an attachment to secure the camera with screws once set up instead of just the magnet so that it couldn't be vandalized or stolen easily. - I hope they have an optional nest made attachment cover in case i need to put it in a place with direct sunlight. Now it only has a warning not to put in such a place but what's an outdoor camera that you can't do such. Otherwise the camera is great and even better with cloud video recording (Nest aware service).,Great video clarity

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Jan 2017,Mr. Dean,"So I was excited to install this outdoor camera to monitor the front of my house. Particularly to catch package thrives that are plaguing my neighborhood. I really liked the waterproof house and aesthetically pleasing look and design.  I found the power cord way too long for my application since I have a power outlet right at my front door, but I could have mitigated it by mounting a secondary to stuff the overflow cords. I liked all the app features and video quality. My greatest frustration was the wifi performance. I was evaluating this at the same time as the Logi Circle. The nest seemed to struggle to maintain a smooth video feed at my front door whe the Logi Circle was very smooth at the same location. Not sure if that is due to the waterproof housing.  I could have moved the access point closer but I thought the distance, maybe 30ft plus a closed front door should be sufficient. Also, I didn't like how the camera would go offline each time I changed a setting but this may have been exaggerated by the weak wifi connectivity.  Ultimately, I returned both next and Logi Circle and am evaluating other options such as the Netgear Arlo Pro.  If wifi connectivity is not an issue, you should be happy with this outdoor cam.","Great Design and features, wifi range was lacking"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Feb 2017,hesselgesser,"I purchased a Nest Outdoor Camera about two weeks after purchasing a Nest Indoor Camera. In general, I found the packaging and overall fit and finish of the product to be very good. On the hardware side, I had some issues with power. Given the location of the mounting, I didn't have any convenient power sources within the range of the USB cable and associated power cable. I investigated extending the USB cable with extenders, but was ultimately not successful as the length of run of the USB that I needed could not support the power requirements of the camera. My biggest problem with the camera is that, when you initially install the camera and receive the 30 day trial of Nest Aware, you just don't realize how much functionality is removed for the non-subscription mode. Purchasing the indoor camera and seeing the great functionality of the software, I naively purchased this camera. Now that I know how poor the non-subscription experience is, I likely would not have purchased the camera in the first place. Yes, I can spend the $100/year to get the subscription, but that will be contrasted against the better subscription free experience that I get out of my Canary home monitoring solution.",Great form factor but unhappy with the non subscription software

Eventually we learned that for the cameras to work properly we must pay for the monthly membership. Since we do not have the membership our camera no longer alerts us if someone comes up to our door. They only send us motion notifications. When we do receive any kind of notification, it is normally 10 or 15 minutes later.

I've spent more time trying to figure out how to stop it generating false alerts than anything else.  My general impression is that as a ""user"" they view me as a potential customer for every other product they make.  It was a royal pain to setup and install - they have this long thin cable connecting the camera to the power supply - except that it has a huge connector on the end so it's very difficult to actually thread it through any openings or conduit.  Thus you are limited in locations for the camera - the end result is something that looks good, is marginally effective, and manages to constantly annoy you with spurious alerts. When it does function and sees something, you end up getting a grainy picture emailed to you that is virtually useless - but the camera looks pretty.",Two stars because it looks pretty...

Pros: Easy installation - had the camera up and running in 30 minutes Great motion detection and notifications iPad and iPhone software integrated with my other Nest products Two-way communication is good - just a slight delay between user on remote device and person in camera Speaker on camera is good Cons: Not really crazy about the magnetic mounts - would like to see a more permanent solution Had to drill a 1-inch hole in ceiling in order to route cable though the attic More color options need to be offered - however 3rd party solution is available to change the color of outside of the device Wish color of camera cable was also a different color. However I purchased a Wasserstein Protective Silicone Cover to match my porch paint. Overall, very impressed with all of the Nest line of products.  I will be purchasing more of these very soon!",Easy installation - had the camera up and running in ...

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Aug 2018,Raleigh,Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I’ve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription.  When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can’t do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there’s motion and it can’t distinguish. It doesn’t even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really  ineffective unless someone  hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period. So if you’re comfortable with being stuck with a subscription every year at $100 per camera then it is a decent camera but it’s useless without the subscription.  I’m looking into other cameras where I don’t have to have a subscription.,***Only works if you pay for subscription***

What I mean by this is the company made the connection a huge USB union to the power supply. Leaving the unit with a bulky adapter to power the camera. All in all Nest could have kept the slim USB micro and users could have received the same quality. Makes mounting the cam in a finished house a lot harder than it needed to be.

The biggest disappointment is that it only streams Flash video to phones and tablets, so I can't see the video on my iPhone or iPad.  All I get is a still photo.  In addition, despite having a very robust home network, I sometimes find a camera is off-line, with no explanation. On the plus side, it's the easiest setup imaginable in a market where that is extraordinarily rare.  You can be up and running in five minutes for each camera.  Each of my cameras happens to be close enough to an outdoor outlet that I only have to plug them in and put in two screws for the mounting bracket.",Not ideal for iPhone users
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2017,Brandon,"I really liked my Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera for the first month that I owned it. It works very well. Picture quality is very good and I get notifications when it detects activity. Using my iPhone app, I am even able to have a 2 way conversation with the person standing in view of the camera. If you would have asked my opinion during the first month that I used my Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera, I would have probably given it 4 or 5 stars. WHY DID I GIVE IT ONLY 2 STARS?? For the first month, you are given a free subscription to ""Nest Aware"". During this time, you are able to view at least 10 days (might even be as many as 30 days) of activity detected by your camera. There are also a few other premium features you are able to take advantage of (ex: getting alerts when it thinks it detects a person, setting up ""activity zones"", etc). After the month came to an end, I thought I was totally prepared to lose those premium features... until I realized that one critical feature I relied on (the snapshot history) is limited to 3 HOURS FOR FREE ACCOUNTS. That means unless you pay at LEAST ten dollars a month, you will only be able to view activity that was captured in the last 3 hours. This may not seem like a big deal, but I became VERY frustrated with this after just one day. I woke up at 8am and saw several notifications on my phone telling me that the nest cam detected activity between 2-3am. Since that was more than 3 hours ago, I was not able to see what the activity was. Now the camera is causing more paranoia than it is helping. What good is an activity notification if you can't see what the activity was?? I don't expect to get multiple days or weeks worth of history for free, but I would expect to get at least 12 hours (like other companies like Canary do). Because of this one feature (or lack thereof), I would not recommend this product. My 30 day return period has lapsed, so I cannot return... but I plan on trying to sell this camera and use the money to purchase a Canary Flex.",GREAT until the app's free month trial ends... then you only get 3 hour snapshot history unless you pay monthly

I have other cameras too, but I needed the Exterior Cameras. Interior Nest works great-no problems. Exterior Cameras: The good- Great Image Quality- Easy to set up- Outstanding Packaging- Comes With Everything Needed Including Quality Hardware (Not Chinese JUNK) The Bad- The subscription $$$- 2 Way Talk Feature...Volume is not adjustable- Mic Sensitivity Is Adjustable, but I had to turn it off completely due to wind noise false alerts (20 a day!!)

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Nov 2016,NashvilleLady333,"It would be a 5 star review IF you could use the camera without the $10 (or $30) a month subscription, but that knocks it down a few stars. If you don't pay the monthly fee, you get 3 hours of ""snapshots"" only (not video). Most people sleep more than 3 hours, so that makes this camera pretty much useless without the monthly fee. A competitor offers a $3 a month subscription that Nest really needs to consider - maybe for 24 or 48 hours of video. I would buy more of these cameras if the subscription was more affordable. Now, the camera itself - I do like it a lot. It was super easy to install - I put it on the outside of my garage and ran the cord inside and plugged it in inside. I used the clips that came with it to attach it to the brick. That same competitor mentioned previously includes a (masonry) drill bit with their product, but Nest does not - so you may need that, if you don't already have one. Sure, it might get stolen, but they would have to cut the cord in order to steal and it's mounted pretty high up to do that. Plus, I'd get a great close-up of their face while they tried! IF you get the subscription, the zones are fantastic. My driveway is right next to my neighbors, so I set theirs up as zone 2 and I don't get notified when there is motion over there. It woke me up last night when a cat walked across my driveway - that is now sensitive it is. The night picture is ok, and the day picture is very good. I do like it better than said competitor's product (which I also have, obviously) but the monthly fee kills it. NEST - offer a lower monthly subscription and I'll change this to five stars and buy a few more!! ;)",At least $10 a month or this is useless.

Camera video keeps freezing up now and then.  Also, there is few seconds delay which is bad since security camera system needs to be close to real-time to be useful (which mean their compression technology is not that great).  The motion detection zone doesn’t even work since the time I bought it.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,31 Jul 2017,N. Galloway,"I like the Nest cam outdoor for more reasons than I do not. The reasons for not liking the camera, is for what they do not tell you. Without the Nest Cam Aware subscription the alerts will drive you nuts. The ability to set up zones is only with the subscription service. These zones allow the camera to focus on just areas within the field of view I can configure. Thus limiting the amount of notifications received. Also without Nest aware the video play back history kept is a mere 3hrs. It would have been nice to know these things up front. Probably would have still purchased because the seem to be the best cameras on the market right now. Setup was a breeze, I did have some trouble syncing the camera to my device. There was a step that said ""I should now see live video"", but I was not. So I started over a couple of times then it worked. As others have no doubt pointed out. The unnecessarily huge tip on the camera plug make through wall installs kind of irritating because you have to drill a larger 7/8s hole for the smaller camera wire to fit through. In my case I used dual feed through bushings with a little silicon to seal the hole. The camera display is clear and in HD. The sound quality is pretty good, actually better than expected and the ability for 2 way communication is genius. I plan to pick up more of these as this first one I am totally pleases with... Update... So after months of have my Nest up and running I am running into issues. When I first installed (didnt sign up for Nest Aware trial), the cameras worked well. After constant pop ups/reminders I signed up for Nest Aware, cameras worked well. I have since let the Aware trial lapse without continuing the service. Now the cameras work like crap. Nothing with my network has changed. The camera consistently goes offline. When it does record incidents or motion now, there is no video. Seems to do just stills. I'd hate to think this is a tactic by  the manufacturer to get me to subscribe to the Aware service. I would have returned the product if this happened in the first 30 days. I am hoping the extended warranty can help out.",I like the Nest cam outdoor for more reasons than I ... UPDATED 9/18/17 Rating dropped

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Aug 2017,djp,The camera itself is build solid and easy to set up. What Nest forgets to mention is that 1080 p is Available only when the WiFi Signal is very strong ( Modem in the Basement Camera on the 2nd Floor 1080p is Gone). When you have strong wi-fi signal you can recognize faces if not even at 20 feet away  you wont be able to see a face. Subscription is very Expensive for more then 1 Camera. 100 $ a year for 1 Camera is OK add 50 for each after that and you're better of Calling ADT.

Shalit,"WARNING - these cameras will NOT notify you if a person is there unless you pay $150.00 per year to Nest! You can set them to see ""motion"" without paying the $150.00 but I experimented and apparently ""motion"" does NOT include if they see a PERSON! Further, if you don't have mega bandwidth these cameras will HOG your bandwidth which negatively effects everything else you use from your iPad to your wireless computer. I phoned my provider to find out why my service declined in the middle of the day and it was seen that a huge upload was happening, which could only have been Nest. I called Nest to ask them to only do the huge upload after 1 am and was told I needed to buy more bandwidth. I already have to have these cams set to the lowest possible resolution so the video is not clear enough to identify a perp. Believe me I am waiting for fiber to come here but meanwhile, I feel that Nest is ripping off the consumer by not telling them the truth about the above issues. I am sorry I spent my money and a lot more time than Nest puts out to have these installed.",Caveat emptor!

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Feb 2017,TMB,This security camera does everything I expected and wanted. I've tested it for a week (using my iPhone 6 & Apple Watch) and moved it around just to get an idea of how it would work in a variety of locations. It switches to night vision when there isn't enough light. It detects people and the alert is immediate. The microphone and speaker work well enough to have a conversation.  The Nest app works incredibly well and alerts me within seconds of seeing a person. Twice I noticed that I or my husband was able to get through without detection - which means it did not film us at all so there was no alert. I didn't do any other research but I'm guessing this must be something to do with the film capture rate.,Great image and sound quality

These go offline numerous times a day. Through our the night, I would get 5 to 15 notices saying the cameras were offline. Checked my WiFi and these drops were not as a result of my router. Camera has good optics live but recorded streams seem degraded. Night images were pretty good but I am use to 5 meg cameras so these seem like glorified webcams not true security cameras. These are easy to setup but the cable can create some challenges with the USB connector from camera cable to USB cable. It is very well made. The whole system feels very robust. But the execution as a security solution fails miserably. I really wanted to make these work. I did even mind paying for the service. I was still in the free month but I would have been furious if I was paying for the recording solution.",Frustrated

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Apr 2018,Scott  Kruse,"We purchased our first Best camera two years ago when our son was born. After tons of research I came to the conclusion that this was our best option for a baby monitor. My wife was skeptical because all her family and friends with kids used a dedicated baby monitor. After using the Nest camera for about 24 hours, she admitted that we had the best monitor on the market that can also serve as a security camera when we stop using it as a monitor. When the recent bombings started in Austin, we decided that we needed some outdoor security cameras. We didn't consider another option, due to the quality of our first purchase. I know that having the exposed wires might be a turn off for some, but the price to have cameras professionally installed is very expensive if not installing during a build. We love being notified while at work when the camera has spotted something. If your expecting a delivery it's nice to know it's arrived. I could go on and on about these cameras. If your in the market for some extra security or for a baby/pet monitor, you can't go wrong with a camera from Nest.",Easy to install amazing quality!!

ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS AGAINST IT BECAUSE OF THE BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, I INSTALLED IT ANYWAY.  I ONLY NEED TO USE IT DURING SPECIFIC PERIODS, AND I ALWAYS KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON MY BANDWIDTH CONSUMPTION. I AM MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT.  BOTH THE CAMERA AND THE NEST SERVERS PERFORM EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED.  THEIR WEB PAGES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT PERSONNEL ARE THOROUGH AND ACCURATE, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT HAD REASON TO CALL CUSTOMER SUPPORT AFTER I MADE THE PURCHASE. MY HOME IS SITUATED SUCH THAT THERE IS ONLY A SINGLE ENTRY POINT, THEREFORE THE CAMERA SEES LITTLE CHANGE DURING THE DAY.  WITH THAT, I USE ONLY ABOUT 21% OF THEIR ADVERTISED AVERAGE 200 KBPS UPLINK (I.E. I USE ABOUT 2.52 MBPS PER MINUTE) AT 720P.  AT 1080P, IT IS EVEN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR ADVERTISED AVERAGE, BUT 720P GIVES ME A CLEAR PICTURE WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION SO I HAVE NO NEED FOR THE HIGHER DEFINITION. THE MICROPHONE PICKUP IS EXCELLENT, AND I CAN HEAR AN INCOMING VEHICLE BEFORE IT EVEN COMES INTO VIEW.  THEIR DETECTION ALGORITHM DOES NOT TRIGGER ON SUCH EXTRANEOUS NOISE, THOUGH, BUT IT DOES PICK UP ON SUCH AS A DELIVERY VEHICLE STOPPING IN FRONT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE AND SERVICE FOR USE WITH DOUBLE NAT (I.E. NO STATIC IP) WIRELESS IF, AND ONLY IF, YOU UNDERSTAND BANDWIDTH CONSUMPTION AND ARE WILLING TO RECORD AND ANALYZE YOUR USAGE.  THE UPLINK BANDWIDTH WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE CHANGES IN VIEW OF THE CAMERA.",I AM MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT

I repurchased these about a year later and redid the wireless in my house at the same time. I'm now using the Ubiquiti UAP PROs and have good success with the Nest cams. They do occasionally go out, but for short periods of time. The new 5 day subscription is much more reasonable and I feel it's worth the cost. The only complaint I have now is the dashboards through any browser will on and off again have issues displaying real time video. This seems to be a known issue on the web. Both cameras went offline for 10+ minutes at a time all hours of the day. One of the cameras was 6 feet from the wireless router, and both had no significant interference. I couldn't find a solution that worked for me and was ultimately unhappy with the product. IF the offline issue had not been present, I would've been much happier with it, even with the ridiculous subscription fee.",Updated: Happy Now

Easy to install and very effective.  For owners of existing Nest Indoor Cams, do not expect the same ""cord and plug"" setup.  This camera is clearly well designed for the outdoor elements.

I waited for more than two years for this product to finally become a reality and the wait was well worth it--love the integration with the Nest app and my existing indoor cameras and other Nest products.",Well Worth the Wait.

I've been putting off purchasing a Nest Cam due to the price and not really worried about security in the country, but finally bit the bullet and ordered one and glad I did.  Like all Nest products, this was very easy to sync up and activate.  Mounting was a BREEZE due to the magnet.  I may get a USB extension cable to move it over slightly, but undecided on that as of right now. The app is very easy to use and find when something is happening (or happened), just wished I'd purchased it sooner. Best part is all 3 Nest items operate in ONE app!",Should have purchased sooner!!!

My roommate bought them without telling ANYONE in the house. They are set up outside two of our windows and look over the backyard and the side entrance. The best thing about these camera are 1) the video quality and 2) the audio quality The Video Quality: Amazing, we are able to keep a watchful eye on our cars parked in the backyard. You think you left something in your car? just log in and zoom in through your window to see if its on the front seat. These 300$ cameras saved our 5$ trashcan. Came out in the morning and couldn't find one of them after trash day. To the tapes we went! a little rewind action and boom we found the culprit. Megatron disguised as a trash truck rounded the turn to far and took our beloved trash can with him. A short skip 2 blocks up and there was the trashcan on the side of the road.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Oct 2016,Jeremy Johnson,"I had no problem with the packaging, install, user interface of the app or online, etc.  The issue that made it useless was the motion notifications.  During testing every single motion event was being recognized and recorded on the timeline.  But I was getting extremely sporadic notifications.  Seemed like one every hour or so.  When I told support they had me run through a million steps of uninstalling the app and resetting the camera.  This is just extremely poor support. If the events are getting recognized by the timeline and no emails are being sent out how can it possible be the app or the camera that's the problem?  It's by it's very definition a backend problem and the support reps just don't understand.  Looking over reviews problems with notifications have been an issue for years.  I got a used iPod Touch and downloaded Presence and it is absolutely perfect for detecting motion alerts.  I can dial in the sensitivity, schedule, and delay timers to my liking -- something I have to trust the all mighty Nest algorithm to do for me which just flat out doesn't work. Without good motion alerts this thing is essentially just recording for archival purposes.  And if that's all it's good for it's WAY too expensive because of the subscription service.  You're better off getting simple IP cameras and a NAS to function as a DVR.  Within a couple months it'll be cheaper to just do it that way.  Until they make the notification alerts more reliable and give more options on the notifications this is just not worth it.",Good camera.  Horrible motion detection notifications.

After the trial ended, the camera basically became immediately useless. The only thing it does now is show you a live stream of what's happening. With the Nest Aware free trial, the camera alerted me through the app when there was movement. I could immediately swipe and see a short clip of the aforementioned movement. Now I can't even see anything that has happened in the past, even 3 minutes ago! The app just freezes, nothing I had a pro alarm with before. I'm very disappointed with Nest.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jan 2018,Raymond L.,"I did a lot of research before choosing the NEST cams.  And I really wanted to like them… But after using them (one indoor, one outdoor) for two months I simply cannot recommend.  It was a very frustrating experience and I wouldn’t buy if I had to do it all over again.  I tried to be as specific as possible to clearly define my exact issues and complaints.  Perhaps folks can suggest solutions/workarounds. The NEST app is not intuitive, difficult to navigate, and buggy --- to the point of being maddening when you first start using it.  My whole reason for going with NEST is that I thought the interface and features would be well-designed.  I was wrong.  I expected better from them.  Here are my main issues: 1.  After initial setup I had to delete & reinstall both my cameras because each was under a different ‘Home’.  If you use the “+” button in upper right corner it will add a 2nd Home…  you must go under 1st Home and choose “Add Product” under the tools pulldown in order to add additional cameras --- completely non-intuitive and not how most apps use the “+” button (eg.  TP-Link KASA app uses the same “+” button to add devices).  I would think that many users would fall into this same trap.  The only way out is to delete everything and start over.  Not a good way to start… 2.  NEST has ensured that this camera is not useful unless you pay for a subscription.  They do this by eliminating most of the features if you don’t have one (Zone motion triggers, person detection, see past video, etc).  Without a subscription you get ZERO video archive (some reviewers were saying it was limited to 3hrs or 12hrs, but this is false).  You only get a still picture of motion or generic sound alarm that occurred WITHIN THE LAST 3 HOURS, and the still may or may not actually have the image of what generated the alarm.  So if something happens in the middle of the night you won’t have a record of it the next morning.  They are trying very hard to make this camera equivalent to a live-only camera unless you buy their subscription! 3.  This is a cloud-based system, meaning that you have NO WAY to view any video unless sending to the cloud.  The bandwidth usage is completely outrageous!  I got an email from my internet provider after two weeks stating that I exceeded my quota of 300GB/mo.  I was uploading 5GB per day for ‘Medium’ quality!  For two cameras on high quality it consumes 600GB per month!  The app gives data/bandwidth requirements under “Quality and Bandwidth” pulldown, along with data hog warning – see screencap below.  This is ridiculous and will exceed most internet provider data plans.  So I can only turn on the cameras for a few hours each day and reduce the video quality --- so what’s the point of paying for “high def” cameras if I can’t use them?  And why pay even more for a subscription if I can’t fully utilize it?  And it isn’t possible to use cameras at all without sending to cloud, so now I am wishing I had bought something else… 4.  The NEST app provides integration with the TP-Link ‘KASA’ app, specifically:  When toggling between “Home/Away” mode you can trigger specific SCENES.  I have my TP-Link color LED bulb in Foyer turn GREEN or RED (RED=Away, GREEN=Home) anytime the NEST app sees that I physically leave my house (linked to my phone location) or someone manually toggles  “Home/Away” which also turns my cameras ON/OFF.  This manual toggle can be done either within NEST app OR the KASA app (icon added under devices—see screencap below).  In KASA, my wife can see the color of the bulb and shows what time I left (or arrived) at the house. - Note:  You can independently schedule cam ON/OFF times and this does not impact “Home/Away” status (ie.  lights do not change status) - Warning:  Periodically my indoor cam does not shut off when status changes to “Home”.  If I don’t notice right away, eats up a lot of my data quota! - Warning:  Every time you logout and log back in you will have to reconfigure the “Home/Away” settings – no way around this.  Bad software! - Warning:  The linkage between the KASA and the NEST app keeps breaking… doesn’t work as advertised.  I completely wasted my money… 5.  Software issues on the NEST side --- all day 1/4/18 I was unable to view live video or turn the cameras ON or OFF.  The cams were indeed working and could view past video from this timeframe.  After more than 1hr of troubleshooting I gave up.  Today everything is suddenly working properly again.  I figure it must have been an issue on the NEST side…  That is the problem with cloud-based systems, you are dependent on their systems to work as well as yours. 6.  Not a big deal, but every time you install a new camera (or delete and reinstall existing camera) as I have had to do numerous times, it gives completion error msg: “Oh No!  Something has gone wrong”, even though everything has installed correctly.  I really hate this software. In summary, the NEST cameras are not reliable and I will avoid NEST products in the future.",Buggy software and you must buy a subscription to make these cameras useful

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Oct 2016,Richard H.,"Super easy to configure and setup. Two things prevent me from giving it 5 stars: I needed to add a $29 wireless repeater to my garage to extend the signal to outdoors. I expect that more people have this problem then they do with the indoor version, so I would add an extra step in the setup: once you have it working indoors, take it outside and simply hold it where you want to install it and make sure it can still connect before you attach the bracket, drill holes, etc. The second minor problem is that the USB cable ""locks"" to the transformer with a cylindrical device that twists into the transformer. This is great because it prevents the cable from accidentally getting unplugged, however it adds bulk to the cable and causes you to drill a bigger hole to get the cable through from outside to inside.","Good camera, couple minor items would make it great."

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Dec 2016,Moburner,"Very good camera, but only with the subscription.  If you don't have the time or inclination to spend a lot of time to set up an outdoor camera, this is pretty easy.  However, unless you have a pretty good broadband connection and a fast wifi router, this is going to hurt.  I have DSL advertised at 10MBPS down/750KBPS up, and I couldn't get one to work properly without slowing everything to a crawl.  I have an excellent, recent wifi/router and each one of these cameras needs almost all of my upload capacity to work with the subscription, plus, it will all count towards the monthly cap, if you have one.  This wouldn't be such a problem if I could capture and store the video locally on my hard drive, but the Nest doesn't allow that.  Also, the advanced algorithms for motion detection, blanking, person recognition, video playback and storage require you to stream to their servers. I ended up getting SecuritySpy software [...] and dedicating an old iMac with a 4TB external drive and bought some IP PoE cameras instead.  I can add just about any kind of camera, including an iPhone, and see it on my desktop or view it remotely with an iPad or phone. There are a host of software providers for Windows as well, to do the same thing with a PC. Nest is excellent, but expensive, and you're going to be shackled to their subscription to get the good stuff. The subscription is probably a good value, if you have the capacity. I prefer wired cameras, but that probably isn't an option if you are renting.  All this one needs is an outlet and wifi. Bottom line; if I had good internet speeds, I'd probably go with them anyway, because of the advanced functions and ease of use. Not insignificantly, their customer service is excellent.","Easy to install, but requires paid subscription for features, must have broadband to work properly"
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jan 2017,DTC,"I'm a nest guy and have multiple drop cams.  I was excited for their outdoor product.  It didn't, however, work for me and I returned the camera.  I had 2 issues: 1) the cable was too long.  I know that seems like a odd complaint but in my mounting situation I needed a much smaller cable and there was no way to make the adjustment.  2) I didn't feel like the magnet was strong enough.  I bumped the installed camera twice and it fell off the mount.",Not for me

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Dec 2016,MNP,To be brutally honest the features of this camera are competitive if you buy the subscription.  If you don't its just a 'dumb' camera with minimal features.  Any activity outdoors will wipe out any useful information that would be stored in the limited amount of saved time.  In other words if you don't pay the monthly fee any incidents will most likely be wiped out before you are able to retrieve the images. Additional issues include: lots of false alerts without the use of zones which are NOT available without a subscription so the alerts are also useless.,Without the subscription (extra costs) camera is of minimal actual value.

Upon ending the free month, I tested the camera without these subscription features. PROS: (1) Phone alerts when it hears sounds or senses movement, (2) Live video feed. That's it for pros. CONS: (1) When scrolling back to see previous recordings, only PICTURES can be seen, not video, (2) There is no facial or person recognition (the camera will alert ""activity"" or ""movement"" instead of a person, as it cannot tell the difference. This feature IS available with Nest Aware), (3) Only the previous 5 HOURS can be reviewed, and as mentioned before, through pictures, not video, (4) NEST AWARE IS LIMITED TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES All this is fine if you understand that the free features are enough for you. In my situation, however, I wanted to purchase the Nest Aware subscription, but my country (Puerto Rico) IS NOT SUPPORTED (although the free trial worked great, go figure!!!!) so I am stuck with an extremely expensive webcam.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Sep 2017,Ellen T Fusco,"i love the video feed, quality wise, from this camera - the audio is near worthless for a couple of reasons: 1st as it has to upload to nest first, then download to my phone, that means two trips on the internet - which gives a 2 second delay. When i speak, it takes 2 seconds for it to make it to the camera at the front door, then after the visitor has heard my greeting, it takes 2 seconds for his response - not good, it gets confusing, and the visitor will repeat himself not knowing about the 2 second delay, and talk over what i'm responding.  2nd complaint - standing under the camera at the door, there's maybe 24"" distance to the micro speaker on the camera - the volume is about the level of someone way down a long hallway talking to you in a normal conversation voice level. If there's a car going by, you're not going to hear it and the road is about 100 ft distance from the door. And that car noise masking the conversation is both ways, the visitor hearing or you hearing what they said. Then comes the fact that after selling you the camera, YOU DON'T GET THE MOTION OR SOUND ALERTS OF AN EVENT AT THE CAMERA IF YOU DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THEIR EXPENSIVE CLOUD STORAGE WHICH JUST ADDS A DELAY TO THE ALERT BEING DELIVERED TO YOU. I only say expensive as it is the pricest service out there compared to their competitors. I will say the camera actually starts recording the motion event relatively close to the event commencing, ie recorded to the event video sent to your phone. It is recording 24/7 so you can always go online to your acct at Nest and review what occurred before the motion notification. now comes the real rub - a lot of folks on youtube have posted ""workarounds"" to enable a user to forego having to subscribe to the NEST Aware cloud storage service - and from comments under those youtube videos, apparently NEST puts it's engineers to work coding defeats to those workarounds - currently there are no working ""workarounds"" unless you're running windows 10 which i refuse to install - i work with videos and prefer Win 7. But even that workaround has a limited life expectancy. Maybe 10% of your customers are going to find and employ workarounds - and you actually spend resources & time looking for them and engineering ""defeats"" to continue your strong arming the customer into buying your cloud storage service?  Lame Nest, really Lame It's a shame - the video quality is excellent, the motion detection is excellent, the night vision is near worthless - maybe effective for 10' distance. Nest - charge me $250 for the phone and keep your $100/yr subscription for the 1st camera and $50 for each additional camera. Let a user record his/her video on their own computer - I spent $300 on a 1 TB SSD solely for video recording the camera. Fortunately i only purch'd one camera - looks like D-link will get the rest of my business below are two shots, one showing the night vision view, and i was being kind when i said 10' effectiveness - to give you a better idea of the same field of view there's a daytime shot from the same camera",wouldn't buy again on principle

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,09 Sep 2017,TW,"As a big fan of Nest products (own 12 products) this camera is certainly the most disappointing. The camera is supposed to distinguish people from pets (and roomba) but alerts me to my pets walking around even though I have it set to only alert me when there is a person in the room. This makes it no better than a regular nest cam despite a hefty price premium. This is troubling since a false positive makes me disregard alerts (and makes it annoying) rendering the ""smart"" features useless. I reached out to Nest and the customer service person tried to push Nest aware on me explaining that my settings are right but there is a bug that needs to be fixed. In the meantime I need to get Nest aware as a work around.  Not only is the camera not working as advertised but Nest's solution is to make me pay for a subscription to fix it. Very disappointing. If I wanted a camera that can't distinguish people from my roomba I would have saved money buying the cheaper version.","A ""Smart"" camera that fails terribly"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Oct 2016,"Amazon Customer - Vista, CA","I own Nest Thermostat and protects .  I finally decided to purchased the Nest Cam and Nest Outdoor Cam at the same time. (From Amazon and HDepot)  This is my first experience with WIFI cameras. Overall the setup was flawless. I had both cameras setup and functional within 10 minutes.  I’d recommend setting  up the Outdoor Cam near your WIFI router before taking it outside. Once setup easy to place and make operational , seems to have good day and night video on both cameras.  I do worry the Nest Outdoor is an target for theft .  There isn’t any way to secure the camera to the base.  The Outdoor is running on 40% WIFI signal strength the doesn’t miss a beat. The recording zones Nest needs a lot of improvement… outside zones are triggered from light shadows from cars driving by and by light changes from shadows,  even though the camera is not facing the street pointed at my front door, it sends email alerts when my porch light turns on each night and random  as passing.  I use Wemo to turn off the lights, using wemo schedules, you would thing these two items could alert each other.  My  Nest Cam inside the house has the same failure,  the camera zone triggers alerts when the room is dark and a light is turned on by wemo .  The inside camera is not facing the light  I’ve tried moving and reshaping  the zones. To no success.. I shouldn’t  have to work this hard for lights turning on.  Out of frustration I’ve deleted all zones.  Which leads me to trying to rationalize the value of recording if the zone performance  is this bad,  when I called nest their input is move the cameras  and after a long conversation I hear this is a common complaint ..my plan has been to install 2 more cameras.  I’ve nixed that idea  Nest is a long way from solving these zones and I’m concerned Nest will address it the same as the wave off function on my 6 nest protects.  Last Nest needs to address the  cost of recording. I'm considering sending the cameras back.",Cameras work great.. Zone feature is not as good as expected

I can't judge the product as a whole from the one apparently broken camera that I received, but I can certainly judge the Nest customer support quality from my several conversations.  The camera is going back in the box and getting returned.  I would NEVER buy another Nest product again - I would have given the actual product a second chance but the customer support experience is not a glitchy, one-off failure.  The Google brand is tarnished by the poor quality of Nest support. I had two issues with this device - one, it kept flapping online and offline as it lost connectivity from a router that was less than 25' away.  Two, there is NO facility to block email notification of this event.  Customer support repeatedly could not understand that I had turned off all email notifications on my account and the camera itself yet I continued to get notification emails.  I made three or four calls to customer support over a period of a month and my issue had NO activity between my phone calls.  At each new call, there did not appear to be anything substantive recorded about the previous call since I got asked the exact same questions that I had answered in previous calls - the email notification seems like a stock problem, but I was experiencing an edge condition and customer support could not seem to wrap their head around that and write it in the ticket or sticky note where they track issues. During my last phone call, I talked with Dan and Dennis and then got transferred into a black hole.  Then called back and got Cassidy and then elevator music for several minutes.  Then I got JR who again started from scratch on the debugging and told me that there was no record of my first conversation with Nest in September and that no actual action had been initiated from my subsequent detailed conversation on 10 October.  Basically, customer support can answer a few basic questions but appear to be more interested in filtering out customer complaints than actually fixing problems with the product.",Nest customer support is a complete waste of time

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2016,KH,"I have a number of Nest Cams and previous DropCams for indoors.  I have to say the setup is super easy and the picture is great.  Where this great camera is lacking is its horrible cable.  This is an outdoor camera and in many installations, like mine, I want to fish wires and hide them.  In my case I want to fish the wire through my attic soffit vent and then get power from the attic.  I was replacing an old Panasonic camera which went to a thin wired power pack and could easily splice an extension.  The Nest looks like it is wired to run my iron.  Also putting a large coupler after about 10 feet of wiring followed by about 15 feet of cable, which was nuts.  The USB end with its locking connector means I have to cut a 3/4"" hole anywhere I want to run the wire and am limited to about 10 feet of cable since I don't want the 3"" diameter coupler showing. In short beautiful camera, great software, horrible wiring.  At least sell it with alternate cabling?  If the cable was more outdoor friendly I would give it 5 stars.  Am I going to order another, yes, but that is because it has one of the best interfaces out there right now and I love the cloud recording for remote vacation homes.  Still hate the cabling :-(...",Terrible cabling design

Currie,"Great product when it works! The ease of set up is great! I installed it and everything was fine. I have two other indoor Dropcams that I am happy with though high heat tends to fry the indoor cams fairly easy. I live in a place where it gets very HOT 100+ regularly. Even though the Dropcams are inside the house in the AC at around 77 degrees, the direct sun in a window sill will eventually cook them. Enter the outdoor security cam. A long awaiting member of the Dropcam family, I am happy to see they have taken things outdoors. That's where the happiness ends. I installed the camera and set it up. It ran flawlessly for 4 days. The temps were moderate, low 90s, no direct sunlight. On day 4, the camera had connectivity issues with my router (looks to be a common issue from the reviews and forums I have read). It's now day 6 and the camera turns on and off 10 minutes at a time - that is to say, 10 minutes live, 10 minutes off.. and so on. I suspect a heat issue as it occurs more often at night when the internal IR lights are on in the camera projecting outwards. Night time temps are in the mid 70s here. All other devices in the house work fine, including the other two Dropcams, so it's not a router issue or interference. I made an attempt to return the camera to Amazon, however they want to route me through tech support. Let me say, with a 3 month old baby in the house and 3 hours of sleep a night, the LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS TROUBLESHOOT A NEW DEVICE. Because I can't flat out return it, I am waiting for Techsupport to get my email so that they can run me through the gamete of BS. Where is AMAZON'S Flawless return policy that they had? If I had known this, I would have bought it locally where I can return it and exchange it for a new one without any trouble.",NEST - Please acknowlege the issue with this camera - Many MANY report the same problem.

(10 day backup) For an outdoor camera, the wifi pickup is very weak.  Most likely, you will need high quality wifi extenders as well.  I would think for the price they would be better.  You will pay $100/yr for 10 day backup for your first camera and $50/yr for each additional one. It doesn't cap either. This adds up quickly!  I would look for other options if you want a security system.  Their indoor cameras are good for watching the dogs while you are away or making sure the kids are home from school.

This is worse by far. I hired someone to install them and now that money is wasted because I am going to have to rip them out. I thought at first the problem might be that it was too far from the router (40 ft and two walls) so I put an extender on the other side of the wall from the camera still it stays off line more than it is on. I know the problem is not the extender because I get a strong signal on the upper floor, far side of the house.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jul 2017,Work of Life,"I preordered a couple of the Logi Circle 2 (directly from Logitech) after returning a set of the latest Nest outdoor security cameras (to Amazon). I have previously owned a set of 6 Logitech Alert cameras (which I loved, but they are no longer available). I am happy to say that the Circle 2 Indoor/Outdoor cameras are improvements over the current model Outdoor Nest cameras as well as the old Logitech Alert cameras. I ordered my two cameras along with the window mount adapters and installed them inside, looking out. Installation is super fast and super easy (as compared to both of the other camera systems mentioned above). My experience was a very simple plug and play. Unbox, plug in the cameras, download the app, connect to your network, customize your camera settings, then pop the camera into the stick-on window mount and you're done! Installation of each camera was less than 10 minutes (including unboxing, download the app and mouting to the windows). This was SO MUCH EASIER than Nest cameras which only offer magnetic and screw mount options (no window mount).  The Nest cameras are also nearly twice as big and much heavier as these new Circle 2 cameras, yet both offer same video quality and 180 view, same remote monitoring, same two way voice communication, etc. The Circle 2 cameras are smaller, lighter, more discreet and offer better mounting options. The Circle app is also a bit more robust than the Nest app. For example, the Logi Circle app allows you to adjust the monitoring areas. This allows you to set a smaller section of the viewable area to trigger movement alerts. This is great if you have pets and want to set movement alerts to only trigger for a doorway or window. The Circle app also offers a cool ""day brief"" feature that allows you to quickly scroll through all the movement events and alerts of the day. If you have the premium subscription (free for one month after initial set up), you can customize some settings of the Day Brief (if you only want to include ""person"" alerts). The Nest app lacks these features. Lastly, one year of Premium 31-day unlimited storage for the Circle 2 is only $99 per year/per camera versus Nest Aware which charges $300 per year per camera (at the time of this review). Again, it is the same quality video, but Logitech offers a much more reasonable cloud storage fee. Improvements I would like to see on the Circle 2 Cameras: 1) A feature on the app that allows us to adjust the recorded area of view. This feature was included in the Logitech Alert Commander software and I used it to edit out areas that didn't need to be recorded. I would like to see this in the Circle App as well. 2) With the window mounts, there are visible reflection ""rings"" from the window mount housing that show up on the video. Turning off the LED and the infrared greatly reduces these ""reflection"" rings, but doesn't eliminate them. I would like to see this improved. Even with this visual ring anomaly on the video stream, it is clear enough for my purposes (security) I am still a fan of the window mount. There is nothing else like it on the market so kudos to the Logitech engineers for creating this brilliant window mount. I hope they continue to improve it. 3) I would also like to see a local storage option for the Circle cameras. This was also part of the Logitech Alert cameras and Commander software that I had at my previous home. The cameras included Micro SD cards, the software would also allow you to assign storage on your local computer AND there were cloud storage subscription options. I really loved these features and am disappointed that the current standard in wifi security cameras is subscription based cloud storage and no local storage options. Granted, you can go in and manually download anything you want, but there are no automatic options (for Logitech Circle 2 or Nest cameras). All in all, I am thrilled with Logitech's newest security camera. Thanks for reading. I hope this review is helpful!",Nest Outdoor compared to newest Logitech Indoor/Outdoor Circle 2!

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Sep 2016,Michael Wayne,"If you've ever researched consumer-level outdoor security cameras, you know that the offerings have left a lot to be desired. Poor hardware and even worse software have pretty much defined the entire market. Commercial options are better, but they're also far more expensive and lack the basics of what I want in a home security camera (cloud recording and a decent smart phone app, to start with.) Fortunately, the Nest Outdoor Security Camera now exists. So far, I'm really impressed with it. The video and audio quality are great, but the best feature is the smartphone app (Android, in my case.) It's fast, it's easy to use, and it Just Works. This is a surprisingly difficult thing to get right, but Nest does. Scanning through hours of video is just as responsive and intuitive as watching the live feed or the last detected moment of activity. In contrast to this experience, a couple days ago I had to check the security feed at work. It involved installing a Java applet that's probably not from this decade and a phone app that crashed any time I tried to seek through the video. Installing the camera was painless, and the fact that I didn't have to run to the hardware store means they got the accessories right. The only complaint I have at this point is that the cables are too long. I actually have an outdoor outlet that's only a few feet from where I have the camera mounted, so I had to coil up the other twenty feet of cord. It's not ideal, but it's also not a big deal. To give a sample of the image quality, I've included a couple screenshots. The last screenshot is of the app's timeline, which gives previews of all detected activity (in this case, cars driving by.) As time goes on, I'll update this review with my experience relating to other aspects of the hardware and software. For now, I think it's an excellent buy and would recommend it to anyone looking for an outdoor security camera. 2016-10-01 update: I've had the camera running for a couple weeks now and it has not required a single adjustment or even the classic ""disconnect power to restart device"" move. I would appreciate more playback controls beyond 15-second skip within the app, but they are available via the web interface. Overall, still very happy with it. 2017-10-10 update: A year later and the camera's still great. No adjustments or power-cycling reboots to speak of, and the Android app has improved quite a bit. Short gif-like clips appear as notifications whenever activity is detected, and they usually tell me everything I need to know. I rarely watch the raw video feed now unless I'm looking for something specific. Over the last year it's recorded all sorts of random things -- a hit and run, property theft, and a neighbor who really didn't like being out in the rain. Well worth the $100/year price!","Finally, an outdoor security camera that gets it right."

They also rolled out some new features that make it incredibly easy to save clips from within the Nest app to the phone's camera roll. My wife and I have been VERY happy with this camera. The video and build quality is top notch in my opinion. In fact, because of user error in mounting the camera it actually fell from about 15 feet to the concrete below. The casing had a few scratches, but the glass protecting the camera was unblemished. The notifications from the app were fixed a few weeks after the camera was released and they have been flawless. It's also very user friendly. My wife tends to get frustrated with tech, but she has found this camera to be very easy to use. She loved the outdoor camera so much that we picked up a Nest Cam Indoor as a baby monitor. Has it met all of our expectations? Absolutely not, but many products don't. The app isn't always the most reliable. Connection drops from the camera from time to time, but only for a few minutes at a time. The $100 per year for 7 days of video history is a bit much in my opinion. None of those things are deal breakers. With all that said, we are very happy with the Nest Cam Outdoor. ---- Original Review ---- I would stay away from this camera until Nest works out some of the kinks. I've spent 3 hours total on the phone with their support trying to figure out how to get push notifications to work on my devices. The camera is useless in my opinion without the push notifications. Nest support says they are aware of the issue and their team is working to fix. I will update my review if the problem gets resolved, but at this moment I absolutely plan to return the camera.",Push Notifications Fixed! I Can Now Wholeheartedly Recommend This Camera

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Sep 2016,Landon Dodd,"Can not believe how easy this camera was to set up and get going. Literally takes about 10 minutes to install and start recording. The mounting system is utterly brilliant. Being able to mount the camera virtually any direction imaginable is wonderful to accommodate tricky building angles that other cameras simply can't deal with. Don't worry that it's magnetic. This magnetic hold is very strong and the camera isnt going anywhere. I didnt have a problem at all with the cables or the cable sizes that other people seem to have issues with. The USB portion of cable is about as big around as my ring finger. Simply drilling a hole, passing the cable through and then filling the hole with a rubber grommet and caulk makes the installation look nice and clean. I don't like micro USB connections (several other reviewers wished micro USB was used) due to water sealing issues- the connection on this camera solves that.  At one corner of my building, there is attic access for a plug. For the camera on this corner, I used a standard office desk cable pass through to run the cable into my attic. Looks very clean and leaves room for more cables in the future if the need should arise. Very happy with video and audio quality- talking at a normal volume the camera easily captures sound and you can tell what's being said. Video quality is great with a nice 130° field of view. Yoy can see a LOT with this camera. Night vision doesn't blow me away but it's adequately usable and doesn't fall behind the other cameras available. The monthly subscription is kind of steep imo but we don't have a choice but to pay for it if we want to keep and view recorded footage. The nest app is GREAT and I love having all of my cameras and thermostats in one app. The ""Spaces"" feature makes using the cameras a joy. Also love the fact that I can talk to people via the camera- One of my favorite features. This is one of the best outdoor security cameras available right now so if you're in the market for one, this is what I'd go with. If you're already in the Nest ecosystem, this is a no-brainer. Extremely high quality piece of hardware that's well built and performs wonderfully. It was worth the wait.",Excellent Camera- Worth the Wait.

I planned ahead and put electrical outlets close to where I was going to install the cameras. Now I have 25' of cable with a fat, ugly adapter in the middle to span a distance of around 2 feet. Hey, I get it. I know a lot of people will be putting these cameras up high and running the cable to a typical outlet near the floor/ground. But why not offer a couple of different cable lengths?

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Feb 2017,Tim F,"I’m really disappointed with these cameras. By all rights they should be the best in class home security cameras. However problems I’ve encountered with their software, hardware, and customer service stop me from recommending these to anyone. I bought an outdoor and indoor camera to create a basic home security setup, and intended to use the indoor camera as a baby monitor in a few months. I set up both cameras and was pretty amazed by the quality of video, thumbnailing, and alerting we were getting. However I had a problem with the “home” and “away” setting. I wanted alerting only to happen when the cameras were set to “away”, and to just passively record when we were home. This was very flakey, and I spent about an hour debugging it with Nest customer support. Resetting cameras would occasionally allow the alerting to function properly but it would immediately get out of sync. Look online - apparently this issue has existed for months. Now, every time we or anyone would walk near either camera I would get notifications and emails. This goes from mildly irritating to infuriating really quickly. So, I turned off alerts altogether. This removes about 30% of the value for me. My second issue is my indoor camera would drop offline for 20 minutes at a time every week or so. I reached out to nest support (again) and ended up with a support tech who argued with me for some time that a) it wasn’t a big deal and b) just move it around some more to see if it still happens. Trust me it’s a big deal if a baby monitor isn’t reliable. I got a lot of attitude from this guy. Since I had my two cameras equidistant from my wifi (with line of sight) and only one was dropping it seemed clear to me there was a problem outside of positioning. When I suggested I would instead just return the camera the tech said instead he’d do a camera swap. Great! Except he shipped it to the wrong address with a different name (but close enough to my name that I felt like he was griefing me). OK, I reached out a third (!!!) time to support to correct the address, this time over the phone. This tech was somewhat upset that the address was so badly botched and assured me she would get it fixed. I’m sure she tried, but it wasn’t fixed. Fortunately it went to my neighbor who I am friends with, so I at least got the camera. I sent the old camera back a few days later (weeks ago) via the included USPS sticker. Now I’ve gotten multiple harass mails saying they will need to charge me if they don’t get it. It’s been weeks in transit USPS ground…and they have the tracking number. Seriously, what the heck? I now have my new indoor camera, which has the same 20 minute dropout issues (this time in the same location my other, working fine, outdoor camera was in for months). And I can’t use alerting. And at this point I’m too weary to contact Nest again for anything. I paid for a year of service for each camera, which I will just grin and bear. But the software, hardware, and customer service of this product just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",Really disappointed with these cameras

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,06 Jul 2017,Megan dowdy,"I honestly can't believe this sort of business practice is even legal in America. Let me explain what you'd be experiencing upon purchasing this camera. First you receive it in the mail, and excitedly you begin setup.  You realize pretty quickly if you didn't know when purchasing, that it is a wired camera. A bright WHITE camera with a bulky bright white cord (with a bulky mid-line power block in the middle of it.)  So your new camera won't be blending in with your house because even if you have a white house the face of the unit is a contrasting glossy black.  Also, since the cord has to either be plugged in indoors or have some sort of weather proof outlet available, you will most likely be making a trip to the hardware store. Okay, you're all set up.  Time to check this thing out right?  Well you'll quickly discover that unless you're defending your home from the most idiotic burglars ever, you'll be getting nearly zilch because the camera just plain DOES NOT record in 1080p (even after changing settings.)  I dont know if there is some seedy loophole or something but when I watch television in 1080p I know I can read license plates that are more than 20ft away from the camera. Maybe you're okay with that so lets move to the worst part.  The app that lets you utilize your camera and view events almost never works well, and you'll find yourself reloading.  You might even pop on over to settings after being prompted about this ""Nest Aware free trial"" that you've been given...To your dismay you'll find that unless you pony up another $100 a year (or 10$ a month) minimum, your new nest camera will, in just 30 short days, turn into a useless piece of trash that takes ""snapshots"" of events (which means you MIGHT catch a burglars rear end as hes coming or going,) and these snapshots are only available in the cloud for 3 hours. TLDR; you'd be purchasing what is essentially extortion in a box unknowingly.  cant believe these things have such high ratings.",Extortion in a box

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Sep 2016,Mg,The product everyone's been asking for since Dropcam originally came out is finally here!  Installed it today and it was fairly simple; The power cord is 15ft and the usb cable linked to the power adapter / cord is another 10 ft.  The thing I was most worried about was that since this was on a magnetic base it would be fairly easy to steal.  Luckily they include some cable retainers that screw into the exterior of your home which should make it a bit harder (you could even get a security bit set if you really wanted).  The other thing I was worried about was the fact that this is actually plugged in to an outdoors and someone could easily just unplug it; went to home depot and installed one that you could lock / zip tie.  So far from what I can tell the wi-fi is improved and is working great outdoors and video quality is on par with the nest-cam.  Will probably be adding a few more if they go on sale come black friday.,Finally an outdoor version!

But to take advantage of historical replay you must subscribe to Nest Away, a recording service that should provide 10 days of replay for an annual cost of $100 for the first Nest camera and $50 for each additional.  Without this service, you will not have access to recording past 1 Day and no ability to record locally to your own computer or hard drive. The Nest Aware service is unreliable and the support is worse!!  I have had days not recorded when I really needed to review and Nest is unable to explain.  They are sympathetic to my disappointment and they expect Nest Aware to funtion properly as well, but it does not.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,18 Sep 2016,Richard Sonnen,"The camera itself is well-designed - solid construction, good image quality, acceptable sound quality, great packaging design.  Pretty much what you'd expect from Nest/Google. The mounting system is novel (a strong magnet that allows you to easily point the camera) but a poor choice for an outdoor camera.  The unit would be trivial to steal or knock down in many mounting scenarios.  I'd be much happier if there was a real connection to the mounting surface. The fatal flaw is the cable system.  Long captive cable to a standard USB connector, a puck-sized power transformer, then another long captive power cable to a standard two-prong plug.  Neither has any means to swap out an appropriate-length cable. No matter where your power source is in relation to the camera mounting point, you will have a coil of USB or power cable to hide somewhere.  This camera is intended to be permanently mounted, so that's not a trivial design error.  It will eventually annoy me enough that I cut the USB cable and re-terminate it to the correct length for my installation, but that's not exactly something a buyer should have to tackle. The phone app is reasonably well put together, though the newest version seems a bit laggy.  The camera display screen seems to be preoccupied with selling you their cloud storage add-on at the expense of usability. I went with the Nest because I have an old Dropcam, Thermostat, and a few Protects, so I'm already invested in their ecosystem.  If you aren't, I don't see a lot to recommend this one over its competitors.","Decent camera, terrible cable design"

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Sep 2016,Bob Jones,"*** See bottom of review for all updates *** This is my second Nest product.  I have a Dropcam pro installed in the house and this Outdoor Nest Camera installed overlooking my driveway, carport entrance and front of house.  I have a third Outdoor Nest Cam on order for the back yard. I am willing to pay $99/year for the first camera and $50/yr for the second one (for 10-day recorded video).  I have a third camera for the back yard and know I will pay another $50/yr for that one.  That works out to $200/yr for three cameras, or $0.55/day.  I have cut the cord on cable TV and so really this expense is not that bad.  The initial cost of the camera seems kind of pricey, but the build quality of this outdoor model is impressive. Many people discuss their concerns with the magnetic mount and the likelihood that the camera might be stolen.  I have no such fears.  I just installed it high enough to eliminate that worry.  By the time they get to the camera, I will have a good shot of them anyhow.  And once I inform Nest of the stolen camera, it will be of absolutely no use to them anyhow. Setup was super easy and best done with an iPhone or Android phone (as opposed to a desktop computer).  It literally only took me about a minute to get it connected to my WiFi and start streaming images. The image quality (day and night) is very good compared to other cameras I have used (see examples). Because we have brick walls I was afraid that the camera would have a hard time grabbing my WiFi signal.  My router is on the opposite side of the house.  I am happy to report that there have been no connection issues so far - and the video stream is solid. I had to run a length of extension cord to the camera (even though it comes with about 25 feet of cable). The main issue I have are false positives on the alerts.  The alerts I have set up send me frequent false positives thinking that a person is in view of the camera.  Flashes of light or moving shadows also cause many false positives.  I am still working on my settings to find the perfect balance. So far the camera does what it is supposed to.  And it is great being able to capture video clips and share them.  We will see how this camera survives the winter, summer and elements in general.  But I am impressed so far and I know Nest will always be improving their detection algorithms - they have a way to go on that score. FIRST UPDATE:  Well I have had all three cameras running (two Outdoor models and one Dropcam for inside) for several months.  I am pleased to report that everything is running fine.  I especially like the phone app (I use an iPhone 5s) and it works great and is very useful.  I would say that I have not been able to get the ""Home/Away Assist"" working.  This would eliminate me getting alerts when I am home by detecting when my cell phone comes and goes.  I did some online research and gave up after seeing that a lot of other people are having the same issue.  Hopefully Nest can get that problem figured out and push a firmware update.  I also get way too many false positives.  Our dog looks like a person to the algorithm.  Car lights and moving shadows are also the bane of this product.  And I do have a few inconsistent wifi connection issues with the camera farthest from my router - but it only pops up every now and then.  So I am happy 8/10 with the product and looking forward to improved detection algorithms in the future.  $200/yr for 3 cameras seems steep.  But I will pay it until a better option comes along. SECOND UPDATE (8 months later):  Still working like a charm.  Wifi connection remain strong, even with my most distant camera.  I'm not using any Wifi extenders.  Sometimes something interferes with the wifi on my most distant camera (who knows what it might be), but it seems to only last a few minutes periodically per every other week.  Recording is rock solid.  I still wish the algorithm was better at filtering out birds and flashes of light and blowing snow, but whatever.  I will be buying one last camera to complete my security system.  Not looking forward to paying another $50/yr for a 4th camera.  But I guess I will until a better more affordable option comes along.  I am slowly building up quite a collection of clips that I am saving as bloopers.  Slipping on the ice.  Falling down the stairs.  Etc.  Good times! THIRD UPDATE (4 YEARS LATER):  Still working.  I have two Nest Outdoor Cams and one old indoor Cam.  They all still work like a champ.  I just bought a 12-LED IR floodlight for my outdoor cam in the back yard.  I don't know why I waited so long.  What a difference!  Now I can actually see what is going on at night.  The built in IR LEDs on the outdoor cams are pretty weak.  I just don't know why it took me so long to realize this.  Also I wish resolution was higher for both day and especially night.  I am starting to look at 2K and 4K cameras and might make the switch once I read some reviews.  I just seems like the quality and clarity of the Nest Cams could be better and maybe they aren't keeping up with the competition.",*** 3rd Update *** (4 years later - Aug 2020)

My only issue is how much cord there is, but it makes sense, not everyone has an outlet installed right where they needed it. I wanted something both my wife and I could use easily. I do have a concern on the camera. It seems a bit too easy to take off the magnet.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Mar 2018,emtiv334,"Neat idea.  Horrible implementation! I bought two of these and installed them on my house.  The first few months, they worked pretty well besides having issues when the sun would get in just the right spot in the sky and it would be hard to see anything on the cameras.  Not because the camera was pointed at the sun, but the light in the yard would just fall exactly right and everything on the camera would just kind of grey out. Fast forward a few months later.  I started getting TONS of alerts a day.  Literally 200+ alerts.  Everything sets these off.  Bugs flying in front of them, a cloud goes across the sky.  The sun comes up, the sun goes down.  A bird chirps in the yard.  A raindrop falls from the sky.  A snowflake.  Literally ANYTHING sets these off. I contacted Nest to complain about this and ask to return the cameras for a refund because I am very dissatisfied with them.  According to Nest, these alerts work off color changes.  Anytime something in the viewing angle of the camera changes color, Nest determines that means there needs to be an alert.  I didn't know that when I bought them, or I would not have bought them.  Like I said, neat idea, but horrible implementation.  Now I'm stuck with $500 worth of security cameras that alert me every time a bug passes gas in the yard.","Neat idea, horrible implementation, and even worse customer support."

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Sep 2016,The K,"So far this is the outdoor camera I've been looking for. I had every intention on buying 3 Hikvision 3 megapixel outdoor cameras since the night vision is so great on that particular camera. My problem was recording and storing video. I'm a normal home owner who just wants a camera installed to watch over my vehicles at night and keep an eye on my front door when I'm not at home. The problem with this kind of set up is I would either have to purchase a DVR for an additional $100-$150 and have the ability to record and store 2 months of footage. Or I'd have to run a server off my PC at all times. Which leads me to the next issue I was planning on dealing with. After purchasing all of this great equipment, getting it installed, spending hours in my attic running cable to the DVR and getting the web server set up, I still have to make the entire system easy enough for my wife to use. With the Nest Outdoor Camera I don't have to worry about that. I pre-ordered the camera figuring I could just return it if I didn't like it. The box came just like my Nest Thermostat and Nest Protect did, well packaged and ready to install. Installation was easier than I thought. I opened my cell phone app and added the camera, scanned the QR code and no more than 10 seconds later had video set up and recording.  My wife's phone updated about 30 seconds later. I mounted the little bracket the magnetized base attaches to, and routed the USB cable into the hole I drilled leading to my attic space. The next part was the worst part of the whole process but this has nothing to do with the system itself. I climbed in my attic (which was currently 120 degrees of the most viscous South Texas air you can find) and made my way to the wire I fished through the hole. I used the supplied wire clips to attach it to the roof rafter (it's low voltage wire so this is kosher) which I then routed to the area of my attic that my home builders were kind enough to install a 120 outlet in. Once I got that situated it was only a matter of plugging the power in and getting my rear out of there before the complimentary installation heat stroke was delivered. That's it...Well, not exactly, I did put some silicone caulking around the hole I drilled. A tip for you self installers out there, pull the cord out 3 or 4 inches and wrap 1 or 2 layers of regular packaging tape around the cable, that way when you seal the hole you won't get the cable all goopy. Video quality is fantastic. It's slightly less clear than the Hikvision during the day, but comparable at night. As a normal home user, this is more than adequate for my household. As great as this thing is, there are a few negatives I'd like to point out. - The App constantly reminds you to upgrade your free trial to the paid version of Nest Aware, it's a bit intrusive - I would have liked the magnetic base to have the ability to route the cable directly through it so none of the cable is exposed, a small gripe - 10 day monitoring is a bit pricey at $15 a month for 2 cameras, 30 day monitoring is out of reach for some home users ($45 a month for 2 cameras) - As far as I know, you're locked in to using the Nest Aware for recording and storage of video - Color options would have been cool, I assume they went with white to keep the unit as cool as possible -The magnet base is awesome. I do worry in the Houston heat that the camera could begin to droop or slowly slide down over time. Overall I don't see a scenario where I'd return these cameras. Well worth the $400 investment. **9/23/16 UPDATE** For my second camera installation, I decided to try the POE route. I purchased an 8 port POE injector and 2 USB POE splitters, set up took about 10 minutes. Works perfectly.",A perfect outdoor camera option for any home user **Works with POE

Now, since Nest was purchased by Google, you will have more cameras added for one price but the service is limited.  If you choose Nest aware subscription, you will pay $60 a year for 30 days of video event history with only recording when something happens.  There are huge gaps in the recordings and if someone comes to your door, within that lost gap recording, you will not know.  If you want 24/7 recording, you will have to choose the the Nest Aware Plus subscription, which will cost you $120 a year.  Once you switch over to Google, there is no switching back.

For e.g:  if you are using wifi range extender with same SID/password as your base Wifi router and in case there is any interruption, then the camera gets confused which router to connect and it disconnects permanently. There are other bugs aswell where the camera recovers only 90% of the times after interruption due to wifi interference in crowded situations.

Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Oct 2016,John Ferguson,"This camera is weather proof, in a plastic-like housing, and uses a magnetic base around which it can be oriented to the angle you require for viewing.  The previous indoor Nest Cams could be adapted for outdoor using a protective housing with a heat sink at the back.  However, I noticed that this attenuates the sound that is picked up.  The outdoor Nest Cam has a louder monitored sound. The USB cable is about 15' and connected to the AC adapter which is intended for outdoor mounting too (has a mounting clip).  The AC side has a 20' cord that is moulded into the PSU (i.e. is not unpluggable like the USB side), of it is is too short, you'll need an extension cord.  There as clips to hold the wires in place, but I used small conduits available from Home Depot to enclose the entire cable. The USB cord at the camera end is also moulded into the body (cannot be unplugged like the original indoor cams). The angle of view is 130 deg wide and the 1080p/720p quality is excellent. You can see vibrant colors and smooth motion and hear what is going on outside. The best features are in the Nest software, which has been updated recently to improve detection of motion, and discerning whether that motion is from a human, or non-human (e.g. vehicle).  You can define activity zones using polygon drawings on your viewed scene to identify where you want to notified of activity. The number of false notifications has been greatly reduced with the updated software.  However, sharp and sudden shadows (from cloud movements) or bright lights turning on at night (from nearby motion sensors) may sometimes be interpreted as motion with false notifications. A Nest Aware subscription is to record video/audio is available for 10-day and 30-day history.  This is useful for his security monitored areas where you may want to retrieve a record of activity.  The software also takes snapshots of activity in a time line, in addition to the the continuous video/audio history.  So, if you get a notification, you can quickly find the time stamp and as you scroll the time line you'l see activity that was snapped. I find this useful to know when the mail has been delivered, as it takes a snapshot of the van in an activity zone.  I can also see when packages are delivered to the front door and retrieve them right away. I highly recommend this camera for outdoor home security and surveillance.  It works on wifi and and has a longer USB+power cord to reach most outdoor sockets.",Great camera for outdoor surveillance
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Apr 2019,Mr Night,"This camera pictures looks really good, including at night.  Easy of setup depends on the availability of outlets in your attic, which for me was a huge pain and next time I would go with ethernet power, but I'm willing to accept that trade off. Where this camera really fails is integration with the app.  First off, if you have an Android phone (like, you know, a few million people), the intercom feature on the cameras does not work.  So much for talking to someone through the camera when they are at the door. Much worse, is that they keep sending constant alerts of movement even when you turn off security because you are working in the yard.  The alarm system has settings for ""away, home and guarding, and off.""  Which makes sense, because at night you want to know if someone is lurking at the door while you are protected. But the cameras only have settings to send alert on ""Always, No Ones Home, Never.""  Given that this system was supposedly made all by one company (a huge selling point in their adds), why wouldn't the cameras have the same settings as the app?  Do the people in different departments not talk to each other? Not to mention that the things barely work if you don't pay a pretty hefty monthly fee.  For iPhone prices, you would expect an iPhone level of planning.","Bad integration with app, dissapointing for the most expensive of systems"

We have the thermostat, doorbell, and outdoor IQ's. All cameras have taken longer and longer to load. I spoke with customer service and they just lie non-stop. They told me no one esle has been having problems. There are numerous forums about  this online. Afterking with two neighbors, I found that they are having the same issues whether at home or out of the house. Their servers are getting worse as the months go by. I am currently researching other home monitoring systems. I would not recommend.",Nest knows they have MAJOR lag issues.
Google Nest Cam Outdoor - Weatherproof Outdoor Camera for Home Security - Surveillance Camera with Night Vision - Control with Your Phone,1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Nov 2017,Happy consumer,"I purchased this camera about 2 months ago for security reasons. It is a two pack and very worth the money I paid. I think the cameras are nice well made and the video quality is good- I usually look at it from my phone so your phone will have a lot to do with this as well. I felt it was easy to hook up and run and as a techniligically impaired person it really is easy to use!  The only real con is the night video is not the best and positioning on my house was a little difficult but again that is my house not the camera. The email alerts are nice but it does pick up passing cars and people who just walk by- this doesn’t bother me as that is what the cameras are for- my opinion only!  If your looking for a camera that is good quality, for home security look no further...",Well worth the money!

Brian Mitchell,"I have many Nest products, and i say this was tough to install, because the plug between the camera and the power source is LARGE.  So I had to drill a larger hole than I expected into the side of my garage.  I had to order a special drill bit from Amazon to do the job.  But once I did that it was all pretty simple, and, just like the other nest products, works very well.","A little tough to install, but nice."
