"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,27 Sep 2018,Papa,"Well, I tried – I really Tried. But it turns out my expectations were way too high. I was mesmerized by the commercials, captivated with visions of my gruff, electronically-brazened voice calling out over the speaker “Hey! Whutter you doin’ on my porch! Put that package down, the police are on their way!” But it doesn’t work that way out here in Suburbia, not in the real world. Oh, I tried, I really tried. I poured through the meek User Guide that came with the kit, graduated to the FAQs on the Ring website, and made so many calls to Ring Tech Support that I cringed each time in expectation that Ring would announce “You’re exceeded your limit!” But of course, they didn’t. They patiently answered my questions, helped me understand about 30-second versus 60-second video clips and the lag or buffering issue and zones and sensitivity. I learned about Device Health and Speed Test and download and upload speeds. I moved my mailbox out of the way of the video doorbell. I bought a new porchlight that didn’t cast its ubiquitous glow onto the doorbell. I climbed into a 110-degre attic, swam through an ocean of blown-in insulation to find and replace a doorbell transformer. Because who among us has the tools or the skills to measure the output voltage of your doorbell wires? BTW, your local hardware store does not stock a doorbell transformer that matches the exact specs of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro, I had to order one online. From a patient cable internet technician, I learned about updating the firmware on my wireless router (“You gotta do this 1, 2 times a year!”). But it was worth it, because now my download and upload speeds are in what Ring calls “the Good Range”. I also purchased and installed the Ring Chime Pro, even though my house is what I would call Small by today’s standards – under1,000 sq. ft. But none of that helped. Even though when I go to Live View and can see all of my yard in vivid color (or stark black-and-white at night) and see every twig movement and hear far-away roosters crow, it still won’t detect and alert me to a person walking up my driveway, until they are actually standing on my porch directly in front of the camera. Oh, it will do it once in a while, maybe twice in a while, but it won’t do it every time, it won’t do it even a majority of the time. The only time it does it 100% is when the person is actually standing on my porch. I am confident that an intruder could roam my yard at will, do as they will to the cars in my driveway, as long as they don’t climb onto my porch. Well, I can go to Live View and watch every movement, but the Ring Video Doorbell Pro will NOT detect and alert me. And that myth about me actually speaking to the person on the porch? Well, the ghost of that ship has done sailed, honey, far out into the sunset and ne’er to return. Only the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Home Improvement Salesmen are willing to stay on my porch after they have rung the doorbell, waiting while it takes 10-15 seconds for the alert to hit my phone, and then the 2-5 minutes it takes for the video to become available for me to view. So no, my expectations were not met. So, I will keep the new porch light, my wife likes it better than the old one. And I should have moved that mailbox long ago, it is much easier to empty in its new location. And I’ll keep the new doorbell transformer, it is a sturdy, handsome fellow even though it is buried beneath an AC return duct and 16 inches of powder insulation. But my old doorbell is going back on my porch, and this Ring Video Doorbell Pro is going back to Amazon. It is too unreliable, and does not, can not, WILL NOT work as advertised.","I tried, I really tried"
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2017,JenDu,When I first got the device in July we immediately installed the product. Install went great and was super easy. For the first month the product worked great. We were super happy with it and even purchased the extra service through them to save our videos for longer. Shortly after that we started getting constant motion detection alerts. Sometimes it was something blowing by but more frequently it was simply the camera shifting from night vision to day vision for no apparent reason triggering a motion detection alert. Then for whatever reason in the end of September it simply quit working. I have tried to contact the company but was told that I needed to verify the make and model of my chimes (only have make no model on them). They said there was nothing they could do. Now I am stuck with a doorbell that doesn't work and service I can't use because they couldn't verify the chime compatibility. Nowhere in the installation instructions was their anything about a chime compatibility and I am not sure that has anything to do with why it quit working. Save your money and don't buy anything from a company who doesn't stand behind their product.,Piece of junk
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2018,Bill Hatch,"This works well. The install is easy. I have one very major complaint. The blurb on Amazon does not explain that you have to pay for a cloud subscription to store and retrieve the short videos of motion events. The promotional material and install instructions are structured such that you do not catch this ¨gotcha"" until the unit is installed and you use it for a day or 2. There is no provision to store these videos locally on your own computer. I am giving this just one star because they are not up front about the need for a paid subscription and the lack of a local event video storage option.",Looks great but hidden cost ¨gotcha¨.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,22 Feb 2017,HTS,"[October 2018 Update] Revisiting my review once again, making it 4 stars.  My doorbell would randomly die after someone pressed it, rendering it useless until I reset the power.  I decided to reach out to Ring and after a very brief conversation they offered to send me a replacement device right away.  Once I received it, I quickly noticed that it was the same in the front but completely different hardware in the back.  I swapped out the old (sent it back to Ring), installed and setup the new (very easy to do by yourself), and for the past month+ it has been working very well.  None of the issues I had been experiencing with the original unit have since resurfaced with this new unit. I'm glad I decided to reach out to Ring for support on this and was very appreciative of the support I incurred including the replacement device. [JUNE 2018 UPDATE] Well, my Ring Doorbell Pro died this week.  It had gone offline about 3 months ago... then again about a month ago... and now it's completely dead.  Previously I would go through the reset / setup procedure and it would come back online.  Now there's no lights, etc.  Apparently it's a ""known issue"" according to Ring.  Read the numerous reviews here. I understand electronics are not necessarily meant to last forever, but a $250 weather sealed doorbell that sits in a sheltered environment should last much longer than 2 years.  In addition, the fact that Ring claims it's a ""known issue"" means that they are aware of a design flaw.  The flaw could be hardware or software, but a flaw means it's their fault. However, since they only provide a 1 year warranty, I suppose that makes it my fault..  Not a single person who's reviewed this issue and had any luck with support on this issue. Support did call me back to advise me to disconnect and reconnect the ring pro to see if that would work. Others who have tried this indicate that it's just a matter of time before it will fail again though. I had to try 3 times before it properly reset. I'm not going to hold my breath.  Buyer beware - if you have money to burn, it's a fantastic device while it is working.  I for one will do my research and see if there's a better alternative available while I wait to see if this one dies. [ORIGINAL REVIEW] One day while I was out running an errand my ring app on my phone notified me that someone was ringing the doorbell.  I don't always answer, but decided to.  The young man at my door seemed a bit 'off' and asked for ""Nick"".  There's no one named Nick on my street... or in the small area where I live.  I told him he had the wrong house and the guy left.  Few minutes later I could not shake that something was off, so I reviewed the entire video footage - Ring captures motion so I was able to see what he did prior to ringing the doorbell.  This guy was wearing a hoodie so he covered his hands, looked through my front door window for a good 5+ seconds, then started to check the door to see if perhaps it was open, before deciding to ring the doorbell... all with his hands covered.  It was 70 degrees out.  Once I answered, he seemed shocked and he quickly pulled up his hood. I contacted the police and they filed a report.  I shared my Ring video with them and they said it was the cleanest video they had seen in some time.  Less than two weeks later a detective called me to let me know that the guy who came to my door was indeed looking to burglarize my home.  He had been arrested and put in jail for other area burglaries.  The detective said that had I not answered the doorbell, my home would most certainly have been broken into that day. I've had the ring doorbell since September 2016 and this was the first and only time something odd/suspicious was captured and, to say the least, it works!!! Now onto some of the issues I've had: 1.  Ring initially was recording very poorly and sometimes would not capture video properly if at all.  I installed a high end wifi extender nearby and problems went away.  Previously my wifi signal strength was about 40% at the doorbell location.  Now it's close to 100%. 2.  My Ring doorbell went offline and it took me who knows how long to realize it.  The app has a health monitor - RING why are you not telling me that you're offline???  Why do I need to discover it for myself????  Getting it back online was a bit of a hassle also. 3.  Angle.  I now see some angled plates for sale but would have liked to have had those when I installed it.  It's perpendicular to my door, which means I am not capturing as much motion as I would like.  Someone needs to be on my porch before it starts capturing motion.  With an angled plate, I could catch them coming up my walkway instead, which is more useful. 4.  Costs $30/year to maintain recordings.  If I install additional devices, it's an additional $30 per device.  Would have liked to get a price break. Overall, great product.  Not sure I've seen a better one on the market.  As with any tech, there are always likely to be issues somewhere.  Overall, I think this is a good product and well worth the peace of mind.",Ring paid for itself in less than 6 months!!!  [UPDATED October 2018]
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Mar 2017,Vance,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought this doorbell since I had gotten tired of finding beer botttles and bags of weed (I kid you not) on my front lawn.  And the fact that I installed tint on my front door (since it's made of glass and I didn't have privacy) and couldn't see who was coming to the door anymore.  And to ensure receipt of Amazon's finest.  And catch package thieves. PROS: I'm so glad I didn't buy Amazon's doorbell installation kit.  Why? Because the tutorial setup was broken down Barney style and it was so simple and easy to use.  I was able to easily determine my doorbell was a mechanical one, and how to find the required voltage for the Ring doorbell to run smoothly. It was so simple to install the additional wiring to the bell, and then attach the Ring device where the doorbell is supposed to be.  They have all the tools needed included in the kit.  BY THE WAY, YOU CAN PULL OUT THE PHILIPS SCREW AND TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN SO YOU CAN SCREW IN THE SECURITY SCREW FOR THE RING DEVICE.  I was looking all over the place for a tool to screw it in, and just when I was about to run to the local hardware store, I was messing with the screw and realized it had another end. Face palm. The video was running in 780p (when it worked properly) and it was fantastic to adjust the motion settings and set zones so that not every passing car or falling leaves would trigger an alert/recording event. The Cons My router modem is about 5 ft away from the door so I didn't see any reason to go buy the Wi Fi extender but sometimes the video playback would have green flashing across the screen or become very choppy. Furthermore, on some rare occasions, there seems to be some videos that I can't open and play at all. The talk interface seems to be kind of hushed as well, my visitors needed me to almost yell to make out what I am saying, which is hard on a pretty busy street. Other than that, I think this is a very solid security camera/doorbell and I'd definitely recommend it over the Sky Doorbell. Edit 1/17/18: Over time, I have not experienced the green screen for the camera anymore.  In fact, I was able to capture some pretty good quality shots of the porch pirate stealing our packages over Christmas (see vattched video). Sometimes the mic would still seem muffled during two way, and my only other complaint is that it still seems to load up slow when I’m answering a door bell.  So I would just grab a baseball bat and open the door rather than wait for it to load up the camera.",Reliable security camera...just sometimes a tad slow
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Jan 2017,BobbeeDee,"I have had a very disappointing experience with my Ring Video Doorbell Pro.  When it was installed, I had some customer service issues which were fixed quickly. Then after a few days, the unit continually dropped it's signal and didn't work.  I would reboot it, as instructed and repeatedly within 24 hours I would lose the signal again.  Finally, the unit lost power completely.  Every time I called their customer service, they ran me through the same circus of reboots, despite the fact I told them the battery was drained and although the unit was connected to power, it was not working.  I've made 5 calls to their customer service department with long waits on hold and the same scripted 'fix' that has not worked.  At this point, I will be returning the doorbell & stick up cam to Amazon for a refund of a defective product that Ring does seem to want to support.","Great idea, but very dissapointing customer service."
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,30 Jun 2017,RedJ,"UPDATE: 2017-08-05 (Removed a star for additional horrendous customer service run-around) Kandyce C. from responded in comments below and promised to get me quick resolution to my problems. The only follow-up contact I received from a Ring ""Neighbor Advocate"" was an auto-generated email that a ticket had been created. It's now evident that Ring promises functionality they can't deliver, despite charging $3/mo, and doesn't back their products up. Additionally, I've started experiencing a new crop of problems such as the Ring apps auto-answering notifications by opening the live view and some devices completely stopped getting notifications altogether. Problems abound even after a doorbell reset. ORIGINAL REVIEW: In principle, the Ring Doorbell is a great upgrade to traditional doorbells.  It's advertising promises the ability to pre-screen visitors and even communicate to them when you aren’t at home.  However, real-world results vary wildly and it's so glitchy that you'll regularly find it impossible to replicate their commercials. Often, the phone notifications arrive well after the doorbell rings or motion is detected, or the app refuses to initiate an active connection to the doorbell camera for so long the person has already left before video starts up.  WiFi strength on my Ring is good, and the response time seems to be quite different from one device to another and the location of the viewing device. Another annoyance is their Windows app is incredibly unstable and will get into a state where it will crash on open 100% of the time on one of my PCs.  If I uninstall and reinstall the app, it will work again for a short time and then go back to crashing. Ring customer service is not very helpful in diagnosing and fixing problems (probably because the majority are caused by something on their end) and they do not follow through with promised follow-up. Pros: Camera has wide view angle. Motion detection is configurable and relatively few false positives (except porch lights on/off). Reasonably attractive Easy setup Cons: Long delays between event and notification App very slow to connect to Live View Windows App refuses to open Unresponsive customer service",Doesn't work as advertised.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jul 2016,K. Carriere,"I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro for just under 2 weeks.  Last week we were on vacation so I figured it was the perfect time to buy and test it out within the 30 day trial period.  I’ll split this review into 3 bits.  First impressions, Install, and Operational Use. 1) First Impressions.  We have a security system installed but didn’t go with their camera system because it was CCTV and I wanted something with an internet connection or way to access it from my phone.  While making small talk with the security system guy, I mentioned the Ring to him.  He was super excited to get out his phone and show me that he has one.  He said he couldn’t buy any camera with nearly that quality at that price even with his discounts.  He spoke so highly of it I was sure that’s what I wanted to get.  We want to do a whole system with cameras on the back of the house, but we purchased the Ring Pro to see how we liked it before we commit to buying everything. I went with the Ring Pro over the Original Ring because I was going to be wiring it in place anyway.  I also like the slender profile and the possibility to use wireless 5.0 in the future if I desire. Plus I live on a very busy road and wanted the advanced motion detection zones on the pro.  Since I did my research, I was aware that the Ring Pro has a 160 degree field of view compared to the 180 degree view of the original.  For this reason, I purchased fiberglass shims to angle it more towards my large 6 foot doors when I installed it. I talked with Ring customer service and asked if there was any advantage to ordering through them versus Amazon and they said there were none, so I went with Amazon for my Prime shipping and additional protections of ordering through Amazon. 2) Install.  I was a bit intimidated with the install as I’ve never wired anything up before and our house is new construction.  But the YouTube video and pamphlets made it pretty clear to follow.  They also emphasize that you can call them at any point for assistance.  I had also been told by the security system guy that install was super easy and I could do it myself (he’s also the one who gave me the tip about the fiberglass shims).  He also gave me an extra tidbit for those of us with stone or brick exteriors: drill into the grout lines – they drill easy; stone does not. I started with the extra power pack that gets installed inside and connected to your door chime.  It was the more complex part of the installation and involved a very tall ladder but it went well.  I was impressed that the ring doorbell came with everything you need to install it – including the drill bit AND a screw driver. It even has extra bits you MIGHT need (like extensions wires and extra screws).  I also really appreciated how everything was in separate baggies for which part of the install you were doing and was very well labeled (extras were labeled as extras, pro kit wires in one bag, doorbell wires and screws in another).  I was unable to fit the power kit inside my chime housing but it doesn’t look bad attached to the wall just outside the chime housing (see picture).  It’s just a bit larger than a matchbox. Installing the actual ring was even easier.  I was able to drill into grout lines between stones so I had that going for me.  The hook up was super easy, two wires from the house connect to the two connectors on the Ring – doesn’t even matter which is which.  Nice and easy. I will have to work out something to cover the shimmed side, but I’ll work something out. Set up was easy and step-by-step.  I was concerned when it was downloading the new firmware and updates and then rebooted because the light was off for (what felt like) a long time (maybe 5 minutes).  But it all went flawlessly. 3)  Operational Use.  I like being able to set up polygons for the motion detection zones.  I was able to easily mark my drive way, flowerbeds and porch.  I’ve never had a problem with the busy traffic from the road (something the security guy mentioned was a problem with his original Ring).  There are two problems they need to work out:  You will get a motion detect when the night vision clicks on in the evening and when it clicks off in the morning.  Expect that. Also, this is not a miracle product.  It will only work as well as your internet connection.  That means a little lag if you’re on a cable connection at peak times.  There are a few times I’ve had the video come up in laggy and weirdly pixilated forms that took a second to work out.  I’ve also noticed our voice connection is VERY quiet.  As in, the person at the door can barely hear the person on the phone, so I consider that feature a bit useless.  We managed to scare our cat sitter from the other side of the country and greet my mom, but I wouldn’t rely on it for communicating with people often.  We managed to talk to our lawn service but we had to yell into the phone and they had to ask us to repeat ourselves a few times.  Also we live on such a busy road that there is a lot of noise which makes the video sound very choppy. So again, I just consider this feature a novelty and not something to rely on. I mentioned a cat sitter.  It was kind of awesome to be able to see that she came by every day.  In fact, the first day she didn’t come by until 11:00pm and I worriedly texted her to see if she was going to come.  Every other day I took solace in knowing that she had already stopped by without having to text her or fear her shed forget.  I was able to see when the lawn service came by and did their thing.  I was able to see when packages were delivered and when my mom brought the nephews up to use the pool.  I also got to scare the crap out of our friend as they were leaving our empty house and I wished them goodnight.  That was worth some money right there.  I even caught a few people using my driveway to turn around. My favorite bit was the unexpected bonus video of my husband going outside to inspect my work.  I’m keeping that one. It catches us leaving for work every day and coming home.  It catches me when I go to fill the bird feeders.  I’ve not had it miss any movement that I’m aware of.  If you have motion sensors on, expect more notifications than you think you will get.  As said, you’ll get the two from nightfall and sunrise.  Plus I get two from me departing for work and my husband departing plus 2 more for each of us coming home.  Add on more for checking the mail and anything you may do in the yard.  This is where not being limited on storage size is handy.  The cloud storage is $30 per year and it keeps videos for 6 months.  It doesn’t say anything about size so having these extra videos doesn’t bother me.  I find the video quality to be great and I can easily identify who is at the door night and day. I also like that it came with a decal showing that the house is monitored.  I placed this prominently in my front window along with our security monitoring service decal.  Avoiding bad guys is worth more than catching them. I feel like this was a great purchase.  The price is excellent.  I love being able to access it anytime from my phone.  I love knowing what is going on at my house even when I’m on vacation.  I love the security aspect both in surveillance and as a deterrent.  It looks sharp (see photo).  It’s also a lot of fun.  I’ve shown it off to many friends and coworkers, at least one of which decided to get one themselves. 4) Summary.  CONS: Only as good as your internet connection.  Sunrise and sunset motion detects.  Sound quality is useless in my experience.  PROS:  Access from anywhere, anytime.  Surveillance and deterrent.  Motion zones let you cut out areas you don’t care to monitor (neighbors yard, roads, ect).  Great price. As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy.  I deducted 1 star because they heavily play up the speaker aspect and that seems worthless in my experience with it.  I’m insanely happy with the purchase over all.  In the future I will probably buy a chime and a stick-up cam to go along with it. UPDATE:  1 Year-On.  We have had the Ring Pro for One full year now.  I've also added two of the chime accessories.  I'm just as happy with it now as I was when I wrote this review.  We tried to trouble shoot the sound a few times and still have had no luck with it.  I think my unit might just be defective in that area.  However I still think if this was advertised as a camera only, it would be 100% worth the price and 5 stars.  I did have someone point out the sticker over the ring might be the cause of our sound problem, removing it didn't help. Our indoor chime had the oddity of only ringing the first chime (rather than a series) after installation.  As our indoor chime was never loud enough anyway, we added two of the chime plug in accessories without even trying to trouble shoot.  We added one chime downstairs and one in our master bedroom.  We've been super happy with them as well. UPDATE: 3.5 years later.  Still working. It stopped working for a while so I called customer service before I purchased a new one to make sure it wasn’t some power issue.  They sent me (for free) the version 2.0 power kit and the chime bypass kit.  Turned out the chime bypass kit fixed it.  I didn’t need the indoor mechanical chime anyway as I have two Ring Chime devices.  I used it this morning to tell the pest control guy the gate code without getting out of bed.  It’s been up 4 summers now. I still look at it every week to see what animals were creeping in my yard at night.  Love the raccoons that come hang out on my porch some nights. If this thing died tomorrow, I’d replace it with the exact same model, no regrets.","As a camera only, I would give this 5+ stars, easy."

Friends recommended it and didn't have any issue. Well the disappointment came. Power to the unit was good, connection was good and tested on 2 separate routers. Issues have been can't connect to doorbell for live feed, grainy video and shadowing when it occasionally worked. When attempting to view events it was a black screen, also, when there was a even that would be viewable it was just a still image with sound playing in the background. I trusted that their tech support could get it working. Had their level 2 tech support change settijngs around in the router, connect to 2.4 or 5gz channels with both routers. The issues continued. They sent a free chime pro, which is their wireless extender to see if it would help. It actually made the connection worse and the router is 1 foot from the doorbell.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jul 2018,Jason,I've had this installed for a few weeks now.  My main reason for writing the review is to save some people the frustration of trying to figure out why the ring will not trigger your internal chime.  This is easy to install if you have an existing wired door bell.  It is easy to set up.  The video quality is good if you have a very strong wifi connection but even then can still be choppy at times when on live view and the two way audio lags and can be choppy.  Overall though it work well though.  My main issue was the the ring was intermittently triggering the internal chime.  I couldn't figure out why.  I reinstalled it twice and reset it a few times.  It was driving me crazy.  It would ring at night but not during the afternoon.  My doorbell gets blazing sun in the afternoon.  Turns out that there is some sort of safety mechanism that shuts down the internal chime when it gets to hot.  I wish I would have known this before I spent an extra hour or two trouble shooting it.  I can't imagine that my door is the only one that gets sun.  If this is a large issue the doorbell should ship with the plug in chime.,Will not trigger internal chime when hot.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Sep 2018,Mitchell,"Initially when I installed my Ring Pro just under a year ago, the service was great. Whenever someone rang the bell I could load the camera and talk to the person at the door. These days however it's impossible. Whenever the bell is rung, the video tries to load but it just sits and tells me it's having issues connecting to Ring. This occurs 100% of the time now and it clears up after a minute or two but after the person has left. When there's nobody at the door, I can load the live video very quickly and without issues. This tells me that that Ring network can't handle the two-way video/audio communication. It grew too fast and without adequate investment in their infrastructure. Hopefully they fix it in the future, but this door bell no longer provides the service that it used to and I cannot recommend it.",Unable to handle the growth
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2018,Gary T,"Would be great if it worked reliably - but it didn't.  Doorbell was w/in 20 ft of our router, and had a strong signal - but twice it went ""off-line"" and the help articles had me go and take the cover off to reset it.  This worked - but to happen twice within 2 weeks was way too often.  The app was hit/miss on whether or not it alerted me, which was the deal breaker.  Someone rang the doorbell while we weren't home, and my phone never notified me.  Again - did their troubleshooting and after completely removing and reinstalling the app - it worked . . . a few times.  Wound up returning it before the 30 days because for this kind of money - it needs to work. We used Ring's recommended installation service, who did a good job (and explained the very narrow electrical requirements, which we did have to get a new transformer installed just to get it to work the first time).  And when it worked - I liked it.  But we mainly wanted to know when someone dropped off a package (which I could check the app, and it saved me a trip to the front door - not enough of a benefit by itself), or have the ability to answer the doorbell when we weren't home.  I love the idea/concept, but didn't work for us.",Unreliable
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2018,Paul Keating,"Door bell looks nice, and it goes to your phone.  However, when it rings on your phone, the app opens up and then freezes.  It basically locks you out of speaking / seeing who is at your door , and when you finally get the thing working....well no one sticks around when they ring the bell and no one answers for a few minutes. I have reached out to customer service.  All my other electronics function just fine on my wireless.  It is out of their warranty period (less than 1 year)  I asked for my money back and they refuse.  I would like to get another brand, so i am probably going to have to eat the 200.00 i spent on this, and hope this review has some clout with other buyers. Their customer service is friendly and responsive, but they will do anything they can to avoid refunding your money.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Jul 2019,R. Dibb,"I have had this since July 2018. The device works well, WHEN IT'S WORKING. I spend a considerable amount of time reconfiguring it because it so frequently doesn't work. The first thing you might say is I have bad WiFi. Not true. I have an expensive NetGear Orbi MESH system. Signal strength when I stand next to the Ring, on any device which shows accurate WiFi signal strength, is full bars. I can set the Router 10' from the Ring doorbell and it will see the WiFi and connect, then disconnect more than a few times in the next 24 hours. It is very finicky about WifI, but there doesn't seem to be any solution. I'm sure there is some other similar device out there, but I haven't found it yet. I went back to a simple, battery powered doorbell with a chime in the house.

The first device connected to the network; although, it was defective since it had no audio, I returned it and received a replacement.  The second one never connected to the network. After two full weekends with two separate defective Ring doorbells, I finally gave up.  Not due to lack of technical knowledge, but 100% because of defective products.

Stanwick,"We've had ours for a month and it keeps failing:  no video, no audio, no motion detection.  Wi-Fi works because pushing the button will ring our phones, the remote chime, and our house chime through the hardwiring.  Seems to fail on hot afternoons.  Could it be caused by hot weather?  Who knows?  Ring customer support was responsive in the beginning, but I think they've written us off now.  I've asked for a replacement unit and they are dead silent now. Was an OK product when it worked, although there are things I don't like about the iPhone app: While reviewing videos, it should show the date/time of the video on that screen. While reviewing videos why do the control buttons backwards/forwards/pause/delete disappear?  Just leave them displaying. While reviewing videos why does the delete button change positions, from left side to right side?  This seems to depend upon whether the video was viewed previously. Very disappointing! UPDATE:  Keeps failing and seems to be completely dead now.  Previously I could bring it back to life by shutting off the breaker, leaving it off for 10 seconds, power back up, then go out and hit the configuration button, wait for it to do all its jibber-jabber and then hit the button again.  Obviously, there's no way to reset it while away from home. ABSOLUTELY THE MOST UNRELIABLE PIECE OF ELECTRONICS GEAR I'VE EVER PURCHASED!  EVER!",Keeps failing!
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Aug 2018,William Barrett,"Update: after a year I've dropped my rating to zero and now need to throw out my $1k investment. Live connection so seldom works and the recorded scenes always start too late after the event.  Now a backyard is stuck on infrared during the day.  Here I am blind away from home.  PATHETIC PRODUCT  I now think these are actually worse than Nest. I'm gonna have to build a soblution. Note that maybe part of the problem is that it uses the way overloaded 2.4mhz wifi band? I got a ring booster, no change. I watched roku further away from my AP than the camera.  Not wifi, just junk. I wanted to like this as I found Nest to be awkward to install and use. The Ring Doorbell installed rather easily. The angled adapters don't share the same colors as the doorbell skins (my doorbell is on a side wall, so i need to angle it out to see down the walkway). I like the motion area setup. You've got digital fences to move around to direct where to trigger on motion (walkway) and where not (street). That is a great idea and works well! (not sure why they don't retrofit this feature onto the spotlight cameras, but those are another disappointment), The app response is really spotty and intermittent.  The idea is that it notifies you when someone is near the door - such as a postman dropping off a package - or a drone I suppose. You should be able to click the notification and see the action. Well - it doesn't always give you a timeline so you may or may not be able to pan back to the beginning of the motion event - - well, the Postman drops and runs so you see nothing by the time you can react. Then it should show up in the event history, and an entry appears! However, the link doesn't work for 5 to 10 minutes - presumably a delay in their cloud. So - you go check the front IRL. Just happened to me again, thus the annoyed sounding review. So - I replaced my Nest cameras with this (and the spotlights) - how'd that work out? - The cloud service is a little cheaper than Nest, especially if you have a bunch of their cameras. - The playback is a bit smoother and the random access works more cleanly than Nest - Nest has a clearer picture, and doesn't have the fisheye effect (which isn't that bad once you get used to it) - The ability to be notified and respond quickly are pretty iffy for both - Ring is not bad when the doorbell is hit but falls down as described above on motion.  Nest reacts faster to motion and allows you to quickly pan back in time (although it's a sloppy process). - the Battery operated floodlight cameras are great to install! - the Nest is wall powered and they put a goofy fat plug on the end so you need to drill a huge hole to get this tiny little wire through the wall. Oh - I use Android and my wife uses iPhone.  About the same experience, iPhone might be a little zippier. So - I dunno - how hard can this stuff be??  There must be a good system out there?","Almost good, Not Even"
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jun 2018,Amazon Customer,"First, if you want a ring doorbell, don't buy it.  Just find a house with it, put on something to obscure your face and pull it out of the wall.  It is only held in with screws and inserts.  Heck, you could even take the time to unscrew it since there is nothing to stop you from doing that but a removable cover that is held on with a screw.  The factory reset is a large button on the side. Second, their help support is non-existent.  10min on hold after the automated menu and no-one picked up. Third, you CAN'T change the account e-mail after you set it up.  Their website has someone asking this question but it redirects you to the custormer support line.  No-one picks up. Fourth, it doesn't work with chimes that require a diode at the doorbell. Fifth, lag.  Seriously.  I have someone ring the doorbell, we open the door.  They come in.  Then my phone lets me know someone is at the door.  About a minute later, the video of the people at the door loads up. Sixth, they constantly want your credit card information.  If you open the app, you get a request for it.  How does a $200 doorbell need a protection plan?  For that price it should be warrantied.",Shop around before you buy

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Dec 2017,Sean Derrick,"There are many defective units. Amazon is aware and investigating. Avoid buying this product until Ring fixes it or Amazon pulls the bad units. Details below: During the install the unit didn't power on. The unit also came with a stripped safety screw. So quality control out of the box is bad. My initial call to Ring's tech support had me talk to a very condescending gentleman who had me troubleshoot the instruction book. After confirming, with multiple pictures, that the unit was wired correctly I pulled out my electrical multimeter and confirmed that the unit was receiving 20VAC, which it requires. They told me to ""let it charge"" for an hour or so. After several hours it still did t power on. Ring had me exchange the unit hinting that either my mechanical door chimed is not compatible or the unit is defective. I received my second unit and it also did not power on. After leaving hooked up ""to charge"" for two day I called support.  Again after running it by their tech support they acknowledge that despite their literature saying that ""All mechanical chimes are supported"" many are not. So I ran a test and installed the unit to my friends house. Again my friends doorbell supplied 20VAC to the unit, but it did not power on. I then bought an after market power kit from Ohmkat. The kit is designed to power a ring pro without an existing doorbell. Again the power supply provides 20vAC but did not power on. I then triple checked the unit by buying a 24VAC transformer and replacing my current chimes transformer. Again the unit did not power on despite receiving 24VAC at the unit. My last call with tech support they were going to mail me the Power Cable. However there has been SUCH HIGH demand for this fix kits that they are out of stock and back ordered. I figured I'd give it one more try because I want this product to work. I exchanged the unit again through Amazon. Since I had already exchanged the unit I had to talk to some at Amazon to get approval for the third exchange. Amazons customer service said that there was an open investigation due to the exchanges. They did not confirm but heavily hinted that this is a common problem. I received my third unit today. I haven't hooked it up to my house but I hooked it up to the Ohmkat power kit. After two hours it had not powered on. I had given up and was writing this update and to my surprise it powered on.  Tomorrow I'll install it to my doorbell. I'll add to the review further if the install to my house works and if I keep it in the long run. But after reading multiple accounts of the same problem, needing two exchanges, trying two houses, and after market power supply, and both ring and Amazon saying there are issue....I heavily suggest you hold off buying until a fix or new model is released.",Defect issues are common.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Aug 2017,Andrew T.,"My overall experience with the Ring Pro after about a month has been frustrating to say the least.  I am still hoping to wring as much potential out of the thing, but dealing with customer support after the initial 30 day return policy expires is a little bit disheartening. I was initially sold on how the Ring Pro was advertised to work with your existing doorbell wiring and you did not need to purchase anything new.  I had read some reviews that indicated they experienced some trouble getting the Ring Pro to work, but decided to plunge in and see what would happen.  After installing the wiring bypass thingy with the doorbell chime and then installing the Ring Pro at the front door, I could get the white ring to come up and power on, but was unable to get it to broadcast a wi-fi signal.  After some research online, I noted that this usually indicates a power issue and one suggestion was to get the Ring Pro Power Cable that would bypass your doorbell chime altogether and ensure the Pro received enough power. Received the cable from Ring free of charge and installed the cable, yet the Ring Pro refused to broadcast a signal still.  Further research suggested replacing the doorbell transformer.  After a trip to the local hardware store and installing a brand new 16v transformer, I still experienced the same issue.  I decided at that point the unit was defective and requested a new one.  I was still within the 30 day refund window and so far had experienced quick and helpful response from Ring. Received the new unit and installed it and success!  The Ring Pro powered on and it broadcasted a wi-fi signal.  Initially I connected it to the 5Ghz network of my wi-fi router but the signal was intermittent and had trouble keeping a consistent connection (the distance between the Ring Pro and the router is about 30 feet at most, but has to travel through a brick wall).  So using the 2.4Ghz network, the signal was more consistent, but the quality didn’t seem good, although, the Ring app indicated that I only needed a 1Mbps up and down connection for it to work properly, which I had.  When I say the quality is poor, the video I see is a pixelated mess, including stuttering and lost frames.  So if someone broke into my house through the front door, I would be hard pressed trying to identify whether it was sasquatch, the stay puft marshmallow man or a real human being. After complaining to the Ring folks about the quality, I was told that there appeared to be signal interference causing the poor quality.  I was then offered the Ring Pro Chime that might be able to improve the signal between the router and the Ring Pro.  I accepted, which they sent free of charge (a nice touch).  After successfully installing that and connecting it to the Ring Pro, the quality of the video has not improved. I contacted customer support again to see what over steps can be taken to improve the quality and I was told to send them a video file so they can analyze and get back to me.  I have yet to receive a response back after a week later and after several follow-ups.  Note that I am now outside of the 30 day return policy and it seems like customer support has gone dark considering I can no longer return the thing. I will update this review as needed/necessary if I manage to get anywhere. Update 8-15-17: as others have noted in their reviews here, after posting a bad review, folks from Ring will contact you to see how they can improve your experience.  I was assigned to someone on their ""neighborhood"" team and was able to schedule a call with her to walk through the issues I was experiencing and attempting some troubleshooting steps.  We eventually got on a three way call with L2 support and they further provided steps on how to improve the signal between the router and the chime pro, mainly in putting the Ring on a DMZ in the router settings.  After almost a 2 hour call, the stuttering effect is mostly gone, but the pixelation is still mostly there, but at least I can better identify the person at the door.  I'm afraid to walk through any further troubleshooting steps as I really don't have another 2 hours to waste being on the phone, to maybe get a small bump in quality.  Ultimately I feel like the product should work right out of the box and having to tweak things incessantly to get marginal improvements is more frustrating than anything.  I had considered getting the Ring Floodlight, but after all this trouble, most likely not.  Important note though, after initially getting emails from Ring without any issues, after a month, my spam filter started junking their emails, mostly from the neighborhood specialist.  So if you end up not getting a timely response, check your junk folder. Update 2018 - at the beginning of the year, I went the route of cord cutting (got rid of traditional cable TV) and got a streaming service.  As part of that switch, I invested in a much better wifi router as before I was using the Verizon FiOS router which was ok, but the 5ghz band sucked.  After that switch, the ring video quality is much much better and does not stutter and pixelate like it did.  I am not changing my rating however since customer service would not confirm if my Verizon router was the culprit with all my video quality issues (I asked several of the customer support folks the same direct question and each one pointedly ignored it).  Why?  My guess is that they dont want to acknowledge that most folks need a quality router in order to get the best video from the Ring.  Because if they did that, they are saying you not only need to put up big bucks for the Ring, but also for an expensive router, which I think would turn off some folks.",Frustrating

Here's my email back too TELease trying to return. The Ring Pro won't connect with my phone due to it apparently needing an internet connection with at least 2mb upload speed which I only found out after installing and getting in touch with Ring troubleshooting.  'Works with any internet connection' it's a bit of a stretch, specifications should have been clearly written out in your Amazon item description.  Requiring a subscription to view video after the fact should have also been clear in that item description instead of using the word 'optional'. In my opinion the item description was more marketing and misleading than helpful (in hindsight of course). I can get everything back into the packaging except the single use write connectors that Ring uses instead of write nuts.  Nothing is damaged and it seems to work fine except the lack of video which was my primary decision for purchasing. _______________ After several back and forth emails to TELeasy, I'm getting charged return shipping and a 15% restocking fee for an item that didn't have easily accessible specs and detailed requirements.

About every other day, the Ring Pro turns completely off.  In order to get it back on, I must remove the cover and press the reset button. I ordered this doorbell so that I could keep an eye on the house while I’m away. But most of the time, the Ring is offline and must be reset in-person. Customer service simply wants to focus on the internet speed of my device, asking me to run speed test after speed test in different locations. It’s clearly a faulty product and not an internet speed issue. I've been using the ring for about 4 weeks now, and I love it.  It's great being able to keep an eye on my house (and any packages) when I'm away.  Since I got the ring setup and activated, I've had no problems - it's been working perfectly.

It's fairly simple to install and an awesome toy to have for peace of mind. ************* Installation went well and the product worked fine for a day.  24 hours later, the doorbell no longer worked, the video only shows a black screen. I tried contacting customer support, but the rep insisted on me running tests to verify that my internet speed and wifi signal to the doorbell were adequate, trying different internet sources, reviewing my installation process (everything was setup correctly).  The tech was unable to help with any worthwhile troubleshooting or customer service.  Finally a supervisor stepped in and fixed the ""problem on their end.""

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 May 2017,Jack Sutherland,"Don't be fooled by all of their misleading ads about how easy installation is. Sure if your doorbell transformer provides exactly the amount of power Ring Pro requires then it would be easy. But what Ring's tech team taught me (after the fact) is that most transformer (like mine) do not! So odds are, not only will you replace your doorbell, you'll also have to replace your transformer. And if your chime unit doesn't support the upgraded transformer (again odds are it won't, because it was installed with the one you're replacing), you'll have to replace it to. What should have taken 30 minutes took me all day, multiple trips to the hardware store, and eventually help from an electrician. And I live in a 4 year old modern home... Not something older that warrants upgrades. Here's the problem... Most mechanical doorbells like mine, have 10VA transformers. I followed the installation instructions perfectly. But my Ring Pro wouldnt power on. So I called support, and a Ring Pro tech told me it requires at least 16VA, and my transformer wasn't providing enough power, and I should replace mine with a 30VA ""just to be safe"" (that dumb comment alone made me doubtful). But I followed orders, upgraded the transformer. A neighbor electrician verified that the doorbell was receiving 30 volts. But still Ring Pro wouldn't power on. So I called back, and another Ring Pro tech told me 30 was too much. I explained I got 30 because the first tech said to, and he suddenly changed his opinion, and said the problem was I needed to replace my chime to match 30 as well. At this point I had wasted a day and was fed up. I was getting nowhere, and wasn't about to upgrade more components in my house. So I told them to just replace it with the older model (because it requires less power). But they told me they didn't want to replace products purchased from Amazon. I guess after all I went through, that would be too easy. Lesson learned... Nothing about this is ""easy"" no matter how many times they print it on the box!",The odds are this will not work

I couldn't see a live video of who rang my doorbell in the first 30 days, but I was able to see the video that recorded them in the Cloud Video Recording.  Now that the 30 days trial period is up I can't see them live and the recording of the event is not something I can see either now that the free 30 day Cloud Video Recording is expired.

I'm fairly tech Savvy so I'm approaching this with that mindset. I have cable internet with 30mb down and 5mb up with a Wi-Fi router 3 feet from the Ring Pro unit. Wires at the doorbell are putting out right at the low end of the recommended range of 16V using a mechanical chime. It's been a LOOONG process of getting this Ring pro to work to the point of ""OK"". The first one gave me hell trying to set it up. It made my mechanical chime go nuts. Their help desk suggested getting a digital chime which I did for $50....didn't help. Returned the digital chime and put my mechanical back up. THEN the ring pro wouldn't connect to my Wi-Fi. Of course, like all companies, their help desk had me go through a script or things to try (reboot router, turn off router, connect ring and turn on router, etc.) they FINALLY referred me to ""2nd level tech support"" on a Sunday. I had been trying to get it to work for four days and had been on with their tech support for all of them. Well, I received an email asking me to make an appointment for 2nd level support which was on a Sunday, a week after first trying to set this thing up . Well on Sunday at the appointed 11AM time, they call right on time. I explained to him ALL of the steps I had taken to try and get the Ring Pro to connect to my Wi-Fi and the other issues. He said, ""You seem to know what your doing, we'll send you another unit"" (good experience with 2nd level tech). Well, five days later, I had my 2nd unit and it connected immediately. They sent a return package with a return shipping label (good customer service on this count). Once the new one was connected, the issue of the jumpy mechanical chime went away as well. I tested a few things and everything seemed go to go.....almost. The motion detection was working, the SMS alerts were working, and the SMS for an actual ring of the door bell was working. What wasn't working was my mechanical door bell. Another call to tech support and this time I REQUESTED 2nd level support immediately which surprisingly, they agreed. The next day I received a phone call from the same 2nd level tech guy. Again, he said, I trust that you know what your doing so I'm going to send you one of our Ring chimes (another Wi-Fi gadget that plugs into a wall outlet that takes the place of your mechanical chime). Well in five days, I had it. Set up was easy and it worked well. Now I had all the functions I needed; a functioning doorbell, functioning security cam with motion detection, functioning SMS alerts, and set up on four family phones so everyone gets the alerts...I was finally after four weeks satisfied.....so I thought..""sigh"". Fast forward a week after my initial satisfaction with everything finally working. One night, all of us started receiving motion alerts every 5 to 10 minutes after nightfall. After reviewing the recordings, it became evident what was happening was the night vision was turning on an off repeatedly and the noise from the loud ""Click"" of them turning on was causing a motion activation with the associated SMS alert. So the first night I turned off the motion alerts so we could sleep and turned them back on during daylight hours. This went on for three days. Since I knew the problem was with the night vision/IR LED's. I tried a work around which worked. Since the Ring is on my front porch right fairly close to my porch light, I tried turning on my porch light ""tricking"" the sensors into thinking it's daylight negating the need for the IR LED's to turn on. At first it didn't work but my light was an old incan yellow-ish light. so I put one of my daylight 60W LED bulbs in it an bam, worked like a charm. To further this and to prevent me from having to remember to turn on the porch light every night, I went another step. I went out and bought the Phillips HUE system and one of their 60W connected LED bulbs. I put their bulb in the porch light and tested it. It worked well for this application. Finally, I downloaded the IFTTT app and created a recipe for the HUE front porch light - ""IF sunset THEN turn on HUE front porch light"" and of course the reverse, ""IF sunrise THEN turn off HUE front porch light"". Now everything is automated and seems to be working good with no false night vision alerts. The only drawback to this idea was that the vision from the Ring Pro is limited to the area lit by the LED porch bulb which is significantly less than that of the night vision provided by the ring. Of course it also requires me to leave the front porch light on all night. Further email exchanges with the Ring 2nd level tech support guy has revealed that that the night vision switching on and off is a known issue and should be remedied with a future firmware upgrade. My other complaint is the black screen I get when I respond to a motion detection about 20% of the time. Even some motion detections that I don't answer are nothing but 30 seconds of black screen with no sound. Hopefully this can be remedied with a firmware as well. App. Recommendations: 1.) Would like to be able to select my desired video resolution (it's currently auto). 2.) Would like to be able to view recordings as they happen when clicking on an event and not wait until the full 30 seconds is recorded and processed. 3.) Allow some setting edits on the actual website 4.)  Integrate with ""works with Nest"" so that a pre-selected nestcamera can activate when motion or the door bell is rung. UPDATE: I figured out a workaround now with IFTTT so that this can be achieved. 5.) Allow users to select custom alerts for the doorbell and motion alerts. CONCLUSION: It is my belief that the hardware of the Ring Pro is solid. Their problem lies in their software which assuming they have talented IT guys should be able to remedy. I think where Ring went wrong was rushing their product to market too quickly without sufficient time for BETA testers which is basically what we as consumers are at this point. Consumers who spend $249 for the most part DO NOT want to be BETA testers (as displayed by all the negative Amazon reviews). I believe with sufficient time, Ring can work out the bugs and have a rock solid product. Their downfall unfortunately may be however a flood of negative reviews causing business failure resulting in a dead in the water product for those that bought it. I hope they see the writing on the wall and put a team of very angry and determined software guys on this to save their reputation and company. Anything short of this, I fear this product will fail. UPDATE 6/8/2016: I received an email from 2nd level support advising me that a new firmware update (1.1.30) had just rolled out to address the IR lights turning on and off repeatedly causing multiple motion alerts. Well, it did keep them from turning on and off repeatedly but the problem is now they don't turn on at all!....come on ring..So currently, I have no night vision/IR lights so I'm still relying on my porch light to supplement the Ring Pro to see anything at night. Update 6/16/16: Well right after I wrote the last update on 6/8, I also emailed ring to tell them about the night vision issue. While waiting for a return email, on 6/10, the night vision started working again. Also on 6/10, I received another email from ring saying that mine sounds like it needed replacing again and that a new one was on it's way. I immediately emailed them and told them NOT to send it because this one had started working again. I received a reply saying, ""Great, let us know if you have any further problems."" Chalk one up for good customer service on Ring's part. Well, today 6/16 when I arrived home, there it is, a replacement ring pro. I guess I'll be honest and send it back after I keep it a few days to make sure the one I have doesn't goo chichi's paribba in the short term :)  All things considered, as much of a pain this process has been, THUS far Ring customer service has been pretty good; albeit a bit slow at times. More updates to come!?!??!....maybe. UPDATE: 7/27/2016: Well things have gone better for the last month. It seems Ring has worked out many of the bugs. My brother, neighbor and friend who also have the Ring Pro report the same thing. MOST of the bugs seemed to have been remedied. The bugs that seem to remain (which a potential buyer should be aware of) is 1.) the issue of some old doorbell not working properly. Like I stated above, ring sent me one of their ring Wi-Fi doorbells as a remedy and that works good for me. 2.) You'll need a good/fast Wi-Fi connection for video uploads. Mine ranges around 5mbs up and that works good. My neighbor uses ATT u-verse with a blazing fast upload speed of 0.5mbs up and all he gets are bad still shots. My brother uses another cable co. and gets 2.5mbs up and it works fine. 3.) There are still occasionally ""black screen"" issues when responding to motion or doorbell rings. In other words when you receive a motion detection or ring notification on your cell and you click to view, you see nothing but a black screen; no picture, no sound. It can usually be remedied by going out of the application and trying again. This presents a problem because of the time that elapses from the motion or ring until you can see whats going on. What I usually see are people walking away or nothing at all because they have left. While this is irritating, it happens about 5% of the time which I find acceptable for the piece of mind you get for the watchful eye at the door. 4.) You still cannot view a 30 second recording until the Ring server has finished processing it if you miss the 30 second motion activation or Ring notification record window. If you do miss it, you'll have to wait for about 30 seconds to view the activity. I hope this process gets faster or is illuminated completely. 9/6/2016: Last week I came home and the Ring Doorbell Pro was completely dead. I don't know if it was a power surge or what had happened. A quick call to Ring's customer service and about a 10 minute dance through the script that they have to go through and I had another Ring on the way. It took 6 days to get there but it took about 5 minutes to remove the old ring and set up the new one. Ring was even nice enough to give me an extra 3 months of cloud service for my troubles. Ring still scores highly on customer service in my book. 2-2017 - Well everything worked great for a while. For the past two months there is no longer two way communication available via any of my phones. The alerts are still good (motion and rings) but if you try to have a conversation with anyone, the video locks up. I've tried calling Ring to troubleshoot the issue but thus far no solutions have been provided. I've even upgraded my internet speed to 100mps down / 12mps up. This being said I still feel the ring is worth it due to the extra security it provides. I wish they could remedy the video locking issue. My nest cam that I have indoors has had zero issues for over 1.5 running; two way conversations and all. CONCLUSION: So the question in most minds is, ""So should I get one?"" If you have a good/fast internet connection and you like the idea of a watchful eye at your door, then at this point I would recommend the Ring Pro. I'm still not convinced that I'm getting 1080P quality out of the videos. Since Ring doesn't allow users (at this time) to select their video quality, it's up to the software to select based upon internet speed/bandwidth. This is fine but I'd like to be able to select it myself. One other improvement that MAY help would be the incorporation of something allowing higher dynamic range in their videos like HDR  or something of that nature. If your ring is in a shaded area like mine is and facing out to a brightly lit street the camera/software has to decide which to meter to get the correct exposure. If it meters under my porch, then the street is completely white washed/blown out, if it meters the street, the area under the porch is too dark. This is NOT an issue unique to the Ring Pro. All camera's have this issue and photographer struggle with the problem all the time. It is over come by either using a neutral density filter or using a software solution like HDR. I don't know how ring would incorporate a neutral density filter but some type of HDR solution might suffice. All this being said,  their customer service has been good for me albeit a little slow at times. They do follow-up to insure their product is satisfactory. The hardware seems well built, the software has most of the bugs fixed and I think the Ring Pro is finally ready finally for prime time. The same is being reported by at least six users I know. They all agree, that they like the product now. I'm happy with mine and will be keeping it and the people that I know that have them are keeping theirs. Lets hope the improvements continue.","Finally, the bugs are gone mostly...(with updates)"

The quality, cloud support, customer service was top notch.  After July the video quality has gone downhill FAST.  Prior to all the firm ware updates I could make out people walking on my street at night as well as any of the critters running around my property.  After this, the video quality looks like I am playing a game of mine craft in the snow.  The picture is washed out, grainy, and choppy.  I am so dissapointed with the service.  I called/email customer service plenty of times.  Only to have been told it was my power pack, transformer, I needed a chime pro, and my internet reception wasn't that good, etc.  I replaced everything aside from disabling the actual doorbell which I am not going to do.  I was told my doorbell is not getting enough power when the device health says very good and I am getting a continuous 4100mV to the doorbell running on a brand new 24v transformer.  Also told I didn't have good WiFi signal at my door when my router is about 3 feet away from it and I am getting 200mb down/10mb up.  Finally customer service told me it was my Ring Doorbell that was faulty.  This is not the case b/c the doorbell they sent me was on firmware 1.3.7 which is about 8 firmwares old.  The video is amazing and the quality is how I remember it.  If there was a way I can never update my firmware I would be eager to learn if I could do that.  I have been saving screenshots from my old doorbell and the new one so i can use them as proof when the same thing happens.  The video from 2 weeks ago was 8megs and the one I took today was 24meg with only 5 seconds difference in time.  This pretty much confirmed my suspicions that Ring has been reducing the bitrate over each firmware.  So buyer beware as the commercials you see are in NO way close to what you get.  So dissapointed in this product as it was amazing 3 months ago and promoting it to everyone i came in contact with.  Now, not so much as I have taken to showing the drop in quality.  Fix the bitrate and I will change my review aside from that all this device is good for is alerting you when motion is detected and letting you know when someone rings the doorbell while you are away.",Beware!!!

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Jun 2017,S. Sherman,"UPDATE: Ring did something with a new firmware patch that has fixed the night vision problem for me. It works perfectly now. Updating my rating accordingly. When I first got this I was thrilled. The picture quality was clear, colorful, and above and beyond what I expected and installation was super easy. The app works great and itemizes each motion event and doorbell ring in a way that makes it very easy to navigate. The problem occured after the first night of it being installed when it went into night mode. At this point it uses infrared to display a black and white picture. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out of night mode during the day. The picture is constantly black and white and low res. I have to either reset the breaker or reboot the Ring to get it back to color and hi res and that only lasts until it goes into night mode again. This is a known issue for Ring and apparently a problem for users with a larger porch overhang. If you Google the problem, you will see many reddit posts about this problem. A lot of them say that Ring is aware of the problem, it's a firmware issue, and Ring is working on fixing it. Many of these posts are over a year old. I still use the Ring, because I know I'm less likely to be burglarized with it there, but if I was burglarized, the video would be virtually useless. I guess there's no use in their subscription. You'll likely see someone respond to this saying that they can help by increasing the contrast, but if you look that up you'll see many people that say that doesn't work either. It's too bad because if this thing had worked properly I would give it five stars, but it doesn't.",Known issue and Ring doesn't care

And three, that I would be able to zoom in on the videos. I must admit you got me and I purchased Ring and much to my surprise none of those features were there.

CONS: there is no way the video quality is as reported at 1080p - the quality is more on par with SD and due to this at times facial features are non-identifiable, the sound quality is often times very distorted, the motion sensor is way to sensitive - picking up people walking 15 feet from our front door on the sidewalk, and lastly the iOS app isn’t the best.",Average At Best
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Nov 2018,Lee M. Ahlstrom,"Bottom line:  Bought my Ring Pro in July 2016.  It just died.  The device is now a brick because there's an internal, unreplaceable battery that will die at some point past your warranty requiring you to replace the entire device with a new one.  BE PREPARED TO BUY ONE EVERY 1-2 YEARS.  More below. Overall, the Ring Pro (hardwired) doorbell is a decent product that mostly delivers on the advertisement.  Good resolution, adequate motion detection with an ability to set zones, good app mobile app.  I've enjoyed having it to be able to check who's at the door and find it particularly helpful in monitoring deliveries. However, there are some problems.  It will often drop off the network for a period of time and require reconnection which is annoying since you actually have to unscrew the cover to get to the wifi reset button.  Other times, it doesn't actually notify you in real time that someone is at the door.  It doesn't really ring the internal chime of the original doorbell and I had to buy the Ring Chime to get better notification. Video quality has declined in the 2 years since we've owned it, largely as a result of Ring software 'upgrades.' As some other reviewers have noted, there is a subscription service required for cloud backup of video.  And as Ring updates software, it sometimes 'breaks' the system for awhile. However the biggest thing I've learned in the last day or so is that even though this $250 doorbell is hard-wired into the existing powered doorbell system, the Ring Pro has an internal Lithium ion battery because your average doorbell transformer can't supply enough power to operate the device.  This battery, according to numerous Reddit threads (simply Google ""ring doorbell died"" and look for the first Reddit thread in the results) actually powers some of the functionality. THE BATTERY IS NOT REPLACEABLE AND WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.  When this happens, your $250 investment is worthless.  Heat is not your friend in terms of these batteries--those of you in hot climates or with Rings installed in the sun are likely to see faster degradation of the battery.  So you're paying $250 for a 366 day investment or if you're lucky like I was, you're paying $125/year for a smart doorbell. Not sure yet if I'll buy another.

Further, there is no time limited free option for cloud storage.  After 30 days, you will have to pay a monthly fee to be able to view video history.  Compare with some of the Arlo products that include both an SD card slot and free 7-day cloud storage. Wish I had paid more attention before installing.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,03 Dec 2019,Joseph G,"This was my second Ring Video Pro and first Echo Show. I bought a second Ring Pro for my side door after loving the one that was installed on my front door. Coupled with the Echo Show makes this a no brainer. It is great being able to go ""Alexa, show me the front/side door"", and then having the live feed of the Ring show up next to my bed. Now, some people may complain about the cloud service, but I don't find it being an issue. The $3 a month per device, or $10 a month for unlimited devices is not a bad deal. This is especially true if you go with a Protected by Ring Alarm system. What other company can give you professional alarm monitoring with video cloud storage for $10 a month? Also, note that this is the Ring Video Pro; pay special attention to the ""Pro"" in the word there. This doorbell must be hardwired, and a transformer capable of delivering the proper voltage must also be installed. I would recommend professional installation, but it isn't required if you are comfortable working with low voltage wiring, basic electricity and own the proper tools. I've noticed a lot of the negative reviews seem to be from individuals that tried to install the device themselves without the proper skill level or tools. I myself had to install a new transformer that was able to deliver the needed power to two Ring Video Pros. I also had to adjust the motion zones and motion sensitivity on both of my doorbells.

Now we have major issues and can't get Ring to help us at all.  They have the worst customer service department we've ever had to deal with personally. We noticed this past month, the two way talk doesn't always work when someone rings the doorbell.  Our voice sounds like a machine if it comes through at all.  After about 45 seconds it then becomes clear enough to for people to understand we are speaking to them and works fine after that. Our newest issue, happens ALL THE TIME now, when someone rings the doorbell: 1.) We can't access the live feed. 2.) We can't even access the video/camera for about 10 minutes after the doorbell is pressed. 3.) When we are able to view the recording, it's frozen just after the doorbell is pressed. Nothing else gets recorded after that. We have reset the camera and nothing fixed the issues. We reached out to Ring directly and were told our internet speed is too slow for the doorbell.  We are in a brand new home with a new modem/router and 300mbps internet speed.  Most of our devices are hardwired.  When someone rings the bell... no one is home even using the internet. We have had zero issues with internet speed on any other device in our home.  In addition, the doorbell has worked fine - up until this past month and nothing internet wise has changed in our home. The guy told me to contact our internet provider as it's impossible the problem is the doorbell. (Wow!!)  So, just to cover all our bases... we did.  Our ISP provider tested our connection, the modem and our speeds. Asked us questions about other devices and said there is NO ISSUE with our internet that because the problem is only with one device, it's a clear indicator it's the device and not the internet.  I again, reached out to Ring and was told again, it's an internet issue.  They refuse to repair/replace the doorbell even though it's within the manufactures warranty time frame.  They claim there is no other test they can do.  No help at all. Normally I would still recommend a product like this, if the company backs it up and provides full support.

As time went on the lag between someone being detected near our porch and us getting notified grew increasingly longer, to where I can no longer rely on it for timely notifications.

It was a little laggy most of the time, but overall worked as advertised. The phone app and cloud service are decent. Less than two months past the one year mark (warranty period...) it just died. We reset it by disconnecting power for a while and it came back up, until you pressed the button, then it died again. I called tech support and they said it was out of warranty and we'd have to purchase a new doorbell, that it was a ""known issue"". Tech support actually said ""known issue"" for the doorbells dying like this! I asked her if I was supposed to buy another $250 because of a known issue and she said yes! It's been over a month since I sent my last email to tech support and nothing. I'd call again, but at this time, why bother, by them ignoring my inquiries I figure they feel they have gotten my money so they will just ask for more or be content with me not pestering them. So... they are pretty much out of a customer. You can get the protection plan for $100/year, but either it wasn't around or I wasn't told about that plan when I made my purchase. If you are paying the $30 for cloud service, what's another $70 for the year? If they had offered some kind of discount for the new doorbell, or retro'd the protection plan that would have been great, but I'm not buying another $250 doorbell after 14 months and slapping another $100 on top of that. If you get the doorbell, get the protection plan and you should be happy. We had some good laughs with this product, but support has left me wanting. *************UPDATE************************ After several rounds with Ring, they did replace the doorbell and also recommended that I transformer be replaced. I finally go a hold of someone in support who knew their stuff and told me the transformer was probably the reason it went out in the first place, because of insufficient power, being used during an update, or some doomsday scenario (for the doorbell). So....  < $20 for a transformer and new doorbell later, we are back in business. I purchased the protection plan so the doorbell is now covered and I'm happy.

Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING (well, except the drill) you need to install & set up your Ring is included in the box. I was worried about needing someone with electrical skills to help me get it done, but the directions are so clear and easy to follow, you will amaze yourself at how easy it is to set it up. It works perfectly. The only time it did not work was when I had to reboot my modem, but my regular doorbell rang without missing a beat. I no longer want to be without my Ring and have purchased the Ring Floodlights to secure the rest of my home. The best part? Me being 20 miles across town, my phone alerting me to motion at my door and being able to SEE who was there and TALK to that person - they had no idea I was not at home. My daughters have the app and access to their phones also so we are all connected and watchful. What an awesome invention!!",OUTSTANDING!

After talking with the Ring support, I ended up buying and installing a new doorbell chime and transformer because I couldn't find a model number on the one I had, that made the Ring people say that I probably didn't have a ""compatible"" doorbell chime.  After installing the new doorbell chime and transformer (in the attic), it did the same thing.  I have been back and forth with them for weeks now when it is obvious that the Ring unit is defective.  I just received an email from Ring support that now they want a photo of the doorbell chime wiring, a photo of the transformer in the attic and want me to take the Ring unit out of the wall and get a photo of the wiring going to it.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Nov 2017,Mysticpass,"Let me say first I am a fan of Ring. I previously purchased/installed the video doorbell and a stickup cam with the solar charger. They work great so I was excited to read about a doorbell that was powered off of the already-installed doorbell.  Not so fast.  If you have a newer home (ours was built 5 years ago) with only one doorbell at the front door, the chances are, this product won't work.  You'll first need to locate and probably replace the transformer. Unless you have several doorbells working off the same transformer, most homes will have a 16 volt, 10 volt-amp transformer.  That's not nearly enough power. Add $15 for a Home Depot 24 volt 20 volt-amp transformer.  Whoops, that burned out the 16 volt chime I had.  Add another $25 (and 100 miles in my case) to get a 16 volt 30 volt-amp transformer. Buy a new doorbell chime (make sure it's on the list of compatible chimes -- they don't tell you that up front either.  Oh, and I hope you don't have more than a 15 foot run from your  transformer to the doorbell or the voltage drop in two-conductor bell wire will not power the video doorbell pro.  In my case the 30 foot run stopped me dead in my tracks. I read on some forums that the best thing you can do is run separate power to the video doorbell, then add the Ring wireless doorbell chime/range extender (another $50.)  I spent a full day, more than 150 miles, lots of forum searches and a call to tech support to find out I should not have wasted my time and money. Returned it.","Great Concept, Bad Product"
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 Mar 2019,M. E. S.,"I have had my Doorbell Pro for just over a couple of years and I recently started having issues with it. About once a week or more depending on how many visitors I get, the Ring Doorbell Pro will lose wireless connection. The only way I can get it to come back on is by resetting the breaker for the circuit it is on. When I contacted their support they were utterly useless. They walked me through very basic troubleshooting steps, ignored my own troubleshooting and told me my unit no longer functioned, that they could not replace it as it is out of warranty and that I should buy a new one and pay $10 a month for a warranty plan. Unlike others who have been offered some sort of discount (some 10$ off, others 100$ off) I was given no such offer. The issue with my device, as I and many many others have come to find out is that the Ring Doorbell pro uses a small battery that acts much like a capacitor to help supply enough power to trigger the mechanical chime of your door bell as well as initialize the live video. Ring claims there is no battery and no need to charge this device, and that is only a half truth. There is indeed a battery, which does require for it to hold a charge, unfortunately the battery only lasts about one to two years and is not a serviceable part. At least not according to Ring, you need the whole device to be replaced. This replacement is only performed under warranty, and the refurbished (not new) replacement unit has a limited warranty. If your Ring dies after your 1 year warranty, you are completely out of luck. Some of the pictures I have seen of the dead or none functional battery show it puffed out, which is very dangerous. This shows that there is a serious lack of safety engineering put into battery protection for this device. This appears to be a serious defect that they refuse to acknowledge. I recommend that you avoid purchasing any Ring brand products. Unless you like throwing away money. Edit: Ring seems to have made a real effort in fixing a lot of their support issues and replacing their first and second gen releases to be more stable and reliable. I've upgraded my review to three stars for now because I want to continue to make sure that their product quality control has changed. The Ring support team reached out to me and offered me a replacement which has been fully functional and working for the past three months. The newer generation of the Ring pro seems to be much more reliable.",Ring Doorbell Pro has serious issues that only surface after a year or two of ownership

I have three others around my house. but this was my first PRO one. I was replacing my original Ring doorbell with this one, in the SAME spot with the SAME wires. This was has worked flawlessly for two year, but I wanted the better resolution that they Pro has. Set up was easy like my other three. But note you need to install a kit INTO your Doorbell Chime box (see image), but don't worry that only takes a few minutes. NOW load the app to set up the WiFi, click the button on the side and NOTHING, no RING-### anything in my Wifi list. Remember this is my FOURTH Ring camera, The other three installed in minutes. I tried again, nothing in my Wifi list, then I tried an ipad, then a different iPhone, still not showing up in the WiFi list. Then I did a hard restart (hold the side button for over 15 secs) still nothing. I reboot my Router (ASUS), the same router that the other three work great with. Still Nothing. After searching Internet for ideas, I call Tech Support. The asked me to try pretty much everything I already did.

Mooter,"Wow...where do I begin? This is a good product that has the potential to be GREAT! I will say that this is the 2nd one I purchased as I had to return the 1st one. (The 1st one was purchased on Amazon through E Zone Electronics and they have been great to work with!) So, 1st off let me say this.  I believe the reason the 1st one didn't work was because of a setting on my Netgear C7000 modem/router.  It's called BeamForming - BFE and BFR.  Once I turned that off, the 2nd Ring Pro connected almost flawlessly.  So keep that in mind. So I don't really have anything additional to say about this as the other reviewers have done a great job of that.  It's a good product, professionally packaged (reminded me of how Apple packs things).  It included a very usable screw driver and drill bit (used for drilling into cement or brick). Instructions were GREAT! and overall the experience (the 2nd one) was great! So, do your homework 1st before ordering: 1: MEASURE the voltage AT the doorbell.  Just loosen the screws on your doorbell, put a voltage meter on it (set for AC) and you NEED to have 16v to 24v.  If you don't have it...replace your transformer. (I did.) 2: MEASURE the wifi signal strength at the doorbell.  Take your phone, download any of the free wifi SPEEDTEST tools (I use Ookla) and make sure you have good signal strength. How much?  According to Ring only 2 MBs up and down.  I have 65 Megs right at the doorbell and the video quality is excellent but the audio is poor.  Very quiet and choppy. 3: I'm having an issue which I'm hoping is just a setting, but when you push the button to ring the doorbell, it only rings on our phone and doesn't actually ring the old doorbell. (See pic) So in a nutshell there you have it.  Is it worth $200?  Welllll....yeah, for now, it's okay. Hopefully soon it'll start to go down as I would love to purchase one for my daughter's house.

I've wanted to install it as soon as my new house was finished being built. I'll preface this review by saying I have awesome internet speeds at my house and office, both sporting 1 gigabit per second fiber connections and full bars of wireless at each location the Ring Doorbell is installed, and where I am using my iPhone 7. I'm also very techy. Once there is motion detected, or the doorbell is rung, It takes on average 30 seconds for the app to connect and put up the video on my phone, often longer or it doesn't connect at all, but it does ring my phone.

It surprised me just how Awesome the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is!!! I had no prior experience with Ring doorbells or Video doorbells in general. This changed my world. Like a doorbell on steroids. Amazing just how much you can actually see from a camera about the size of a pencil eraser. And you don't just see you can have a conversation with whomever is at your door while you're anywhere. I was so impressed I bought another Ring doorbell about a week after installing and using this one. It is the talking point for everyone who comes to see our new home. I have been recommending to family and friends and talking about Ring in just about every conversation. My parents bought one based on my experience. I was nit picky giving 4 instead of 5 Stars and here is why. You need a very good WiFi signal for Ring to work as advertised. With less than excellent WiFi you might experience what some of the other reviewers complain about, lag. That is lag time from when someone presses your doorbell to when the alert comes up on the Ring App on your device. So if you have this issue and it persists check out your WiFi signal before bashing Ring. My new house has excellent WiFi signal and I have had zero issues now that our network is up and running. As Ring continues to update there software and App hopefully this will help alleviate lag as well. So use to view, talk, save to cloud, security, etc. I highly recommend for anyone.

Furst,"I purchased this with the thought that since it is wired to your existing doorbell, it did not require a battery.  After the 1 year warranty expired, my doorbell died.  After researching how to fix it, I found that there is indeed a battery inside the unit and once the battery dies, your video doorbell is useless.  There is no repairing this unless you ""mod"" the Ring.  I tried the mod and my Ring must be completely dead.  I am an electronic technician so I have enough experience with soldering components.  I'm very unhappy with this product and so are a lot of other people that this product has failed on them.  Do a search and look up Ring video doorbell pro died.  It seems to be right around a year to 18 months until it fails.  I can't see paying $249 every year for this.  I'll wait until they figure out how to remove the battery from the circuit. Update: 12/12/2018  A Ring representative saw my review and reached out to me.  They are sending me a new doorbell to replace the defective one.  Although I am happy they are sending me a new doorbell, I seriously hope they have figured a way to keep this doorbell working for longer than 16 months.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Apr 2017,J. Amicucci,"I was hesitant to buy the Ring Video Doorbell Pro for two reasons: 1) the price is rather steep; and 2) the negative reviews were concerning. But, I am intrigued by the products and needed a security solution so I decided to try a Ring Video Cam first. I fell in love with the cams and ended up buying 3 to put around my property. All work flawless. So I decided I would then take the plunge and buy the Ring Doorbell Pro. I purchased it on March 3. Installation - was pretty straight forward. If you've changed a light switch or done simple electrical work then the install shouldn't be an issue. Directions were straight forward and comprehensive enough. Performance - from March 3 to March 6 the doorbell worked great. Good wifi, good voltage. Motion detection was awesome. If someone rang my doorbell I got the notification and could view the live video. Then on the afternoon of March 6 I got a notification that the doorbell had lost connectivity. And it has been a bumpy ride ever since. Customer Service - I started exchanging emails with customer service. Apparently, all the issues I was experiencing had nothing to do with their perfect product, but everything to do with my lousy house.  It must be bad wiring or it must be bad wifi or it must be bad voltage transformer, etc... Even if you look at their support website, any issue you try to troubleshoot pretty much puts the blame on something in your house. For 4 weeks now I've had off and on exchanges with them and they offer zero real support and have yet to admit I may possibly have a defective device. Today, April 5, I now have a $249 doorbell.  I cannot view any video. I do not receive any notifications when someone rings my doorbell. Yet, the doorbell reports perfect health - very good wifi connection, very good voltage readings. The doorbell works like a $3 doorbell from Home Depot - press the button and ding-dong and that is it.  I am trying to get it replaced with Ring, but to this day they still say ""perform a wifi test"" or some ridiculous thing like that.  I keep reminding them I have 3 other Ring cams around my property that all are on that same wifi and all work perfect. This doorbell is a ding-dong for sure!

At Ring support's suggestion I switched from 5GHz to 2.4GHz, reset the unit several times, added a Ring Chime Pro wifi extender (they provided) but if anything the problems seem to have gotten worse.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,21 Nov 2018,Ryan Walls,"Nest cams, including their doorbell offer a DVR styled recording with flagged motion events. Which is awesome. With this Ring doorbell it failed to sense motion in the zones I had set up during a middle of the night encounter I had with an SUV full of ppl trying to break into mine and my neighbor's vehicles. Also, their motion alerts on phone and Apple Watch do not show the event that triggered the motion. You have to wait until its done with it's 1-2min recording, then wait for it to upload to their cloud, THEN and only then can you see what triggered the motion. As a man who works with a wife and children at home, that is alot of time from when a bad event starts to when I could be alerted that something bad is going on. Especially when that is one of the only reasons I bought the doorbell in the first place. The NEST hello shows a thumbnail of what triggered the motion on my Apple Watch, and repeating GIF on the banner on my cell phone lock screen of the motion event that triggered the notification. All of those negatives aside, the customer service is absolutely SPECTACULAR. So if you are fine with a far inferior product for the couple bucks a month savings, there's that. And all those negatives btw, can probably be changed with software and server upgrades. So if Ring gets their sh** together and upgrades some better features this might actually compete with the NEST products. Right now however, its a no brainer for anyone who wants a fully functional camera doorbell. Take it from a guy who bought a Nest Hello, not on sale and have my $200 ring doorbell sitting on a shelf in my garage now.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Oct 2017,Gil,"Video quality really isn't very good. I made sure to give it a dedicated wifi access point very close to the door on a good router.  My internet speed is consistently 100 Mbps with 10 Mbps upload.  The ""live view"" video quality is just bad.  I'm probably going to switch this out for the Nest Doorbell when that comes out. There is a very noticeable delay between the time from when the button is pressed and the time when you get the alerts or the Chime product that you have to pay extra for rings.  Video often takes a while to get started, too.  The delay is well over 5 - 10 seconds usually and if you live in a major city that is already more time than any courier will stay at your door. The software is really pretty bad, too.  You can't easily do things like changing wifi settings without going through the entire setup process which requires you to take off the cover.  I should be able to change settings on the thing via the app, but you can't. They claim it's 1080p video and while that may technically be true due to lines of resolution, whatever they use to encode the video makes it look really bad. At best it looks like 480p video at a low bitrate.  It's really bad. Reducing my review to 1 star:  This thing doesn't even seem to work half the time. Update: I'm increasing my review to 2 stars because the company really tried to reach out and help me with my issues, but unfortunately the software is just really buggy and doesn't offer nearly enough configuration options that it should and the video quality isn't good enough for me.  I think I just have higher expectations. Update: I'm reducing my review back to 1 stars, because after about a year of use this thing barely works whenever I need.  I'm certain I have a strong WIFI connection even as reported by the unit's health checks itself.  Video quality remains terrible and spotty.  The app doesn't respond quickly enough to actually answer in time.  The thing doesn't work reliably.  I don't know if they break things between firmware releases or something like that because I do get times where it's ok, but it isn't reliable at all.  It does look a lot nicer than the Nest so I'm not switching it out yet, but I do need something that works and this thing doesn't work reliably.",Video quality is generally bad.

However, after trying to rely on it for a year or so, I've come to realize it's just not happening. I started with the basic, then upgraded to the Pro when that wouldn't work.  I've got great bandwidth (85 down/32 up on a bad day), a good connection to the unit, and ""very good"" voltage.  The RSSI (received strength at the unit) is in the moderate range.  I added the Chime Pro to boost the signal.  I've spent more hours on the phone with tech support just to get it to work at all at the beginning than I'd care to count.  Now, when I just ask for a ""Live View,"" about 90% of the time, it just times out and says it can't reach the unit.  Do all the troubleshooting again -- same results.  So basically, I have a VERY expensive doorbell/motion detector.  If you want to be using it with other Amazon/Alexa products, forget about it.  Even on the occasion the image DOES come up, it can take 30 seconds or more to appear, by which time the person at your door is likely gone.

The main problem we encountered, which is mentioned quite a bit in other forums online, is that we could not get the device to power on after wiring it to the existing doorbell wiring. My dad is a pretty techie guy and had a voltmeter on hand, so we were able to easily verify that enough power was routing to the Ring doorbell (17V). Other purchasers online commented that it took up to 24 hours for the device to finally power up connecting the wiring, but the eventual solve for us was discovering that there is a hidden micro USB port on the side of the device. To access it, you need to pry off a little plastic panel to the left of the doorbell button. Using the port, we plugged the device into the wall using an iPad charger, and the doorbell came to life. After letting it sit for a while, we then wired it back into the front door, and it’s worked fine ever since (device health in the app shows “Very Good” voltage). I’m giving it 4 stars because once we got it working, all of the features work flawlessly as advertised. But, it was very difficult to get working, and if we weren’t “tech enthusiasts,” probably would have given up much earlier and returned the device.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,04 Apr 2017,Martin Benning,Save your money and your time and no matter what preserve the packaging and components so you can easily send this back.  Installing the doorbell is simple and only takes about 10 minutes.  Once you begin setup is when you will need 4+ hours to troubleshoot issues through chat and phone calls with Ring. The app only has 3 stars or so in the iOS app store so that'll give you a sense of how great it isn't.  It's plagued with problems during the whole set up. Honestly just get a Nest camera is you can and save yourself the trouble.,Don't waste your time or money
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jul 2019,C. Cox,"We just got a second home and I night before last this ring did phenomenal for us; suspicious characters came up to our door where one of our Amazon packages was still there And slit open the package; fortunately  they were distracted by something and left.  They  did not ring our doorbell but the video captured them at our door and walking up from the street.  I posted it to the Ring neighborhood and found out that others in the neighborhood ( which is far encompassing) had seen these people and one of them was caring a hatchet. For those of you that worried that the three dollars a month is too much, I have to ask how much is your safety worth?  I sent clear videos to the police department after they asked us to document it and send them the videos.  It would be fantastic if RING Would supply police departments with the results especially of suspicious characters or acts Of theft, violence etc. We wouldn’t trade our RING for anything. One slight drawback is that we get traffic motion especially if cars are speeding but then we have a pretty wide range so that we can see the entire front of our house. I also note that the Wi-Fi signal which we have an excellent router doesn’t always tell you when it’s happening— it’s almost like a slight delay.  That said, if someone waits around at the door we answer it even when we’re in another city/state. The Alexa that they are talking about is actually a spot for a video thing I wish it worked with our Echo or Echo Dot so if we couldn’t respond to them Alexa could and maybe even scare some person in middle of night who doesn’t ring the doorbell off. LOL Can also share your ring info videos with family so that they can monitor it for you when you can’t.  They can see a live version, any alerts that have been there and also the neighborhood Reports. A win-win situation.",Most important security feature we got
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,19 Jan 2018,LUCK,"This is a great smart home device for being able to see video of your front door and speak to the person at the door - even if you’re hundreds of miles away! PROS: * Installation was pretty easy (I used a uniden product before this and couldn’t get it to work with my existing wiring at all ... but see CONS below) * Video App (when someone rings the bell, my phone rings, and I can open the app to see video of the front door and speak to the person at the door if I like) * Detects motion (I’ve seen some complaints on earlier versions that it detects cars passing by, etc.  This one allows you to define the zone for motion control - so I set a zone that included the front yard but not the road.  I hardly ever get false positives, but I rarely miss it when something is moving “in the zone”). * Motion detection can also alert your phone.  So if you’re expecting a package and the delivery person doesn’t ring your bell, you can still be alerted and ask your neighbor to grab it for you. * Captures video (you can set it to capture video whenever motion is detected and whenever the bell is rung ... but see CONS). * Integrates with a ringer device (purchased separately - this device can make a sound whenever motion is detected or the bell rings) CONS: * Some installation (particularly for your existing doorbell wiring) is required.  But the instructions are pretty clear, and it went pretty quickly.  I’m moderately handy around the home and was able to handle this solo. * I could not get mine to actually make my existing doorbell ring.  This is an improvement over the Uniden bell I had (which made my existing bell constantly hum).  But I had to purchase the ringer device to get a functioning doorbell.  I’m not sure if I just did the doorbell wiring incorrectly or not - but I suspect that different doorbells are different voltage and the Ring kit wasn’t made for mine.  This is what cost a star in my rating. * Capturing video requires a monthly contract.  Ring would tell you that this is the cost for hosting your data.  But my Blink Video cameras include motion capture, and there is no monthly fee.  Ring could also integrate with OneDrive or Google Drive to capture video to an existing cloud storage area.  There’s just not a good excuse for charging you monthly for this service.  This cost another star.",Nice Smart Home Device. But some installation gotchas and monthly fees.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,23 Jun 2017,RangerDog,"This continually disconnected from my strong network and the process to reconnect requires a screwdriver and about ten minutes of standing next to your doorbell. I had to do this every morning. Please note, I have many devices and nothing else disconnects from my network. The device also showed a very good electrical connection. I returned the Ring product and replaced it with one from Arlo. That one connects much more easily and it would probably re-connect except that it has never lost connection. With Ring, ""live"" view worked only sometimes and took up to a minute or two. Honestly, I like the concept of the Ring which is why I purchased it. But after spending a ridiculous amount of time trying to get it to work consistently, I gave up. I'm glad I bought it from Amazon where returns are easy. The kicker: There is no way to delete your account. You are required to set up an account for the Ring to work but they won't let you get rid of it. Once they've got your email, it's theirs forever. I contacted support and the response was: ""There is no way to completely delete your account.""

Then I started having issues where I'd get motion alert but the live feed wouldn't work because of poor signal strength.  I tried putting it on both my standard and 5G networks but neither helped despite other wireless devices working just fine in the same area. Fast forward 11 months later and I noticed I hadn't even received a motion alert in a couple weeks.  I checked on the device to find that it wasn't on, was hot to the touch, and couldn't reset.  I contacted the Ring help desk and spoke with a lady for nearly 3 hours trying to troubleshoot. She was insistent it wasn't getting enough power even though it had worked for months and the voltage going into the device was exactly what she said it should be when I used a VOM to check.  After being placed on hold for the umpteenth time, I started checking around on their website and found if there's not sufficient power they offer a complimentary power cable of some sort that can help.  When she got back on I requested that be sent to me.  I was immediately placed on hold and after 15-20mins waiting the call abruptly ended... During that time I was doing some more research online and apparently despite being hardwired this particular device does actually have an internal battery that CANNOT be replaced and often fails after 12-16 months depending on weather conditions.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,01 Mar 2019,Thomas Ott,"After using the product for nearly one year, I can say with confidence, the Ring Video Doorbell Pro is a reliable product and is backed by an EXCELLENT USA-based support team. QUESTION:  Why not a 5-Star rating?? ANSWER:  UNEXPECTED POWER REQUIREMENTS. After the Ring Pro was installed, the product did not work as expected. The video response time lagged, and the video quality was not as expected. Additionally, the original ""mechanical"" doorbell would not consistently chime when a visitor pressed the Ring Pro button. After troubleshooting with Ring's excellent tech-support, it was discovered the original doorbell TRANSFORMER was not powerful enough to operate the ""Pro"" model properly. My home was built in 2003. I guess in those ""old days"" many homes were built with doorbell transformers rated at 16v/10va. I'm not an electrician, but Ring tech-support stated the Ring ""Pro"" model needs a transformer with a minimum rating of 16v/30va (the ""30va"" is the important part). Something tells me, even if your home was built in the last year or two -- it is likely has a ""contractor grade"" transformer that will NOT adequately power a Ring Pro. I purchased a new 16v/30va transformer (Edwards Signaling 598 120V 8/16/24V 30W) from Amazon for $30, and I did a self-installation to avoid the additional cost of a professional electrician. By the way, locating the doorbell transformer can be a mystery -- depending on the age of your home. My transformer is located in the garage, and it was not an easy install because it is in an awkward position --11 feet off the ground (tall garage). A little advice: if you decide to install a new transformer yourself -- the electricity needs to be TURNED-OFF at the breaker box! The new 16v/30va transformer resolved the ""video lagging"" issue. However, it did not resolve the mechanical (hard wired) wall chime operating sporadically. Again, Ring tech-support was contacted, and they suggested the original (2003) mechanical wall chime still might be demanding too much power from the transformer and suggested replacement of the NuTone chime box. Since I had just purchased the Ring Pro AND had the unexpected expense of a new $30 transformer, I expressed to Ring tech-support -- I was not about to add the cost of a new mechanical wall chime to the scenario, and perhaps it would be better to return the Ring Pro to Amazon. Understanding this concern, Ring tech-support was kind enough to send me a RING WIRELESS CHIME free of charge. Actually, I like the Ring Wireless Chime better than the old mechanical wall chime, and here are two reasons why: (1) The Ring Wireless Chime offers 20 different ""ring"" chimes; plus a selection of ""motion"" chimes. The motion chimes are GREAT for when delivery drivers drop off packages at the door -- but do not ring the bell. When the Ring Wireless Chime sounds for motion at the front door area, I always check the Ring Pro camera to see if a package is sitting near the door. (An excellent feature for thwarting Porch Pirates.) (2) I can move the Ring Wireless Chime to a different location in the house, or it can be moved to the patio when I'm working outside (electrical outlet required). That way, I always hear the doorbell ring or sound motion activity anywhere inside or outside the house. Now, nearly one year later, I have had ZERO ISSUES with the RING PRO and highly recommend Ring's products to family and friends. However, the rationale for the 4-Star instead of 5-Star rating was based on the disappointment of encountering ""unknown power requirements"" AFTER the purchase. After checking YouTube and other online sources, apparently, operation issues around the 16v/30va power requirement are very common. I think Ring should disclose this anomaly prior to purchase -- or at least offer a discounted 16v/30va transformer for around $20 and free shipping. All-in-all, if I were asked to recommend either a Ring Pro or a Ring doorbell model that is battery-operated, I would suggest going with the Pro model and upgrading to a 16v/30va transformer. Plus, here in the Valley of the Sun, with over 100 days of 100+ temperatures each year, batteries don't live long. So, not having to worry about heat-related battery failure is worth the extra cost and effort to install a Ring Pro. One last thing . . . Because Ring was EXCELLENT at resolving the electrical issues encountered with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro with quality tech-support and customer service, I recently purchased and installed the RING ALARM HOME SECURITY SYSTEM.  So far, the Ring security system is EXCELLENT, and I will talk about this product in a separate review after a few months of experience.","Ring Video Doorbell Pro could be 5-Stars, but . . ."
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,17 Mar 2017,James F.,"This product has so much potential, but it simply DOES NOT WORK as advertised. Video?! More like still pictures. I have a great internet connection AND I even purchased a Chime Pro Wi-Fi- to try and help. No luck. Every time I answer a motion or watch a video it shows about 3 seconds then freezes. And stays frozen. If you're lucky it will skip ahead to another still shot. I wanted so bad to return the product, but there are certain uses that me and my girlfriend wanted to keep. The motion sensor works great, we always know when somebody is in our yard or walkway. We can get a STILL SHOT of who was at our door. We know when packages get dropped off before the delivery notifications etc. But I would NOT recommend this product for $250. As for the answering the doorbell and talking to your visitor, it is barely functional. It sort of works. Basically when we first got it and set it up we tried and it was wonky and didn't work. We tried a few minutes later and it sort of worked, just a delay which is expected and understandable. The video cuts in and out, but it doesn't outright freeze like the recorded videos. We haven't tried it much since, but i was able to talk to my gf through it on one other occasion without any real issue. Just choppy and laggy. What's weird here is that the live feed, while still laggy and buggy looking, works better than the recorded videos. SUMMARY: It has some useful features such as the motion sensor and a slightly serviceable live feed, but overall the product seems like it flat out does not work as it should, or as the price reflects. If you want a motion sensor that will alert you when people are approaching your door, this is great. If you want to be able to see a video of somebody approaching your door and what they do, this is NOT the product for you. If you want to answer your doorbell from anywhere and chat, good luck. The delay means you usually get people as they are walking away, and even if you get them, the video, and to lesser extent the audio, will be very laggy, delayed, and borderline embarrassing to use with visitors. P.S. All those Facebook ads I see where the video is working perfectly?? LOL not sure who is lucky enough to have it work that good, but again with a good, fast internet I have had no such luck.",BAD Streaming/TERRIBLE Recording
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Dec 2017,M. Gondek,"Great concept, mediocre implementation. We've had this installed for about a year, and it's gone from ""okay"" to ""unusable"" in the last few months. Unreliable connections are the worst of it, so much so that I'll be replacing my Ring with a Nest or August doorbell in the next few months and have to eat the high price tag of this useless device. Pros: 1. Installation. Easy, no problems. I installed the doorbell myself in place of an existing doorbell and chime, and it went smoothly. The instructions were clear and adequate. 2. Camera functionality. I really appreciate the wide angle of the camera, which makes it easy to see people approaching the front door from the street, and then if they walk toward the back of my house. 3. Effective night vision. I've read that some other doorbells have poor night vision, but this one does a good job of showing a person's features when they approach the door. 4. Decent app. The app is pretty intuitive and doesn't require excessive tapping to do simple things like live view, history, and settings. I also like that I can set motion detection zones, since car headlights were triggering motion alerts until I played with the motion zones. 5. Easy sharing. No problems sharing the doorbell controls with my husband. You can also set the motion sensitivity by user, which is great since my husband wants alerts for every little thing and I only want alerts for probably people. We can each get the motion and/or ring alerts we want by tweaking our own settings in the app. Cons: 1. Doesn't integrate with much. The only partner in the app is Wemo, so I can't integrate this doorbell with my Nest, Abode, Hue, etc. And while it works with Alexa, I never use my Alexa for anything other than ordering anymore. I'd far rather this integrated with my Google Home, which is our default Assistant. 2. Unreliable app notifications. My husband and I can be sitting next to each other in the same room with the doorbell chime, and hear when someone rings the bell. About half the time, the Ring app on his phone notifies him within 30 seconds (or so) (which is still really slow when you've got someone standing on the porch). But those same times, the app on my phone doesn't notify me until 5-8 minutes AFTER the person pushed the button. Since it's notifying my husband's phone but not mine, it's obviously not a WiFi issue. 3. App fails to load properly. Most of the time when I try to interact with the person at the door (those few times it actually notifies me while they're still there), the app hangs up before the camera connects - I get a blank screen instead of the camera live view. If I back out of the app and go back in and tap ""Live View,"" I can then interact with the person. Why it doesn't connect the first time, I have no idea. For the record, I've gone through all of the (lousy) Help materials on the Ring site, and checked the Device Health repeatedly. The WiFi tests and Device Health all tell me the doorbell SHOULD be working just fine. Since it's not, the only thing I can assume is it's just not a reliable product. Incredibly disappointed to have spent the money on this device for only a couple months of useful life.","Worked okay for a couple months, now it's garbage"

It’s a fairly simply process that most anyone can complete. Once installed, the doorbell didn’t power up. I walked through online troubleshooting and determined the doorbell itself to be defective. I called Ring customer support and after being on the phone for 45 minutes walking through many of the steps I had previously taken, the rep told me I needed a new doorbell transformer. As opposed to trying to install myself due to a busy work schedule, I hired an electrician to do the job. The electrician then notified me that, as I had expected, the doorbell was defective. I spent $100 for the service call and $15 for the transformer, which wasn’t needed. Ring replaced the unit, but refused to do anything about the $115 I was out due to their poor customer service advice. Not acceptable! I identified initially that I had a defective unit.

Apparently, there are still issues with this system, primarily due to the technically finicky nature of this product.  The first unit I received install easily enough, but upon setup, it was unable to find the Ring network at all.  I went through troubleshooting on the phone with one of their CS folks and after several reboots, re-installs and the like, he said that I may be the recipient of a bad unit with a known issue where network syncing fails to happen and so they instructed me that they would send a replacement and to send the ""unresponsive"" unit back. Round 2:  So, about a week later, I received the replacement unit.  I went through complete install again and was excited when alas, the Ring network was visible on the phone app!  Yay, right?  Not so fast.  I was able to sync it fine and then, to my utter dismay, the thing failed my first test.  It did not register motion and did not send me any notifications when I tried t ring it.  So, I called Ring again and the CS person walked me though some more testing and finally asked me to do some signal diagnostics.  I did that with him several times only to finally have him tell me that my internet/network service provider was the issue.  Really?  I have Verizon Fios and NEVER lose signal or have any latency issues, yet he was trying to blame it on that.  Very frustrated once again at this point.  I REALLY wanted to have this system, but until they work out all the finickiness of this thing or have someone who can actually troubleshoot it to the point of successful operation, I cant recommend it to anyone :(((.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Oct 2018,Steven T. Snyder,"My first 6 months with the Ring Pro were great. Good video quality, motion alerts are easy to set up, decent sound quality, relatively low latency, and the ring never disconnected or stopped working. Around month 6 (in the middle of summer), I started seeing corrupt videos coming from the Ring Pro. I would get motion alerts when there was no motion, and when I looked at the video I saw random colored stripes appearing in the video and apparently causing the motion alert. I reset power to the device and the problem went away for a few weeks. Then the problem came back, except it actually froze the video. So the Ring Pro became useless. It just kept sending out the same pictures over and over. After going back and forth with support through their generic troubleshooting process for a week or two , they finally sent me a new Ring Pro. This one had an improved heat sink on the back, which confirmed what I suspected --- the Ring Pro's electronics were not holding up to the heat of summer. Unfortunately, 10 days in this replacement Ring Pro has a dead WiFi module. At this point, my Ring Pro has only worked for 10 days out of the last 60. At this price point, Ring Pro could be building high quality doorbells with components rated for high temperature. My recommendation is to avoid their products until their reliability is on par with pricing. Update 11/27/2018: I'm now 1 month into my 2nd replacement unit.

I installed it and it plain doesn't work. No lights, no camera, no action. I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. The wires behind the ring show 18VAC with my multimeter. I connect them to the screws.. nothing no flashing lights no solid lights, nothing.  Touch the wires together and the bell rings. My brother finally looked it up and it turns out getting dead products is very common with the ring pro. Many people have posted about their frustrations with this doorbell and how they returned them and got other broken ones several times. Several of them even said that customer support recommended getting the lower tier model instead of the Pro. They should recall these and refund us for our troubles. I don't even want anything to do with Ring anymore. What a shame.",Dead on Arrival.

Owens,"This has been a great video doorbell and far superior to SkyBell, which I bought first and had to return. The only problem is that it lasted only 27 months. My expectation is that a $250 doorbell would last more than a little over two years. Update: Ring replaced my defective doorbell. Update: you should be aware that the Ring Protect Plan is not truly optional. If you do not purchase the plan, your video feed will have a red banner on it telling you to purchase the plan. Below is my interaction with the help desk: Ring: Hi, thank you for contacting Ring! My name is ———. In order to have the banner message in the Ring app removed you would need to subscribe your devices to a Ring Protect Plan. I’d be happy to review your account and help you subscribe to a plan. . . . Me: I don’t want to subscribe and when I bought this it said subscription was optional. Are you telling me that the device I paid for will have an ad on the dashboard unless I buy an additional feature? Ring: The Ring Protect Plan subscription is optional. If you choose not to subscribe to a plan, then the banner message will appear in the app notifying you a device is not subscribed and recordings are not being stored. Me: OK. Unacceptable.

Even after I purchased the highly recommended Ring extender and an expensive and more powerful router (tried another brand repeater as well), but to no avail. My Ring front door device is a straight 50 foot shot from my router and should work perfectly. some good news, even while the app constantly says front door ""Offline,"" and doesn't allow me to see or speak to visitors in real time, at least I can hear the door bell ring and I can still access and review previously recorded videos, but after the fact. I was hoping to see motion and people before they walked up to and/or during the knock on my door, but that never worked for me more than a day or two in a row. So far its been an expensive door bell chime that allows me to review historical videos, better than nothing! I also purchased two Ring cameras with double motion sensor lights from Costco for ~$500 for both, and those seems to work better for some reason.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,29 Jan 2020,Scott W,"I replaced my Nest doorbell for a Ring a couple months ago as I didn't care for Google's policies and the app wasn't really integrated that well into the Home suite. Well, turns out that Ring isn't any better on any front except for maybe a slightly better app. The camera works well and I've subscribed to their service since it doesn't really work without it. All these doorbell products are just a bait and switch. Without the service, if you don't look at the camera quickly enough, it's a history event and has a rather horrible user experience. So plan on an annual fee to actually use this for what it says it does. Installation was easy. Took about 10 minutes and I didn't have any issues. Compared to the Nest, Ring's doorbell doesn't really look as nice and it certainly doesn't feel as sturdy. The base and way it attaches to the way feels almost flimsy whereas the Nest looked and felt more like it was part of the wall. Not to be too critical on the looks - the Ring looks ok - just don't think it looks as nice as the Nest. I was disappointed that this doesn't really integrate into Alexa or the Alexa app any better than it does. I've still really got to have a separate app installed to use it. The app works well enough and I've not had any problems with it. I have MFA turned on and have had no negative experiences with the app and extra authentication. The part that gets me is how liberal Ring is with my data. Their app gives away the farm on your personal life. Do a simple search for Ring app giving away data and you'll see where it's been found (as of Jan 2020 anyway) that the amount of data that Ring decides to just throw out there to Facebook (yes, even if you don't have anything to do with Facebook), Google and others. Highly disappointing and had I known that beforehand, I would not have purchased this product. So, the doorbell sort of works without subscribing to a service. Although to get the full functionality, you have to pay $$ annually. And then as if that weren't enough for them to make money off you after you've bought the product, they then sell your private data to make more off you. Win-win for them I suppose.",Works good - just prepare to give your life away
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,25 Nov 2019,Bruce D Lightner,"We have three Ring video doorbells.  Hard to imagine living without one now days.  All worked as advertised up until a few days ago.  That's when the first, our ""hardwired"" $250 Ring Video Doorbell ""Pro""---the most expensive one---died after 27 months in service.  Power is good but the device does not respond to the push-button or over the WiFi (see photo).  No lights, no noise, no good. Given our cost of $250 for 27 months of useful life that works out to a monthly hardware cost of $9.26---plus the Ring Cloud recording change of $3.33 per month.  Is $12.50 per month worth it?  Personally I do not think so. The device is sealed up good, meaning disassembly, inspection and/or repair is not possible.  The device was installed under our front porch roof and never gets wet.  Here in Southern California we do not get much rain at all.  We are close to the Pacific Ocean, but if that environment was an issue I'd expect notice of that on Ring's Website or in its user documentation! Waiting for the other two units to die now.  Time to look for an alternative option?  Probably! :-) UPDATE: 12/13/2019 To my great surprise Ring contacted me soon after this ""one-star"" review was first posted.  I talked to an actual person who told me Ring would send me a replacement video doorbell at no charge---plus send me a shipping label to return the failed unit.  That was despite the fact that the original device is now out-of-warranty. Wow!  I've changed my rating to ""four-stars"".  It is not a ""five-star"" product---yet---but is is getting better with every update of the device firmware and mobile app software. The most frustrating thing remains the sometimes long delay before one can actually see what triggered a motion alert and/or after requesting a ""live view"".  Too bad the device can't send video DIRECTLY to my mobile app whenever BOTH are connected to the same WiFi network! :-)",Plan on buying a new one every couple of years! (But maybe at no cost?)
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jan 2018,mark,"9/14/18 Just junk. The company is, too. I've had the same problems consistently with my Ring Pro since I got it. Always just the run around and blaming it on anything else. Now since the 1 year warranty ended, they say it's a hardware issue and is out of warranty. Dishonest company and junk product. 2/4/18 It does NOT work as much as it works. It's unreliable for sure.  Customer service will always blame it on your setup and require you to painstakingly do a hundred steps to get them information about your setup. But, again, it will be blamed on your setup. I get 100 times more reliability from an ip camera compared to this. June 19, 2018 via email to customer service: So for awhile now, my Frontdoor Ring notifies me someone has rung the doorbell, I click on the notification, and the Ring app takes about 10 seconds before saying it is having trouble connecting. Then it does not refresh so I can try to go to Live View - No devices available, so I have to close out of the app and reopen it. I click on Live View so I can talk to the person waiting there fpr now 25 or 30 seconds with no indication that I'm trying to see who's at my door. Upon connecting to Live View, I can see a black screen with the green and red call buttons. No video or picture of the other person. It will do this no matter how many times I close out and try again. Live view works fine later on when I no longer need it. My speed at the device is very good, but it has been said that the signal is just ok. I have used the Chime Pro, both close to the wireless access point as well as closer to the Ring and also mid-way. None helped a single bit. The Chime Pro didn't seem to help with all of the issues I've had with the Pro. I have a ubiquiti lite ap about 20 feet away. Of course, no issues with other devices, even if I'm 50 feet further from the ap outside and around the corner. It's just the Ring Pro that has issues. Always has been the case. Anyway, just letting you know. I'm not going through the 100 steps that you blanketly request whenever there is an issue with your product. Just frustrated with your product and service, as usual, because it does not work more than it actually works. Jan 15, 2018: Great idea but don't. Any issues, customer service will always give you a personalized blanket response that requires a lot of items for you to find our and answer. They do this even when they know the problem lies on their end. I suspect most people give up after the 1st or 2nd email because it is too much. I have the Ring and Ring Pro. Most of the time, they have issues of 10 minute notification delays as well as 15 minute video processing delays. They try to blame my system, and have done so over the past couple years, but it's quite evident it is their system. The system is almost useless.",Junk

Initially Tech Support told me I needed to replace my doorbell transformer. I called an electrician to replace the transformer but it still didn't work. I was told the transformer wasn't compatible but product info showed it was. Finally I spoke with a different tech support who found that I had simply set my Ring Pro for digital ring rather than mechanical. The expense & time I'd spent replacing the transformer was unnecessary. I also didn't realize that I'd have to pay a monthly fee after 30 days to see video except real time.  I also had trouble with the newspaper delivery person setting off motion sensor every night even after multiple adjustments. Since I installed my Ring Pro, I haven't been able to answer anyone at my door from my phone.  One time it had logged me off and I had that corrected. Other times I show there is someone at my door but haven't been able to get a screen to show for me to answer. Last week I was in my backyard when someone rang the bell and I was waiting for them but could not respond from my phone. I had to literally run around my house and stop them before the got into their vehicle. Again I found I had been logged out.  Today the same thing happened, I showed I'd been logged out and by the time I was able to log back in, there was no point. Friends who had the Ring in years past had recommended it but at this point, after many hours on the phone with tech support and no resolution, I am sorry I bought the unit.

The motion detection is absolute crap. I just received mine yesterday, and I set it up about an hour ago (easy setup, took about 5 minutes). I added a motion zone that covers our entire patio and it only goes off about 10% of the time when I walk directly in the motion zone, even when I wave my hand in front of the device. SIDE NOTE: pertaining motion zones, nobody wants their alert to go off when cars drive by - a motion zone should also be able to define a max distance of motion, so that I can just wrap the entire view in a motion zone and then measure the edge of our porch and set the limit there... instead, I'm left with making a motion zone that only covers the surface of the porch, to avoid alerting on people walking by on the sidewalk, cars, etc. Then, when I click on Live View it says ""Activating Device..."" and then times out with an error about 70% of the time. Our Wi-Fi connectivity is definitely not the issue, since A) our router is about 6 feet from the Ring, and B) I can connect my iPhone to our Wi-Fi from the middle of the street about 60 feet in front of the Ring, and I still have about half signal from there. I also just did a bandwidth test and got 119.16 Mb/s down, 12.16 Mb/s up, and 14ms ping. I'm holding off on returning this for the time being, so I can test this out further, but it's looking really bad so far.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Jun 2017,Stephen K.,"When it works, this product is very good (4 stars).  However, it didn't have a great range from my wifi/modem (45 feet, no material walls to interrupt the signal), so I subsequently needed to also purchase a wifi booster which solved the initial problem.  However, when it recently stopped recording for reasons unknown to Ring Support, I learned it needed to be reset which requires your physical presence at the doorbell, including dismantling the doorbell cover, pressing a reset button, and more.  Having purchased this device for a vacation home where I am absent for many months at a time, when the doorbell for no apparent reason went offline after the first 6 weeks, it became essentially useless unless I find someone to go to my home and follow the various instructions as to how to reset the device.  And of course, if it happens again in a day or a week, or whatever, then the reset drill has to be repeated.  I had anticipated that if these devices went off line due to a power outage, internet outage or otherwise, they could be reset remotely either automatically or via the Ring App as can be done with other remote cameras of similar price, however, apparently this is not the case.  I never would have purchased this product if I had understood these shortcomings.  One would think people who buy these types of items would need them to work/keep working on an ongoing basis, otherwise it defeats a good portion of its purpose.  Ring Support basically told me: sorry, that's the way it is/they can't do anything about it.",Performance not as expected/can't be reset remotely  - I would not buy this item again.

I hired a professional installer that Ring scheduled come to my home today and he could not get everything to work together.  First, I contacted Ring for assistance & they told me to replace the doorbell transformer which I did and then the installer told me that was not necessary?  Second, they told me my door chime in the house was not on the phantom ""approved list"" of door chimes which they then emailed to me. So I spent another fifty dollars to replace the door chime unit which, again, the installer said was not the problem.  The installer got it to ring once, with the help of their phone service, and said ""It's fixed, and we thought it was.  But after he left, I pressed the door bell button and the chime would not stop ringing.  It rang for a good 15 minutes, then I disconnected the wire to the chime in the house.  After that, the camera would not come on any longer.  So I packed it up and it's going back UPS Monday.

The first one was defective and I returned it after receiving a replacement from Amazon--the Amazon support staff is excellent--I replaced the Ring with the new one. It worked for two days and then quit.  I had surgery on the day it quit and did not realize there was a problem until I returned home from the hospital.  The Ring app suggests there is a problem with something and after reading all of the troubleshooting material from Ring--the last suggestion after eliminating all of the potential issues was a 'power supply' problem.

But if you plug it in and it doesn't, it is a nightmare. Mine is the nightmare. Allow me to explain and to warn those who may have an older home.  The Ring doorbell REQUIRES 16v to 24v to operate.  Older doorbell systems (that means the transformer that is connected in your wiring system to provide the low voltage to your doorbell buttons and chimes) use lower voltage, 12v and maybe less.  Ring WILL NOT WORK ON THAT VOLTAGE. If Ring's site, advertisements, and tech support would simply state the above, a lot of frustration and cursing (and waste of money) could be avoided.  But the company presents a cheery facade, and leaves their customers to figure this issue out on their own. If you know where your home's doorbell wiring transformer is located, it's not a big deal to swap it to another transformer to provide proper voltage.  I'm not that lucky. My house has no basement, and the wiring in the attic is under insulation; likely the transformer is behind a wall somewhere.  It'll cost $500 to $1000 for me to hire an electrician to make the change, or it'll take me an equivalent amount of time to do it myself.  ....  to install a $200 doorbell.

They even include a drill bit and screwdriver. I'd personally follow the instructions for setup via video in the app or online on their website as it's much easier to follow than the paper instructions included. For the latter, it's best to view the setup video before purchase to see if the device is compatible with the current setup have in your home. Hardware setup took me around 20-30mins and the only hard part about the setup is the wiring which the instructional video and labels make it simple and clear to follow. Software setup is much easier. You just download the app, make an account, link the app to your wireless connection and sync the device. After installing, for the first few hours it will work flawlessly, then it will have connection issues, where you have to contact customer support. My friend and I had this issue. You have to call the support number when this happens for a hard reset, like when calling Comcast to reset your router for your internet a few times a year. There is a subscription service involved, but is not required. Subscription service is basically for cloud video storage. The Ring device is always on and when someone rings the doorbell it records/saves the first 10secs before the press the doorbell until the camera notices it's clear and stops recording. You can also set up motion sensors for recording, and even share videos of suspicious activity with Ring users around the neighborhood.  You can view the recorded videos at anytime once it's automatically recorded. Subscription fee is $3 a month, or $30 a year ($2.5 a month). They give you a 30 day free trail to start. If you decided not to subscribe, you'll lose the video recording and sharing feature. I'd say the $30 a year is worth it for peace of mind. Without a subscription, you are able to: 1. Answer to door through voice on your smart phone. You can see them and they can't see you, but you can chat with them instead of having to use the door peep hole or look through our window blinds. This is great when you're in your underwear and want to answer the door before an important guests think no one is home then leaves. 2. When not home, you able to answer the doorbell like #1 in real time. You will get phone notification when the button is pressed. If you have the subscription it will record everything that is happening  as mentioned before, just in case you're busy and not able to answer the door via the app in time. Regardless of no subscription or subscription it will time stamp when the doorbell is rung in the history section 3. Able to monitor the front yard at anytime via the app. Just in case you're part of neighborhood watch for a burglar or suspicious person. Also good for keeping an eye out on the kids if they play out front. You can also call out to them when dinner is ready. Camera quality is really good. Similar to most back facing smart phone camera these days, but with a fish eye lens. Night vision camera quality is a bit lower, but you're able to make out things in detail Speaker quality is good also as it's slightly louder than smartphones when they're on speaker phone. Door bell ring. You can set it for digital or use your existing doorbell. I'd go for the latter if you live in a large home and not in the living room (or close to it) often as the digital ring can a bit low. The doorbell does not let off repeated rings (in case your guests are button happy). May be a negative or positive depending on how you view it. You will get alerted in both the app notification/sound and the door bell itself. Overall, very good doorbell that triples as a security cam, and one way video conference with guests.","Easy Setup, Subscription Required For Optimal Usage"
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Aug 2018,S&SBOYS,Don’t buy this or anything from ring.  Their product has major flaws and their customer service is terrible.  My ring pro (not at all professional) malfunctioned more than 5 times in the first month.  It was getting excessively hot and either the camera or mic would stop working.  After several failed attempts to troubleshoot Ring sent a new device and told me to return the original to them.  The second had a different design with what looked like ridges on the back similar to heat dispersing ridges to aid in cooling.  Evidently it didn’t work either because the second ring malfunctioned on the first day.  I called support to say I wanted a refund and they said they would refund after sending it back.  2 weeks later now they say they won’t refund the taxes because it was purchased from Amazon and not them.  Not only have I been waiting for the refund for weeks but now I’m out the taxes.  The agent said the other agent should have mentioned that.  I will NEVER purchase a ring product again.,Overheating issue and fraudulent customer service
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Dec 2016,TaraBelle,"I'm a bit of a research nerd, and after reading hundreds of reviews from various sources, I admit my enthousiasm about my impending Ring Pro purchase was a little dampened. However, after two weeks of frequent daily use, I'm excited to report that I experienced none of the technical issues reported by others! It was super easy to install and set up (I watched a YouTube video prior to beginning--research nerd! haha), and my Netgear AC 1900 has had zero issues keeping up with streaming demands. The router is on the first level approximately 20 feet from the front door. There is the standard light/sound unavoidable physics-type delay with the audio using the Talk feature, but it doesn't impede normal conversational flow. I purchased Ring Pro because solicitors are a huge headache in our neighborhood, and recently this irritation took a more sinister turn when a series of break-ins and home invasions cropped up in our area. The group responsible was found to be using a door-to-door sales ploy to case homes. I generally avoid answering the door during the day when I'm by myself and needed a way to screen visitors. It's a challenge in our open living/kitchen area which is lined front and back with large windows. Ring makes it easy for me to see whether I actually need to come to the door or not. What really sold me, though, was an unexpected purpose I found for it. I have elementary aged children who are starting to enter the level of responsibility where I feel comfortable leaving them home alone for brief periods. They have close relationships with many of our neighbors who are also home during the day, but without a LAN line and them not having cell phones, it was a bit risky. With Ring, if I'm running a few minutes late running errands, I can use Live View to watch them walk from the bus to the house, and, once on the porch, engage the Talk feature to let them know I'll be home soon. Even better, if they need me, all they have to do is ring the doorbell to alert my phone and engage Talk. They haven't needed me yet, but it's reassuring for me to know that in those minutes before I make it home, I can easily handle everything from settling an argument over the remote to reminding them what to do if they need an adult presence immediately. All in all one of the best purchases I've made. In a few more years when we have teens we'll probably go full-blown security system, but for now Ring Pro has exceeded every expectation. For those interested in the customer service and support angle, I have no feedback to offer there. Haven't needed it! :)",Exceeded My Expectations

After a guy came pounding on our door at 10:00pm wanting to ""use our phone"", we made a few changes. By the way, we didn't open the door. First off, we got a ""Dawn to Dusk"" porch light because we had forgotten to turn our light on. We're sure he was attracted to our house because it was dark. When we couldn't give the police a good description , we needed to have a video camera. After seeing the ads for Ring, we checked it out and were impressed. We got the Ring Doorbell Pro because we already had a wired doorbell and it looks most like a regular doorbell We now alerted  when anybody comes to our door, even when they just knock. We know when the mailman comes, when UPS makes a delivery or when we have visitors at 3:00am (see below). We can be anywhere when getting an alert. The ladies at work are just as interested as me to see who's at my door. We opted for the $30.00/yr. option to save video for 6 months. If we're not home when a shady character comes to the door it will take longer then 15 minutes to get the police involved. From what I understand, 15 minutes is as long as video is saved without a subscription. Go for it! You won't be disappointed.",Some fears resolved!

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 Jul 2017,Randy Ryneski,"I uploaded before and after door bell installation and chime setup. The chime setup was easy. Just follow instructions as illustrated. Keep those connections clear from the moving mechanism. The doorbell was not such an easy setup since my door bell mounting surface area needed to be modified. It required chewing out some of the wood with a hacksaw and wood chisel. Once a terminated all the connections and downloaded the app everything else went smoothly as far as app setup and wifi syncing goes. I took a star off for the subscription that they decide to let you know about after everything is set up. After the 30 free trial you no longer are allowed to save videos. As if you already pay enough for the device itself, Ring wants to throw a subscription model on you. Im only interested at seeing whos at my front door anyway so I know whether or not i should arm myself. But otherwise its a good product. Updated review: after having this for over a year there is constant hardware issues. Video, sound, and the speaker system is constantly freezing. Every so often I have to unwire the unit and rewire it to do a hard reset. Not good.",Very impressed
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jan 2019,Thomas J. Kuhn Jr.,"I am disappointed with the Ring products. The first Ring doorbell (Standard) I purchased (January 2, 2017) and received would not connect. This was an easy installation, the transformer had worked the standard push button doorbell for many years, and all voltages confirmed with a volt meter that it was working as designed. I spent a good 90 minutes working on the issue only to have to email customer service for assistance. The Ring tech support, after a few email exchanges, came to the conclusion that this was a Wifi issue. They were good enough to offer to send me a Chime, hoping that would fix the issue.  However, it did not. So round two they wanted to replace the mounting plate, After installing the new mounting plate, it appeared to solve my issue and life is good, well so I thought. Fast forward to September 14, 2018 when I decided to upgrade my doorbell to the PRO model.  Sounded like it was far better than the old standard model. The new doorbell was again an easy installation, one minor component at the transformer and replace like for like, this was easy. Fast forward a months, October 2018.  I took my old doorbell to the other house so I could make sure things were always good there.  Well, this installation required all my skills as there was no transformer to install too.  I had to wire in a transformer and connect the doorbell.  It's a good thing I had a great teacher. So with both doorbells up and running I was very excited. Well fast forward to January 2019, I am back at the original house and my wife is at the second house.  Now the reason I only give Ring a 1 star.  The get one for the amazing still picture quality that they offer on my phone.  The reason they loose 4 starts, The picture quality, even though amazing, is so choppy (along with audio) that I can walk about 10 feet and the frame stops and starts bringing me in and/or out, all choppy.  That loss of picking up a person until they are at the door or even inside is so un-secure that these devices are not worth what I paid for them.  And then to not record while someone is in view is even a higher risk.  A person could literally hide their face and watch their time and then when recording stops, uncover and go about the dirty business. So lets talk about the choppy audio.  Again after several emails to the Ring Tech, they advised me that a simple reset of the device would solve this issue, yes it did for about 30 days.  The new unit, PRO, is so bad my wife, who is at the second house for the winter, will only say hi on the Ring.  She can't hear a word I am telling her after about 10 seconds so we can't have any conversations.  I guess I need to reset the unit again, and that requires removing the device from the house and then reinstalling it on the house.  This task looks like it needs to be done every few weeks in order to have a conversation with someone outside my house. The Android software has never crashed until Ring shut me down.  I had money in the account but they still chose to stop any activity until I reset the account to a full 2x recording costs for a year. This appears to be a great product but has many features that need improved.  I'll am so disappointed in what I have done, might just shut down the standard unit and bring that unit back to the original house as it worked best here.  Then I might just trash the PRO as it doesn't work as expected.",Not up to the Tasks

When the temperature drops below 10 degrees F, (The device is spec'd to work to -5F)  the doorbell starts ringing and the camera keeps turning on, as if there is motion.  The temperature dropped to +1F in the past 2 nights. There was no motion in the area. The same location is also monitored by Arlo camera, that showed no activity. The other Ring doorbell I have did does not have this issue and works well in  the cold. I called technical support. The technical support appears to be farmed out to an overseas call center. The agent had a hard time understanding thermal failures. She said that she had no instructions in her trouble shooting guide for thermal issues. Her only advise was to pull out the battery and see if that fixed it. She insisted that the Ring Pro has a battery! She did not have any working knowledge of the product or it's specifications. She is only allowed to say what is in her script manual. She is not required to understand the product, only read the script. Her resolution was for me to call back when the temperature drops below 10 degrees F, in the middle of the night, and she can then have me pull the battery. She sent me an e-mail advising me to call back when the unit is failing again (2AM in the morning, only below 5F), and she will then have me pull the battery, so that she can say that I followed her scripted trouble shooting.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,07 Oct 2016,Terry J. Keaton,"Update: AVOID!!  Have had problems with this since we purchased it, but dealt with it. Was able to see people on our iPad that is dedicated to the Ring, we have the Ring Pro and two spotlight cameras that are hard wired. With new update you have to physically tap the app to see the video. We don’t want to run across the house to tap an app to see if someone is approaching. Not why we purchased it. Supposed to have video pop up when motion detector is activated. I believe this reneged on their promises for services and they have defrauded me. The equipment and electricians were not cheap and now that money was wasted. What a bitter disappointment. Wanted this so my disabled wife could see what was going on at the front door. Was hoping the live view was continuous, but not. In fact,  the live view won't work at all. Finally got the motion detection to work, does well. Works fine when the doorbell is pushed. Slight delay between pushing and chime sounding is not a big deal. Wife is ok with the motion detection and doorbell activation, so we'll keep it. Wish the live view worked. Customer service at Ring read my review, contacted me, and fixed everything. Ended up sending a bypass and Chime (free) to bypass the original doorbell and increase current to get all the Ring's activities working just fine. Since everything is now working as it should, I have increased my review to 5 stars. Really great device. Well, after installing the bypass, Chime, updating, etc., the Live View still does not work. First the Chime quit working when the Doorbell was pushed. Deleted, reinstalled. Now the chime works, but Live View is out again. Tried to get help via Ring and the in-app help and haven't heard a thing. I want to give up on it and get surveillance cameras and intercoms, but my wife doesn't. So, we are keeping an expensive system that does not work as described or desired. Hopefully others won't have as much disappointment. Recommend looking into surveillance systems and weighing the cost vs frustration. While I still cannot give this doorbell a five star, the company is amazing. They ended up sending me a new Ring Pro, which I installed. Still had problems with it. Dierre, my contact at Ring, kept trying things and having me try things to get it to work properly. Still had issues with no live view, bell not ringing, camera working intermittently, other pains. Dierre and Ring kept working to try and solve. When nothing else worked, they ended up sending out a technician to troubleshoot at my home. To recap: I purchase the ring here at $220.00. Ring sent me a bypass and Chime ($30.00), a new Ring ($220.00 min), sent a technician ($80.00/hr min), and countless hours from Dierre and others at Ring to clear up my problems. I may not be thrilled with the bell (which does work now, with reservations), but I am extremely impressed with the company. Don't know of very many businesses that go that far past the point of diminishing returns, but they have drastically increased this customer's satisfaction. If you are interested in getting this type of home home security, get a Ring. You probably won't have the problems I have, but any you do have will be handled by Ring until you are satisfied with the results.","New update- Waste of money, reneged on promise, feeling defrauded"

Now, at the end of summer 2019, I have a couple hundred dollars' worth of useless plastic attached to my home. Pros: -I got one FedEx employee written up for literally throwing a box marked ""fragile"" on my doorstep. -Sometimes I got motion notifications and the video would be a cute bird catching a bug attracted to my porch plants. -You can change the sound of the chime (in the app and in the peripheral, see below) to some fun seasonal options, like a wolf howling for Halloween. -The Ring neighbors app is, in theory, a good place to see videos other users have posted of sketchy things. In practice, it's mostly rich white people being racist about ""strange people"" knocking on their door.  Mostly what look like kids trying to raise funds for their soccer teams.  I call this a pro because I at least get to laugh at paranoia and call out people in my own socioeconomic demographic for being jerks. Cons: -CONSTANT motion sensors going off, no matter how much you fine tune your ""zones"" and ask the sensor to only focus on human activity.  Cars driving on the street waaaaaay off in the distance set it off. -LAG.  The time between when someone comes to the door/rings the bell and when you get a notice is soooo long.  As mentioned above, since I didn't have a hardwired chime in the home, I went ahead and splurged on the $30 chime peripheral that allows this thing to act like an actual doorbell.  That lag also impacted how long it took the chime to sound. -Annual cost - I'm sure you'll see plenty of people mention this, but yes. In addition to the initial outlay, you also need to pay an annual fee to ""keep"" your videos.  It's not the worst, it's not the best.  The cost was worth it to me to get that one FedEx guy in trouble but *shrug*. -Doesn't work with all smarthome ecosystems.  When I initially researched this, it was supposed to be able to work with Google Home. Amazon bought Ring. Guess what happened. -and here's the big one: it. stopped. working. All of the sudden, apparently, this thing bricked itself.  I didn't get any kind of notification or anything. I just realized one day that I hadn't gotten any ""false alarm"" motion notifications in a while, and when I looked, my doorbell was offline.  I followed all the troubleshooting and even turned power off and on at the breaker, which basically confirmed something wrong with the device (because it powered up for a second and then went kaput again).  After too long a call with the customer service people (who made me do all the same stuff AGAIN, despite me telling them I had already done them), they said ""oh, we'll send you a new one!""... ...except then they told me they would charge me for the new one if I didn't return the old one in 30 days.  And when I asked if they were sending a tech to uninstall the device hardwired into my home and install the replacement, they said no.  I am neither confident enough nor qualified to install something like this (I did my thermostat, but that's much more straightforward), and I already paid for installation once.  And if I couldn't get it swapped out in a month, I'd be charged for a new one again? And this one isn't really that great? Nah. I just ordered a Nest Hello instead.  Yes, I'll still have to pay someone to install it, and yes, they also have a subscription service, but it's compatible with my other smart home devices so there's that.

First thing first, the package provides everything you need to install minus some basic tools like a drill and hammer if you need the included hollow wall plugs. This was installed on stucco. I would suggest buying the Ring Chime Pro with this product in case you need to extend your WiFi to connect as I had trouble getting the Ring Pro connected. You can always return it if not needed. Or setup a WiFi mesh network like Google WiFi to ensure a strong signal. Stucco will block your signals. A quick chat with Ring support helped me to figure out this problem. One giant issue: if you run into the WiFi connectivity issues AFTER physically installing your Ring Pro in it's final location (and hooking up the controller in the chime box and wired up the Ring Pro at the old push button location,) and are unable to complete the App setup, the Ring Pro will not operate your existing chime in the meantime. So I was forced to re-install the push button, re-establish the connections in the chime and place the Ring Pro aside while I waited for the Chime Pro to arrive. In a few days, I plugged the newly arrived Chime Pro in an outlet inside the front entry, re-installed the physical components at the chime and finally the Ring Pro. In the app, installed the Chime Pro and connected to my WiFi then connected the Ring Pro to the Chime Pro. Success! But... The Ring support FAQ's indicated that the Ring Pro will work with our NuTone BK125LWH-1 mechanical chime. Not so fast. We have a single chime, single push button setup; basic. After solving the initial setup issue, I noticed existing chime now doesn't chime once the Ring Pro button is pressed. To compound the issue, a day later the Ring Pro stopped working too. This time you'll have to knock! Wasn't going to uninstall all the physical components.  Discovered the Ring Pro and chime setup had burned out the existing transformer. Bought and replaced with a like kind NuTone transformer. Two days later, same result. The Ring FAQs and support mentions nothing of the transformer issues with NuTone/Braun chimes. I suspected that I needed a transformer that had the amperage to handle a two chime, single button setup. So I ordered the NuTone C907 16V, 30VA Transformer; a 15a step up. Again  a few days later received and installed. Success again!!! After more than a week, all is working. Love the motion alerts and ability to see who's at the door and telling the annoying sales people that I'm busy.  Only thing, after the initial 30 day trail, you'll need to pay for cloud recording. One minor issue. Our terrible 24mbps internet connection doesn't like the traffic from the Ring Pro and our Nest products (Thermostats, Protects and cameras). So upgrade your speed. Goes without saying as though. Good product but needs to operate the existing mechanical chime if the WiFi goes offline. FAQs need beefing up. Pros Prompt notification of motion and door bell ring Good video quality Good night vision Cons Will not operate the existing mechanical door bell if the WIFi connection isn't established/lost Need to upgrade the NuTone/Braun mechanical​ door bell (single bell setup) transformer to the NuTone C907 16V, 30VA Transformer Need to pay subscription for cloud recording past the initial 30day period Need a high mbps internet connection for clear real time video and audio","Learn from my install issues, have a good internet speed and be aware of subscription"

I've had a lot of frustration with this product and was considering returning it. It required a lot of troubleshooting after installation based on what was within its view. I suspect the original firmware had problems with audio/video quality that was fixed with a factory reset and registration as a new doorbell. A WiFi router sets about five feet behind the doorbell. Motion detection was triggered at sunrise every day, waking my dog and I up, and I was faced with a puppy who wanted to interact with me an hour before my alarm went off. This was fixed a few weeks later by installing a wedge kit to angle the camera so a wall was not in view. Pros - Easy setup. Get notified by phone. Easy to download video of events. Able to talk with people. Can setup active motion zones. Night vision. Fish eye lens covers a large area. Can snooze motion detection while you cut grass or hang out on the porch.

When I saw the ""new"" Ring Pro, released three months after my original purchase, I was interested. But Ring.com has a ""no upgrade"" policy. No loyalty discounts, no bonus offers, nothing. You buy a completely new device as if you were a new customer. I don't like that, but I guess I can understand their policy... they're probably still a smallish niche company, needing to stretch their revenue as much as possible. Yea. Fast forward to Prime Day 2017 when the Ring Pro was one of the deals. At least I could fool myself into thinking I got a discount. Prime delivery was fast, but installation was a bit more tricky on the Pro. I don't understand the ""pro power kit"" which is apparently necessary, but easy enough to install. The doorbell mounting was tricky, as I needed a ""retrofit"" plate to cover the existing holes, and the wires for the doorbell itself were short with not much room for play. But either way, still something an average DIY homeowner can do in an hour. As with the original Ring, hardware and packaging was fantastic, but software falls short. I needed to run thru Wifi set up twice for some reason. The first time it worked, and when I pressed the doorbell button, my phone immediately notified me MUCH faster than the original. Second time I pressed the doorbell button, the blue ring spun around in circles and never notified my phone, and no events were logged. It stayed spinning blue for an hour, at which point I did a hard-reset and re-ran the setup process, and then it started to behave as expected. But there is a really weird 5 or so second lag on the MECHANICAL DOORBELL ITSELF. When I press the Ring button, my phone is notified, and THEN a few seconds later my mechanical chime rings.That lag was consistent. I figured something went wrong again, so I again did a hard-reset but the lag was still there. Pondering this issue, I had my hand resting on the Ring Pro and it was noticeably, and uncomfortably, warm. Not hot, but warmer than I think it should be. Since physical installation was kinda tricky, I didn't really want to dismount the Ring Pro and fiddle with it to make sure nothing was crossed. Eventually settled on removing Ring Pro and putting the original back. This is all too bad, because when it did work, it was very fast to notify, ring views were nice and sharp, and I loved the idea of the motion zones, even if I didn't get to play with them...",Ring Pro doorbell

Application Guides posted on Amazon states ""you'll need to replace your existing doorbell's transformer with the provided 24VAC transformer"".  However, same application guide mentions 230VAC input power so it appears that this guide is for Europe, but same guide gives a US phone number for help from Ring. Ring web site states that a 16-24VAC transformer is required. No mention of VA.  However, the help section of the web site says ""Your Ring Pro requires a power source that supplies a minimum of 16 volts AC at ~20 volt-amps when connected directly to a transformer or plug-in adapter, or ~30 volt-amps when used with an internal doorbell"".  I tried installing with my existing 16V - 10VA transformer but the Ring Pro never powered up.  I then purchased a 16V - 20VA transformer but found no improvement. I even tried a 20V 30VA transformer.  I called Ring who said 16V - 10VA transformer is all that is needed and if it did not power up then Pro is defective.

After reading other reviews, I verified first that the existing transformer was 16V. Following the videos and instructions, I had no trouble installing. I was a tiny bit disappointed that the unit did not recognize my 5GHz network, but I installed it on the 2.7GHz.  It came up no problem. I customized the range, the schedule of alarms and motion detection with no problem. However, recently, we had both a power outage and two mild earthquakes, and for whatever reason, the Ring Pro quit working. I didn't know if I had a electrical problem or a network problem. Before I tore into tracing power hookups, etc., I called Ring Customer Service and talked to Joyann.  With her on the line, she walked me through checking if the unit had power to it, recycling power at the circuit box, etc. In about ten minutes she concluded the Ring had gone belly up for some reason, and ordered a new unit to be sent.  I was told it would be 5-7 days, but I received it in 2 days.  I am awaiting the separately sent power unit harness to reinstall to original effectiveness.

Upgraded to four stars due to the fact that this is a pretty cool piece of technology. The unit I bought was bad and that was the reason I was not able to get it working.

Be warned that this install might seem simple and in theory it is. I cant write a complete review at this point because I have not been able to get it to power up. Customer service from ring so far has been meh. I have gone through two new transformers and still will not completely power up. Do not just look at your doorbell system and assume that if the chime states it’s a 16 volt system that you are actually getting that. Seriously put a meter on the connection at the door to see what you are getting. My original transformer was a 16v/10a one but only was getting 11v at the door as well as the at the TF. Enter TF number two...16v/10a now putting out 20v (lol) even at the door. Now I started getting a flicker at the Ring unit but still will not ring the chime or power up. Thought maybe it was an amp issue. Enter TF number three at 16v/30a and the exact same results so far. Again, customer service has been meh and not really helpful.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,20 Jul 2016,R.S.,"In the end I give this 4 stars. I have deducted one star from an otherwise correctly working product mainly due to the installation issue I had. First things first: Now it is working fine. I have no issues at all with it. The notifications come through quickly. Motion is detected properly. The current firmware version of my Doorbell Pro is 1.1.30. Also note that my home internet connection is quite good (50 Mbit/s down; 5 Mbit/s up; Comcast cable). My wireless router (latest version Apple Airport Extreme) is about 10 feet away from the Ring Doorbell Pro right on the other side of the front door. Back to the installation issue: As instructed I connected the Pro Power Kit to the existing doorbell. I replaced the existing doorbell button with the Ring Doorbell Pro. I finished the setup through the app on my phone. Everything seemed to work fine. Only one major issue: Every night around 10 PM the doorbell would stop responding. Completely dead. The only way to get it to work again was to either reset the Ring Doorbell Pro (which is hard; take off the cover; hold the button on the side) or power cycle the doorbell transformer. I contacted Ring support and they sent me on a wild goose chase. Reset the doorbell (I already did that). Check internet connection (connection is fine; that is clearly not the problem here). No help from Ring support. After I couple of days of resetting the doorbell every morning I wondered why it was failing every evening. Then it dawned on me: At some point in the evening it will switch on its IR LEDs which cause it to use more power! I checked my current transformer (Broan Nutone 515T) and that was only rated 10 V; 5 VA. Not enough to power the Ring Doorbell Pro. I replaced it with a generic 16 V; 10 VA transformer and have had no issues since. I should have realized this sooner. Using the old transformer the mechanical doorbell would only ""ding"" when pressing the Ring Doorbell Pro. With the new transformer it is doing the proper ""ding-dong"" sound.",Good product after some installation issues.

If you don't, as I did, the doorbell will have a series of frustrating problems from not connecting to your wifi to turning off randomly, etc. Tech support was super helpful and identified the issue quickly: my old doorbell used a 10V transformer, they recommend 16-24v. This was easy to change out once I found where the transformer was. No similar issues since. Other than that, the basic functionality has worked well: it looks nice (I like the subtle glow of the ring around the button at night), is a nice form factor for replacing an old doorbell, and when the button is pressed it connects to your phone pretty fast in our experience so far. I also like that it works with my Wink hub, allowing, for instance, using alerts of various kinds to trigger Wink robots. The motion alerts have required the most tweaking so far. You can create zones to monitor and set the sensitivity. It's been a trial and error process to find a setup that minimizes false alarms while notifying us reliably when something of interest occurs: we initially had the default sensitivity but placed the zone only over our yard and not the road. This created a lot of false alarms, e.g. when headlights sweep across our yard at night. Turning down the sensitivity meant we missed some alerts like mailmen walking up. We now have as just a zone covering the whole view but at its lowest sensitivity (labeled ""people only"") and it has seemed reliable so far (though its obviously hard to know what you missed -- it catches us every time at least). It would be nice to control the sensitivity of each zone separately, I think this would catch some of the edge cases. Regardless, we've already captured one attempted mail thief on camera. The videos are easy to download and share, and you are invited to join other ring users in your area in a neighborhood group to share videos.",Tech support was super helpful and identified the issue quickly

They had me open the chime device to ensure it was compatible, which it was. Then they had me search my house for a transistor, which I found and told them the resistor was 18v and 10VA. They said that my transistor was the culprit behind the device failing to power on, even though I had power at the doorbell wiring, and even though my first device remained powered on with zero issues for about 4-5 months. The resistor needs to be at least 30 VA (duh)!  They told me I’ll have to replace the resistor, which could conveniently be purchased from them (Amazon), or upgrade to their $499 doorbell.

The Ring Pro has a very noticeably clearer picture than my other camera (so much so, that I am now replacing that camera with one of the Ring Stick Up cams). Installation was simple and easy (took less than 15 minutes). Before my purchase, I read through a lot of the reviews and seen a few consistent complaints, so I figured I'd address them based on my experience. From what I can tell, it appears they have all been resolved. 1) Wifi connectivity issues - I seen several complaints that it would randomly disconnect from wifi without notice. My Pro is reading a constant ""Good"" wifi signal, and has not disconnected once. 2) Delay in recording once motion is detected - I genuinely couldn't ask for this thing to pickup motion any faster. For example, when I go to walk out my front door, before my foot can touch my porch, my phone is vibrating to let me know motion was detected. In fact, last night I got a notification that motion was detected while watching TV. Pulled up my phone and played the recording, and it literally started as a cricket was in mid-air jumping onto one of the stones on the siding of my house. Not really sure you could ask for more than that. 3) Delay in doorbell chime inside the house after button is pressed - So, a few people mentioned that someone would hit the doorbell button, their phone would go off, but it would take 5-15 seconds before their chime actually rang out in the house. I have a standard hardwired digital chime in my house. I will say there is a very slight delay (half second to one second), but it is so short it is almost unnoticeable (the only reason I noticed it was because since I'd seen the complaints, I specifically wanted to test for it). Had I not have been actually looking for the delay, I wouldn't have even noticed it. 4) Price plan for multiple cameras - So, ring offers their cloud service (which you have to have in order to save your recordings) for $3/mo or $30/yr per camera. There was one or two people who were upset that a discount wasn't offered for those owning multiple cameras (if you've got a big house and purchase 10 cameras, after all, that adds up). I am happy to say that Ring has added a second plan that is $10/mo or $100/yr for unlimited cameras. So, if  you've got 3 or less, stick with the per-camera plan. Otherwise, definitely switch to the unlimited. After calling customer support to ask, if you currently have 3 cameras, have paid your $30 each for the year, and add a fourth, you can either call or go online to convert your plan to the unlimited. They'll issue a credit for any remaining time you had, so the most you'll ever pay is $100/yr (if you do the annual plan instead of monthly). They also give you a 30 day free trial so you can check it out before you decide whether to sign up for the plan or not. So, my only complaint thus far about the Pro is that the angled mounting bracket is not included, and must be purchased separately. In my opinion, this should be a standard part of the installation kit. Most people probably won't need it. That said, my doorbell is located directly next to a stone wall. As a result, without that bracket to tilt the doorbell away from the wall, 50% of my picture is just the wall. To make matters worse, this causes period issues where the camera will focus on one of the stones instead of the walkway, so someone walking up is *slightly* blurry, and at night, the IR lights shine on the stones and wash out the remainder of the picture. You can still see a person walking up at night, but you can't see them until they get right up to the door. The bracket is cheap, and should solve the problem entirely, it's just annoying to have to purchase it separately. In the grand scheme of things, though, not really a big deal, and certainly not worth knocking off stars. I'd just suggest that if you think you may need it, go ahead and order it. Worst case scenario, you can always return the bracket if you don't need it, but it's a lot easier to set everything up once and be done than to have to take it down, add the bracket, and remount it. TL;DR - Amazing product, even better customer support, and previous issues have been fixed/addressed. Definitely recommend. Will definitely be purchasing other Ring products in the near future.",Can't Recommend Enough
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,11 Jun 2019,Phil in Baltimore,"What a great idea. Unfortunately execution of the product leaves much to be desired. Audio from outside at the doorbell to an inside device like a cell phone or iPad is terrible. No amount fiddling around with it, as recommended by Ring customer service, could improve performance. Even a signal booster (repeater) sold by Ring and touted to make everything all right was a waste of money and time. It did not make things all right. It did not even improve function one iota. Ring customer care continued to encourage me to buy a new router or other device to boost the signal. I asked them to send me one and I would try it. They declined. I am not about to spend another$300+ on more equipment that may or may not work. It's funny how all other Wi-Fi equipment works perfectly through my Verizon FIOS router. But not this Ring door bell device! I sent it all back to Ring and to Amazon today. My advice: save your money. There are a lot of better video devices that are way better for security and less intrusive. Too bad I didn't know this beforehand, or maybe that I was too pig-headed to listen to others and their reviews. You have been warned... Caveat Emptor!",Complete disappointment
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Jun 2020,Mark,"Installation of the hardware was fine, right up until we had to mount the doorbell to the supplied angle bracket. The instructions say use the two short machine screws to do so. The only problem is that those screws were only 1/4"" long, and would not even come out the back of the doorbell, much less screw into the angled base holes. We spent an unnecessary hour or so going through jars and plastic drawers, without finding any workable machine screws, before giving up and using some self-tapping sheet metal screws. Apparently they don't have any measuring tools in China! So, once the hardware was installed and powered up, we downloaded the app, created an account and proceeded to follow the in app instructions, right up to locating our home wi-fi router. The app could find our neighbor's routers, each at least 75' away, but could not find either or our home networks (2.4 and 5.0) with a router only 25' away. Alexa, multiple lighting devices, multiple streaming devices and multiple iPhones and computers have no problem. But Ring appwas stymied. The suggested solution: bring the Ring device into the same room as our router! SAY WHAT? Turn the power back off, remove the faceplate, remove the mounting screws, hope the device recognizes the networks when within 6"" and then reinstall the device? What a PITA! So, too much time invested to return, but we cannot recommend this device. UPDATE: After additional research, I discovered Ring's recommendation to reset the router through the admin process, to make sure I was using 2.4 on channels 1-11. Should have made no diffference, because the Pro is supposed to work with both 2.4 and 5.0, but I did go in and check. Everything was fine on that end, no need to change any settings. Restarted router, and wonder of wonders, Ring found both networks it could not find the day before! Joined network and completed installation. So, I raised rating from 1 to 3 stars, because the Ring does what it is touted to do, once installed. However, the installation and set up tasks are way too difficult, especially when one has to scrounge for mounting screws. This is not ""plug and play!""",I Already Hate This Device ....!

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,05 Oct 2020,fpink3,"Ring acts like they don't need the business of their customers. This doorbell worked fine for 12 months. Then it stopped working. It was installed according to the instructions, including using the Ring Power Pro voltage attachment. The instructions from Ring said an additional resistor was NOT necessary, even though I had one. But it died anyway. The Ring customer service rep said the resistor was necessary. So a product that cost over $250 required two additional gizmos to be installed even though only one was supposed to be required. Ring said they would give me a 30% discount on a replacement if I buy it through Ring, because it was now two months over the 12 mount warranty. So that's a $60 discount on a $250 product that lasted 14 months. I live in two houses in two states. I didn't return to the house using the Ring until after the 12 month warranty period. I cannot recommend this product because the company isn't capable of acknowledging their product failed in an unacceptably short period of time. They said if I had opted for the expensive monthly plan (which was unnecessary for me), I would have been given new unit.

Plus for those that cannot read the 'No Solicitation' sign in our window?!?! Signing up for the video plan plus having the ability to see what else is happening with the ""Nearby Incidents"" feature is showing us that people with neffarious motives seem to see the Ring on our homes and realize that something is happening; this seems to deter the smarter ones because they know they are on video.

Being able to view people at your door before answering it is priceless and if you choose to talk to them, you can do so without having to open your door.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,4.0,Reviewed in the United States ,24 Jan 2019,cycling chemist,"After giving up on the Doorbell Pro I wrote a review that expressed my disappointment with the  unit.  I received an email from Ring Customer Service stating that they wanted to ""make it right.""  I was skeptical but responded to the email and talked to a technical support person from Ring.  The problem I was having was caused by the algorithm used by the camera for motion detection.  I am a scientist and have used vision systems before so I assumed the algorithm was sophisticated enough to ignore light from the street that is at 90 degrees from the camera view.  Instead, headlights and tail lights triggered motion alerts at night even when the lights were outside the motion areas I had set up on the camera.  In addition, I was using motion alerts to turn on a floodlight for 3 minutes.  The result was that the light would come on  from a car then motion was was triggered again when the floodlight turned off 3 minutes later.  The light flashed on and off all night long.  Ring replaced the Doorbell Pro with a Doorbell 2 which uses passive IR for motion detection and it works without a problem.  They even reimbursed me the difference in cost of the two units.  In the end I'm happy. Previous review: I have tried very, very hard to like this product but in the end I'm very disappointed.  In order to eliminate false alarms I have to turn the sensitivity down to the point where it responds to absolutely nothing.  One option is to use motion zones but the zones don't seem to work at all.  Motion outside the zones trigger an alarm as easily as motion in the zones.  In addition, if I turn an outside light on it identifies that there is motion.  My intention was to use smartthings to turn an outside light when the doorbell sees motion.  The light turns on with motion (outside a zone many times) then when the light turns off after motion ceases a motion alarm triggers.  This means that the light flashes on and off all night.  This is unacceptable and no better than a low tech and inexpensive alternative.  This was a giant waste of money.",Wrong doorbell for my application

The cautionary note here is that it is possible that i lost or messed up the wiring to the point that I would have no doorbell at all.  Proceed at your own risk.  I couldn't find any write-ups on the web so I figured I would share a few pics of what I did and it worked.  I had to pull with decent force to bend the wire and pull it through the hole . I could also tell I had sufficient extra wire before I started drilling.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,15 Jun 2018,David H,"I purchased the new bell and was initially impressed by the very detailed step by step illustrated instructions. I was also impressed that all items needed for install was included, hate nothing more than stopping and having to go to the hardware store for a part. The install went quick and the initial connection to my router was pretty straight forward, but then this is where it came to a stop. To clarify my router is new and was bought with enough signal strength to reach my detached garage 100 feet away and it does with 4 to 5 bars. The door bell is about 9 feet away and showed good signal strength so it should have been a breeze. Going step by step in the app which was again very detailed and straight forward but it turned out not to be. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app 5 times before I could get the bell to hook up to my router which it finally did, (by this time I was on the phone with support which was friendly and seemed knowledgeable) this process took about 45 min and when it finally worked it lasted about 30 mins. Did the same process as above again and this time it lasted about 8 hours. Customer service thought that part of the issue was the bell needs a bit of time to power up as they started and once it did and downloaded new updates it should be fine, but it was not the case. I went through uninstall and reinstall again and it took for about 6 hours before disconnecting and would not reconnect by itself I had to remove and reinstall. I have an orbi router with a satellite and I'm not sure if the software with the bell is just not friendly with it or what but I finally removed it and returned it which as always with amazon went smoothly. I'm sure it is a good product but it did not work for us.

"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 May 2019,Human Collapse,"I have had my Ring Doorbell Pro installed for roughly 2 weeks now. I was super excited about it when I first installed it because it was my first security camera and I've wanted one for a long time. It initially seemed like a pretty good little camera, with the obvious pluses of being a doorbell (and immediately catching a Fed-Ex guy tossing a package over the railing rather than taking the extra 5 steps around said railing...) and also being able to send me notifications and 2-way communications, live. My biggest issues are as follows: 1. It seems to pick and choose when it wants to activate night vision (which is apparently only tinted green rather than actually truly colorized) and when it acknowledges that the front porch light and other lights on the front of the house, are on. In green-night vision mode it seems to be super blurry and distort colors like crazy. I haven't figured out what causes this yet because it changes from night to night apparently. When I was testing this, I was wearing a black t-shirt that looked blue, and orange gym shorts that looked grey for some reason. It drops all detail and only leaves the shapes of things. It even cuts out definition of white pieces of trim on the house, next to the door in the attached pictures. You can hardly make out the sidewalk in front of the porch in one picture and it's clear as can be in the other... My $20 Wyze Cams produce far better non-colored night vision video, without the IR lights on! I hopped online and started researching this. A lot of people have had their Ring doorbells just randomly go blurry/reduced image quality (even in the day) and their customer support either says that it's an issue with the customer's wifi and too bad, or they send them a new one. Mine started doing this (only at night so far) after only a week and a half of ownership! 2. WiFi shows that it's at about -50 (50%). My Wyze Cams are all over the house, further away from the router than the doorbell and read from 96-100%. Those cost $20 for pete's sake! They must be using some super cheap WiFi chips or something if my SUPER SUPER SUPER cheap wireless cameras are reading about 50% better, from up to 2x further away. 3. This thing gives me notifications all the time for no reason! My motion is set to the 2nd lowest position and I drew detection zones to keep the street and trees out of the motion zone, but it doesn't seem to care. The only thing that might be moving are blades of grass in the wind. I find it hard to believe that's what's causing it when it doesn't even pick up when I'm pulling out of the far side of the driveway even though my car briefly passes through the detection zone set to try to protect the cars from thieves... 4. Monthly fees. This is on me for not finding a different camera that didn't require $3/mo to save videos. I just accepted it. Then I found several other doorbells cams that aren't as big names, but are still well known and reputable, that don't require a monthly or annual fee. Again I have to look at Wyze Cams because they're so cheap and they store clips for a rolling 14-days, for free. They are definitely much shorter clips, but with a cheap SD card saving up to several days of rolling video, that doesn't matter! What it comes down to is this doorbell camera works, but Ring really needs to address their software and also consider reducing their monthly fees. They should offer a model with an SD card slot for continuously rolling video too. I'm guessing the <$7 for an SD card does not outweigh their profits though. For the name-brand and price of this device, I expected a lot more and I'm considering returning it and just sticking another $20 Wyze Cam under the soffit over my door...",Hit or miss I guess...

Cowan,"Update: Sep 2019 After almost 3 yrs of use the doorbell disconnected from WIFI and would not reconnect.  No amount of directions for how to fix it, including moving a WIFI router to within 2 feet of it, fixed the issue.  It is dead.  I can't honestly recommend this product. Update: June 2019 I've had to downgrade this item, after 2.5 yrs of use the thing consistently times out when trying to talk/hear audio.  I moved one of my Google Wi-Fi pucks to within 1 ft of the front door in case it was wi-fi access, nothing has changed.

I have it installed since January 2017.  It generally serves its purpose, but I've noticed a few things that you may be interested in knowing before purchase. First off when it works as expected its quite good.  I can clearly view and answer the door bell from my phone while at home (I have a 3 story house, this can be very useful to keep me from rushing to the door). Issues arise when I travel.  Often the video feed will not load in the app on my phone.  The Ring application says the video feed has timed out (even when the phone is connected by LTE or WIFI). I am generally at home and sometimes I get delayed notifications of motion or none at all.  There is no consistency to it.  It works probably 80% of the time correctly, so its not enough for me to be upset, but certainly it could be better. Lastly, I have a huge issue with needing to pay to keep video clips in cloud storage.  I've paid $250 for your video doorbell, I believe you can throw in a week of clips for free.",When it works as expected its good.
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,28 Feb 2018,Neal W Berggren,"For something that is advertised as a quick installation this was anything but easy.  Now that it works I can say that it works fine and mostly meets expectations.  If it wasn't for the install issues I would have given it 4 stars. Getting it to work was a 10 day event, replacing transformers, calls with Ring Support, and Amazon shipping out a new Ring doorbell pro.  My problem was despite having good voltage at the wires measured with a multi-meter the connected ring device it would not power up.  I read other reviews of people saying it could take up to 24 hours to power on the first time.  I waited 48 hours and nothing.  I replaced my transformer to a 24v 40VA unit and had the same issues.  After working with Ring support it was determined best course of action was my unit was DOA and return to Amazon and get a new one shipped out.  The other option was bypassing my mechanical doorbell with a cable they sent me.  The ""new"" ring pro shipped to me by Amazon had clearly been previously opened since all the seals were cut.  But nothing looked to be missing so I forged on wanting to get it working. The 2nd unit behaved just like the first one and would not power on.  I finally decided to try to hook it up directly to the transformer using the fused cable Ring sent me in between.  Initially it did not power on but after about 20 minutes it lit up.  Then I took it outside and reinstalled.  Now it powers up fine. I don't know what is going on.  The reports about it taking a long time to power on initially indicates that it has some sort of stored charge device in it.  Whether that is a battery or capacitor I don't know.  I know it has stored charge since when it's disconnected from power it continues to work for a short period of time.  This stored charge is probably to combat issues with a traditional mechanical door bells sucking to much current or breaking the circuit when the doorbell in rung.  It allows the ring to continue to have power, like a very small uninterruptible power supply. I suspect my problem is a lack of sufficient current that is being delivered over the wires initially to trip the charging circuit to turn on.  Since the battery/capacitor does not charge it will not start up.  After getting it installed and added to the app it says I have very good voltage at 4307mV. I think the bottom line is Ring (bought by Amazon today) needs to do some work on the internal design. Fix the initial power up issues, and something to better indicate what is happening.  Some simple LEDs on the back just to show status would be nice.  I suspect they get a ton of returns as a result of them not powering on.",Not a quick installation but eventually works.

I posted on this problem (there was already a thread) on the Ring site maybe 6 months ago. I get notifications in my email up to 5 per week about others who have the same problem hoping to hear of a fix or that Ring will take responsibility for this issue. Some have mentioned that they have been offered a 40% discount to buy another but since they have not addressed the problem, why would anyone do so? I believe some mentioned that Ring support said the button should not be exposed to too much sunlight. So I guess this it the ideal doorbell for inside your house.

To be fair, before the button cracked, I loved this thing. It still works well but knowing what kind of support I have received I am still bitter.",Button cracks when exposed to sunlight
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,1.0,Reviewed in the United States ,26 May 2017,Shawn,"Overpriced bell that does very useful and convenient stuff when it works. My doorbell worked great for 1 week and a half. Then i ran into debilitating issue. It would NOT connect to my wi-fi. I contacted them and spent 2 hours trying to trouble shoot on a cold day to no avail. They gave me a bunch of excuses and possible reasons such as not enough power but couldn't explain why it worked prior. Then i was told that I would be sent a replacement. I called two days later to follow up on the replacement only to be told it was never processed. REALLY!!!  The customer services is a hit and miss, there is no consistency and the recording service is always breaking down. I would prefer a long lasting functioning bell and consistent customer service instead of my money back, but if i cant get those two things then I need a refund. I am hoping Nest will enter into this realm someday.",Did I make a mistake?
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,10 Sep 2019,J. Romero,"I had Arlo cameras and was looking to get a Ring one for some time, but just couldn't get myself to justify the expense. Man, do I wish I had done this before. Superior device and total piece of mind!.. Installation was simple enough. The WIFI setup is a breeze. The connection is solid and it senses everything that happens outside. You can even set up motion zones within the view, although I haven't played with that yet. It connects with Alexa too. I have the chime set up so that it plays a wolf sound when it detects motion, LOL... The Neighborhood application is awesome. The only ""con"" is being aware of all the stuff that happens around your house that you didn't know of before (and there is a LOT more than you think) but I suppose that's a welcomed one! On the funny/creepy  side, I have ""accidentally"" recorded conversations from people standing by who didn't realize Ring was there. This happens particularly when people are waiting outside for someone to open the door. I have also given my daughter's friends a good scare by talking to them through the device out of nowhere, LOL...",Awesome device!
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,3.0,Reviewed in the United States ,12 Apr 2017,B. Cooley,"First unit was defective, as determined after 3 calls to tech support which were a polite bunch but I know more about troubleshooting this thing than they did. (""Can you shake the power adapter? If you hear something rattle it might have a blown fuse."")  After all those calls I came away with the impression that Ring Pro is a touchy thing, sensitive to voltage from the doorbell transformer. I hope its not going to be rendered inop or dead after every brownout. Speaker isn't really loud enough for people at the front door to hear you on a windy day or with a truck driving by. And the time it takes from a doorbell press...to an alert on your phone...to unlocking your phone...to the video then buffering and showing up on your phone screen is very long. I could see some people leaving in that amount of time thinking I'm not home. Not good if you want to make sure you are around to sign for a package, inadvertently great if you just want solicitors to leave. Its the best looking of the smart doorbells and the video quality is quite good. If you are going to mount it immediately alongside your door, prepare to install the optional Ring mounting adapter or a piece of bevel case moulding under it to angle the camera more toward where people will be standing directly in front of the door.","Not bad, not great."
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,08 Nov 2020,Jacob S.,"I would first say to look at the measurements of the Ring Pro to make sure you have enough space for it on your desired location.  Its smaller than the other Ring versions but is still a pretty hefty in the size department.  My old doorbell was really small and on a narrow lip of the door.  Luckily, the Ring Pro fit without protruding over the edge.  The installation of the Ring Pro was really easy.  I don't have any wiring or electrical experience and I was able to do the install, setup and troubleshooting myself.  The install took me about an hour.  Set up was about another hour, it would have been shorter if I hadn't made a mistake.  I mistakenly installed the power kit where the wires were in the way of the chime mechanism, a simple reposition of the power kit solved that issue.  Then I couldn't get the Ring to connect with my wifi but a simple reboot of my wifi router solved that problem.  After that everything has been great!  I am always able to access the Live Feed without any problem.  I really enjoyed exploring the app and making a motion schedule and mapped out the motion areas.  I probably need to explore the app more to solve this, but my only negative feedback is the motion detection always sends me a notification when I check the mail or step outside.  Hopefully there's a way to some what remedy this in the app.  All in all a great, reliable product and I recommend it!",Easy Install and Great Added Home Security
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,2.0,Reviewed in the United States ,16 Oct 2020,Rebecca S. Robertson,"I only had my ring doorbell installed less than one month when it stopped working.  After spending more than an hour with tech support they decided it was not fixable and they would resend me a new one.  I had to take the doorbell off to take a picture of the bar code, QR code, on the back.  My suggestion is to take that picture and keep it in your files so if you have to call them you have that code. I had Vivint in my former house and my favorite thing was being able to talk to people when they came to the door and thought this would be less expensive than a monthly fee. I will give the new doorbell a chance and let you know if this was just a lemon.",Worked less than 1 month
"Ring Video Doorbell Pro, with HD Video, Motion Activated Alerts, Easy Installation (existing doorbell wiring required)",1,5.0,Reviewed in the United States ,14 May 2018,Matt B,"If you already have a powered doorbell (lights up with chime), then I would recommend the Ring Pro.  The installation instructions are very easy to follow, but be warned:  16-24 V transformer is required, with 20 VA recommended.  I know this very well because our new construction house doorbell is probably only a 12 V and we have had minor issues.  The Ring Pro still works, but if you overuse it, it may power down and give an error code until the power is back in spec. Overall, we've been using our Ring Pro for about a week and I have to say that it works as promised - even with the transformer issue (which really only affected us the first night).  The camera quality is great.  It provides great video in all levels of light:  daylight, direct sun, evening/twilight, night mode, and night mode with street lights - we can see our porch and even the street very clearly. It offers excellent field of view, great resolution and very easy interface to set up your Ring to do exactly what you want.  You want a security camera?  Set the motion setting to sensitive and set the polygon capture area to include everything.  Be warned - you'll get hundreds of warnings and video clips to review if you do this, as every little thing will set it off (cars, shadows, insects, etc). You only want the Ring to alert you whenever a person walks up our just to guard your walk way?  Change the settings and scan area simply by using your phone or tablet.  Or turn the motion and scan area off and it'll literally be a fancy doorbell with phone/video interface. Night mode works great and we have found no video quality issues whether we view our Ring remotely via 3G/4G or via WiFi.  The sound quality isn't great, but like another reviewer stated, if you view the Ring Pro as an awesome camera that offers sound instead of a fully functional video camera, then you won't be disappointed! Cons:  there aren't many.  The app interface sometimes won't load the video from my notifications (I'm using Samsung on Android, so I don't know if that matters since my wife's iPhone doesn't have this issue) and one time our chime didn't go off, but the phone notifications did alert us and we still answered the door.  Does this really matter?  Not to us, but I want to give you the honest feedback.  Btw, this is the only reason why I give it a 9/10 instead of a 10. I installed this in about 30 minutes.  It only took so long because I couldn't find the correct breaker to isolate the doorbell transformer!  Just follow the guide and watch the video clips.  Finally, be patient and give your Ring an overnight to remain at power before you play with it.  I would have sworn that our Ring was a brick that needed to be returned, but the Ring tech support was very good at explaining the power situation and how to fix it if it continued to be an issue (again, since the first night, this hasn't been an issue). All in all, this is a good product that seems to work as promised!","Ring Pro is great, but check your power supply!!!"
