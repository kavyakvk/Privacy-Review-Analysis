Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,mike,Easy install easy setup easy instructions easy to record and simple way to keep your home or property safe and protected,Great starter cameras
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Jun 2020,Drew,"The camera itself is built pretty solid, the light on it is pretty bright, and the siren is loud. Solar panel works great! With only one battery in the camera i've only seen it drop to 85% overnight and that's with all the settings set to max. For the most part its pretty consistant picture with some stuttering on live view. 2 way works very well also.

Downside? The ring system does not support 5G wifi, which frankly blows my mind. With the cameras on the same channel as most of my household devices it can be hard to get quality picture and even establish a connection to the camera. One would think a company like Ring would support 5G on the cameras considering bandwidth these things can use. 

We live in the country and while the IR sensors work pretty well, half my yard is little to no light so it doesn't go to far in that direction. If you're in a more populated area with outside lights the IR will work better. You can see in the photos I included that in low light it looks really good, but when it gets darker the quality drops if you cannot provide some light for it.

While I would recommend this system (love the battery and solar panel combo) to more residential areas, I am likely switching to Nest which has much better night vision reviews.",Good Camera but bad firmware
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Spilly42,"These are not nearly as good as the floodlight cam, so if you debating, get that. I have both. The spotlight cam still takes excellent quality video and with the addition of zones, it has improved the usefulness. The warning: if you cannot choose your wifi speed (2.4 or 5Mb) you will most likely also need a Ring Chime Pro. This is not an issue with the wired Ring cameras, just the battery versions. Also for some reason, it molds on the top of the camera.","Okay, but choose wisely"
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,Mikey,The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I have 7 ring cameras and four our Spotlight cam but they are wired 110-volt versions this camera looks exactly like the 110 volt versions so I thought all the settings and features would be the same but they're not the camera works great I bought the solar panel for it it stays charged 100% everyday it just doesn't have all the adjustability for motion on the camera and also adjustability for motion on the light like the 110 volt versions do other than that they works great there's nothing wrong with it I love my ring cameras,My seventh ring camera
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Jul 2020,NedC,"I initially put this in my backyard. It's doesn't throw out as much light as a floodlight but it is enough.  Ending up getting another one for the driveway. It gets a pretty decent spread of motion detection.  One sort of flaw, for vocal notifications, like ""You have motion in your ....."".   The only device name it says is if you used one of the default name choices.  For example, my driveway cam I named , well, Driveway. But whenever there was motion it would say, in the app vocal, ""Motion in your spot camera"".    Driveway is not a default. I renamed the cam  ""Front"" and now it says ""motion in front"".   The popup notify on your phone does show any name.  I confirmed this with Ring support and they created a ticket to have more name choices.    The cam runs on one battery, but you can put two in, then when one drains, it will switch to the other while you charge the one.  Solar is also a choice. Because my driveway requires a ladder for me to change batteries, I decided to order the wired one and will put it in the driveway.",Bought more

I found unit easy to install and use-as long as you follow the instructions. Battery took 6 hours to charge and is holding charge well. It only took a couple of positions and sensitivity adjustments to find the best settings. I also found that downloading the Rapid Ring App in addition to the Ring App, was a good decision. It gives you instant access to the live camera.
Would you recommend this product as a gift?",My ring
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,AdamS,"Pretty good.  Image quality is good with good lighting, but this is used on a garage at an alley and I really should of got the bigger flood light. Otherwise pretty good.  Got it to pair with my ring alarm system (doorbell, indoor camera, motion sensors, door sensors,keypad, and alarm siren/base). Also got some connect smoke and CO detectors to pair to the system.",Good product
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,DebL,"These Ring Spotlight Cams are just what we needed for our  back patio and back patio. The batteries have held up so far, but one is draining faster than the other. We adjusted its motion sensitivity as it was being triggered more frequently than the backyard one due to its location by the sidewalk. The drain on the battery has slowed down some. We prefer the Battery-charged Spotlights rather than the Wired ones since they would have required an electrician.",Battery-charged Spotlights
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2018,MikeMike,"I read all the reviews about the wireless ring spotlight, good and bad reviews. After all those reviews I end up given them a chance since they are wireless. 
Here we go....

Battery: 
Everyone wants to know how long this device really last. Now I don’t know how the device was tested to last 6 months on a single charge. I’m still on the edge to see if my cameras will even last the month. I installed them on 12/3 and as of today 12/17 (14 days in) , they are at 40 and 37 percent full. My settings are at the lowest settings and if I’m home I try not to check the cameras through my phone to save the battery since I notice the battery drains like crazy when you view them live (disappointed) Yes that defuses the point of being able to see them love. I figured why not just look out the window, rather then letting the app load. So, as of now, the battery is not the best and I wish they would come with two batteries instead of one. 

Settings: 
This part really took me by surprise. Ring advertises that you can select the area you want the motion to be patrol. Negative, that’s only with the hardwire products. The wireless one only gives you the option in a 180 degree and from 0-30ft. The wire one gives you more options. Also, on the wireless one, you.l can’t select the sensitivity of how the camera senses motion. Wireless just has light, standard, and frequent. The wire one has from pets to only persons. This was a really set back for me when I found this out because my neighbors cat is always setting off my cameras. 
Ring, please update this!! 

Quality: 
The quality is a hit and miss. You can’t really see a clear image when you zoom in. Not sure what that consist of. At night, the spot lights are great. They give enough light to alert any intruders. Night vision is good but you have the same problem when you zoom in. The two way talk is great, used it couple of times and they’ve been a success. Only reason I haven’t returned them back. 

Over all the cameras would be better if they had the features ring advertises and if the battery life really last 6 months.

I would love to know how I can get the 6months or even 4-5 months of battery life.",Great product but...
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Sep 2020,JohnB,I purchased a couple of these for my home and have been very happy with the quality of the video. I have mine set in the most sensitive setting and get a about a week out of the battery. You can back the sensitivity off and extend the battery life to you can add optional solar panels to help supplement the battery. You must purchase a plan with Ring if you want the data uploaded to the cloud but the cost is very reasonable. It's a great option if you don't want to have hardwired cameras installed,Great camera but could use longer battery life
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Moda,This is the first spotlight cam I've purchased and it's a good addition to existing Ring set up. The amount of light it gives off is a little disappointing. I have 2 Ring Flood cam and although I can't expect them to give off the same amount of light I would like to see a bit more for this camera.,Good addition to the family
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,PamSD,"Installed almost a month ago. Easy to install, clear picture. Hooked to our home's wifi through the mobile app. with just a little difficulty (not exactly as directions noted but worked). Motion detection very good and can be adjusted back if too sensitive. Live view is a nice feature but if you have more than one camera, doorbell etc. streaming you can go through mobile data quickly! Multiple mobile users can have access. Ring protection plan is available and very economical (free 30 day trial when you activate your cameras). Batteries are inexpensive and in these Spotlight Cams you get one battery for each camera but they can hold 2 each. Buy the extra 2 and you can double the time. USB charging cables come in the package. It looks like one battery charge will last over a month and with 2 installed in each Cam the time will be doubled. It also depends on your settings. The neighborhood watch group in the app is informative. Everything for installation is in the packaging which made it very easy. The only reason I go with 4 stars vs. 5 stars is there was not much information (and is not easy to find after the fact) or a warning about how much data use can occur. We installed the 2 cams and a doorbell and had all 3 with live view activated. We used triple the mobile data we normally do. If you have unlimited no problem or if there was a warning about the live streaming it would have helped. We have adjusted our viewing and love the security of being able to see our home from anywhere. Absolutely a very good purchase that I recommend highly!",Lots of Features and easy to install

We plan to purchase another for rear location on the property.",Night Owl Guard
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,JT31,"The problem with this thing is that it continues to detect motion that shouldn’t be detected. I have it set on person only mode.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Oct 2020,Apryl,"This camera has provided so much peace of mind. The downside, the battery does not last long, maybe 5-6 days. I’m debating getting a second battery or a solar panel. I wish it made it one whole week reliably so that I could have a charging routine (like every Thursday morning).","Peace of mind, crummy battery life"
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 May 2020,MoeMoe,"I bought these cameras to help ease my mind with the recent overflow of teens causing trouble in my neighborhood.  While they have done that, they're a little tricky. The battery life is very limited so I suggest the hard wired ones or buy the wolar panels as I later had to do. The battery will last roughly a week should you have it set to a high alert and have too many neighborhood cats as I do.  They get the job done.  Just know they take some time to get set up and figured out fully. Also read the fine print. You have to buy additional coverage monthly/yearly to keep recordings.  Not a bad item just a little more work than expected.  Also the Spot llight does NOT include a Bridge. You have to but it separate for the item to qork at all and it is not cheap.  Cost me more than the light did.",Decent product
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,RogerD,"Decided to make the move to go to the Ring system for my outdoor security and I couldn't be happier. The Ring spotlight camera was the final piece. Easy to install with a great picture day and night. I don't like wires, so I went with the wireless option. It comes with 1 battery but has room for 2. I highly recommend purchasing 2 extra batteries so you can install 2 and have the third as a backup. I use the spare to rotate with my other Ring cameras. You will not be disappointed.",Great spotlight cam!
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Jul 2020,Mossmusic,"While this is a great camera it works nothing like the camera on TV. It only records for about 30 seconds. Then takes a while to reset and record any movement. If I was to break in a house I would crash movement. Wait for the light to go out then break in while the camera doesn't record. Voice works nothing like the commercial. Very slow connection when trying to view live and I'm running extremely fast wifi. That eliminated the excuses of slow connection. While this camera has room for improvement, still better than the rest at this time. Also bought the flood light camera the other day.",Great camera with flaws
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,DaddyChIll,"I own 3 of these specific spotlight ring camera and love it. In day light it works great but at night it isnt bright at all. The night recordings arent very good without light and the light isnt very bright to help the camera out. Unless u have this low to the ground or add other lights around it to help light up an area at night, it isnt that effective. I mounted this by my front porch light so it does the job for my home day and night but again, If you have it mounted high, the light will not work well at all. In my back yard I added sensor solar lights that light up the area if anything is near so it supplements this ring camera to help get a better recording at night. The pictures show the camera at night without any light, during the day and at night with my other non ring solar porch light qith sensor. The ring cam caught a possum walking in our back yard. Without the additional light it gets really grainy and hard to see. I have the same driveway cam see day and night pics. Hands down, love the ring apps. Watch videos of the various settings. They also have a ring community where you can share info like ""hey someone tried to break into my car"" and actually share footage or just messages. U can see when someone reports occurrences in your neighborhood too.",Ring Spotlight Cam works great during the day

In addition, I bought the associated solar panel since I do not have to charge the battery. The solar panel keeps the battery at 100% charge.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Aug 2020,Poohkado,"We installed the spotlight camera in the backyard to watch people approaching the back porch and the said gate. It took a while to get it positioned just right to pick up someone entering the side gate. We also have a tree near the porch which was constantly triggering it from the wind or birds. After much adjustment we finally got it dialed in. The battery life in the spotlight cam seems shorter so we bought a second battery. It works good now, but we probably need to get a second one or mount it on a pole to get a proper view of all access points, currently there's a blind spot behind it.",It does it's job!

We have very fast internet and a router right above where the camera is installed so that shouldn’t be the issue.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Bnewb,"So I have ring 2 I bought my friend ring 2. I had no issues and love it she got the spot lights and ring 2. I got the extra battery for her. We were amazed and shocked no 1 said anything about the fact the spot light packs have room for 2 batteries but only come with 1. However they work fine if you only put the 1 battery in it! Super cool plus if she puts the lights up hogh she won't have the trouble of trying to get a ladder each week or 2 and recharge or be with out battery when 1 runs low. Say she goes out of town she just needs buy 2 extra packs anand boom charge um all fill um both with 4 2 come with and 2 extras and now she just lets it run or swaps half out and relapaces the other half super cool. We worried about what when our cable goes out like a power outage but do have tmobile 1 hotspot for free and are going to inquire in regards to this. I also use 1 of mine inside the home as well as no inside stuff from ring has been made that I'm yet aware of. We just love the talk back features and using our cells to answer the door or yell at each other and record our pets and communicate for work or out of town. Its a great product if u have any packages delivered like with amazon and delivers a lot of criminal activity around the home. We live in a bot so great area and it saved my puppy from being stolen the 1st week. Saved me from having a hit and run the 2nd week. And the third my bestfriend was enjoying and now we shear funny videos with each other and an awsome group app called neighbors links intermittently with the app to show your neighbors friends and family who to watch out for and what's happening. My neighbor thanked me for shearing the video when I told him it was me and it saved his dog from the same teen trying to take blue pits. And we shear the funny videos of each other to each others phones and download and enjoy. Its a great security system, dog watcher (helper not for leaving and no sitter) lol, in home security, links with other apps and devices and the neighbors app it links with it will offer to shear with the police if you choose to report as well. All in all a great product and the price is only going up so get ut while u can and buy extra batteries. Only 2 cons cable outrage scary if mobile hot spot won't work and charging batteries if you don't have extra or time. Wished they charged faster. All bennifits besides the 2 little cons. I bought several and plan to keep buying more. You should get the extender if in a multi bedroom home. I dont need 1 but I have a 1 bd 1 bath home and my friend has a multiple room larger family home and does need a wifi extender just for front door all else worked great.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,TriedIt,"This was the 2nd pair of spotlight cameras I put up at my house, because we had one on the front of the house that didnt sctivate when a car parked along the street was stolen from our house. (we had the sensitivity at mid level because we dont normally park on the street, but this was a guests car.) 
We recovered the stolen car a couple days later. But we started noticing suspicious activity at night, once we increased the sensitivity of our 1st cameras and started paying attention in the days following the theft, including a vehicle we didnt recognize stopping for a minute right alongside the car that had been stolen, the night after we got it back. 
So these 2 cameras went on trees near the road, looking both ways down the street. They light up the street every time a car or pedestrian approaches our address. Suspicious sctivity stopped the night after I put them up.

I wish the batteries lasted longer. I get about 10-12 days total out of the 2 batteries in each camera, but we keep them on the highest sensitivity and frequency. Nothing happens near our home that isn't recorded now.
Ring charges $100/year to save everything, so plan on that if you want your videos saved for later use. Havent found anyway around that, but there's no limit on the number of cameras or amount of data you're allowed to store, so we get our money's worth from it.",They light up the yard

I guess the design of my front walkway / front door did not allow for enough of a view for me with the doorbell. I returned it and did not buy anything to replace it. I found this on sale, mount where you want, wireless, much better view for me, plus it has all of the two way talk options. The spotlight is quite nice and the zones keep from over using your camera.
It's worth a try!",Much better than the doorbell
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,AP2015,"I have been using this camera for about a month now here’s my take on it:
The Good:
1) easy set up-just screwed camera on the wall etc and its done.
2) one battery has descent life so far with average use, I still have over 70% life
3) easy to use app, has adequate features
4) night vision is descent,
5)live view is perfect, can communicate and be heard/hear well
6) motion zones can be extended far enough
7) price-I bought it on sale $30 off which was fair price 

The Average
1) motion detection and alarm do have a delay as much as several seconds sometimes, sometimes though is immediate 
2) I’m not sure if time of recording is adjustable but it only records 30secs once it detects motions even though there could be actions continuing (again I’m not sure
If I can adjust that time)
3) sometimes the motion detection works right on cue and sometimes it doesn’t pick up the motion (I did turned off one zone that had freq actions and that seemed to help a bit)
4) the app may need 1-2 more features added

I m not planning to buy the extra space for recording, I think it comes with daily recordings which is enough for me.

Overall it was worth my time and money, I feel good about leaving my place and still can have an eye and ear on it.",Ring camera

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,LNetW,"Getting these working was a snap. I did plug in the batteries and charge overnight before attempting installation. Ring seemed to think of everything so imagine my surprise when, 1. the screws for the physical installation were black (my unit is white) and 2. one screw broke off during installation using a hand-held cordless screwdriver into soft wood siding. So I had to go to the local hardware store and figure out which stainless steel silver screws would work. And then fill and paint over the holes from the previous install since my odds of getting that broken screw out were slim to none. But getting it working with my wifi was a breeze. I purchased an extra battery and the solar panel and the solar panel keeps both batteries charged on as little as an hour of sunlight a day. Motion sensor is adjustable for distance, recording is a bit behind, but good enough, and at night the light is surprisingly bright. I think the video quality could be better but I recognize people who set off the recording. Was surprised to learn I have to pay $30 per camera per year after 30 days to keep any video unless I purchase their all inclusive annual premium pkg at $100 a year. Was hoping I could simply store the video on my own network drive. If there's a way to do that, I haven't figured it out yet.",Cheap installation screws but works great

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Railimages,"I purchased these cameras to hopefully catch whoever has been vandalizing the bird feeders and solar lights in front of my house. I have found that the camera will not always activate. I can at time jump up and down in from of them and they will not go off. They are pretty much useless if someone approaches the camera directly head on as they won't activate most of the time. They have to approach from the outer edges. They claim these cameras are 1080dpi but they look more like 720dpi and at night when they go off and the lights come on (the lights coming on is great, will most likely scare anyone away) the image is extremely grainy and there is no way you can identify a person (hard to do in the daylight also). I have another 1080dpi camera from Reolink and the image is SO MUCH sharper then these. Ring customer service hasn't been much help so far with the resolution issue and I even bought an outside signal booster hoping that might help but it didn't.",Lights work nice @ night but resolution lacking

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,RebelExpress,"I currently have 5 Ring Cameras (2 Ring Doorbell Pros, 1 Corded Stickup Cam, and 2 of these Battery Spotlight Cams.   One thing I miss most in the battery powered cams is recording.   This is common on battery powered cameras with Arlo and Ring from everything I've read.   With cameras that get direct power via Cord or PoE, when there is motion, you will see 1-2 second prior to motion.   With Battery powered cameras, it will not get the recording prior to motion.  Other than that I like these cameras and love how they integrate with the Ring Security System, Ring Battery Lights, and Alexa.    Everything ties together which makes these great.   Also, Ring's subscription costs ($10/mo or $100/year for unlimited cameras AND security monitoring) are the lowest compared to Arlo and Nest.",Good Wireless Cameras
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Randy,"We have several other ring cameras and are very pleased with them. I got this one as it could be placed where I don’t have power to plug one in. I put it in my dog’s kennel to see how it would work.

 IT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CHOOSE YOUR MOTION AREA. I knew this when I got it. On the other cameras you can choose the alert zones by selecting areas on the screen. This unit only has preset distance and area ranges. It also is slower to load and the picture does not appear to be as clear as the wired units. It farther from the router than any other camera. 

I purchase the second battery so I didn’t have to charge them as often. It was in a location without sun. I don’t use the light function much but it has lasted about a month on one battery. It does get a few trips during the day and we drop in about every other day to live watch the dog.

Not sure how much you have to pay just yet. But the experience I had for that month I did like. You can just go in the app and go live view or go and see past videos of when it catches motion. Oh and another downside, you do have to keep charging the batteries which I don’t like to keep doing. But there is room so you can have two batteries at once.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,KjMo,"I already have a Ring Pro Doorbell and bought this Spotlight Cam Wire-free.  My doorbell has the problem that my voice comes through clearly to the guest outside, but when they talk, their voice echoes back to them through the device.  The exact same thing is happening with the Spotlight Cam.  I can talk to the guest but their voice echoes back to them through the device.  This is very annoying to guests and makes both devices somewhat useless for communicating with someone at my door or in my driveway.  I spent over 16 hours troubleshooting this problem with Ring after I bought my new Samsung Galaxy S10 phone.  After weeks of not being able to resolve the problem they sent me an email saying this is very important to them and they will be addressing this.  So far, a few months later, no luck.  I still have the guest hearing their own voice echoing back.  So I just use both devices to record video and listen to visitors talking, I just don't bother trying to talk to a guest so they don't have to hear their own voice echoing back out of either device.  It's not like they show on TV.  I guess I could tell a bad guy I see them, but if I want to talk to a guest or a delivery person, it's really awkward.  I'd still recommend both devices for the very good video quality, but if you have an S10 just be prepared.",Good Camera Below Average Audio

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,DrBTPDallas,"This product has been amazing so far. I’ve had the camera almost 2 months and haven’t encountered any issues. I’m actually buying another today to secure a blind spot that exists on my property. The camera has been reliable and provides me with reasonable comfort and good coverage when I’m home and away. I trust that I will be alerted if anything is taking place that shouldn’t. One interesting fact - the signal strength was a little poor in the beginning but increased after signing up for a Ring Protect Plan. Now the signal strength is consistently solid. Interesting coincidence, but I’m a happy customer.",Comfort and coverage

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,TomWalla74,"If you are getting these to put outside i would highly recommend getting the solar panel for these. It keeps the battery charged 100% and that is with us having all the features on the drain the battery the most.


We purchased this so we could cover the perimeters of our house. Originally we did the double battery per union which will last about 3 months with our configuration and activity, but the solar option was the deal winner and the reason we purchased these. Best combo to get.

Camera's work well, Night vision does a pretty decent job, has a siren and light. 

You can also adjust the motion zones and sensitivity. Connects and says connected to our home wifi without issues. Good signal is RSSI 58 and down.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Number1TechFan,"Ok so I’m sure you’re wondering why my review is rated so much higher than about 90% of the other reviews pertaining to the Ring Wireless Spotlight Cam. Well here is why...solar! Nearly every single review mentions how falsely advertised the battery is, how you’re lucky to get 6 weeks let alone 6 months usage. I bought these for Black Friday so I saved $50 on the pair, but what I also did was purchase them along with the Ring Solar Panels. Yes you’re spending an additional $100 or so and yes you shouldn’t have to, but...the solar panels basically revolutionized the cameras. After about a weeks use, my batteries have not dropped lower than 98% AND the panels charge them back up to 100% at sunrise. I have a new house, in a new development with construction workers around all hours of the day working on my neighbors’ houses. The other night my cameras caught a worker stealing water from my outdoor spicket...an several deer lurking about as well lol. I would not buy these without the solar panels. The only thing keeping these from 4 stars is the fact that they are so very internet/wi-fi dependant so make sure you have one that’s fast.","Just shy of amazing, but..."

However, it notifies me, occasionally, when people drive by but when I drive into my yard, it doesn’t tell me someone’s there until I’m at the front door.... which, by the time I finally get the camera to load, I have no idea who is at my front door. (Since I have such a big yard I can’t have it on my door and my yard) I end up using my window most of the time. It loads slow, so don’t get this expecting to see things immediately.

The solar panel keep the battery charged so I didn't feel the need to have  more then one battery.  Connecting to my wireless router was very simple, I have one camera that is 75feet from the router and I have no issues connecting to it.  The only issue is with the two way communication.  Sometimes I'll get feedback and its hard to listen and talk at the same time.  I bought them on sale and they came with an Echo dot so bonus for me.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Switch,"Overall it is a great camera, I gave it 4 stars only because it does not record 24/7 like Nest. I did have to upgrade my Comcast internet to a higher speed, I also had to change wifi to the Google Mesh, the camera had issues with my Apple Extreme with 2 Apple Extenders, the camera needs a steady signal. 

The camera also has 2 battery slots, but only comes with one battery, Ring says that is all you need but I complained and they sent me a free 2nd battery, if you are paying $200 you should get 2 batteries, at least while one is charging the camera can still function.

I did have an issue when I charged one battery and went to install it, the camera app kept saying battery door open, I had to take the camera off the bracket and take it inside, apparently when it gets cold it needs to warm up, that is what Ring said. I have 2 stick up cams and they are better, Ring said this replaced them.

I have had the Nest cams in the past, and I think I prefer their design better. They are smaller and are less noticeable, and made of metal and not plastic.

Well now I don’t have to because Ring is simply awesome. No monthly fees, only additional cost is for the cloud storage for your recorded data but it’s totally optional and upto you if you want to get the additional service which by the way I strongly encourage that you do. Even with the additional services it was still more cost effective to pay for the service for a year compared to what you would be spending on those other service companies, and best of all NO CONTRACTS.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,rodchav,"I installed an access point and have speed tested my wifi near the camera. I even setup a separate ssid so I would know that the camera is using the access point. When I use the Ring App on my phone I still a lot of times just get a black screen or an unable to connect message. Sort of Annoying. I also don't like that the camera can use 2 batteries and they only give you 1. I would rather they chard $229.00 and include a 2nd battery. I have checked the Scottsdale Best Buy, Lowes, Home Depot, Target and WalMart and none seem to have the battery in stock for this.

Also, when the light comes on it stays on for a short time and then it takes 30 seconds or more to refresh, so all someone would have to do it wait for it go out and move.

I have a total of 4 cameras on the outside of my house and the only one I'm having an issue with is the one that is mounted on the side. The point of installing the side camera was to have a view of the side of my house or see if anyone is trespassing on my property. The way the camera is built straight out of the box, when mounted to the side of the house, points at my neighbor which I'm pretty sure she wouldn't appreciate being under surveillance. I was able to mount the camera on the side of the house at an angle that during the day has an appropriate view of anyone that walks on the side. At night you can't see anything. You can make out figures but if someone broke into the house you would not have a clear view of who it is or what they look like. I contacted support and was basically told there's nothing I can do other than reposition the camera which would in turn not show anything I need to see other than my neighbors house.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,1,23 Jul 2020,Faustind,"Based upon recommendations from friends and reviews we read on different websites, we purchased 2 Ring Spotlight Cameras with Solar Panels to keep track of activities in our front yard. We had the cameras installed by Best Buy Saturday morning and were initially quite excited, but the excitement quickly turned to utter disappointment. The biggest problem was that even though the Motion Detection range is advertised at 30 feet, we only experience a Motion Detection range of 10 to 15 feet in each camera. Coupled with the 3-5 second lag time after motion is detected and recording begins, the person is already at our front door by the time we get any notification. The motion detection is also very hit-and-miss (we can get a detection in one spot once and 5 minutes later there is no detection in the same spot). We really wanted this to work for us, but it doesn't.",Initial Excitement Turned To Utter Disappointment

However the battery lasts about a week to a week and a half and then you have to get the ladder out, remove the battery and charge it for several hours. You can buy the solar panel for like $70-80 or another battery for $40 ish but after already paying so much for just these two camera, it’s a little disappointing that I have to charge so frequently or just spend more money. Also you can’t view any motion after the first 30 day trial and then you have to buy a monthly plan to see the footage even. Also, was hoping to avoid monthly fees but no such luck. They are cheap ($5-10) a month but still just another monthly charge I don’t like.","Great camera, charge doesn’t last"

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,1,23 Nov 2018,NewYorker,I purchased 18 of these cameras between Best Buy and another retailer. From the very beginning I had issues with the battery and with connecting the camera to WiFi. I was able to get a Chime Pro which I literally had to plug in on the other side of the wall for it to connect. I installed the camera facing the back yard around 10pm. By 11am the camera had 81% battery life left. I followed all the instructions that were given to me by Ring and still nothing. How am I supposed to install 18 if these camera between three different locations if I have to recharge all the batteries every week to week and a half? I told Ring time and time again it’s the batteries but they tell me otherwise. I guess at this point I have to return 18 Cameras and go with someone else.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,CC1985,"It's ok. First off I didnt know I had to pay a subscription in order for it to record alerts. But is only $30 a year so no biggie. The resolution is good unless you zoom in. The zoom sucks even if it's just a little. The alerts tend to get annoying sometimes but that's just me. I dont recommend using the light though because it does drain the battery pretty fast if theres quite of bit of alerts. The one thing that irritates me the most is the app. When you get an alert and click on the notification to bring it up, it doesnt work for me. So I hurry and click on the app and it takes forever to start up. Also when clicking on live view, it takes a while to load. If someone was really in my yard, by time it loaded for me to see, they would probably already be in my house. The whole thing is just slow. It's a decent camera but it's really not worth the price. I dont know if I'd buy another one. I've seen cheaper ones work better and faster.",Its ok

If you sale the camera with the battery why not sale the extra battery? Or the manufacturer should put 2 in the box.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,1,23 Jan 2020,AbeK,"Simply put, and for the price you pay, there are MUCH better options. I purchased two Spotlight Cameras and I spend more time waiting for the view to load than actually viewing the cameras. The cameras began working great, but after the first month, everything slowed down significantly. On average, and if it actually works, the live view takes about 5-10 minutes to appear. The product is not reliable though, and most times, the live view doesn’t work or the cameras are offline and unable to stream. Because of this, the motion detection also goes down, tending the cameras entirely useless. I believe I’ve called Ring Customer Support about 5 times in last 2 weeks because apparently the only solution to this issue is to constantly restart each device. I am currently awaiting shipment of a different brand before returning the two cameras. I am having the same issue with the doorbell as well, and will likely be swapping it for a different brand as well, but that is less important, generally.",Avoid at all costs

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,2,23 Nov 2019,Cperk,"Purchased these cameras this week and I must honestly say I am very disappointed. While the video quality is very good but the motion detection is terrible. They will pick up vehicles driving down my street, but pull in my driveway and it doesn’t activate until people have parked and are already out of sight. Motion activation is very intermittent and misses a lot of activity. To be honest, my Blink cameras are much more reliable and a heck of a lot cheaper with better battery life. Also I don’t have to pay $100 a year for storage. I cannot rely on these cameras for security. Will most likely be returning these. Save your money and opt for something more reliable at half the cost.
The only reason I can give these two stars is for the video quality. Otherwise I would not give them 1 star.",Not all it’s cracked up to be

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Oct 2020,AnnieG,"Was a little intimidated by the whole process, but I was definitely wrong.  Easy to set up.  The hardest part was deciding where to place it outdoors to get the view we wanted.  Some adjustment of areas - blowing tress & distance to street & sensitivity of motion.

But overall, love the system.  

We have 1 battery in the camera & well worth it to get the solar panel so you are not climbing up &down a ladder to charge the battery.  Solar must spend a few hours a day in the sun & the wire was at least 8-10 feet long, so the solar did not have to be real close to the camera.

I would suggest buying 2 batteries for each security camera to minimize the amount of times you have to climb a ladder to change them out.   Only other draw back is the ring commercial is just that, a commercial and not totally accurate.    To go “live” on your phone or tablet to view what is currently happening, there can be a 5-15 second delay before you actually get the live view.  The view is not immediate as they show on their commercial.  While it did record,  if the person does not stay in place, you may or may not be able to confront them via the mic/speaker.

I ended up paring this with a solar panel in order to put it towards the back of the yard facing the house and it's worked like a champ for over a year.

I am going to buy the solar panel for $50 so that I don’t hVe to keep getting up on a ladder and recharging the battery over the years.  The other downfall, that I also remedied and now it’s fine, is the need for a signal to get them to work.  I had to get a wifi extender ($80) to get signal outside my concrete block home to get the camera about 10 feet from the house onto the lanai roof.  Use fast.com to check your signal at the location you want to put them before you install. You’ll need it to at least register 25mbps.","Great, but needs a couple extras"

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,DBLA,"I’ve tried Arlo, Blink and Ring. I stuck with Blink and Ring. What I like about Ring is it always records, you can not turn off the record function for motion that it senses, it is meant to always record movement therefore it is a true security camera. You can reduce the amount of alerts you get but even if you don’t get an alert because you wanted to receive fewer for instance if it picked up cars going by and you didn’t want to get alerts for that, the nice thing is if you needed to go back and review it will be there in the cloud on the app. The light is nice and now with the new update if you turn the light on in the app you see in color instead of the black and white night vision view with most cameras.

Our biggest complaint is that these cameras tend to show all purple or green output at times (equally outside or inside).

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,NJTech,"Battery life is impressive; it’s down to 38% in the front and 69% in the back, after 1 month. I’m still fine tuning the settings, still erring on the side of more “false” alarms. Two things are causing the “falses” triggers: a couple of feral cats, and our family working in the garden (picture mowing the lawn, going back and forth across the field of view of the sensors). I’d guess that eliminating these problems would cut the battery drain in half. 

I haven’t found any settings to put the sensor in a sleep mode, short of cover the camera with a plastic bag. Adjusting the tilt of the camera (raising) would reduce the cat detections, but limit the viewability of the sidewalk. Buying the 2nd battery doubles the time between charges, and I highly recommend it.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,AGMC,"And these cameras are fantastic. I already had the previous cameras, but the updated ca,eras with lights make a tremendous difference. Although I wish there was a way to keep them on consistently for a longer period, it is worth it to have these in areas of the house that may have blind spots or minimal lighting. One caveat to prepare people for is the fact that majority of the ring products don't have the greatest receiving radios for wireless signal. I had luckily updated my roter to the Netgear Orbi mesh system, but even with 3 satelites to blanket the width of my house, penetration through load bearing/steel walls is a task and a half for the Ring cameras to pick up. If your router/wifi signal isn't extremely strong outside, I highly recommend upgrading that first or pre-testing speeds where you intend on installing the cameras, prior to purchasing. You will not be happy if the wifi speed cannot provide a consistent connection for the ring. That will lead to black video or pixelated video. There is the ring range extender that can be purchase,but I opted for adding a satelite to my orbi over the ring range extension. That will have to be at your own discretion.",Ring has made me feel more secure...

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2018,Jasper,"The ring cameras and doorbell have been reliable in terms of function and everyday use. This battery operated version does what it’s supposed to do: watch for suspicious activity on your property. I bought an extra battery pack and solar panel accessory to keep this camera running. It’s pricey like all other Security cameras, but it’s worth the investment. The subscription plan and ring app are very helpful since other ring users in the community can share and report suspicious activity in the neighborhood. All That being said, security cameras such as ring will only perform well, depending on how good your Wifi connection is. So make sure you have WiFi that’s good and able to reach this camera, depending where you place it.

The IR night vision is really good.  The spotlight works sufficiently and they do the job I need them to do.  

I don't know if I pay full price but since I got them on sale and got a free Echo Show for each Spotlight Cam, it was a great deal.  This probably the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

I saw this combo on sale during Black Friday and decided to purchase it with a solar panel. Installation was quick and picture quality is great. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because sometimes I can't connect to my spotlight through the app. This is probably due to it's proximity from the access point of my wifi mesh network. Still annoying but I would but it again. The solar panel was wonderful. It keeps the batteries charged even in Chicago winters where sun is a limited commodity.,Great Solution for Area with No Electric Outlet

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Wilson,"Love these cameras and their wire-free capabilities. When coupled with the solar panels for these devices and good device/battery management, there is no need to change out the battery. 

That being said - If your goal is to put batteries in and never need to change them out I would advise purchasing the extra battery and solar panel. If your device receives high frequency (motion) then you may have to set some good device practices to keep fully charged. I have one spotlight cam over looking a road that receives a lot of motion, coupled with the solar panel and extra battery, if I lessen the motion range or frequency for a day then my batteries are 100% charged. This is heavily dependent on the amount of direct sunlight received by the panels.

The panel is worth the extra 50$ and the extra battery is worth the extra 30$.",2nd purchase.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Dec 2019,SeanL,"...but unless you're going to buy a separate solar power adapter, you need to manage batteries. The batteries do last quite a long time (after install I didn't have to touch it for a couple weeks running on a single battery. It supports two.) Checking the battery level is quick and easy (one tap from the viewing the image), and if you have a 3rd battery you can do a hot-swap with one if its dead.

Big minus though -- I'm hearing Ring has contracted with hundreds of government agencies, which means technically there are thousands of people who *could* watch your videos without your knowledge. You can decide if that's a problem for you, as there are other camera systems that don't do this.","Installation couldn't be easier, but..."

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Stefanie,"The video is amazing, very clear and I like the option of adjusting to the area I want to see.  The salesman was excellent and gave an in-depth description of the product. He did say the battery would last about 6 weeks. The battery actually only lasted about 2 weeks so I’m glad I purchased a 2nd one. It’s lasting about 2 weeks, too, even though I adjusted the settings when putting together to consume less battery life. Also putting the battery in was very difficult because you can’t put it in until the camera is installed. You have to really force it in until it pops in place and being on a 6’ latter you don’t have much leverage or capacity in strength when pushing it in.  Overall I like the product and I hope my review will be passed along to the Ring team so they can look at improving battery life. Thank you for the opportunity to give a review.

My suggestion to you would be to get the Ring Chime Pro with the Cams or Doorbell since it broadcasts a network specifically for your Ring devices so they would no longer have to fight over WiFi with other smart devices such as phones, tablets, computers or TVs.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,ChicaCT,"I've only installed this a couple of days ago fully but so far I am very very pleased. I've even had to narrow the search range because it is quite sensitive which of course is what I would prefer rather than not picking up enough motion! Please note my review under the hardwired doorbell because much of the same information applies to this camera. You're going to need about 3 full gigs of upload which has nothing to do with your download speed on your WiFi internet so be aware when you are making your choices. Again the same as on my review for the door bell, there are many upgrades & there a different models. I chose this one with a separate solar panel charger so I don't have to worry about the battery running down which takes 6 hours to charge. The camera comes with one (1) battery which is all that is necessary even though when you open it you will see that there is space for two (2) batteries - if you wanted to purchase another one for about $40 you can. But why bother?? I chose to purchase the solar panel charging device that is connected directly to the back of the camera and mounted nearby to use. You will not need the other battery and you should not have to worry about the battery running out and then having to dismantle the camera somewhat in order to take out the battery and not have coverage for 6 full hours while your battery is charging. Granted these extra devices are more money however just like with the hardwired doorbell I listened to an expert and I'm glad that I did because this will prevent me from having problems with acting secutity coverage especially when I am away!","Sensitive very good coverage, very pleased!"

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,10thLetter,"Shopping for a home security camera system was very overwhelming! Not only read the reviews on BB, but also looked at Amazon and online reviews, YouTube unboxing, contacted security companies to see what their packages included, etc, etc, etc.

Found an inexpensive camera with solar for under a $100 on Amazon. We needed two plus a micro SD card (128 gb for each). Camera came with an app and we were on our way. Only problem with the Amazon set, only one person can be logged into the account when an alert went off. Major issue with this since both my wife and I need to be able to access video footage on our phones when needed. Returned the Amazon cameras. 

Back online looking for a reliable security camera that had solar and can have multiple users at one time. Came across Ring camera info and was about to place a new Amazon order. Decided to visit our local BestBuy. 
Found the Ring Spotlight Cam on sale and it came with the Echo Show 5 for free with the 2 pack. Bought the matching Spotlight solar panels. 

Picture quality is great when connected to strong Wifi. One of the cameras had a lower picture quality when it was connected to the ChimePro after we installed it. After resetting the camera and connecting to our home WiFi, picture quality improved. 

So far very happy with the purchase and we are both able to check in on the property when motion is detected.",Non wired battery /solar operated security cameras

Video and audio quality were good and we really liked the infrared and spotlight features.

However, at the time, we did not realize that the maximum recording time was only 20 seconds.  Even with the retrigger time set to the lowest possible value, we were not able to get the full event recorded which could be crucial if something were to actually happen.

We also found battery life to be poor.  With the included single battery, fully charged before using, it was at 25% after one month.

The dealbreaker was the low recording time and the inability to customize that setting in the app.  We ended up returning this, unfortunately, as it did not meet our needs.",Ok outdoor camera - not exactly what we wanted

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Jan 2020,ScreenQueen,"The good thing about this camera is that it’s easy to install. Just charge the battery and mount it outside. The alarm is ok. Not that loud. But annoying enough to get people’s attention. The night time light is decent. Has two modes, turns off when motion detected or you can just keep it on through the ring app. But since it’s battery powered, I would suggest just motion detection. You have to get pretty close for it to detract you for the light to come on at night. We have it on the back porch and we tested it by walking on the back porch and the light didn’t come on until we were half way to the door of the back door. We were hoping it would start detecting us right when we are coming up the steps on the back porch. We changed the settings range but still no luck. Has decent video quality.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2019,draxxell86,"I had originally purchased an Arlo Pro 4 camera system. After about a year and a half usage one of the cameras failed. I then decided to try the ring cameras. I purchased (2) two camera kits 4 cameras total. It started off with a free 30-day Plus subscription trial, after that you can opt to pay per camera or pay for the Plus which was significantly cheaper for me with multiple cameras. This part I did not like as the Arlo had a free tier and the base station had USB ports for external storage. I had a 1TB drive hooked up. But one thing that really sold me was Ring offers replacement of any stolen device with the Plus subscription. Overall I spend an additional $180 over the cost host an Arlo Pro 4 camera system. The batteries last substantially longer than the are those systems batteries, and as a cherry on top you can put two batteries in the ring cameras.

Ordered an extra battery and the first time I replaced the battery I had to remove and resetup the devices. The battery compartment design is not the best.

Still have a problem with one camera when we try to go live. Will try to fix that this weekend.

I have walked in front of the Spotlight Cams multiple times only to get it to activate, record video and send alert maybe 5 times out of 20. Made no difference adjusting the Motion Zone or Distance. When it does record video, I've noticed the first 5 to 10 seconds are pixelated until it clears up to produce a very sharp image. The Spotlight Cams lose Wi-Fi connection randomly. The app, under Device Health always show my connection as Good or Excellent. The Live View feature fails most of the time leaving you with a black screen with a constant rolling icon or it tells you your phone can't connect to the Ring. The Andriod app is Horrible and full of bugs. I'm Using a new Samsung Note 8 and the app has crashed, froze becoming unresponsive, failed to save selected Motion Zones and Distance. Just read the recent bad reviews for yourself on the google play store. It says it all. The batteries also don't last 6 months. Mine went from 100% when installed to 23% in 5 days.

Pros
Easy to set up 
Spotlight is good for area's that do not have electrical hookup
Good video quality
Two way communication

Cons
No local storage option
Notification times are not quick enough. 
Takes a while for ring to process the video
Battery version and hardwire version are different when it comes to motion zone setup
Motion detection is not consistent

I think if your in a bind and need something such as a motion light and camera this will potentially due. I just don't like getting a notification then not being able to see quickly what set off the camera. Also having a slide bar for motion detection makes it difficult to figure out what area will set off the detection. Cameras are not consistent. Sometimes the camera will pick me up leaving the property, but when I return there is no detection. Also there is no local storage option, if your internet goes down, then you will have no recordings. So if a criminal cuts your cable line, there will be nothing recording.With these shortcomings , I would only recommend it if you are in a pinch and do not have electrical hookups.

One thing I have found with these cameras and other Ring WiFi devices is that they cannot connect to WiFi when the SSID or Password contains special characters with their out of the box firmware. You must connect them to a non-secure or basic password WiFi hotspot, or even use your phone's mobile hotspot.

Initially, I was having trouble with not having enough of a good WiFi connection even though I had one of my mesh network satellites pretty close by.  I moved it closer but it still didn’t improve.  Turns out I had to just reset the system like I sometimes have to do with my ring doorbell.  

After the fix, it works just how I like it.  I have it installed over my garage which is located in the alley.  It gives me a good piece of mind since we’ve had an arsonist in the neighborhood setting fires.  The battery life is great with about 70% still left after the few weeks I’ve had it.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Jul 2020,Yolornrnb3,Works well with all other Ring cameras. Does require 2 batteries that last for me about a week maybe a week and a half. The light is bright enough for my use.,Works well
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2018,Thewealthyman777,"Cameras are expensive by themselves but with the battery’s longevity its even more expensive and a headache because you are on the ladder every week replacing them, thus bring attention to their placement. I have four of these cameras and thats four extra batteries and i still feel that I should purchase the solar panels . Nevertheless, the extra batteries I feel will get me at least 2- 3 weeks of not climbing the ladder and waiting 12hrs/per battery to full charge ( th new batteries arent fully charged nor are they with the cameras when u purchase them so you shouldn’t use them until you fully charge them )
In conclusion, ring is a good choice outside of the pricing but they are a li slow and the motion isnt that accurately calibrational, rabbits, squirrels and birds to name the least will trigger a push notification ( annoying when u arent at home). There’s and $3.00/month /camera fee I still need three more sooo be aware ( price is still lower than other manufacturers on the market. Wireless feature helps a lot with discrete placement just get extra batteries and solar panels that will blend into the surroundings if you dont wanna draw attention",Better than not being home when u are away

One facet that could be improved slightly is the sound/speaker on the camera, as it’s sometimes hard for me to hear what’s happening or being said, and it’s hard for those who are standing underneath the camera to hear me.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Scott6271,"I bought the ring system because I wanted modern wireless security. PROs: incredibly easy to install and set up. Just download the app on your smartphone scan bar codes and place cameras, door bell, sensors, and key pads. Which are all user friendly. Get instant alerts on your phone when any sensor or the cameras are tripped and talk through your phone through the camera immediately which is another nice feature. CONS you will need solar panels and or get the optional second battery for the cameras. They loose charge quicker than expected. When setting the distance to trigger the cameras it is not an exact science and rain, and other unintended movements cause camera alerts. Should have a setting for only human size targets to set off alert and camera. The lenses also fog up and are subject to glare due to sunlight. Was also disappointed that even though I spent about $1400.00 and will have to spend about another $500 on another components, another wi fi extender, solar panels and the extra battery for cameras, carbon monoxide and smoke detector, that they don’t throw in a yard sign (it’s around $50) I also only received 4 window stickers (also sold separately) so ring is missing the free advertising opportunity by not giving these items for free because I will buy generic video surveillance yard signs on Amazon about $10 each since customer service won’t reply to my emails.",Pros and cons

It works fine with just one, but it requires charging much more frequently than with two. Also, Ring provides 30 day monitoring with the purchase, after that there is a fee of either $30 or $100 per year, depending on which plan you choose.

I like the light option for when I need to see the video feed more clearly at night, and the fact that the spotlight turns on automatically when it senses motion.
The only problem I have with the Ring system is the delay with the app. There will be motion detected by the camera, but many times by the time the app actually opens to the right screen, to view the motion in real time, it is irrelevant.",Great cameras
Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,4,23 Nov 2019,Hman,These ring cameras are great and we’re easy to setup.  I purchased three of them and got them mounted and configured in about an hour.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Go4themoon,"You have probably seen the advertisements for Ring.  They make the system look great and fit every need you may have.  That is not entirely accurate though.  The camera does a great job of activating while picking up movement.  The image is 1080p so it is good but not as good as some systems.  Generally a person or car needs to get closer to the camera for a good image.  However, I have found that the battery life on these is not as good as I want.  The system activates with trees blowing which drains battery life.  Also every single car that drives by sets off the system which drains the power more.  If I get one month on a full battery charge I am lucky.  Granted I only run with one battery in the system (it will hold 2 for convenience), but it is a major inconvenience to be charging these all the time.  With 4 of them, I spend about 4 days a month to do a recharge cycle.  This gets very annoying quickly.",Be Sure What You Need

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,2,23 Jul 2020,BDogg,"My problem with my 3 Spot Light Cams is their slow at initializing or “activating device” for live view. Slow to wont even activate. Also, the camera only catches about 50 percent of the motion. I’ve adjusted the camera from height to tilt position in ever direction. I also bought the best WiFi extenders with satellites so my RSSI is like -16 to -38. My internet speeds are untouchable. Changed settings. Been back and fourth with Ring and we keep doing the same steps.. unplug modem, wait 10 seconds, then plug back in and try again... for the price and then all the accessories you gotta buy to make it run with out errors and you still have errors, it’s not worth the price until the issues are solved. I don’t recommend this spot light camera. 

I hope there’s a software update that could possibly fix the issue but, still interacting with Ring to find a solution. I don’t feel like it’s going to get fixed though.

The cameras house 2 batteries each so I recommend forking the extra cost for 2 extra batteries per camera so 4 total per camera. That way when they die, you can easily replace them. It’s a lot more money but worth it in the long run. I don’t like getting up on ladders a lot throughout the year.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Feb 2020,Dabud,"The reason why I gave this a good rating is because it was problematic getting it to connect to our Wifi. I had the perfect spot, but it was slightly too far from the wifi spot. I moved it closer and it was ""better."" But it still has trouble being consistent when we want to check an alert. Moreover, there is a ton of false warnings. Even though I have set the parameters of the space it is ""seeing,"" it still will pick up things outside that area. However, I feel better knowing it is there. The good rating is more for the number of false positives and intermittent connections even though it is only about 20 feet from Wifi.",Good for the blind side of the house

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,Grammie,"Ring spotlight has good features such as the light which comes on when movement is detected.  This will thwart many trespassers to leave the area.

I find the response time too slow.   By the time Ring notifies us of movement, and by the time we turn on the app on our phone and connect with the internet, the person may have already left the area.  The camera seems to have a delay which may help if the intruder stays in the area, but more often the light comes on and the intruder leaves the area before the recording is transmitted to our app.

Ring is helpful when we are out of town since we can interact with people at our door and they have no idea that we are hundreds of miles away.

We are impressed with the technology and have often referred the Ring, but improvement in recording delays would be helpful.","Simple, but effective for most homes."

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,5,23 Nov 2017,Knuckles66,"We started with the stick-up cam and purchased these for our back yard. Love the Ring products and their customer service is great. These cameras work great, however, they say the battery will stay charged for 6 months to a year, and I find that to be a major stretch. Maybe if it only records once a day, but for any normal house usage, you can get a month maybe 2 out of a battery. I would still recommend these very highly, but I would recommend you purchase a second battery (only about $20) for each camera.",If you want wireless this is a great product.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,3,23 Nov 2019,FoothillWoman,"All in all these are pretty great little cameras. Whether daylight, dusk or night time, they truly capture a really clear picture. Our issue is that motion alerts and motion light responses  seem to trigger quicker when it’s a vehicle versus a person. I have heard that the equipment uses a heat or thermal tracking source, therefore it’s quick to be set off with a large heated vehicle but less so with a person. And in spite of all of our upgraded equipment, Netgear, extenders, we still can’t get the live feed to come up very quickly. After the fact, the video is easy to view, but sometimes I’d like to see what’s going on in the moment.",Good & bad

The recording time is limited to 30 second compared to 1 minute for the wired spotlight cam. It is difficult to catch anyone ""in the act"" within such a sort period of time or sufficient evidence. Arlo Pro camera provides up to 2 minutes of recording and you do NOT have to buy a subscription but lacking lights for now.

Ring - Spotlight Cam Wire-free - White,1,2,23 Nov 2018,IrishDoc,Pretty hyped to install these cameras only to find that the picture quality when zoomed in is poor to unusable at best. Could not get good signal strength until I purchased the chime booster. Now have minimal signal. Overall distances to router/chime boosters average less than 40ft. Buyer beware on these. I should have followed my gut and returned them once I saw the quality and signal problems. If using the spot lights you’ll need more batteries...many. In a matter of a minute or so they will drain a fully charged battery. Motion detection is set through he app and is ineffective at best in controlling the zones it is suppose to be denied from.
