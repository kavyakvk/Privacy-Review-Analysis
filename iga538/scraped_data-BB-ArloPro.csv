Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,4,23 Aug 2020,preshusmom83,Had to call Arlo support several times for different issues. Spent excessive amount of time on hold and also with support troubleshooting issues.,No directions in box
Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,4,23 May 2020,Plan9Shopper,"The primary reason I purchased a 2 camera Arlo Pro 3 system was its convenience in setup and use, plus the fact I got this on sale ($399+ tax.) Wireless camera connectivity is a definite plus and is a breeze, even if you're electrically challenged (like me.) Communication of alerts via cellphone notifications is extremely handy, especially if you're not home. They throw in 3 mo free phone alert service; after that, it runs around $10/mo. In addition, you get up to 2K color video feeds (even at night) due to a motion sensitive optional light which also acts as a deterrent for would-be criminals. Videos are downloadable via SmartHub to USB drive, or can be saved on your phone. Each saved video is available for 30 days, and you can mark favorites or delete feeds if you want.

My 2 camera package contained:
(2) Arlo Pro 3 cameras
(1) SmartHub 
(1) Magnetic charging cable (very short! - 3')
(2) Rechargeable batteries
(1) USB power adapter
(1) Ethernet cable (for SmartHub)
(1) Adjustable stationary camera mount
(1) Magnetic camera mount
(1) Quick start guide (far too brief!)
(1) Video monitoring guide (I don't remember the contents of this one, but it was much longer than the setup guide!)
They provide a link for Arlo Smart (the free monitoring software that runs on your phone) which you pick up from Google Play, etc.

Now for the cons. Idk if it's Arlo or my internet connection, but I'm not receiving audio with my text alerts every time. In fact, audio rarely accompanies my texts. Maybe it's due to people overtaxing broadband signals due to the current Covid-19 situation, but it's frustrating when lower priority videos come in with sound and more important ones don't. I must say that Arlo support has been trying to resolve this, and they've been very friendly and helpful with my issue (I've seen other reviews with people complaining about rude service.)
Something that irks me about Arlo is how stingy they are about including enough accessories in their already pricey systems. They provide only the bare minimum, then charge an arm and a leg for accessories you'll probably want. For example, the magnetic cable is puny (3'), so I bought solar panel chargers at $79 ea. The package also only contains one camera mount of each type. Additional mounts run around $40 for a pkg of 2 magnetic, and a lesser sum for standard mounts. Longer magnetic cable runs $50 for 25'. Anyway, you get the idea...
There are also 3 viewing modes, and if you want your camera(s) to zoom in on whatever triggered the event you'll have to downgrade your quality to 1080dpi, thereby losing 30% of your peripheral scope (from 160->120 degree radius.) Still, you'll be able to capture motion, depending on where you place your cameras, that is. These cameras are more accurate when motion happens from side to side, rather than when objects are coming towards or going away from them. There is a problem capturing all the action in some video feeds, however. This is more common with my camera with higher resolution than the other (2k vs. 1080dpi) and is probably more of a bandwidth issue.
You will need to hook up the SmartHub directly to your home router/modem with the supplied ethernet cable for optimum connection during setup. (I first tried connecting it to a switch in my home network, but it wasn't recognized.)
I've also read reviews saying that their cameras only need recharging every couple months or so. That's not the case here. I find myself recharging my cameras every 7-10 days, and I don't live on a busy street. I haven't installed my solar panels yet because we've had hail in our area recently, but I'm hoping they'll keep my cameras charged once I do set them up.

At any rate, I'm pleased with my purchase for the most part. I even bought a 3rd camera lately, so I'm committed to this system. (Maybe I should be committed for spending so much!)","Sleek, modern design for home security"

I had the gen one Arlo set-up but, needed four cameras to take care of the viewing areas. They were good but the constant need to buy expensive batteries out weighed their benefit.

They just keep getting better. Love the new pro 3. Quality is great, alerts with the smart subscription are great, and the night vision is great. Only negative is price.

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,3,23 Feb 2020,Raul69,"After my 3 month trial cameras are now only good to watch live video. If you get a notification you have to go live right away to see what's going because it doesn't record anything, not even a day or an hour. 
Which means you have to buy a plan. $3 per camera or $10 for up to 5 cameras per month.
Basically $120 a year.
That's one of the issues, second one is to get live feedback takes forever most of the times. There's been times I just close the app and forget about it because it's taking forever.

Quality is good but, if you can't watch live video quickly enough and on top of that pay a monthly fee to see history it's not worth it.
I'm stuck with them already but, for future buyers I don't recommend this unless you're ok with monthly fees and some lag on video feedback.",Useless without a paying plan

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,2,23 Jun 2020,Brian,"I have had these camera's running for almost 2 weeks now.  They are well constructed, easy to initially setup and mounting is fairly quick.  The app is pretty good too.   Daytime clarity of the cameras is awesome.  However, that's where the good points end.  There is a significant delay when trying to view the live feed from any camera.  Sometimes, 4-6 seconds, sometimes 20 seconds, and more frustrating, sometimes it never connects.  My cameras are all within 50 to 100 ft of the Base station.  The camera's do not use your wifi, so having a mesh system with multiple wifi points and awesome speed does the system no good.  They connect to the Base station via its own wifi, so it limits where the cameras can be placed.  Motion detection is hit or miss and you have to position the camera so that the bottom two thirds of the viewing frame contains the area to be monitored.  This forces you to set your cameras at a higher angle, missing activity areas below the camera.  Nighttime viewing is okay, even though the camera's have a 2K resolution.  I really wanted to like these cameras as I am not able to easily run power to the camera locations, however, the lag time to view live feeds, the lag time to trigger motion, and the lag time, sometimes over 5 minutes to get a video clip of the event is too much and forcing me to return these to BB.  In contrast, I have a Nest doorbell camera that instantly shows the live feed and instantly provides the video clip when motion detected.  If Google has figured it out, I don't see how Arlo cannot resolve the camera delays.  Once that gets fixed, these cameras would be a great system.  Until then, avoid it.",High Expectations...Low Results

Well that all changed when I got (6) Pro 3 cameras.  I can not trust them to record movement 100% of the time.  I’ve had several instances where they failed at distances of 10 to 20 feet.  It got so bad I had to walk past all my cameras to make sure they were working they even missed my jeep and truck coming up the driveway a couple of times. I think the Pro 3 has a weaker signal than the Pro 2 because I noticed it on the signal strength meter with both cameras at the same location.

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,4,23 Oct 2020,RyanC360,"Out of the box, the camera system was easy to install. However, there is a delay between the camera and the device you are viewing the footage on. It also depends on if you are connected to the same internet connection the cameras (Home Wifi) and if your viewing it via LTE or on a different connection than the cameras. The lag can sometimes be a difference of 10-30 seconds. Moreover, the audio communication between the camera and you the viewer is poor. Those listening from the camera can hear you just fine, but it is difficult for them to hear you. The picture quality is okay, but not what I had hoped 2k quality to be. The battery life has been good so far, but I have mine on a schedule so they only run when there is movement at night and throughout the day. Arlo tech support seemed to be helpful, but weren't able to resolve all my issues. One of them is that the USB I plugged into the base to record locally would not accept my external hard drive even though it was formatted correctly and was below the drive capacity threshold. So, I had to go with a simple 32GB stick for the meantime. I had researched this camera system for a years  and finally got to a point where I had to buy something. I thought the price was good for the Arlo Pro 3 since I got them on sale. The Ultra wasn't worth the extra and the Pro 2 didn't have all the features I wanted.

I have a fairly big house and have a great WiFi System that covers both up and downstairs of my home. The real problem about this product is the the Arlo router that is suppose to give broadband with to these cameras can’t cover big areas and can’t go through concrete and can cover only 300 feet. I have concrete walls downstairs and the cameras couldn’t give me a signage from corner to corner of my property. I really had high hopes for this product and repeatedly tried more than several rimes to get
all cameras to work but the only ones that work were in close proximity to the Arlo router. Also Arlo tech support was no help because all they wanted me to do is move their router in my house to accept access to all the cameras.

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,2,23 Jun 2020,Jake,"I'm writing this so others who are looking at the Arlo Pro 3 camera system as an option know this before purchasing. As there is no way to tell this security issue before actually setting up the product.

First off, having a security camera system is for exactly that purpose, security. I have tested several security camera systems. With Internet of Things devices (Smart TV, security cameras, Roku, etc.) I try to make sure these locked down so they are hard to hack. So when setting up the Arlo camera system I was shocked at what I found out.
  
Like most wireless security camera systems, the system creates its own WiFi network so the cameras can connect and ""talk back and forth"" to the homebase module which is connected to your home internet either wirelessly or through an ethernet cable.

The security problem I found is that the WiFi network (or SSID) that the Arlo system creates for itself is called ""ARLO VMI - ##########"" with a generic password provided. After the cameras are connected to this WiFi network, the network is still broadcasted 24/7 meaning it shows up on any device in the WiFi network list. Other security systems the network ""disappears"" as an available network and is no longer visible after setup. Since the Arlo SSID is broadcasted 24/7, there is also no option to hide the SSID (something that is standard protocol with routers). Even further there is no way to change the ""ARLO VMI - #########"" network name or the generic password. I talked with Arlo directly about this and they said that's how the camera system is designed and there's nothing you can do as a user unfortunately. Through some digging I found many forums on Arlo's website dedicated to this very topic and security complaint.

These are a major security problems, in my opinion. One, anyone near your home such as neighbors, passerby's, even someone who is trying to break in will know you have an Arlo security system. Since it is visible always in the WiFi network list on a device as ""ARLO VMI - #######"", Next, even if the system has to have the SSID broadcast visible, the network name should be able to be changed if the user would like.

As an end user of a product, the user should have the option to hide the SSID or change the name if they please. There is no reason it has to be a visible broadcast 24/7. Other security camera systems the network disappears after being set up, for example with the Blink XT-2's (another system I have tested).

So if you are someone who's wanting to hide your camera system and not have people know you have one, take this into consideration before purchasing. Also, if you have had your home WiFi compromised before, I may suggest you weigh this as well.

The hardware and camera's themselves are great build quality and seem very durable and come with some great features, so I was looking forward to getting to use these. Although, this issue highlighted here was enough for me to pass on the system for other's.",Nice cameras with MAJOR security caveat

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,5,23 Mar 2020,Themizz039,Switching over from my Nest Hello doorbell (which we loved) and also some other nest cameras. Made the switch because our new alarm wasn’t compatible with nest which is why we chose the Arlo cameras and video doorbell. Installation couldn’t have been easier and the battery levels have dropped maybe 5% over the 4 days they’ve been installed. Make sure you set up the activity zones properly otherwise you’ll be getting 500 notifications a day. Once they’re set up it only notifies you when something of importance happens. One of the things I love about the Pro 3 is the motion tracking. When it senses motion the camera actually zooms in and pans (digitally) to follow the motion. Over all we are extremely happy and will be adding more cameras as time goes. If you’re in the market do yourself a favor and make the purchase!,Great cameras with motion tracking

Even with the most energy efficient settings, never got more that a month of service from a full charge.

Customer Service did send me two new batteries but we had the same results with an average of 3 weeks of charge time.  (Sometimes it was less than a week.)  Door bell camera is hard wired and is clear as well but the lag time is 3 seconds or more and is not for easy communication with someone at your door.  Sorry I purchased this brand and have recommended against it to several friends that have asked.  Purchased at Christmas 2019 and it's too late to return it to BB.",Battery life and lag time stinks!

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,5,23 Aug 2020,SafariTraveler,"Bottom line: great video quality, great solid construction, and excellent cloud storage (you can download videos also) and application support.  But no embedded date and time on video, and continued cloud storage features requires monthly fee.

These camera are solidly built and work well.  The batteries last a fairly long time, but we have a lot of activity at our house so they don't last 3 months which is stated as the average.  I would recommend a high-speed internet connection since videos are uploaded to Arlo's cloud storage.  Phone app is very functional, and you can configure to receive alerts.  Cameras are motion activated.  One deficiency is that there is no option for putting date and time on the videos - some folks have had a problem using videos in court for that reason, and there is no consistent metadata in the file to help.  Only the filename contains time data, and that can be renamed, so courts don't like that (this is what I've heard - no first hand experience with this).  After a three month trial, continued cloud service requires a monthly fee, but being able to monitor cameras from anywhere on my smartphone is worth it to me.",Well Built and Works Great
Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,5,23 Jan 2020,RynoH,"Purchased as a gift for a family member, since her 1st Gen Arlo's were essentially bricked by their recent firmware update until they fix it.  She's enjoying the finer resolution and it was easy to setup.  What I like is the fact you have access to 7 day's of recording for free, unlike other wifi security camera systems that charge varying subscriptions.  Arlo does offer those as well, but it's nice to know free is an option too.  

Now we're just hoping Arlo will rectify the software update for 1st Gen, so we can integrate them back into this system.","Great system, better resolution with this model"

First it limits the size of hard drive you are allowed to use and any data saved to the hard drive is just crazy hard to view.  Not for the weak of heart.

All this changes if you use Arlo's monthly subscription service.  What you can do with the cameras is expanded and easier to use, and the cloud videos are easy to view and to find what you would like to look at.  But its a monthly charge.",This company wants your subscription service.

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,3,23 Jun 2020,surfahdude,"I went with the Arlo because my current alarm system had to be replaced.  The new alarm had a monthly monitoring fee of $65 which was pretty expensive.  Once nice feature is that the alarm system had window sensors, movements sensors as well as being able to work even when the AC power was down.

The Arlo is a decent surveillance system.  With a large property, it was cheaper for me to buy two complete systems as I needed eight cameras.  The cameras have a decent resolution (3K) but its range is pretty limited to about 20-30 feet as the sensor does not do so well after that, so i needed overlapping coverage.

I still have to fine-tune the sensitivity as it keeps giving false alerts.  When one camera is triggered, I can program to have adjacent cameras activate at the same time to observe the area. I can also have all the cameras turn on the sirens when one is triggered.  Still, with eight sirens sounding off,  the system is pretty soft.  Recharging the batteries requires you to remove the camera from the mount so you can remove the battery from the camera housing.  This means you have to realign the camera after recharging.  The package comes with two magnetic and two flimsy screw in mounts,  I ended up buying the optional Arlo mounts which are more substantial.

Pros:
* Compact, easy to install
* Decent camera
* Relatively cheap (bought eight camera system for $1100)

Cons:
* Each camera has its own siren which is pretty weak.  I had to synch all the cameras to sound the alarm at once to get decent sound
* Battery-based system which is supposed to good for 60-90 days between charges
* External mounts sold separately at $15 each
* Removing batteries to recharge requires you to readjust mounting of camera
* Hard to adjust sensitivity, too many false alarms
* Requires subscription to record videos online, $15/month
* App design could be better, only allows one admin to be logged in at any time
* While the cameras are battery powered, any power outage will take down the base unit which also requires internet access.",A pretty good home security system

Arlo - Pro 3 4-Camera Indoor/Outdoor Wire-Free 2K HDR Security Camera System - Black,1,1,23 Jan 2020,Vega,"Well I’ve had arlo products for a few years now. I started with arlo pro 2 and smart lights. I wanted to improve the resolution of my cameras but since my arlo pro 2 do a good job I could not justify to replace them with arlo ultras. Then the pro 3 were released and they had everything I was looking for to add to my existing arlo system. The spot light and the 2k resolution made it what I was looking for. I first purchased two add on pro 3 and added them to one of my vbm4000 base stations. After two months arlo admitted the arlo pro 3 were not compatible with the vbm4000 and vbm4500. Supposedly they said they were working on a firmware to fix the issues. January 2nd 2020 they released a new firmware that did not fixed all issues. So I returned the two add ons and purchased a set of arlo pro 3 with a  Vbm4540 base station. The reason I want it the vbm4540 is so I could connect a 2Tb external hard drive for local storage. The biggest issue with the two add ons was not detecting motion and not recording to the cloud. With the app and firmware update that was released January 2nd arlo supposedly provided in app access to local storage compatible with the vbm4540. They had promised to provide that access in 2019. The problem is you can only access the local storage in the app when you’re in the same network... they’ve provided other options like port forwarding totally insecure... also the cameras do not record all events to the cloud. When I compare how many events I have in the cloud against local storage. I always have more motion activated recordings in the local storage than in the cloud. Not to mention that the arlo pro 3 and ultras require a paid smart program to be able to record to the cloud. The arlo pro 2 have a free 7 day recording to the cloud. I could keep writing problems with this cameras, but you should do your own research. Arlo has a lot of work to do and fix the local storage issue and issues with the cameras firmware. I hope they do... because if not they lost a costumer.",Beta state product...
